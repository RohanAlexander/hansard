But that was not the take its first steps towards a clean energy government's position, and ultimately the future. As a result, there was a significant package gave what we consider to be quite amount of negotiation, which is not generous compensation, over and above surprising when you consider the disparate what we argued was necessary, to coal fired interests that were involved: Labor, the power stations. But we as the Greens agreed Greens and the rural Independents. to the compensation because, under the Ultimately there was agreement on the energy security heading, was a very price to be put on pollution, even though important part of the package: the agreement people might have started from different to pay for the closure of around 2,000 positions and preferred a different outcome. megawatts of the dirtiest coal fired power There was agreement on the architecture, stations in this country. even though some people might have I read from the clean energy documents, preferred that things had been a different where it is stated under the heading 'Energy way.

In That is right, and it was a key plank of the other words, if the package is passed, the package which was negotiated. The fact that cash that they have already received plus the this plank was included in the package compensation in the form of free permits that allowed us to sign off on what we felt was they are about to receive might make them overgenerous compensation to coal fired financially better off than if the package had power stations. We did so because, on the not been passed. one hand, they would be getting the money, Because the government changed the but, on the other hand, around 2,000 goalposts by taking out one key element of megawatts of their generating capacity the package, it is important to adjust it, would be closed. because the package was agreed on through The government has since decided not to compromise by all sides, and, if one part of it proceed with the closure of 2,000 megawatts is taken out, we should recalibrate it. One of of the dirtiest power production in this the best ways of doing so would be by taking country. Either the government did not this opportunity to say: 'Over the coming proceed because the minister who was years, if these coal fired power stations aren't responsible, but who is not the minister doing as poorly as might have been thought sitting at the table now, did not have his and if in fact they stand potentially to make a heart in it, or they did not proceed becausewindfall profit, then they have potentially and this is the public justification that is been overcompensated. Let's get the given-to do so would not have represented Productivity Commission in to give a good value for money. (Extension of time genuine review of the adequacy of their granted) One of the only reasons that the compensation.' We accept that the payments companies which own the coal fired power in cash have been made-that is done and stations could say there was no economic dusted-but there is no reason that the future incentive for them to close the stations is that $4.5 billion worth of compensation, in the they are being so generously compensated. A absence of evidence that is absolutely $5.5 billion compensation package is going necessary for energy security, needs to go to to these companies-$1 billion in cash and the companies. In fact, there is now a very $4½ billion in free permits to come-and strong case that the overcompensation of the that influenced the companies in their companies which own the dirty coal fired discussions with the government on the power stations is distorting the intention of package.

(Time expired) about or said that they would be voting for a Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (16:08): carbon tax, yet every single one of them did We need to think back to 2007 and so. We know from Australian political remember why Labor was elected then. They history that any party which goes to an were elected in part because they understood election promising one thing and then doing how important the issue of the cost of living another will pay a very high price when they was to families and to seniors. Everyone next have to face the Australian people. I would have seen on the TV news the photo think about 1993, when Paul Keating said opportunities of Kevin Rudd sitting around a that he was campaigning against a GST and table with families to discuss the household then, in his first budget after the election, he bills. There was lots of nodding and lots of dramatically increased the sales tax on a empathy. He did it in so many seats. Labor whole raft of goods. It was, in effect, a GST were going to do things: Fuelwatch, which by stealth. Following that, the Labor was a failure, and GroceryWatch, which was members who voted for the increase in sales a failure. Now we have come to a situation taxes in 1993 faced the black-and-red as on where the Labor Party are in complete denial TV about how they voted to increase the over one of the main concerns-that is, the sales tax on wine, on cars-on everything. cost of living-of families and people on The attitude of the Labor Party seems to fixed incomes, especially seniors. I am be denial: 'What are you complaining about? talking not just about electricity. We have It's working as we expected.' I think about seen dramatic rises in all utility rates-of 1993; I also think about how, in 2001, when water, of electricity and of gas. They keep on the Liberal party were in government, there going up. was a big campaign by the motoring A lot of the government's arguments say, organisations over concerns about the high 'It's not all due to the carbon tax,' but there is cost of petrol with the introduction of the no doubt that the carbon tax makes the GST. We listened to what the community pressure on the cost of living much, much was saying and made some changes because worse. The latest argument from the we recognised the pain in the community government is, 'The price rise for electricity about the high price of petrol. But we had is in the order of 10 per cent; the policy is not taken a policy of making such changesworking as planned.' But what that ignores is that is, removing excise and adding the the enormous pressure that Australian GST-to the electorate, so the situation then families and Australian seniors are feeling. was not equivalent to the situation we find now, where a government which was elected is the simple thing: the compensation is only promising to do something about the cost of necessary because of the carbon tax in the living for families and seniors has done the first place. very opposite.

165,Mr Mccormack To Move:,"Thursday, 11 October 2012 Bali Peace Park his elevation to Second Deputy Speaker. I will miss him as Chair of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, but I am sure he will be replaced by someone equally capable. TodayI rise to speak about the 10th anniversary of the tragic Bali bombings, which will be commemorated tomorrow. Both here in Australia and in Bali friends, families, survivors and supporters of those who suffered during this cowardly act of terrorism will stand side by side in memory of the tragic event. Two hundred and two people, including 88 Australians and 39 Indonesians, were killed at the Sari Club on the night of 12 October 2002. Even more were injured and airlifted to Australia for treatment. Our Defence Force were instrumental in treating victims on the ground and setting up makeshift hospitals to treat not just Australians but all those injured. Tomorrow we will be not only remembering the events of 12 October but also celebrating the ever-strengthening relationship between Indonesia and Australia. I have spoken before in this place about a wonderful bilateral organisation that was founded in Perth, Western Australia, in 2008 called the Bali Peace Park organisation. This not-for-profit organisation is supported by Australian federal and state governments to bring together survivors, families, friends and supporters of those affected by the Bali bombings, as well as Balinese and Indonesian government officials. The organisation has a mission statement of 'striving to help build a future without fear by promoting tolerance, understanding and freedom for generations to come'. The Bali Peace Park organisation has helped many Australians and Indonesians come to terms with the horrific terror attacks and move on in cooperation. Since the organisation's beginning in 2008, I have sought to keep the House up to date with the Bali Peace Park's goal to create a spiritual garden on the Sari Club site for persons to reflect upon and acknowledge the terrorist attack on 12 October 2002. At the moment the site is being used as a makeshift car park and the organisation is in ongoing negotiations with the owners of the land. I wish the organisation every success with these endeavours. I have also had the opportunity to meet with the Governor of Bali, Governor Pastika, and promote the ideals of the Bali Peace Park organisation to him and seek his assistance in reaching the goal of turning the Sari Club site into a memorial, a spiritual garden. Tomorrow morning I will be attending the peace park's annual dawn service at King's Park in Perth with WA Premier Colin Barnett and many members of the public. The support for this service continues to grow year after year and is a testament to the spirit of the survivors and the supporters. In closing I would like to acknowledge one of the patrons of the Bali Peace Park, Dr Fiona Wood. Dr Wood pioneered groundbreaking medical technology to treat the burns and save the lives of many injured in the blast. It is people like Dr Wood, our Defence Force and heroic survivors who have pioneered through heartbreak to create a strong and supportive network. They deserve to be celebrated on 12 October each year.",128,Notices A Government Member As Chair And

167,Mr Irons (Swan) (09:30,"I must officially congratulate the member for Hindmarsh onGorton Young Leaders Awards and Minister for Small Business) (09:33): Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, I congratulate you on your elevation to high office. I am extremely pleased to inform the House that the electorate of Gorton has produced another round of exceptional young leaders who have received recognition under the annual Gorton Young Leaders Awards initiative. I established the awards, now in their third year, to recognise young people who have shown exceptional commitment to public service in their final years of secondary college, specifically through involvement in voluntary work, student leadership or community. These young leaders follow in the traditions of previous recipients of Gorton Young Leaders Awards. Each individual was involved in a number of worthy endeavours during this challenging final year, demonstrating commendable levels of commitment to their communities and to greater public life. One prizewinner was involved in the Acts of Random Kindness group at her college, an outreach project that connects students with sick patients in partnership with Western Health. Another student spent a week sleeping on a tennis club floor so he could assist with the flood recovery efforts in Charlton. Other students excelled academically while juggling college leadership roles and student advocacy commitments. Twelve former year 12 students from across six schools were awarded the Gorton Young Leaders Award based on their achievements during 2011. The winners were: from Keilor Downs Secondary College, Natalie Jayne Little and Julian Amici; from Taylors Lakes Secondary College, Ryan Lim and Elizabeth Hope Kalas; from Copperfield College, Jan Tuilagi and Aoun Rizvi; from Overnewton Anglican College, Joseph Pensa and Sharlene Amisha Prasad; from Victoria University Secondary College Deer Park Campus, Alex Mendez and Krista Anne Multanen; and, from CRC Catholic Regional College, Luke Barallon and Bonnie Seymour. Earlier this year I also convened a morning tea in my electorate office in Keilor to formally recognise the achievements of the young leaders, who are now enrolled in courses at university, TAFE and other educational institutions. It was a great pleasure and privilege to meet and speak with the winners and indeed to speak to some of their parents and some of their teachers. The morning tea was a wonderful success and it also provided a great opportunity for the schools and indeed the families to witness them receive these prizes. I am sure the House will join me in congratulating these young leaders on their efforts and wishing them every success going into the future. No doubt these exceptional young leaders will continue to excel in numerous areas of endeavour and achievement as they pursue each of their respective pathways. Mitchell Electorate: Taekwondo World on your elevation to this grand high office. I believe you must be the first government Second Deputy Speaker. That is a big achievement in itself, so well done on that. In paying tribute to your great success story of a successful migrant family, I want to talk about another success story in my electorate in the great fabric of migration to Australia. Taekwondo World in my electorate celebrated its 25th anniversary on the weekend. Grandmaster In Cheol Yoo emigrated in 1987 from Korea and started Taekwondo World in my electorate.

169,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (09:36,"Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, I also congratulate youwhen you grow up in a community and are integrated in it you think you know everything about it, but when I turned up to Taekwondo World for the first time and saw about 1,000 people participating in taekwondo I learnt that my electorate is home to the biggest taekwondo club in Australia today. Grandmaster Yoo was responsible for the coordination of the taekwondo events at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. He serves as the Chairman of Sports Taekwondo Australia and as Vice-President of the Korea Taekwondo Association of Australia and is a member of Kukkiwon World Taekwondo Headquarter International Advisory Committee. This is a remarkable Australian success story too. Seeing all those families participatingthe young children with their parents learning self-discipline, concentration, a martial art and fitness on the weekend-was quite inspiring. Grandmaster Yoo is ably assisted by 18 highly skilled taekwondo masters. I congratulate him, his wife and his team for being a valued part of our Mitchell community. They often participate in displays at our annual Hills Orange Blossom Festival and in open air taekwondo lessons around our community. It is certainly a great business that trains and develops bonds between parents and children and develops great people in a martial art. I also did a martial art when I was a young person. It certainly benefited me. I can understand the benefit gained by many young people in their discipline, training and fitness. After 25 years of great success-this club has been awarded club of the year in Australia for around a decade in the 2000s; almost every year this club achieves that pinnacle within Australia-we recognise Grandmaster In Cheol Yoo, his masters and all the parents and families that participate in this great sport and also this great success story of yet another migrant adding to the great fabric of Australian success. They come from all over the world. There is a great relationship between Australia and Korea in terms of trade and diplomacy, but there are also many hidden success stories with individual migrants coming to this country, establishing a great life, building a great business and passing on a value-added cultural asset to our country. Corio Electorate: Flamefest 2012 Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs) (09:39): Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, I too add my congratulations on your elevation to high office. Later this month the proud community in Geelong will quite literally reclaim ownership of their neighbourhood. Flamefest 2012 will be held in a park, a common, called Whittington Link. Just in the last decade it has been a place of broken glass, illegal motorbikes, crime, drugs and violence, but today it is beautiful. It is a beautiful area with great public art and with increased usage. It will be celebrated through Flamefest. The emblem for Flamefest is a phoenix, and it is emblematic of what has happened with Whittington Link and also of what has happened with Whittington itself. Whittington is one of Geelong's most disadvantaged suburbs, but it is also a suburb which is setting a new standard in how residents and the agencies that serve those residents can work together to achieve real and sustainable results. The Community Renewal program was launched by the Victorian government in Whittington in 2007-the then Bracks government-and from that we have seen the creation of a community garden, a permanent home for the Men's Shed and the development of the community-planned Whittington Link which, I am proud to say, was",130,Constituency Statements
170,Mr Marles (Corio,"Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs andfederally funded by this Labor government. In addition, the Apollo Drive Kindergarten reopened and its enrolments are growing, as are student numbers of Whittington Primary School. A notable milestone was reached last year when, for the first time ever, every student at Whittington Primary School had been to kindergarten before starting school. Community Renewal as a formal program completed its work in September, but it is fantastic to see the programs that have sprung up to take its place. One of these is Whittington Works, which aims to get people back into the workforce and create a culture of lifelong learning within the community. Entrenched and generational unemployment is a very real issue in Whittington, but the work being done by community agencies, registered training organisations and Job Services Australia providers is yielding promising results. All up, 17 organisations are involved in Whittington Works. What sets this initiative apart is the extent to which these 17 organisations are working together. They may vie for business in the marketplace but in their work in Whittington they are collaborators first and competitors second. At the Whittington Flamefest later this month job service providers, training organisations and employers will gather collectively under the banner of Whittington Works at a special jobs expo being planned as a part of that day. I can think of no better way to celebrate a renewed sense of community. The people of Whittington have shown us all what can be achieved when we harness the strength within us and our hopes and dreams for a brighter future, and those hopes are certainly invested in the community of Whittington. Live Animal Exports you on your new position. I seek leave to table a letter I received from a Northern Territory constituent last night. Leave granted. Annaburroo station asking if I could read her letter in parliament. As we only have three minutes I will only read certain parts. She says: If you truly care about the welfare of animals destined for export than please, please read my message and then take the time to think long and hard about the bigger picture to this debate. If you think my words are a waste of breath, than think of this-I had coffee with a mustering pilot yesterday who said he has clients who are unable to pay their bills knowing that they have to continue with mustering for the welfare of their cows and calves, and that one gentleman feels that despondent that he has contemplated suicide. The Live Export Industry not only involves the welfare of animals but human life too-why are people not understanding the impact this is having on OUR livestock here in Australia, Australian Families, and the thousands and thousands of Indonesian Families already affected by a temporary ban in trade by a rash decision made by our current Government influenced by the Greens. Yes we, Australian Graziers, do care and are quite concerned about the welfare of animals that have been exported to other countries. But ask yourself this-if Australia turns their back on Live Export what other country will continue Australia's effort to ensure the welfare of animals exported from other countries? … … …",131,Constituency Statements

172,Mrs Griggs,"Thank you. The letter I received was from Mrs Vicki Mayne from theThe Greens are pushing ahead in Federal Parliament to ban live export. I ask this question, if the Government and people of Australia push forward with a Live Export ban what will happen to the welfare of over a millions cattle and sheep here in Australia and what will happen to families involved? Are Australians happy to watch cattle and sheep die of a slow painful death as they starve due to overstocking of their paddocks because the Government decides to close the door on Live Export? And are Australians happy to watch on as our Australian Graziers take their own life because they are so ashamed that they cannot provide fodder and water for their livestock or financial support for their families. Have people forgotten about the Beef Depression in the 1970s which affected 100s of grazing families and their communities in NT, Qld and NSW all because the cattle industry in Northern Australia collapsed because there was no market for Live Export? Cultured Animal Products elevation to high office. You will be a magnificent Second Deputy Speaker and I hope one day you are the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Recent developments in Europe and the United States could revolutionise the production of meat and animal products even as the Australian livestock industry struggles to contain public outrage at the cruelty of the live export trade. Scientists have made good progress in producing meat and leather by tissue culture, where sections of animal hide and muscles are grown in a nutrient solution and then processed to produce substances that are indistinguishable in appearance and other properties from meat and leather taken from slaughtered animals. Researchers at the universities of Oxford and Amsterdam found that, for the same weight of product, cultured product expends seven to 45 per cent less energy than conventional farming methods, produces 78 to 96 per cent fewer greenhouse gas emissions, uses 99 per cent less land and needs 82 to 96 per cent less water depending on the meat types they compared. In the United States the technology start-up company Modern Meadow announced in August that by 2017 they will start to produce leather by tissue culture while they continue to work on growing meat in the laboratory. The prospect that cultured animal products may displace a significant part of the produce of the meat and livestock industry is not just a dream but a real possibility given the obvious advantages in a world facing an ever-growing demand for animal products from an industry increasingly constrained by environmental limitations. According to the US Department of Agriculture in 2011, the world consumed 55 million tonnes of beef and veal and 100 million tonnes of pork and this will double by 2050. Supplying even a proportion of that demand will place a great burden on the environment and use vast amounts of energy and non-renewable resources while the slaughter of animals continues to raise very understandable concerns about animal welfare. According to the business information provider MarketLine, the international meat, fish and poultry market generated revenues of $527.6 billion in 2010 and had a compound annual growth rate of 3.8 per cent for 2006-10-good news in the short-term for the Australian livestock industry but even more encouraging for the producers of cultured animal products. These technological changes will have an adverse impact on people working in some rural industries yet the meat factories, if I may call them that, will still need agricultural products to feed the bio reactors, will still need workers and will, one hopes, provide well-paid jobs that do not entail the unpleasantness and frequent cruelty that goes with the slaughter of animals for food and hides.",132,Constituency Statements
173,Mr Murphy (Reid) (09:45,"I too take this opportunity to congratulate you on yourCowan Electorate: UN Pty Ltd managing director, Mark Keogh, and the whole team at UN, a company based in the electorate of Cowan for their 2012 win as the Telstra Western Australia BusinessA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesProceedings suspended from 09:48 to 10:06 director, Mark Keogh, and the whole team at UN, a company based in the electorate of Cowan, for their win of the 2012 Telstra Western Australian Business of the Year Award and the Commonwealth Bank National Medium Business Award at the Telstra Australian Business Awards. This is a huge achievement for Mark and the team. Since UN began operating in 1998, they have been providing power generation, air compressors and waterpumping solutions to industry. Particularly in the resources industry, Mark Keogh and his team are providing what the industry needs and have therefore been successful. They develop and integrate modular products using one simplified process, from conception to hire or purchase to ongoing support. As I have said before, there are many people in this country who think that to be in the resources sector is a simple pathway to high returns. These people do not see or recognise that success sometimes, but not always, comes after putting the family home up as security for a loan, very long hours of work, the worry about bills not being matched by the returns and knowing that one is stretched to the limits of one's finances and personal capacities over years. That is the UN story. In UN's application for this award, Mark stated: UN was established due to the market demand for a better product in a robust niche market within the mining industry. To me, this quote highlights Mark's vision of pursuing what he believed he could achieve and being brave enough to take a huge gamble and carry a lot of risk because he saw the impact his business could make in the power industry. Mark's knowledge, experience and dedication have seen UN establish itself as a professional, trusted and reliable company in its industry. The company has expanded from 10 staff and a small office to 148 staff, one office complex and numerous workshops, yards and other infrastructure. The company has also grown from the humble beginnings of 1998 to turn over $50 million in the last financial year, and is now looking forward to turning over in excess of $100 million within the next three years. Despite UN's great success, they, like all other companies, also face challenges and issues. During a recent visit to the business, Mark said that some of the biggest issues facing their business were competition with the mining industry for staff, and government burdens, in particular excessive red and green tape and visa related issues. At this visit, Mark informed me that UN employs two full-time employees purely to deal with government regulations. This demonstrates the need for governments to get out of the way and stop holding back businesses. In particular, what a future coalition government will do for businesses like UN is, firstly, to get rid of the world's biggest carbon tax and, secondly, to get rid of the mining tax. Beyond the clear positions that everyone knows the coalition stands for, a further initiative of the coalition in government will be to cut $1 billion worth of red tape.

(Time expired) Brand Electorate: Kwinana Integrity) (10:09): I rise today to speak about the locality of Kwinana and its recent qualification as a city in the 2011 census. Kwinana is a township in the northern part of my electorate, in the southern metropolitan area of Perth, a city now of 30,000 people. It is a city that for all of its life has been an integral part of the economic structure of Western Australia, from the days before European settlement, when it was part of an important trade and communication link pursued by local Noongar people from Perth through to what we now call Bunbury, up to now-the home town of the industrial hub of Western Australia. Western Australia has four great pillars of economic activity-the mining industry, of course; the agricultural sector; our massively efficient ports; and the Kwinana industrial area, which generates in the order of $20 billion worth of economic product to the benefit of Western Australians. The graduation of the town of Kwinana to city status is extremely important. It brings to fruition the vision of successive mayors of Kwinana, from Frank Konecny through to the current mayor, Carol Adams, to grow the town in a way that supports the local community and supports the aspirations of the people who live in that community. Kwinana industries provide energy; they provide agricultural products. The port at Kwinana is Australia's largest export agricultural port. The port at Kwinana provides the export capacity through the CBH hub, which is a massive investment in the future of Western Australians-made by our farmers, made by CBH and made over 40 years ago-to the benefit of all Western Australians. It is an icon of my part of the coastal fringe of the Perth metropolitan area. The Kwinana industries together-generating, as I said, $20 billion worth of productgrew from an insightful decision by a government almost 50 years ago to create the first registered state agreement on which the BP refinery is founded. That refinery then created the need for labour and built the housing stock that became the town of Kwinana, which has now graduated into city status, so that it stands equal to its neighbouring Coburn, Rockingham and Mandurah as a place of the future, a place of growth, a place of prosperity, a place of pride and a place that has built its future on a grumpy sense of self-reliance. It has had its own future taken in hand by great leaders of our town like Frank Konecny and successive mayors, building a town that will hold a place in the future as a city, and I congratulate Kwinana for it.

It shows that 17 of 18 key basin sites, including the Lower Lakes, Coorong and South Australian wetlands, many of which are man-made, would be protected if 3,200 billion litres were returned and capacity constraints removed. First of all, if the MDBA plans on actually listening to the science and looking at the science, that would be a first, let me tell you. I also mentioned the word 'obstacles'. What are obstacles? According to the MDBA, these are system constraints, which most of us know as roads, bridges, houses and towns-including Darlington Point in my electorate-which will all be flooded if the amount of water that the MDBA says is now needed actually flows down the system. The New South Wales Irrigators Council says the Basin Plan modelling released by the MDBA has placed the process 'entirely in the realm of absurd', and, of course, the chief executive of the Irrigators Council, Andrew Gregson, is correct. It is just absurd. It is totally out of the realm of reality to think that that amount of water would be put down the system. The irrigators in my electorate, who actually grow the food to feed this nation, are understandably outraged. Griffith farmer John Bonetti was one of many who said the community would continue to take action to protect its food production capabilities. Yesterday morning I was at a breakfast-of the Crawford Fund, 'For a food secure world'and there we heard that it is possible to feed the world and to feed the planet, which now has 7.2 billion people, as we heard at that breakfast, a billion of whom are already going to bed of a night hungry. How can we expect to feed those people if we are going to take productive water away from the farmers who grow the food to feed this nation and other nations as well? Murrumbidgee Food and Fibre Association President Debbie Buller said that it is not in farmers' natures to play dirty, but she is understandably upset. She said that even if it is a good plan, which looks unlikely at this point, we are still in massive trouble if it is poorly implemented. Of course she is correct. If that happens, we all need to fight back, stand up and speak up. And we will in the Riverina. We will not cop a bad water plan. We will not cop this amount of water being taken out of our system and put down the river for no environment gain. It is totally absurd. (Time expired) Fremantle Electorate: Clean Energy Future Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (10:15): I want to take this opportunity to highlight some of the innovation occurring in my electorate as a direct result of the government's Clean Energy Future policies. Through the support of these initiatives and programs, individuals and businesses across the Fremantle electorate have seized on the chance to explore and develop the kinds of technologies that will put Australia on the path towards a low-carbon energyefficient economy. In Jandakot, the family owned garden products company Richgro is investing in a $3 million anaerobic waste-to-energy plant that will provide 100 per cent of the site's electricity needs with the support of a $1 million grant through the Clean Technology Investment Program. Any surfeit electricity will be directed to the grid and the digestate from the anaerobic process will be incorporated in Richgro's garden products, making this a zero waste system. Meanwhile, in his backyard workshop, South Fremantle inventor Graeme Attey is turning his energy and water efficient HIVAP evaporative air conditioner from a prototype to a commercial reality with a grant of $138,000 from Commercialisation Australia. The HIVAP unit, which is small enough to fit in any standard loft space, will be the only system capable of operating using seawater or greywater, thereby potentially saving 30,000 litres of potable water per household per year. It is incredibly encouraging to think of all the savings, environmental and economic, that will be made when this supersedes the energy thirsty units that now burden the electricity grid and our household budgets. With more than $1.54 million through the National Solar Schools Program, there are 35 schools across my electorate that have reduced energy consumption and increased energy efficiency by installing PV solar systems, solar hot water units, rainwater tanks, other renewable energy systems and energy efficiency measures. Most recently, Southwell Primary School in Hamilton Hill received a $50,000 grant to install a 40-panel PV solar system atop its undercover area. At almost 10 kilowatts, this system is expected to supply more than half of the school's entire energy needs. A web based metering system will allow Southwell students to see the amount of renewable energy generated on their rooftop and to monitor energy consumption. Today's students' understanding of energy needs, use, efficiency and innovation will be the platform for tomorrow's innovations and improved systems of demand management. I have spoken before on a number of occasions about North Fremantle based Carnegie Wave Energy and their efforts to expand the application of their technology with the support of a $10 million grant through the Emerging Renewables Program. The Fremantle electorate has always been a place that seeks out, trials, refines and adopts innovation. It has an established reputation as a leader in urban sustainability. The examples that I have given today show that the Fremantle community is continuing to break new ground in pursuit of positive change and that the participants are as varied as a back-shed inventor, a new publicly listed company, a family owned business that has been run over three generations and dozens of local schools. Australia's clean energy future must belong to all of us and it will require contributions from right across our society. The good news is that these contributions are being made and are being supported by government policy. 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded.

There are a number of other non-budget changes as a result of this, including changes in relation to disclosure of information and privacy issues under the Social Security Appeals",135,Constituency Statements
178,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr S Georganas,Order! In accordance with standing order,137,Bills
179,Mr Neumann (Blair) (10:18,"I speak in support of the Social Security and OtherTribunal. There is a change in relation to child support that fixes up a problem caused by the decision of the Family Court in relation to the payment of child support particularly in circumstances where paternity is disputed and found to be otherwise than that which was expected by both the mother and the father. There are other minor amendments in relation to the schoolkids bonus and other changes as well in terms of the rounding of payment rates for family assistance and clean energy legislation. In relation to the other minor amendments, the amendments make sure that the schoolkids bonus is consistent with our intended policy. The schoolkids bonus, as you know, is the successor to the education tax refund which we brought in. The schoolkids bonus provides $410 for each child at primary school and $820 a year for each child in high school. It will benefit and has benefited about 11,000 families in the Blair electorate, which is based in Ipswich and the Somerset region. There are 19,400 children who have benefited from that particular piece of legislation. It is a great Labor initiative. It costs a lot of money to raise a child. The Institute of Family Studies indicates that it costs a parent about $1 million to raise a child to 18 years of age, so this will assist parents to meet the needs, to make sure school items are purchased. Not having to wait months to get something back is good policy. It is a good initiative of this federal Labor government. I was at one of the biggest primary schools-Raceview State Primary School, where both my daughters attended-in my electorate when we actually brought that in, and was talking to mums and dads as they dropped kids off in relation to changes we were making. There was not a person there I spoke to who was not happy with what we are doing. Sadly, of course, those opposite opposed the legislation when it came into the House. It is one of those things where the other side have the visceral commitment in their DNA to saying no, and sadly they did. The other aspects of this legislation deal with extending the Cape York Welfare Reform Trial. As chair of House of Representatives Standing Committee on ATSIA, the committee looked at and commented extensively on the work being done by that particular organisation in Queensland. It is a particularly successful organisation and we commented upon that in our recommendations in the Doing time-time for doing report. In fact we recommended to the Commonwealth government in recommendation 38: … that the Australian Government in partnership with the Queensland Government and the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership extend the funding of the Family Responsibility Commissionin relation to this particular reformuntil December 2013, pending further evaluation. I am pleased to say that the committee noted that in this budget and in the previous budget the Australian government provides $16.1 million to extend the FRC until 31 December 2012. We are of the opinion that it is critical to extend the funding until December 2013 in order to allow the operation to continue and an adequate evaluation in relation to that. I am pleased that this legislation will continue the income management element of the Cape York Welfare Trial for a further 12 months until 31 December 2013. The background to this reform is really important. It is important to note, and as a Queenslander I am pleased to speak on this bill. The Queensland Family Responsibilities Commission began operating in four communities-Aurukun, Coen, Hope Vale and Mossman Gorge-in July 2008. The purpose is to support the restoration of socially responsible standards of behaviour and to assist community members to assume and maintain primary responsibility for the well-being of their community, individuals and families. It is about strengthening communities and improving personal resilience. There are a number of objectives in relation to that: to restore social norms and to make sure that the well-being of children is promoted. The objectives are about making sure that children go to schooltruancy is a problem-and making sure that the norm is not to drink alcohol in the home or to have pornography in the home. There are a range of other things that Commissioner David Glasgow from the Family Responsibilities Commission explained to our inquiry. This has proved to be a successful operation and it has made an impact for good in Queensland in relation to all of those issues. We have seen improvements as a result with stronger communities in North Queensland. One of the things I was most struck by as we looked at that work done by the FRC was in notification. If a person's child is absent from school three times in a term without reasonable excuse or a person has a child of school age who is not enrolled in school without lawful excuse there are significant consequences that flow. Commissioners are involved, elders are involved and the whole community takes ownership of what is going on. This particular measure in this bill takes up the recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I am pleased to see that the budget measure correlates with the recommendation of the House of Representatives committee. We are seeking a commitment from the Queensland government to continue funding for the Family Responsibilities Commission including some amendment of Queensland legislation. The Queensland government has not always been generous with its funding of organisations, particularly Indigenous organisations, for those who are suffering homelessness or are at risk of homelessness, for front line services such as family planning, or for tenancy, family support, health and other services in Queensland. In Queensland the attitude is to purge and financially cut off funding. We are hopeful the government will put its money where its mouth is. It talks positively about what is happening and it is about time it put up or shut up. There will be an evaluation of the trial, which, I understand, is currently under way. It will assist us in our efforts in Cape York The other budget measure in this legislation is for Indigenous education payments. I am pleased to see there is about $16 million in funding for the combined 2012 and 2013 calendar years. A number of the programs relate to improving school attendance and to improving the quality of education and teacher training. They also improve nutrition and make sure that children are more likely to not absent themselves from school but are more likely to be focused on their school achievement and to be focused not just on education in the classroom but on high-quality development on the sporting field as well. Programs such as building a quality workforce talk about the need for teachers in remote Northern Territory schools, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander teachers, to have the skills they need for specialist teaching in intensive numeracy and literacy. The committee, for its inquiry into language learning in Indigenous communities, went across all of northern Australia and all around the place for 23 public hearings. We went to a place called Utopia Homelands in the Northern Territory. It is a very remote place and you get there by plane. One of the things that struck me as we travelled around Western Australia and the Northern Territory was the need for it to be compulsory for teachers to be trained in English-as-a-second-language education. There needs to be good accreditation and goodquality understanding of first language and the need for bilingual education. We must make sure that those teachers who come from Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane who go into these communities are trained well and understand the Indigenous languages. There are a plethora of recommendations in the report, Our Land Our Languages, to promote that. Building a quality workforce is one of the initiatives funded in this budget and I applaud the government for it. School nutrition continuation programs are also important. We can see that in the Northern Territory. I have seen that sort of program adopted by Indigenous elders in my community at my old high school, Bundamba State Secondary College, where the Davidson women, elders in the local Ipswich community, have taken the initiative with a number of other Indigenous elders. They call them uncles and aunties in the local community and they do great work making sure that Indigenous kids at Bundamba State Secondary College get to school. That is a program that has been picked up by places like Ipswich State High and other areas-so Indigenous and non-Indigenous kids are going to school with food in their bellies and are able to improve their educational output and their capacity to learn by the fact that Indigenous and non-Indigenous people are helping to make sure they have good nutrition. This particular program, School Nutrition, provides meals to about 5,000 students, and I am pleased it is being funded in this particular legislation. The Sporting Chance program is also particularly important. We are very happy to cheer on our Indigenous stars in the AFL and the NRL. We are very happy to cheer them on and assist them at the State of Origin and in other areas of sporting endeavour, whether it is Cathy Freeman, Jonathan Thurston or any other sporting hero, but we need our next champions to come through. I am pleased that the House of Representatives ATSIA committee, which I chair, is looking at the role of sport in Closing the Gap. The Sporting Chance program, under this particular legislation, is using sport and recreation to increase the engagement of Indigenous students in their schooling. Sport has a particular role to play. I can recall a boy of about 14 years of age in Utopia. He was an AFL champion of the future. He found himself in a position where he was struggling as school. But it was explained to him that his starring on the field was just as important as his starring in the classroom. So what the teacher did was, through this type of program, make sure that he had stars-stars that were listed beside his name when he achieved good things in the classroom. This boy, this great star of the future, was proud of the fact that he starred. His physique was incredible; he is going to be a champion in the AFL for sure, no doubt about it; he was one of the best players in the Northern Territory. He had a sporting chance. Sport was so important to his good education on the team. So that Sporting Chance program is the kind of thing that is important: sport-focused learning and development. There are a number of things like that program that teach initiative in remote areas as well. In conclusion, there are great improvements in the bill. It fixes a problem in terms of child support where the Family Court has made an order which confused the issue of paternity. I was involved, when I was a lawyer, in those types of cases in the past. They are very complex and very difficult, so we are effectively bringing back what we thought was the long standing policy that we have in terms of accrediting money in one way or the other, making sure that we do not go through the process of further litigation, which was the consequence of that decision. There is another amendment in relation to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, enabling SSAT members to release some protected information to relevant authorities where there is risk to life, health or welfare; and improving privacy protection. So this legislation has some really good things in it which will make a difference to people's lives, particularly our Indigenous brothers and sisters. It is not just fixing things up with some technical amendments, overcoming an adverse decision; it will make an appreciable difference to the lives of Indigenous people across the country. I support the bill. and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (10:33): In the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2012 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2012, several measures from the 2012 budget are introduced. There are also some non-budget amendments that clarify current policies and improve the operation of existing legislation. BeforeI speak to those measures, I thank the member for Blair for his excellent contribution to the debate. The Gillard government provided $11.8 million in the 1012 budget to extend the Cape York welfare reform trial for 12 months to 31 December 2013. Aiming to restore local Indigenous authority, encourage positive behaviours and improve economic and living conditions, the trial is a partnership between the communities of Aurukun, Coen, Hope Vale and Mossman Gorge; the Australian government; the Queensland government; and the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership. The trial began in July 2008 and has made some positive differences in the lives of Indigenous people in Cape York. The welfare reform communities in the Cape have seen improvements in school attendance, care and protection of children and community safety. A key plank of the Cape York welfare reform is the Family Responsibilities Commission, which is established under Queensland government legislation. Local family responsibility commissioners hold conferences with community members and refer people to support services. When necessary, they arrange income management. Under the current rules, a person can be subject to income management under the trial only after a decision by the Family Responsibilities Commission made before 1 January 2013. Under this bill, that date is extended to 1 January 2014. The extension provides an opportunity to build upon the success of the initiatives already underway. The Queensland government has also committed to continuing its support for the trial and to introducing legislation to extend the operation of the Family Responsibilities Commission. This bill provides a significant boost to Indigenous education by amending the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to increase the act's legislative appropriation. The increase will amount to around $16 million combined for the 2012 and 2013 calendar years. This change will allow the continuation of existing initiatives under the act and the commencement of new initiatives announced in the 2012-13 budget. Among the new initiatives that will be funded by the increased appropriations for 2012 and 2013 are the expansion of the Sporting Chance Program, Teach Remote stage 2, student education trusts delivered as part of the Cape York Welfare Reform Trial and initiatives that",137,Bills
180,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs,"Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Changesupport teachers, professional development and frontline services to improve Aboriginal children's access to quality education. Under the existing Sporting Chance Program, sport and recreation are used to increase the engagement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in their schooling. Participation in sporting teams or access to certain intensive highquality sports-focused learning and development are used to reward students for good school attendance or engagement. New school based sports academies will now be established and operated to deliver the program for secondary school boys. There will be additional programs for secondary school girls. Additional Commonwealth funded assistance under the Teach Remote stage 2 initiative will help with building a high-status, high-quality, committed and competent teacher workforce in remote Indigenous communities that are under the National Alliance of Remote Indigenous Schools. With additional funding, the student education trusts measure that forms part of the Cape York Welfare Reform Trial will also be extended for 12 months. These trusts are a financial management service that gives parents and caregivers from the remote Indigenous communities in the Cape York area support and encouragement to save for their children's education costs from their early years through to tertiary education. The bill also introduces some non-budget amendments to clarify current government policies and improve the operation of existing legislation. Some of these make up a package of minor amendments to improve the operation of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in the social security, child support, family assistance and paid parental leave jurisdictions. As an example, some amendments will enable Social Security Appeals Tribunal members to release protected information to relevant authorities in certain circumstances where there is a threat to the life, health or welfare of the person. Privacy protections for information and documents will also be improved, including allowing the principal member of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to issue a nondisclosure order that applies to any information or documents obtained by a person at any time during the review process. Amendments also extend confidentiality obligations to all people providing services at the hearing of the review. The objective of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal is to provide a mechanism of review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. Amendments clarify that this objective is to be pursued by the principal member in performing his or her functions and using his or her powers under the legislation. The bill amends the child support legislation to confirm the long standing policy and administration where the amount payable under a parent's child support assessment is reduced because the court decides that the payer is not a parent of one of the children in their assessment but the payer remains liable for another child in the assessment. Lastly, minor drafting clarifications are made to portfolio legislation, including the schoolkids bonus legislation and the family assistance clean energy legislation consistent with existing policy.

As a member of that committee I commend the process that this parliament established under the previous, conservative government-under great pressure from the then numbers in the Senate-for the evaluation of these organisations, one by one, by the parliament rather than under the direct auspices of the Attorney-General. I believe this gives the Australian public a feeling of transparency and ownership of this process, which it deserves, and it makes members of this House cognisant of the activities of these particular organisations-17 organisations in totalwhich are a threat to the Australian people, as has been shown and as we are about to remember, by the deaths of 88 of our countrymen in Bali as a result of the activities of Jemaah Islamiah. I will come to some of the other organisations in a minute. I note that the Director-General of Security, Mr Irvine, recently said that some 200 cases are being followed by the Australian security services of people who are coming backwards and forwards to Australia from places like Somalia, Yemen and the AfPak theatre, as they call it, who are a potential threat to Australia. With 200 people like that, the job of making sure nothing untoward happens must be extremely difficult, and I pay tribute to those people who were in the field defending Australian interests, making sure that we remain without attacks on mainland Australia. We have been very fortunateunlike France, Germany, Britain or the United States-to have avoided such attacks in our country. We have to work very hard to maintain it, including this parliament's supporting the practice of classifying these groups according to objective and rational analysis that we receive-in a bipartisan way and in a way that is transparent to the Australian people through its parliament. So we are particularly concerned about organisations like al-Shabaab in Somalia, where three Australian citizens affiliated with it have been charged and convicted of terrorist related activities. We have the Hamas Izz ad-Din Qassam brigades, who have killed more than 500 people in 350 attacks since 1993. The activities of Hamas are particularly relevant to",141,Bills

183,Mr Danby,"I am supporting the recommendation of the Joint Committee on IntelligenceAustralia, since an Australian citizen was arrested and convicted and is in jail for three years following his attempt to surveil establishments in Israel. I particularly want to draw the opposition's attention to the fact that the ABC, in what I can only describe as a gutless decision, in reporting this arrest and jailing after an open trial, said that this Australian citizen would be of concern only to Israelis because he was convicted of a terrorist surveillance effort there. Of course, as an Australian citizen, after the three years a person returning to Australia who has been involved in such a focused and important terrorist activity would be of great concern to Australians as well. The fact that the ABC completely refuses to acknowledge that this group is classified by the Australian parliament as a terrorist group is a decision that reflects very poorly on the Managing Director, Mr Scott, and the various program executives who have refused repeated requests from the elected representatives of Australia to include that reference in their news reports. There is also classification of Palestinian Islamic jihad. But what I want to focus on today is Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Sunni Islamic extremist organisation based in Pakistan that uses violence as its stated objective in uniting the Indian administered Kashmir with Pakistan under a radical interpretation of Islamic law, which would then become part of the wider Caliphate of the Salafist Islamists-that is, people who use the great religion of Islam as a political cause, who abuse that peaceful religion for a political cause. LET is an organisation that is most active in Kashmir. It is a terrorist group that is actively engaged there in preparing and planning attacks, including bombings, and kidnappings against people all over India. Lashkar-e-Tayyiba has played a role in terrorist attacks that have involved Australians. The murder of two of our countrymen in Mumbai in the attacks on that fine Indian city three years ago is something I particularly want to reflect on. I have been to Mumbai twice since then and stayed at the Taj Hotel, probably as an act of counter-suggestibility. PerhapsI am known for that trait! But I think the jihadist world view would regard India and its success, particularly a great commercial capital like Mumbai, as an affront to their world view. In fact, as we speak, in the streets of Pakistan, members of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba are openly parading themselves. The founder of the group, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, has held public functions addressing people, supporting the attack on Mumbai and threatening further attacks on India. It is intolerable that the government of Pakistan, which has pledged to crack down on Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, continues to allow this group to openly parade-this despite the fact that it was officially banned in Pakistan in 2002. The group's re-emergence suggests that powerbrokers within the Pakistani security forces are reactivating it so it can continue the turbulence it causes, which they think, in some crazed fashion, benefits Pakistan. Some in the military in Pakistan view the efforts of President Zardari to forge a rapprochement with India with suspicion. Ending the cold war with their neighbour is something that these people associated with the ISI, the infamous Pakistani intelligence service, would hope to make difficult, because it is not their view. A number of individuals who have been trained by Lashkar-e-Tayyiba have been arrested in Australia. People from this organisation who have been jailed in other countries have come to Australia, including Willie Brigitte. There are a number of other people who have subsequently been jailed who have been involved in training in Lashkar-e-Tayyiba camps. There was the case in 2006 in the New South Wales Supreme Court where Faheem Khalid Lodhi was convicted of plotting to attack the national electricity supply, trying to get into Holsworthy barracks and onto HMAS Penguin naval base. In 2009, the Indian newspaper the Calcutta Telegraph reported that the Pakistani American who mapped out the target sites in Mumbai, whose name was Daood Gilani, had gone to India to scope these sites-very much like the Hamas man, an Australian citizen, who was convicted in Israel. He was arrested on federal charges in the United States for committing terrorist acts on overseas targets, including facilities and employees of a Danish newspaper. So Lashkar-e-Tayyiba remains an active concern to this country. We have a number of people have been arrested who were charged with working with Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. In my view, this is nothing less than a terrorist group run by Pakistan, and I say that completely seriously. Pakistan is allegedly an ally of the United States and Australia, and it gets $2 billion of American taxpayers' money and $119 million of our foreign aid. The leaders of Lashkar-eTayyiba, as I said, live openly in Pakistan. It is outrageous that Pakistani explosives factories in Lahore are the major source of the improvised explosive devices that kill Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. Let me repeat that: Pakistan is a country that receives $119 million in foreign aid from Australia, but its factories, under the control of the Pakistani state, provide the explosives that are used to kill Australian and American soldiers in Afghanistan. We all have our views on Afghanistan. But we must not let the duplicity of the Pakistani state deter us from our duty. However, it is intolerable that, on top of that, we have this group, Lashkare-Tayyiba, which has repeatedly been involved in terrorist missions and training of people in Australia. I would suggest that, if you look at the five sets of people who have been arrested, charged and convicted in Australia of terrorist crimes, you will find that all of them have a Lashkar-e-Tayyiba training connection. Even worse than that, there were two Australians among the 200 people directly killed by that disgusting terrorist attack on the beautiful Indian city of Mumbai, the symbol of India's progress and commerce. This is a most important classification today. Following the death of Private Greg Sher at the hands of the Afghan Taliban it has been a part of my duties to work with his dear parents, Felix and Yvonne Sher. I feel this most personally. I know the Australian people do not want terrorism coming to our country. I praise the security services, the armed forces, who keep these people far from our door-and long may it continue. In all of this it is important that the Australian parliament brace up to its duty and see that these groups are classified in a proper, impartial, rational and transparent way so that all Australians can understand why these people are to be arrested and charged if they are involved in such deeds in Australia. I am particularly concerned about Pakistan's ongoing activities as a country that supports and allows attacks on Australian soldiers and, worse, allows this group to continually train individuals who not only harm Australians overseas in cities like Mumbai but actually try and penetrate Australia. We in the Australian parliament must continually address the Pakistani government and tell its ambassador here how gravely we hold these activities. The provision of aid to Pakistan will one day become an issue if Lashkar-e-Tayyiba is further involved in attacks on Australian citizens. I remember when, under Mr Howard's government, Pakistani President Musharraf came here and in the Great Hall made all his false promises to take all of these issues seriously. We are not fools. Australians may be pleasant people but we hold these issues very gravely and we will hold the Pakistani government and all its agencies to account. Debate adjourned.

A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11:22 to 12:14 Sunland Group that has been badly let down by the legal system in this country. The company acted within the law, honourably, and despite this is faced with trial by media over the illegal activities and likely corruption of two well-connected Australians, Angus Reed and Matthew Joyce, in Dubai in 2007. Sunland Group is headquartered on the Gold Coast, an ASX listed property company that has been in business for 29 years, 17 of those as a publicly listed company. Sunland's portfolio includes iconic buildings like the Q1 as well as housing, urban development and residential multistorey throughout Australia and overseas. In 2007, the Dubai waterfront was being developed. Sunland had already acquired property in the area and was seeking more. In what it believed to be a legitimate land deal, Sunland sought board approval for the purchase of the land and proceeded to transact through its lawyers here and overseas for the land purchase. It would be later revealed that, despite their representations otherwise, neither Matthew Joyce or Angus Reed had rights over the land which they sold and that the payments made to them by Sunland were never recorded or correctly reported. Despite recent media reports, it needs to be made clear that Sunland is not a party to the Dubai criminal proceedings and the Dubai criminal investigation was not commenced as a result of a complaint made by Sunland against Joyce, Lee, Reed or Brearley. The proceedings were initiated by the Dubai government after an inquiry by the Dubai audit department into an alleged bribe paid by Reed to Joyce. Sunland's only involvement is that the money from which the alleged bribe was paid came from money Sunland paid to Reed's company for development rights Reed said his company held. The Dubai government has said that no such development rights existed. Until Sunland was advised by the Dubai government of this, it had not known that it had been deceived. The Dubai authorities say that Joyce, who was a government official, received approximately $7 million from Reed in connection with a land transaction involving his employer, the Dubai government, where he failed to disclose the payment to his employer. Joyce has been charged with receiving a bribe and Reed is charged with paying it, and with disclosing government secrets and harming Dubai state interests. Sunland has taken civil action against Reed and Joyce in Australia to reclaim the moneys paid to Joyce for the land. The complaint is supported by documents prepared by Reed's lawyers which say that Prudentia, Reed's company, has reached agreement with the seller, Joyce's employer, to acquire and develop the property, which Sunland says is a representation that Reed already had an agreement with Nakeel to acquire the plot and upon which it based its reliance on the validity of its rights over the property. In Dubai, property is transacted differently than it is in other countries. That is, rather than the full amount, any premium or increased value is paid to the rights holder, who in this case was from all investigations deemed to be Angus Reed through his company Prudentia. It was",143,Committees

185,Mr Robert (Fadden) (12:14,"I rise today in support of a great Queensland companyunder this arrangement that Sunland paid nearly $14 million to Reed from which Joyce himself was paid nearly $7 million by Reed. The defendants in Dubai are also charged with defrauding Sunland, but even if the Croft judgment was correct in its finding that Sunland was not deceived, and even if the Dubai court accepted that Sunland was not deceived, the other charges would remain. In particular the charge of bribery would remain, which is a serious crime in Dubai, as it is in Australia. In Australia, Justice Croft recently dismissed Sunland's case. He contended that the Dubai proceedings were not considered because he considered the evidence of Reed bribing Joyce to be irrelevant. Sunland, however, maintains that the $7 million bribe is very relevant as it provided a strong motive for Joyce to make the representations alleged by Sunland. There is evidence before the Supreme Court of Victoria that documents relied upon by Joyce and Reed are likely to have been falsified, and also unchallenged expert evidence that one key document relied upon by Joyce and Reed was proven to be a forgery, with a faked signature of a Dubai Waterfront employee. Despite protesting their innocence, at the Victorian trial Joyce and Reed chose not to give any evidence, so their witness statements were never able to be tested in court, and they were never able to be cross-examined about documents relating to Reed paying the bribe to Joyce. In relation to certain documents put in evidence, Joyce and Reed also claimed privilege against self-incrimination. The Australian civil case is going to appeal. In Dubai, the judge recently requested that the prosecutor consider if the charges against Reed and Joyce are sufficient. Last week the charges were upgraded. Sunland considers that the reputation of the company and its executives has been attacked in the Australian courts with the ulterior motive of assisting Joyce and Reed in connection with the criminal proceedings in Dubai. I know the Sunland directors well and their integrity is beyond reproach. It then begs this question: why have Sunland and its directors been attacked so viciously through trial by media? It is a great question and is a question that deserves to be answered, because Sunland directors have in my experience been fine, upstanding men, pillars of the community, and deserve every support from the community. Diabetes Council seeking my support to stop the epidemic of diabetes that, according to the Diabetes Council, every year sees 3,000 young Australians develop type 1 diabetes, 19,000 women develop gestational diabetes and 80,000 people develop type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Council warns that 2.45 million Australians-more than 10 per cent of the population-are at immediate risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Australia is not alone in this growing catastrophe. Around the world, governments and scientists are alarmed by the number of people young and old who are being afflicted by this cruel malady, which brings with it an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, blindness, nerve damage, amputation and now dementia. Using a spread sheet and figures for the growing incidence of diabetes it is easy to show that, if the numbers continue to increase at the present rate, 100 per cent of the population will be diabetic by around 2040. This outcome is unlikely, yet such is the rate of increase that there is no doubt that many more Australians will succumb to this largely preventable disease in coming years. Although the effects of type 1 and type 2 diabetes on bodily health are well known, recent research has identified a third type which principally affects the brain. There is",146,Adjournment
186,Mr Murphy (Reid) (12:19,"I recently received a letter from the Australian Diabetesnow strong evidence that the effects of what is called type 3 diabetes should be identified by its better known name, Alzheimer's disease. Insulin was once thought to be a hormone that principally regulated carbohydrate and fat metabolism and controlled blood sugar levels. That is, when a person eats a meal and blood sugar levels rise, insulin is released by the pancreas and stimulates cells in the liver, muscles and fat tissue to take up sugar from the blood and store it as glycogen or convert it to fat. In a normal person, insulin keeps blood sugar levels between four and eight millimoles per litre, which is why a person with insulin dependent diabetes must measure their blood sugar level and then inject enough insulin to keep their blood sugar within that range. This much has been understood for years. However, recent research shows that insulin also has an important function in the brain and affects central processes such as the formation of memories. It is clear that normal levels of insulin are important for a healthy brain. A simple example will explain how insulin levels worked for our prehistoric ancestors. In the wild, so to speak, high energy foods rich in sugars are rare and valuable and the effects of a spike in blood sugar and resulting increased insulin levels arising from a sweet meal of fruit alerts the brain to reinforce a memory trace along the lines of 'remember this place: it is important'. These days, sellers of junk foods containing high levels of sugar exploit that biological mechanism and junk foods are cheap, widely available and heavily promoted through advertising that in many cases targets children and the less well-educated. The well-understood effects of the frequent ingestion of foods with high sugar levels is to cause insulin levels to rise to a high level, with the consequence that muscle, liver and fat cells stop responding to the hormone; blood sugar levels increase to toxic concentrations; and the pancreas, pumping out even higher quantities of insulin, eventually fails. This process, clearly reinforced by frequently eating junk food, is now well understood to be the cause of type 2 diabetes and increasing evidence shows that it is also driving the growing incidence of type 1 diabetes. There is also growing evidence that persistently high insulin levels driven by eating junk food are responsible for the changes that may lead to Alzheimer's disease. In a manner similar to the response of other tissues to persistently high levels of insulin, the brain may turn down its response to insulin, impairing the ability to think and form memories. The eventual result is permanent brain damage. In conclusion, the consumption of junk food, with its high levels of sugar, is the primary cause of the great increase in the incidence of types 1 and 2 diabetes and an increasing incidence of Alzheimer's disease in the view of many experts beyond any reasonable doubt. Yet the unethical promotion of these harmful products continues by individuals and corporations concerned only with profits as they knowingly condemn their unfortunate customers to ill health and dementia.

187,Mrs Griggs (Solomon) (12:24,I seek leave to table a story sent to me regarding,148,Adjournment
188,Mrs Griggs,"I would like to take the time. I have left to talk about some of the contentsseen for themselves what is happening to our live cattle. Luke Bowen from the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association said that this story is one real account, a human story, which instils confidence in our next generation of farmers who are making a go of producing food; managing vast tracts of our country; and forging cultural, social and economic relationships in our region. Donal Sullivan left Jakarta with a sense of confidence and hope. She says this hope was not only for her own future but that of her family and the northern Australian cattle industry, an industry still in crisis. Just 18 months ago Donal's world was about to be shattered. Donal was working with her sisters in the cattle yards at her family's cattle station 450 kilometres south of Darwin as the ABC's Four Corners program interviewed her dad, Rohan Sullivan, who was president of the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association. The girls were working cattle in the yards, joking and exchanging jibes. What was about to follow with the airing of the ABC Four Corners program was to change her life, that of her family and that of the northern cattle industry. She says her father, as head of an organisation whose members had the most invested and the most to lose, dropped everything at home to fight for the survival of an industry. From the night the program aired it seemed like the whole world stopped, paused and took a turn where all that had been normal no longer existed. In the months to follow, the family's operations struggled. Donal's mum, Sally, who has a long history in donating her time to the community including to the Isolated Children and Parents Association had to keep the business and family on track. Donal says, 'Dad was in Darwin, Canberra, Indonesia and when he was home he was working until all hours of the night and morning answering calls from concerned Australian cattle producers and animal activists who he thought needed to know the real facts of the real story.' Donal says she knows she and her siblings were shielded from much of what happened: the abusive threatening emails, letters, faxes and phone calls; and the excuse that it gave some Australians to be bigoted and racist, to vilify cattle families, Indonesians and Muslims. Deputy Speaker, you would know, as a member of parliament, that we were inundated with a lot of emails and some of them have not been nice. Some of these families have been receiving these as well. Donal says the ignorance yet almighty righteousness that pervaded animal activists groups, politicians, one minor political party and many others highlighted a number of geographical, cultural and information divides. Donal's family hosted two Indonesian students from eastern Java as part of an eight-week agricultural exchange program. The program was such a success and the relationships formed so strong that three weeks ago Donal set out from Darwin to go to Jakarta. Travelling with a small group of the industry's youngsters, Donal recounted the shock of being out of your depth and out of your comfort zone, the rigours of life and the resourcefulness of the Indonesians, the warmth and hospitality of her Indonesian hosts and the opportunity to experience a new culture. They visited farms and talked to farmers to understand how a country of 240 million people goes about feeding itself and the fact that many of the workers they met on the farms and feedlots earn about two dollars a day. Donal says that she was hesitant and anxious about what they would find when they visited an Australian accredited Bandung abattoir with the other Gen-Ys. The atmosphere was tense. By the time the first animal walked up into the restraining box some of the tension had dissipated. The facility was not of the industrial scale of the Australian equivalent but it was quiet, calm and efficient. She said the process was fast, humane and efficient. Flying back to Darwin after a week in Indonesia was the biggest thing for her. Now she knows that there is a future, and she wants to go back again and see for herself(Time expired) World Sight Day time when we seem to have a national or international day for every cause known to manand I do not want to be disparaging of those other causes-World Sight Day is a very important event. It is the main advocacy event to raise awareness in the global effort to prevent avoidable blindness. The campaign also encompasses the World Health Organization's VISION 2020: The Right to Sight initiative, which is a global effort to prevent avoidable blindness. The theme of World Sight Day this year is prevention. The House would be interested to learn that over half a million Australians aged over 40 are living with some form of vision loss. Of those, over 66,000 are blind. But it is estimated that in Australia 75 per cent of blindness and vision loss is preventable or treatable. A number of members and senators on both sides of the chamber and on the crossbenches have joined the campaign as World Sight Day Champions, including me. Many of us attended a breakfast here in the parliament this morning that actually doubled as the 80th birthday celebration of a former member for Lalor, Barry Jones. Barry is the Chair of Vision 2020 Australia and I do not think it would be stretching things too far to describe the former member as somewhat of a national treasure. As World Sight Day Champions, the members of parliament have been actively engaging with our local communities to raise awareness about preventable blindness and encourage local residents to have their eyesight tested on a regular basis. There are many causes of vision loss. The major eye diseases that can cause blindness and vision impairment in Australia are macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataract and diabetic retinopathy. Together with underor uncorrected refractive error, they account for more than 90 per cent of vision impairment among older Australians. It is also more common for people to develop a vision impairment as they age; however, some of these conditions, if caught early, can be treated. That is the key prevention message of World Sight Day that is being promoted here today in the parliament. There are a lot of things that Australians in particular can do to protect their eyes. In a hostile environment like many of us experience in our rural and regional communities, wearing sunglasses and sunhats wherever possible in the sun is a good preventative measure, not only for your eyes but also for protection against skin cancer. Also, wearing eye protection at home and at work and quitting smoking are valuable measures. It is a known fact that smoking is one of the major contributing factors to poor eye health outcomes. The prevention message of World Sight Day is emphasised in the need for people to have eye tests on a regular basis. On Monday, before I came to the parliament I met with an optometrist and good friend of mine in Lakes Entrance, Evan Bryant. Evan passed on the following recommendations to me. The average eyesight test only takes about 30 minutes and is painless for the majority of clients. People who have a family history of eye problems, are dealing with other medical conditions such as diabetes or are in the older generation should have annual check-ups. People over 40 should have their eyesight tested every two years,",148,Adjournment
189,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (12:29,"I rise to speak in relation to World Sight Day. At awhile younger people with good vision should have their eyes tested every five years. That is all good advice from Evan and I thank him. Evan and his wife, Elaine, are heavily involved in World Sight Day, as they donate all their fees on World Sight Day to Vision 2020: The Right to Sight. The impact of vision loss on an individual's contribution to our community is very significant and also affects a person's emotional well-being. People who are blind or vision impaired are much less likely to work and are less independent than those with normal vision. That is not to say that they cannot make a major contribution to our community in many ways, and the overwhelming majority do, but there is no question that our sight is important to us and there are poor health outcomes related to people who have a loss of vision or are vision impaired. Eyesight is something that we should never take for granted. I can only encourage the people of Gippsland to be proactive and to take a simple eye test that could save their sight. People with vision loss are twice as likely as others to use health services. They are twice as likely to have a fall. They have a rate of depression three times that of someone without vision impairment. The message again from World Sight Day 2012 is that the overwhelming majority of eye problems are preventable or treatable. I congratulate Vision 2020 Australia on its work in promoting good eye health and I encourage other members to support its work in the future. Hindmarsh it is my opportunity to congratulate him on his election as the Second Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives. Congratulations! South Australian National Football League like to congratulate you. Even though I did so the other day in the chamber, I congratulate you officially and formally in the Federation Chamber on your elevation to Deputy Speaker. Last weekend in South Australia was a very special weekend. That was because it was the played on Sunday at Westlakes AAMI Stadium in front of 30,000 people. It was a great event. There are not that many state leagues that can pull a crowd of 30,000 people to a grand final. For me it was even more special, and that is because my beloved West Adelaide Football Club-I am very proud and honoured to be their No. 1 joint ticket holder with former Premier of South Australia Rob Kerin-were in the grand final. Unfortunately they did not win, but it was a special occasion for me; we had been waiting for a number of years to see our team make the grand final, and when they did they made us proud. Just the fact that they got to the final was a great achievement. As I said, it was a very tough game. It started off fairly evenly in the first quarter, but by the second quarter the writing was on the wall and we could see that the other great South Australian football club, Norwood Football Club, was pulling away. Norwood ended up being the champions of football in South Australia, taking out the premiership and celebrating, as they should have. I am very honoured to have the West Adelaide Football Club in my electorate, in the western suburbs. They represent the western Adelaide area. The club's formation is shrouded",150,Adjournment

191,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (12:34,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I, too, wouldin a little bit of mystery because there are no documents, so stories of its formation vary according to whom you are listening to. The club's website says that it was established in 1887, but then a historian's paper on the club's site suggestions that it was between 1891 and 1892. I am sure there will be many debates over the years about which one is correct and which one is not. West Adelaide club won the 1895 premiership in the City and Suburban Football Association, and in the following year, on the introduction of the electoral system, joined the senior association in South Australia. In 1897 West Adelaide formally joined SAFA-the South Australia Football Association league-and they developed their uniform. The original uniform was a red and white strip, but so as not to be confused with some other SANFL teams in South Australia-such as Port Adelaide and North Adelaide-West Adelaide adopted its colours of red and black. They played in the early years in the West Park Lands and in 1952 the club decided to work towards moving to Richmond, which is just west of the city in my electorate. They developed a council site into an oval and still play there as their home ground. With the assistance of the council and many, many hours of volunteer labour contributed by players, supporters, club officials and a lot of local businesses, the West Adelaide Football Club commenced playing at Richmond oval within the SANFL, or South Australian National Football League, in 1958. Some of their achievements have been premierships, and they were champions of Australia in 1908 and 1909. They were premiers and champions of Australia in 1911 and premiers in 1912, 1927, 1947, 1961 and 1983. In 1983 I was very privileged to have been at the game and I recall that joyous moment. We have been waiting since 1983 to see us win another premiership, even though we have played in a couple of premiership games since then. West Adelaide have been runners-up many times: in 1922, 1954, 1956, 1958, 1959, 1962, 1991, 2003 and, of course, 2012-this year. It is a great club with great history. As I said, I am very proud to be their No. 1 ticket holder. I have supported West Adelaide ever since I was knee-high, and I remember going to my first games at around the age of six or seven. It is only a stone's throw away from my house and I still enjoy going to all the games. I would like to congratulate the club president, Paul Sperling; the vice president, Wayne Henson; the CEO, Kym Russell; the marketing manager, Angela Jacka; and, of course, our wonderful coach, Andrew Collins, who did so well to get them to the final this year. I congratulate them on making the final and, on behalf of all the West Adelaide supporters, I hope that next year we will actually take out the flag. Parramatta Electorate: Historical Precinct Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (12:39): Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and can I also take this opportunity to congratulate you. I know you will do a great job. Congratulations. I rise today to alert the House to some rather alarming news for the residents of Parramatta, which is that the O'Farrell state government has plans to sell the old Parramatta Gaol. In Parramatta we have the most remarkable heritage precinct, largely in a state of neglect, partially inhabited by sections of the health and education departments-mainly Health. But it is an incredible precinct that includes the current World Heritage listed old Government House, where most of the things you studied in primary school about Governor Macquarie took place. We have the site of the first farm. We have the confluence of the Darling Mills and Toongabbie Creek, where Governor Phillip landed and walked up the banks and made the decision about where to locate our first Government House. We have the meeting place of the Darug Nation on the banks of the river in that precinct and the site of the first reconciliation attempts. We also have a Greenway-designed female convict factory, one of the earliest and certainly the most intact in the country-which was built, by the way, on the sacred women's site of the Burramattagal. Adjacent to that is the Parramatta Girls Home, which was established and once occupied by the Girls Industrial School in 1887 and before that the Roman Catholic Orphan School, which was established in 1844. There is also the old Kings School. It was the second school in Australia, but it is certainly the oldest-it is the only one that has survivedand it was established in 1844. The original school building and the headmaster's residence, both dating from 1836, are reminders of the status of that school for the male children of convicts during the 19th century. It is an extraordinary precinct, and when you walk through it you get a sense of the history of modern Australia from the first arrival of white settlers to now. In fact, part of it has been a prison for women for over 200 years, so the entire history of the incarceration of women and girls is on that site. It is a remarkable place. A couple of months ago there were a couple of things that spurred local heritage groups into seeking to identify the precinct as a whole and preserve its heritage. There was the decision of the state government not to proceed with the funding of the arts precinct in the old Kings School, which was a commitment of the previous state government which the new Liberal state government withdrew from; and the permanent closing of the Parramatta Gaol, which completes the precinct-it sits on the north end of the precinct, and it is a phenomenal collection of buildings. There has been a jail in the precinct since 1798, but the Parramatta Gaol was built between 1837 and 1843, which makes it the oldest jail in Australia; and it is very much intact and still has some of the cells from those earliest days. In 1929 it was the state's principal manufacturing jail, and at one point it was the second-largest jail in the country-so, again, it adds to that collection of buildings that tell the tale of incarceration in modern Australia. These are incredibly important sites. But on FridayI came upon something that was extremely worrying. It was the September 2012 edition of Tenant Talk, which is put out by the State Property Authority. It goes out to all of its tenants-I understand there are about 500 of them. It is up on their website and you can push 'forward' and send it to anyone you want to send it to. It advises that the old Parramatta Gaol is now being managed by the State Property Authority. It says: 'SPA has taken on the management of the property, while preparing it for sale'-a very clear statement, made publicly, sent to 500 tenants and forwarded further than that. In spite of commitments from the local member that the jail will not be sold, this is a very clear statement that 'SPA has taken on the management of the property, while preparing it for sale.' The state government have announced that they will be developing a master plan for the precinct. But it is hard to believe that any master plan for the precinct could proceed in any real way, particularly with the level of engagement that the community expects on this incredibly important precinct, without including in it the plans for the Parramatta Gaol. I would say to the state government and to the community that whatever plans they might have for the future, the planning process and community consultation requires that that jail remains in public hands while that planning process takes place. This is one of the most important heritage precincts in the country and it should be treated as such. Education National Life Sciences Hub on 21 September at the Charles Sturt University Wagga Wagga campus. On that particular occasion I was joined by the member for Cunningham, the Hon. Sharon Bird, Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills. I welcomed her to that very important event. There were some fine people present: Chancellor of CSU, Lawrie Willett AO; Vice Chancellor Professor Andrew Vann; Associate Professor Heather Cavanagh, who is the acting Executive Dean of the Faculty of Science; Deputy Vice Chancellor Administration Professor Ken Dillon; President of the Eastern Riverina Science Teachers Association Anthony Hogan; CSU PhD student Dr Ray Cowley; and the former member for Riverina Mrs Kay Hull. We were there to officially open the National Life Sciences Hub, which is an amazing facility. NaLSH is undoubtedly an extremely important project for CSU. It is dedicated to research which serves our communities, and clearly agriculture, animal science and the environment are critical areas for our communities. I have here Professor Vann's speech notes in which he indicates that: Some of the challenges facing us are global: meeting the demands of a growing world population whilst protecting the ecosystems which support us. In turn, this creates national priorities in agriculture and animal research and I think it's worth remembering that agriculture is one of the industries along with resources which means that 2/3 of Australia's exports are derived from rural and regional areas. To meet these global challenges we need a new generation of highly qualified fundamental and applied scientists. CSU is meeting that challenge. It has particular strengths in life sciences: plant and animal sciences, food production and security, animal health, and water and environmental sciences. As a National Party member I am pleased to say that our shadow agriculture minister, John Cobb, the member for Calare, has food security in his portfolio title. Professor Vann continues: Over the last two years we have been making a very significant investment in research capability with $10 million per year off the top investment. NaLSH will go with this investment in human capital to provide a completely new level of capability and grow national educational and research excellence in these critical areas. We need to integrate fundamental research with existing applied research and teaching. We need to build linkages between researchers, students, industry and producersand this building will do it. It is half a hectare of the most magnificent research laboratories. It gives students the very best environment in which to learn: NaLSH will strengthen those linkages, building the critical mass to extend undergraduate and graduate training and improve interactions across our partners in Australia and overseas. That is according to Professor Vann and he is correct. He continues: Importantly, integration of plant and animal science facilities will promote increased collaboration across disciplines leading, we hope, to novel research and innovative solutionsthe answers for the future. As he points out: Research is a social and community activity. Excellence and innovation in learning and research, and 'out of the box' ideas happen where both spontaneous and structured interactions between researchers can occur.",151,Sanfl Or South Australian National Football League Grand Final The Grand Final Was

Professor Vann noted-and the member for Canberra should listen to this: … this project would not have been possible without the support of the Federal Government through the Education Investment Fund. I know that quite often on this side of the House we are critical of the lack of investment in key portfolio areas but I have to say, and I am sure the member for Fraser would agree with me, that higher education is very important. I am pleased to say that the government has come on board with this particular project to help CSU make it a very important reality. As Professor Vann noted: Technology is critical. NaLSH has integrated collaborative ICT, such as microscopes that can be shared over the networks. This will further expand CSU's distance and digital learning technologies to agricultural disciplines, broadening engagement with students, and between students and researchers. It reinforces and advances CSU's strategic commitment to technology that enables learning and collaborative research over distances. This is very important to CSU, which has campuses and sites right around the globe. I acknowledge and praise the government for coming on board with CSU and I praise the member for Cunningham, who was very good on the day. She pointed out that this is an important regional facility and it will do great things in the future. Bell, Dr Coral, AO Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (12:50): I rise to speak about a great constituent of mine, Coral Bell, AO, who passed away on 26 September 2012. Coral Bell was a former academic at the Australian National University and one of the great international relations scholars in Australia. Her former ANU colleague Andrew Carr said, 'She was a landmark figure in Australia's international relations who was often the only woman in the room yet was always well heard and respected for her intelligence and character'. My friend Michael Fullilove, who has recently taken over as executive director of the Lowy Institute-and I congratulate him on that-called Dr Bell 'a giant of the Australian foreign policy scene'. Dr Bell came to adulthood during the Second World War and, as Robert O'Neill noted in his obituary for her, knew from her own experience just how much was at stake when great powers went to war with each other with modern weapons. She understood the challenge of nuclear war and was part of a key group of Australian scholars working on key issues around understanding the Cold War. Her doctoral thesis, which formed the basis of her first book, was based on understanding how the United States was managing the Cold War. She returned to teach at the University of Sydney from 1961 to 1965, then to a readership at the London School of Economics and was a professor at the University of Sussex until 1972. Dr Bell returned to work at the Australian National University from 1977 until 1988 and then continued to contribute to the field. She characterised the NATO alliance as 'always in disarray', an observation which I think contains more than a kernel of truth. Her paper The End of the Vasco da Gama Era, one of the Lowy Institute's first, is considered one of its best. Dr Bell was regarded as a conservative realist-not an international relations tradition with which a small 'l' liberal like me would associate-but she was nonetheless very much a conservative and not a neocon. In that capacity she was a strong critic of GeorgeW Bush's foreign and military policies and held the view that the United States had lost its sole superpower status and we were moving towards a world order where power would be shared among several major states. Lowy Institute board director Robert O'Neill noted in his obituary: Her analytical legacy is this view of a world where US power and influence have slipped, and those of China, Europe, Russia, and India are rising to form a condominium. Dr Bell's recent publication A World Out of Balance: American Ascendancy and International Politics in the 21st Century highlighted the unique economic and security challenge this context presents for international affairs. Our understanding of international affairs has been enriched by this giant, Coral Bell, and those of us who seek to contribute to the ideas and policy debate in international relations stand on her shoulders. Fowler Electorate: Multicultural Events country, so I have the privilege of attending many vibrant cultural and religious events and celebrations. I find that these events not only showcase and preserve the traditions of people's original homelands but demonstrate their commitment and gratitude to their new home, Australia. RecentlyI again had the honour to speak at the opening of the annual Moon Festival event in Cabramatta. This is one of the biggest events in my local area, with more than 90,000 people from all around Sydney attending for the main celebrations on the Sunday. The food, music and many entertainment activities of various cultures of the Asian community truly showcased the diverse and multicultural nature of my electorate. In fact, I have one of the largest Asian communities outside Asia itself. I would like to praise the efforts of the Fairfield City Council; its mayor, Frank Carbone; and, in particular, the event coordinator, Cheryl Bosler, and her team for organising such a wonderful event. Cabramatta police, the State Emergency Service and the fire brigade were all on hand to ensure the safety of all those who turned out to celebrate this important community event. A couple of weeks ago, together with my wife, Bernadette, I also had the pleasure of attending the annual Friends of India Ganeshotsava celebrations at Liverpool's Whitlam Leisure Centre. We enjoyed a traditional south Indian dinner, maha prasadam, as well as a program rich in culture and tradition with classical singing and colourful dances by the children. I would like to thank my good friend Charishma Kaliyanda, who keeps me informed and updated and involved with the local Indian community. I would also like to thank all those who are involved with the Friends of India group for their wonderful contribution to our community. Most recently I attended the Cabramatta Lions Club's Cambodian singing competition to raise funds for the Sovanapoom Care Orphanages in Cambodia. These orphanages provide boarding and day school, vocational training, a refugee centre and emergency food relief and medical care to close to 3,000 people a week. I thank my very good friend Jenny Tew and Sotha Bourn from the Cabramatta Lions Club as well as Virak Um from the Khmer Community Radio. I also recognise the work of the dedicated students from Canley Vale High School Leo Club, particularly their President, Harry Wong, who deserves to be praised.",154,Sanfl Or South Australian National Football League Grand Final The Grand Final Was

This organisation plays a key role in facilitating a strong cultural exchange between Australia and Africa and assisting migrants from various African countries to settle successfully here in Australia. I acknowledge the good work of Theophile Elongo, director-general of GLAPD and president of the Congolese Council of Australia, as well as Nadine Shema, director of public relations, for fostering a greater involvement of migrants from African countries in Australian society. Last weekend I had the honour of representing the Prime Minister at the official opening of the 24th Philippine Australian sports and culture festival, Fiesta Culture, at the Fairfield showground. I would like to thank Manny Castillo, president of Philippine Australian Sports and Culture Incorporated, for his commitment to a strong presence and involvement by the Philippine community in Australian society. I also thank my good friend Francesco Marchesano, better known to many of us locally as Paul; Father Anthony; and also the president of Our Lady of Mt Carmel Association, Tony Romano, for inviting me to the annual Our Lady of Mt Carmel Festival last weekend. Following mass I took part in the procession to the Mounties sports club complex. We enjoyed traditional foods, drinks and entertainment, all associated with the festivities of the parish community and paying a tribute to the nature and contribution of the Italian community in south-west Sydney. It certainly was a traditional Italian celebration. These are just some of the events that truly showcase Australia's rich cultural diversity while celebrating and keeping alive the traditions and customs brought from people's homelands. I take pride and feel most privileged to attend these functions and see first hand the full benefits of living in a diverse, vibrant, multicultural society. Question agreed to.
