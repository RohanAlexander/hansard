We consider the construction of this transcontinental line to be a matter of national and Federal importance, because of its commercial usefulness and servioeableness for Defence purposes. The railway would also open up a large' area in the interior, which, according to recent reports, offers much more opportunity for profitable development than has hitherto been supposed. Questions 2 and 3 may foe answered together. been suggested that the dividing line between the Northern Territory and South Australia proper might be altered with advantage, and I understand that the extension of the South Australian railway from Oodnadatta 1o the McDonnell Ranges is in contemplation. This line would reach -to a point beyond the present boundary, but not beyond the proposed boundary; and, although of interest to -the whole Commonwealth, the extension would be of particular interest only to 'South Australia. But the further extension -through the Northern Territory to Port ""Darwin would be of national importance, -seeing that it would provide an outlet to TorAustralia that there should be railway con-res Straits and the northern seas, and give -an advantageous connection with the whole «of the northern coast and countries most easily reached from there. I should, therefore, be inclined to favour any reasonable -proposal for assisting the survey of that railneed not necessarily go through South Aus-way through the Northern Territory with a -view to the determination by this Parliament on full information of the wisdom of constructing such a line. At present the Northern Territory is under the control of South Australia. At the very commencement of Federation an offer was made from South Australia to transfer the Northern Territory to the Commonimportance? wealth, but after the negotiations had proceeded some few steps that offer was suspended, and has not since been revived. If in connection with a new proposal for the acquisition of the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth a project for the construction of a railway were submitted by the South Australian Government, it would have the most careful, attention of the Government and Parliament of the Commonwealth. boundary as suggested? That was one of the points which stopped negotiations. stopped negotiations on our side, because to move the border between South Australia and the Northern Territory north to the McDonnell Ranges is in our view a proper alteration. just given by the Prime Minister, do the Government propose to consider the proposal to construct a transcontinental railway to Port Darwin until the State of South Australia has carried out the solemn It has lately guarantee, entered into by it prior to Federation that it Would, by an Act of Parliament, authorize the construction of a railway from Port Augusta to the border of Western Australia?

Are not the Australian Mints largely paying the expenses of the gold coinage of the Empire, on which there is a loss; whilst the profitable silver coinage is reserved by the Imperial Government at present? honourable member, I beg to state: 1. The Imperial Government on iolh March last was asked to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government in regard to the withdrawal of the present silver coinage from circulation in Australia, and it was urged upon it that ^'200,000 per annum of the existing silver circulation should be withdrawn and placed in circulation elsewhere than in Australia, instead of j£roo,ooo, as preII was also asked to agree to cease the supply now forwarded from the Imperial Mint to other parts of the Empire so as to allow the silver withdrawn in Australia to be transferred there. 2. The Imperial Government does make a considerable profit on the coinage of silverFor the Commonwealth to avail itself of such profit, the gradual withdrawal of present currency from circulation would be necessary. 3. A considerable amount of gold coin is annually exported to' Great Britain. During 1903-4 there was a net profit made by New South Wales and Western Australia, in connection with the Sydney Mint of ^7,274 2s. 6d., and Perth Mint °f ;£'7J545 3 There was, however, a net loss S sustained by Victoria in connection with the Melbourne Mint of ^335 iSs. 9d.

In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed from 1st September, vide page l8 The GoThat the item, ""President, j£i,ioo,"" be agreed to. portunities that are afforded to honourable members, I think that that presented by the discussion upon the Treasurer's financial policy is the most fitting to select, for doing justice to the various questions of public policy to which it is considered necessary to direct the attention of the Government. I have very carefully perused the Treasurer's financial statement, as reported in Hansard, and I think that if it is read, as I hope it will be, throughout the British Possessions, it will create a distinctly favorable impression. The Treasurer was perfectly justified in taking an optimistic view of our financial conditions. An investigation of the Treasurer's figures will, however, demonstrate how little the results which, are shown in the statistics supplied by the right honourable gentleman with such liberality throughout his Budget are due to legislation by this Parliament, and how much they are dependent upon the action of a beneficent Providence in giving us excellent seasons during the past two years. It is from that cause that we have benefited more than from any other, and I think it is a reflection upon us that the financial statement contains no proposal which seems calculated to improve the conditions which now obtain owing to the bountiful seasons which we have experienced. There are one or two matters to which I desire specially to direct the attention of the Treasurer. I regret to say that an effort is being made by a certain section of the House-and in this connection I wish particularly to emphasize the views of the commercial community,",14,Commonwealth Laboratory

Theie is an entire absence of corruption, but unfortunately a number of honourable members, whose honesty of intention cannot be questioned, have been carried away by theories which have not been put to the test, and have supported legislation which has done much to hamper the development of the Commonwealth.

I do not propose to deal with other branches of the question of defence, for the reason that these have been dealt with so fully and exhaustively by the ex-Minister, the honourable and learned member for Corinella. There is, however, one inconsistency, to which I should like to refer. Honourable members will observe that there is a larger sum allotted for the rifle ranges in New South Wales than has been allotted to similar institutions in Victoria, although in the latter State there are considerably more members of such clubs. as many members of rifle clubs in Victoria as there are in New South Wales. toria there are 19,800 members of rifle clubs; and I trust that, when we come to deal with the items, the Minister representing the Minister of Defence will be able to explain matters, and assure us that the clubs in Victoria are not to be placed in a worse position than are those in New South Wales. Personally, of course, I hope that New South Wales will get the amount allotted, and morei f required ; but I claim that Victoria, in this con£ 5 protection, anyhow. nexion, is entitled to better consideration. After the exhaustive manner in which the sugar bonus has been discussed, I shall not presume to deal in detail with so complicated a question. As with most bonuses, however, those who receive this one regard it as so comforting and desirable that they crave for its continuance; and, in my opinion, we should probably not be justified, considering the financial position of Queensland, in abruptly terminating its payment. There has been a suggestion that the bonus shall be extended for another five years, but I trust that to this proposal there may be a modification, so that, while the bonus is extended for a slightly longer period, there shall be a gradual reduction, until, at last, it becomes extinct. too long. I should say that we might extend the bonus for two years beyond the present period, and, thereafter, over five years-allowin g it to become gradually extinct. That, I think, is a reasonable proposal. proposal. proposal. WhatI want to secure is that the public of the .Commonwealth shall see some point at which this bonus will vanish. That, it seems to me, is most desirable; and to secure that end we shall probably have to give way by allowing a little longer time. In any case, when the matter arises for discussion, I shall advocate the gradual extinction of the bonus. We ought to remember that this bonus was granted for the ostensible purpose of, in time, removing the Kanakas from Queensland-for the purpose, in short, of securing a White Australia. for also on the ground of protection to the local producer? son was to secure a White Australia. ber not know that the white grower pays ,£3 in Excise, and receives only £ 2 as a bonus ? tion. not get the full £ 6 protection. understood that I am fully in accord with the desire for a White Australia. .

I am sorry that the Treasurer has not definitely declared the intentions of the Government in regard to this matter. We have had some expressions of opinion from him as to what should be done, but he has given us no indication of the intentions of the Government. orable member think that it was a little too soon to expect that ? tleman might justly have said that he had only recently taken charge' of the Treasury, and had not had time to go into this question. He must, nevertheless, have evolved in his own mind some scheme for dealing with the States debts, though, as I have admitted, it would perhaps be asking too much to expect him to come forward with a cut-and-dried scheme. Two Conferences of Premiers have dealt with this subject, and proposals in regard to it have come from various sources, notably from the right honourable member for Balaclava, who, because of his long term of office as Treasurer, and his knowledge of detail, could, perhaps, deal with it more conveniently than any other honourable member, and recognised the great difficulties to be overcome. He required, first, f u l l transfer of all debts to the Commonwealth; secondly, f u l l control by the Commonwealth; thirdy, f u l l security for the Commonwealth; and, fourthly, that future borrowings be the business of, and confined to, the Commonwealth Government.

The constant question of State Treasurers is : ""What is the Commonwealth Treasurer going to do with the large amount of ' revenue which he will have in his possession if the Braddon provision is not extended ?"" Mr G. B. EDWARDS If we take over the debts there will be no margin. the Commonwealth could exercise the powers given to it under the Constitution; but any forced measures will prove unsatisfactory, and the co-operation of the States seems necessary to insure success. We shall engender permanent ill-feeling unless we carry the States with us in regard to any arrangement that is made. The proposals of the States are these: First, that their finances shall not be dislocated, which is what they constantly dread; secondly, that they shall retain the management and control of the railways, which are the main security for their principal loans; thirdly, that there shall be a clear -definition, within reasonable limits, of the amount which the Treasurers of the States may expect to receive, or be called upon to pay to make up deficiencies. The Statess are justified in seeing that they are secured or indemnified against the possible dislocation or upheaval of their financial condition. The points of difference on fundamental principles, therefore, seem to be few. I have carefully studied the reports of the Conference recently held, and those of the previous Conference, and in my opinion there will be no difficulty in removing these points of difference if we can implant in the minds of the Premiers of the States the feeling that the Federal Parliament does not intend to interfere with or to dislocate their financial position. The States Treasurers would like to see the Braddon clause extended for a specific period JOHN FORREST Not Australian of fifteen or twenty years, or, alternatively, the allocation of a specific sum out of No ; I am speaking of Customs and Excise revenue for the payment of interest.

No Federal Treasurer -no t even the late Treasurer-woul d be able to present to honourable members anything more than the ground-work of a scheme for the transfer of the States' debts. The superstructure will require to be carefully built up after much thought, and in the light of the most complete information if the result is to prove financially successful and advantageous to the people of the Commonwealth, to the Federal Treasurer, and to the States Treasurers.

The loans, when they expire, will have to be provided for by further borrowing, and if the old bond-holdersare paid off, new ones will have fo supply the funds. Therefore, it appears to me that it would be prudent to ascertain the views of representative men with regard to the situation. I think that the sooner the Federal Treasurer and the States Treasurers comeinto close and practical business contact, instead of confining themselves to talking; at conferences and making various suggestions, the more likely we shall be to arrive at a solution of the difficulty. We should, make ourselves acquainted with the financial methods that are followed in Great Britain, and I hold that no satisfaction canbe secured unless we enter into consultation with the leading financial authorities in that country. It would be desirable for us to obtain the benefit of the advice of men of the standing of the general manager of I hope that the Federal the Bank of England, the general manager of the Joint Stock Bank, the manager of the London and Westminster Bank, and other financial authorities.

I understand that the right honourable member for Balaclava is about to make a trip abroad to recruit his health, andi f he could be induced to extend his visit to London, and ascertain the views of the financial authorities there, he could bring back to us much valuable information.

I suggest that the Commonwealth representatives on the Commission should consist of the Treasurer, the leader of the Labour Party, the leader of the Opposition, and the right honourable member for Balaclava, and that four representatives -should be appointed from the States-on e from New South Wales, one from Victoria, and two from the other States, in order that their representation may approximate to the amount of their joint debts. have more representatives than Victoria, if her representation is to be proportionate to the amount of her debt. secure absolute equality of representation so f a r as the States are concerned. New South Wales owes considerably more than does any other State. Victoria comes next from the stand-point of her indebtedness, and, consequently, I suggest that one representative should be chosen from each of those States, and two others from the remaining States. We should then have four representatives of the Commonwealth upon the Commission, and an equal number of representatives of the States. I am ""aware that there is some opposition to my scheme for the appointment of a permanent Council of Finance, inasmuch as it is claimed that the creation of such a body would deprive this Parliament of its direct responsibility. But the Commission which I suggest should be appointed to frame a scheme for the transfer of the States debts, would be equally representative of the States and of this Parliament, and bedefinite in its purpose. what States? may bring in all the Statesi f he chooses, but I have endeavoured to preserve a sort of balance of financial obligation. If effect be given to my suggestion, we shall have I offer it in the most upon that body a representative of each party in this House, and those gentlemen will have the assistance of the wisdom and experience of the late Treasurer. The Commission should be directed to formulate a scheme for the transfer of the States debts for submission to this House and to the States. I may mention that other honourable members, whom I have consulted, consider that the carrying out of my proposal would enable us to obtain some practical scheme for dealing with this great problem. The Commission should be given specific directions, and should be required to report to this House within a specified period. If that report were forthcoming early next session, the whole question might then be discussed, and a scheme arrived at which would be satisfactory to everybody concerned.

I am entirely at one with those who condemn in the strongest possible terms the individuals who go about the world defaming the country which has made them a l l that they are, and which has given them all that they have. If there is one part of the Commonwealth which has been defamed more than another, it is the State from which I hail, and to which I am proud to owe my birth.

In this connection reference was wisely made this afternoon to a report which, according to the newspapers, has just been handed to the Government of South Australiaa report in which a high official appointed by the Imperial Government to preside over one of the States, has departed, it appears to me, from the legitimate prerogatives of his office, and has assisted to circulate slan derous statements.

If I were a member of the Parliament of South Australia. I should be prepared to vote for a motion urging the'recall of a Governor who could so far forget his position, as the Governor of that State appears to have done. Government who permit him to do such a thing ? much surprised to learn that the present State Government are prepared to submit to such a thing. So long as we remain an integral part of the British Empireand I hope that the connection will continueI suppose we must have some intermediary between the Crown and the Commonwealth. We have that intermediary in the Governor General, but we never find him forgetting what is due to the Imperial authorities, or that which is due to the Commonwealth. stand alone in resenting most deeply any interference with legislation passed by this Parliament on the part of a State Governor. I dare say that if all the opinions regarding the unsuitability of the climate of northern Queensland and the Northern Territory for white labour could be brought together and scrutinized, they would be found to have emanated for the most part from those who have never done a hard day's work in either a torrid or a temperate climate-fro m men who have generally been supervisors of labour, rather than labourers themselves. There are members of both Houses of this Parliament who have not only lived in northern Queensland, but have done there the hardestday's work that could be carried out in any part of the world, and yet they are among the warmest advocates of the policy of a White Australia. When we go into the sugar districts, as the honourable member j for New England claims to have done, we find that whilst the large planters assert Whatever may that the climate is unsuitable for white labour, the holders of small sugar plantations express a contrary opinion. I must do the honourable member for New England the justice of saying that, in the course of his visit to the sugar-growing districts of Queensland,' he appears to have obtained a fairly accurate knowledge of the conditions of the sugar industry. Judging by his speech in this debate, he seems to have made very careful inquiries, and to have endeavoured to secure impartial information ; but I would remind him that in investigating this question much depends upon the source from which one seeks knowledge. When we go to the large planter, he will almost invariably tell us that a white man cannot work in the canefields, and that the industry could not afford to pay white workers' wages. He is usually prepared: to make almost any statement to prove the necessity for allowing this territory to be worked I shall be very by a cheap and servile class of labour. On the other hand, if we make inquiries from those who are growing sugar by means of white labour-if we ask them as I and other honourable members asked them during the recent parliamentary trip to northern Queensland-w e find that they are almost as unanimously of opinion that white men can do the work as are the large plantation-holders that they cannot. Those who are actually working in the cane-fields of northern Queensland tell us that they can I know that I do not not only do this work, but that they prefer it to navvying on railway construction works. If I put it to those honourable members who took part in the recent parliamentary trip to northern Queensland whether they observed any degeneracy in the race, as they went north, I am sure their answer would be that the manhood, the womanhood, and the",25,Budget

150,Mr Wilkinson,"childhood of ' Queensland compare very favourably with those of any other part of the Continent. Prior to that visit of inspection I had not been beyond Townsville; but as we went further north on that occasion I met men and women with whom my early childhood had been spent in the southern parts of Queensland, and found that, although they had been living in the tropics for upwards of thirty years, they looked as fresh, as healthy, and as strong as did any who had spent all their lives in southern Queensland or New South Wales. The women not only looked as healthy and as strong, but the families were as large as were those to be found in the south. Some interested parties have expressed the opinion that the race is sure to degenerate by prolonged l if e in the tropics of Queensland, and that the natural increase in the population must f a l l off and eventually almost cease. It appears to me that that has not been the experience of other tropical countries. We find that the most densely populated parts of the earth to-day are those within the tropics. I shall be told, of course, that the people of those countries have coloured skins, but in the root stock I believe they are of the same race as ourselves. If it be argued, as it has been, that only a coloured man' can endure tropical heat, and that nature has proved that this is so by placing nearly all the black races within the tropics, I will reply by advancing an argument used by a medical man, whom I shall quote at some length presently, and ask how it is that we find a coloured people in Greenland, one of the coldest of countries, and also in parts of Canada, where the land is covered with snow for six months out of every twelve. I shall reply by asking further how it is that the aboriginal races of Tasmania were as black as the ace of spades; that the Maori, who lives in anything but a tropical climate, is a coloured man; that the Jap is a brown man, and that the Chinaman is a yellow man, although none of these people live within the tropics? I am prepared to admit that there are ailments such as malaunderstood, and intelligently handled, is not only rial fever, and certain diseases engendered by a parasitic attack, that are almost pecuthe whole round world. What has given rise, liar to the tropics; but medical science has learned to combat those diseases, and it is the opinion of the medical fraternity that there is no disease more susceptible to treatment than that which is due to a parasite. I would also remind honourable members that the malaria of northern Queensland was, fifty or sixty years ago, the malaria of south Queensland and the northern parts of New South Wales, and that it is not uncommon to find malarial diseases, such as fever and ague, occurring wherever new country is being opened up. The early settlers of Queensland and northern New South Wales tell us that malaria was prevalent in the early days on the rivers there just as it is prevalent today on the rivers of northern Queensland. northern Queensland is as low as is that of any other part of Australia. the whole of Queensland is almost as low as is that of any other part of the Commonwealth, and I believe it"" is very much lower than that of Victoria. On the other hand, the birth rate of Queensland stands at the head of the list. This does not show that its climate is unhealthy; and when I say that the State stands at the head of the Commonwealth in these matters, I practically say that it stands at the head of the world, inasmuch as there are very few countries whose statistics in that respect are more favorable than are those of the Commonwealth. With regard to the varied opinions about the health of Queenslanders, I said I intended to take the liberty of quoting the views of a medical man who has lived at Geraldton, on the Johnstone River, for a number of years. I refer to Dr. T . F . Macdonald, who has lived for many years in what is considered to be the wettest part of Australia. It is said that the white man may stand the heat of a tropical climate, but not humidity combined with great heat. The quotation I am about to read is a refutation of that statement, as well as of others to which I have referred, inasmuch as the experience of Dr. Macdonald has been mostly gained on the Johnstone River, where the' rainfall is as great as, if not greater than, that in any other part of Australia. He saysThe climate of North Queensland, correctly the best, but absolutely the very best climate in then, to opinions freely expressed at times in political quarters and in the Southern press, that here in North Queensland we, the pioneers of an Australian Empire yet to be, are doomed to toil in a tropical hell? An earthly paradise were surely nearer the mark. '. .

It is thought by some, perhaps many, that Chinese and Japanese are better fitted than white people -to work in tropical agriculture. This contention I wish to question very seriously. It seems to me that, without any rhyme or reason, people <juickly assume that a coloured skin affords protection against the rays of the sun, and that, therefore, coloured-skinned people are those fitted by nature to do tropical work. By this token then coloured skins are also best for extremely cold -climates; for the Eskimo is a brown-skinned man; and again, the aboriginal inhabitants of America and Canada, countries notorious for their cold, -weather, are red-skinned people. The Japanese, -who inhabit temperate climates, on the 40th parallel north, are, again, brown in colour. The Chinese, who barely touch the tropics are yellow; while New Zealand and Tasmania (and he might Jhave added Patagonia and Terra del Fuego), a long way out of the tropics, to the south, were inhabited originally by very dark races. . . . I have touched this coloured question at some length, lest any white settlers be kept away from -our truly gardens of Eden from fear of their -descendants turning black from the light of the -sun. . . .

It is sunlight which has given us the mighty scrubs of to-day, as it has, in days gone hy. laid down the seams of coal. It is sunlight which has given us our white skins. It is sunlight which purifies a poisoned earth, and makes it wholesome and sweet, and good to look upon; and it is the sunlight of Northern Queensland which is destined to come to the rescue of the city slums and the unemployed of Australia. It will lend a hand in the development of the human race, and lay its kindly fingers upon many a poisoned social sore. Speaking from my own personal experience of the white gangs of cane cutters on the Johnstone River, I can testify to the fact that they flourished in health while at the work. One man, indeed, -who came down from the tableland a wreck from Mr Wilkinson. influenza, regained his health and strength while working in one of the gangs. Some of the farmers' daughters on the Johnstone River develop a taste for work in the cane-fields, and enjoy themselves as much as the girls in the harvest fields at home. That is the kind of work which a little while ago we were told the white man could not do, and which more recently we were told he would not do. White men have proved that they can and will do the work. When some of the objectors saw In my experience all races girls and women working in the canefields, where they had said the white man could not work, they cried shame, and said it was not work fit for a woman to do. But they have had to admit that a white woman was able to do the work which' they had said the white man could not. do. In this, as in other cases, they endeavoured to prove too much. The whole question then is, not the ability or the willingnessof the white man to do the work, but the willingness of the employer to pay him a decent wage. Amongst other questions inquired into by the Federal party during their tour in Northern Queensland was the rate of wages paid. When some planters who advocated a continuance of the use of coloured labour in the Northern cane-fields made their representations, they were asked to say what wages they paid, for one of their complaints was that they could not get a sufficient number of white men, however willing they might be to employ them. In reply to their question, the Federal party were told that ploughmen were getting from 17 s. 6d. to £ 1 per week and rations, which were valued at from 7s. 6d. to 8s. Does it appear reasonable that while the planters offer such wages they will induce white men to go and do the work? A ploughman can earn more than that wage in Victoria, New South Wales, and in the southern part of Queensland, and he is not likely to be induced to take up the same class of work for the same pay in the northern parts of the Continent. That the industry cannot afford to pay "" white"" wages was partly believed in each House of this Parliament when it was legislating on this question. In order that that plea might be met we passed the Sugar Bounties Bill, to enable the planters to tide over the difficulty that we were convinced must ensue in the transition from the one condition to the other. It has been said this afternoon-and by other honourable members during the course of the debate, and at other times-that the bounty has failed in its object. I claim that it has succeeded splendidly, so far as it has been able to work. I agree with the honourable member for Franklin that it is scarcely a correct way to deal with the matter to take percentages. I am quite certain that, to deal with it as it has been dealt with by the honourable member for Kooyong, is not correct. The amount of sugar produced by white labour, when the bounty began to operate, was 12,000 tons. The estimated quantity to be produced by white labour this year is down at 52,000tons. an increase in the quantity of sugar produced by white labour of four and a half, times On the other hand, in 1902 65,000 tons of sugar were grown by black labour. We have now reached an estimate of 107,000 tons; or an increase only of one and two-thirds the amount with which we started. If the same rate of increase is continued proportionately for the next three years, 'we shall have every reason to congratulate ourselves before the expiration of the period for which the Government have promised to extend the bountv upon having solved the coloured labour question, so far as concerns those planters who are willing and anxious to see the White Australia policy succeed. But some planters in Northern Queensland are so stubborn in their resistance to the White Australia policy, that they have announced themselves publicly as being willing that the whole industry should perish rather than have _ that policy succeed. and say that I would rather that the whole sugar industry should perish than that the White Australia policy should f a i l . Because, important as the"" sugar industry may be, the policy of the preservation of Australia for the white race is, to my mind,_ of infinitely greater consequence. A publication has recently been issued by Mr E. W. Cole, of the Book Arcade, Melbourne, entitled ""Cotton Culture in Queensland,"" in which various quotations are made regarding the labour question in the northern parts of that State Abridged reports_ of various meetings of the Royal GeographicalSociety are printed in the work. Amongst others, there is a quotation from a speech delivered by Captain Barclay, who has been for some thirty years or so in the Northern Territory. I was present at the meeting, as was also the Minister of Home Affairs, and the deputy leader of the Labour Party, the honourable member for Wide Bay; and I think they can bear me out in my assertion that Captain Barclay emphatically stated that, after thirty years'' residence in the Northern Territory, he could fearlessly declare that there was nokind of labour that white men could not perform there. But I mention it as another example of the suppression of the truth on this question-no t one single word of that statement appears in the report of the speech in the publication to which I have put referred, I also spoke strongly in favour of There has been the white labour movement in Northern Queensland, as did the honourable member for Wide Bay. But not one word of what we said appears in Mr Cole's statementIn this way facts and statements are suppressed and distorted to suit some end which, in my opinion, is not calculated to conserve the best interests of the Commonwealth or of Queensland. It should hardly be necessary at this time of day to refute statements about the suitability of every part of Australia for occupation by the white race. But we find contrary .'assertions so frequently and continuously cropping up, that it is necessary to meet them, and that can best be done by giving facts. I will quote the birth-rate and death-rate of various States of Australia, and the excess of births over deaths, as proving the suitability of Queensland for occupation by the white race. I have taken the figures for three States-Ne w South Wales,. Queensland, and Victoria-and have selected' the last year for which Mr Coghlan, in his I go to the other extreme, statistical work, gives averages. I find' that the death rates for 1903 were: F o r New South Wales, 11*59 per thousand; Queensland, 12-24; Victoria, i2'9o. Thebirth rate for New South Wales was 28'20per thousand; Queensland, 29'8r ; Victoria, only 26""39. The excess of births overdeaths was, in New South Wales, i 6 ' 6 i ; in Queensland, 17 -57; and , in Victoria, only i 3 ' 4 9 ; or 4 per thousand less than thefigures for Queensland. In the face of such statistics-whic h are compiled not by a Queensland statistician, but by one who is, I suppose, one of the ablest statisticians in the worldI do not think that the merebarren assertions of those who are interested in introducing cheap and servilelabour into the tropical parts of Australia ought to carry very much' weight. ' In considering this question, and trying to be fair to those who have embarked capital in sugarcultivation, we have to remember that owing to the State assistance to the industry in the period of its initiation, a number of people were induced to go into it who expected to realize very large fortunes in a very short time, and to return with their thousands to the other side of the world, to live in luxury and ease for the remainder of their lives. They thought that to be a sugar-planter in Queensland meant to live a kind of Arcadian existence^ swinging in a hammock under the palm trees, with a Kanaka woman, or a coloured woman, or some other woman, fanning him to keep the flies off, whilst low-paid labour was doing 1 the graft in the fieldsand making a fortune for the proprietor. Induced by such ideas, a number of people rushed into the industry, with the result that many of. our large sugar plantations-lik e some of our Queensland! squatting properties, and some in other States-becam e enormously over-capitalized. three rates of interest to be derived from the crop before the profits were reaped; and after the profits were taken the little residue was divided up amongst the labourers who did the work. A very small amount, we may be sure, was left for them. That is one of the reasons why it has been claimed that the industry does not pay. But when we come to consider the yield of sugar per acre, and the price to the sugar-growers, with the cost of cultivation, it may be asserted without fear of contradiction-or , at any rate, without fear of proof to the contrary-that there is no more profitable crop in the Commonwealth than sugar. The bonus, so we understood, was given in order to tide over the change between the employment of coloured labour and the employment of white laboui, the employment of coloured labour being made necessary, possibly, by the over-capitalization of the industry in .its beginnings. Queensland Government had allowed the Kanaka to be brought in, and this cheap labour, with the consequent huge profits, led to over-capitalization; and when the charges are met now, the margin which is left for the payment of other than the cheapest labour, is small. It would not be just, I think, at this juncture, to make those who went into the industry on those conditions the sole sufferers. orable member like to renew the bonus? Mr Wilkinson. term. not been given enough? would the honourable member' extend the bonus ? that matter presently. The honourable member for Kooyong seemed to be at a loss to account for the small increase of the acreage under sugar cultivation. The explanation is largely that the white grower, who hitherto has, in the main, bedn a small holder, registered the whole of his farm, and not only that part under cultivation. The table which was quoted by the Treasurer, and which does not go further' back than 1904, stands in need of some rectification. The acres under cultivation by white Many of them had labour is there shown at 45,424 acres, the yield from which was about 39,404 tons of sugar. The acres, it will be seen, number more than the tons of sugar produced, and that is accounted for by the fact that the whole of the farm was registered as cultivated by white labour, whereas a considerable area was not under cultivation. On the other hand, we. find that in the same year, 74,375 acres were cultivated by means of black labour, and 105,000 tons of sugar produced. From this it would appear that the results of the black labour were considerably greater than those of the white labour, but the explanation I have already given largely accounts for the figures. If we were to confine ourselves to the area cultivated by white labour, we -should find that the yield per acre does not materially differ from that of the land cultivated by black labour. I am certainly in favour of a further extension of the bounty. I should continue the bounty so long as there is a pound of sugar grown The by other than white labour in Queensland, and I should do so in order to penalize' those who continue to grow by black labour. would continue the excise? the bounty, or increase it and the excise.

The honourable member referred to the effect which the bounty had on the manufacture of jam, and showed that it paid the jam manufacturers to use imported sugar, paying a duty of £ 6 per ton, rather than Australian sugar, which pays an excise of only £ 3 per ton. only to jam for export. manufacturer, who imports sugar for the manufacture of jam for export, gets a rebate of £ 5 , whereas the rebate on the Failing that, I excise amounts to only £ 2 10s.; and, under the circumstances, we cannot be surprised that the imported sugar should be prefor a further term of ferred. to jam for export. ference.

These inducements were due very largely to State encouragement of the industry. I recommend the honourable member for Robertson to secure a copy of the work published by Miss Florence Shaw. When she visited Australia as a representative of The Times she went very minutely into this question, and also into the question of the occupation of pastoral lands. What she has said on some matters connected with Australia is not well founded, but what she has to say with regard to pastoral occupation and to the occupation of sugar lands in Queensland is well worthy of perusal and study. She proves conclusively, by tracing the money from the cane-fields baok to its source, that it is borrowed and re-borrowed, and that there are heavy brokerage charges, interest charges, and so on, connected with the capitalization of the sugar industry. never came back.

I am glad to notice that the State Government of Queensland is moving in the direction of imposing some restriction on the practice. There are a number 'of other matters with which I should like to deal, but I shall confine myself to one or two of special importance, which the Government might consider when dealing with the establishment of an agricultural bureau, such as was referred to by the Prime Minister this afternoon, in answer to my questions concerning the institution of am entomological and bacteriological laboratory. and. learned gentleman has announced, on several occasions, the Government to endeavour to foster rural industries of various kinds for new products. There is, in my opinion, a wide field open to us in this direction. I may mention one or two industries to which some attention might be given. It may be thought, when I mention the cultivation of cotton, that I harp on that industry somewhat unduly. But when we consider the enormous amount of money which is sent out of Australia yearly for cotton goods, the suitability of Australia for the production of cotton, and the possibilities of cotton manufacture in the Commonwealth, the question is one which might well occupy the attention of the Government, with a view to seeing whether it is not possible to establish this great industry. might refer to linseed, flax, and castor oil. Last year, we imported linseed to the value of £ 5 , 0 2 3 ; linseed meal, £ 1 0 3 ; linseed cake and oil, £^9,451 ; and linseed oil, £ 1 0 4 , 0 9 6 ; the total value of the products of this plant introduced reaching £ 1 1 8 , 6 7 3. W h y does the honThen, with respect to castor oil, the castor oil plant will grow like a weed from Northern New South Wales up to Cape Yorke..

Whether the plant can be grownprofitably in competition with that grownin IndiaI am not prepared to say.. At any rate, it is a fit subject for inquiry. well enough here. a weed. I have seen a small plantation of it in Queensland, grown for economic The leasing of purposes, from which oil of a very superior character was obtained. We import -£36) 5 5 worth of castor oil in bulk, 2 besides what comes in in bottles; and the earth-nut, or pea-nut, from which China oil-of which we import £ 2 1 , 8 6 9 worthis obtained, will grow like grass here. We import a considerable quantity from the New Hebrides, where the plant grows, and from India; but neither place is more .suitable for it than are some parts of Australia. Indeed, in some places in Australia it has been found difficult to eradicate it. We import £ 6 , 9 7 3 worth of cotton seed oil in bulk; and recently I had a letter from Messrs J. Kitchen and Sons, of The honourable Melbourne, about some cottOn-seed oil expressed from cotton-seed sent down from the willingness of Queensland last season. A sample areai was under cultivation for cotton in Queensland last season, and twenty tons of cotton seed were sent to Melbourne. The firm to which I have referred forwarded to me a sample of cotton-seed .oil cake, and some cotton-seed oil. The fluff had not been removed from the cotton-seed, so that the sampleof oil cake in question could not be used for fodder; but I am satisfied' that when there is machinery to deal with the seed in the proper way, a good commercial article will be obtained.

To me it seems a pity that the growing of cotton should be so languishing, when it might be made the very largest industry in the Commonwealth. However, I attach more importance to the value of the cotton fibre than to the value of cotton-seed oil. At one time there was a factory at work in Queensland which employed nearly 100 operatives, about half of whom were males and the other half females. These are some new products which I think might reasonably be encouraged by the Government when dealing with the matter. I congratulate the Minister of Home Affairs on the fact that he has decided to insist, as far as possible, upon the use of Australian timbers for public works. In the past we have been too much given to preferring imported timbers, and are only just -realizing the value of a possession which we have been allowing to go to waste, although persons outside the Commonwealth have long ago realized, its value, and even the British Admiralty is beginning to recognise the usefulness of Australian timber, as the following cablegram showsAustralian teak is being tried for the backing of armour plates on the armoured cruiser Minotaur, 14,600 tons, 44 guns, which is now undergoing repairs. When the Tariff was under discussion, it was decided, after a long debate, that Oregon pine should be admitted duty free, because it was needed in the mines; but the following paragraph shows that inquiries for Queensland timber aire now coming from Oregon itselfThe Queensland timber exhibit at the Oregon Exhibition has attracted some attention. .Department of Agriculture have a letter from Messrs. J. A. Martin and Company, of Portland, in which they speak favourably of the timber, and iisk for quotations.

There seems to be some prejudice against the Queensland hoop pine on the part of the people of the other States, despite the fact that the whole export of Queensland butter, which amounts to 50,000 boxes annually, is sent away in boxes made of that pine, and there has been no complaint about its being tainted or injured in any way. Quite recently the Queensland DeMr Wilkinson. partment of Agriculture made exhaustive tests to determine whether butter stored in boxes made of New Zealand white pine kept better than butter stored in boxes made of Queensland hoop pine. Both freshlycut and well-seasoned timbers were experimented with, but the result proved the superiority of the Queensland pine over the New Zealand pine. In view of the fact that, under Inter-State free-trade, Queensland has become such a large customer of Victorian produce, not only the products of her soil, but also of her factories, it is not unreasonable to ask that the dairymen of Victoria and New South Wales should, as far as possible, use the timber prod'uced in the northern sister State. I have the report of the Inspector of Public Works in Queensland, with regard to other timbers, but I do not propose to trespass on the attention of honourable members at any greater length, so far as that subject is concerned. I would urge the Government to encourage the formation of cadet corps in all parts of the Commonwealth. Every honourable member who has spoken on the subject of defence has emphasized the necessity of establishing such corps and of beginning the training of our young men for defence purposes in the schools. In this, however, as in other things, there is a disposition to place the burden on the other fellow. We are willing that other people should be drilled and taught how to shoot, but I do not suppose there are many honourable members who ever think of using a rifle. It is hardly to be expected that we shall always be immune from aggression. I believe that, in the event of any attack being made upon us, we shall be able to give a good account of ourselves , provided the 1 means are at hand to enable us to do so. The The men will not be wanting, because, if regard be, paid to the number of males in the Commonwealth capable of bearing arms, it will be found that we could put a considerable army in the field. But, supposing what arms would be available? According to Coghlan, we had, in the Commonwealth, in 1901, when the last census was taken, 1,082,193 adult males, whilst there were also 101,956 males between the ages of fifteen and twenty-one, while the males over sixty years of age numbered 54,813. If we added to the number of adult males the males between the ages of fifteen and twenty-one, anS subtracted the number of adult males over sixty years of age, we should have a total of 1,129,336 males capable of bearing arms. Without taking into account the males between fifteen and twenty-one years of age, or'the males over 60 years of age, we -should have a total of 1,027,380 males capable of bearing arms. Therefore, we need have no fear, so far as our resources in that direction are concerned, especially when we remember the willingness with which our young men recently volunteered for service in a country not their own. The question is-Ho w could we arm. these men? We are spending hundreds of thousands of pounds upon defences, and a very large amount is devoted to scarlet and gold braid, whilst the number of rifles that we have at our command is barely Sufficient to arm our ordinary Defence Forces. is paid for out of the pockets of those who wear them. deal to keep up such a large number of officers. tempt to set mv opinion against that of the honourable and learned member, who is undoubtedly an authority on defence matters, and whose recent speech will be read with interest not only throughout the Commonwealth, but also in other parts of the Empire. Still, I think that the honourable and learned member will admit that a good deal of money has been spent upon what may be called ornamentation-in military displays, parades, and reviews, and that kind -of thing, which are more ornamental than tiseful. -spent upon ceremonial parades; the conditions are much better than they used to bs. there is still too much spent in that manner. There may be some use in ceremonial parades, but I think for the most part they are ornamental. practically wholly ornamental. ever amount may be spent in that direction at present might be more usefully devoted to providing arms for those who are willing to bear them, to the encouragement of rifle clubs, and the establishment of cadet corps. If we begin the training of our youths whilst they are attending school, they will never forget what they are taught there, even though they may afterwards drop out of the Defence Force. Whatever alterations may be made in the drill manuals, they will have such a sound rudimentary knowledge that they will be able, if occasion requires, to quickly pick up their drill at a later stage. Sof a r as drill is concerned, the men could be readily "" licked into shape,"" but they could not be taught to shoot without spending a good deal of time in practice, and without considerable cost to themselves. As an old member of rifle clubs, I know that there are thousands of men in the Commonwealth who, if they had encouragement and facilities offered to them, would be prepared to spend a good deal of time and money in making themselves efficient rifle shots and in otherwise qualifying, themselves to act as defenders of the Commonwealth. It costs us a good would the honourable member suggest? members of rifle clubs a more liberal supply of ammunition at a low price. rounds free, and 230 rounds at half price. of ammunition might reasonably be allowed, and some alteration should be made in the conditions under which the ammunition is used.

If it is taken up with earnestness by the Government, I feel sure that it will receive a good deal of assistance from the several States interested in an influx of population and settlement on the lands. I have heard it said that population is not required, because land cannot be found for the men to work. There is very excellent land in every State of the Union. In the central part of New South Wales there is enough land for millions of people. Many holdings which now comprise millions of acres are found, to be suitable for agriculture, and if a system -of immigration were established it would bring people here who could settle and make a very fine living, contributing much to the prosperity of Australia. Some time ago, it was the custom to talk about the expenses of Federation. I was in favour of the establishment of the Commonwealth, and I agreed with those who had estimated that Australia could be federated and governed on the basis of an annual expenditure of £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 . According to the statement of the Treasurer, 2s. 5d. per head -of the population is the actual cost of government, the total coming within the estimated limit of £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year. made before Queensland was expected to join the Union? was, and, if so, it will leave a small margin for certain expenditure which must take place when the services outlined in the Budget are taken over. It is satisfactory to find that the "" new "" expenditure has not exceeded that estimate. paid some attention to the question of taking over British New Guinea. In deciding to accept that Possession, we have undertaken a very great expenditure. We have to provide a sum of about £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 a year, while the revenue of the Possession is not sufficient'by one-half for its proper government. should be introduced by which the Possession should be made self-supporting. From its native products, in its uncultivated state, it supports a native population of nearly half-a-million. This goes to show that when the enterprise of the European is brought to bear very great results may be attained. I hope that the Government will do something in the way of bringing population to the Possession. [65] There is one question which stands out above others' with which we must deal, and that is, the consolidation of the States debts. Under the Constitution we have power to take over States debts to the amount of £ 2 0 2 , 0 0 0. If these were taken over, the saving which was al ways promised to the people from Federation, would be effected. On a very rough estimate, we find that it would amount to £1,350,000. effected ? which is paid by the several States averages 3*67 per cent., but with! the proceeds obtained from the issue of Commonwealth debentures the debts could be paid off as they matured, with/ a saving of possibly f per cent. do not warrant that statement. ter which has been gone into carefully by financiers, and, while I say that f per cent, would be saved, that is the basis on which the calculations were made when the Con ferences sat prior to Federation.'

The best possible security could be offered to debentureholders, and there is little doubt but that we should be able to issue permanent stock on the London market at 3 per cent. rule. The Customs revenue ofGreece is hypothecated to English bond-holders. universal rule. The money market is regulated by the character of ""the security that is offered. If , for instance, we take the republics of South America, we find that, as the security is of a very unsatisfactory character, the rates of interest are very high. But when I take a country like Auscralia, with the resources which it is known to possess, and with results such as those stated by the Treasurer; when I consider the amount of trade which is being conducted from our ' shores with foreign parts, and the amount of private wealth which is held by our people, there is little doubt in my mind but that 3 per cent, stocks would be taken up. If then we were able to consolidate the public debts, and issue debentures for the purpose at 3 per cent., there would be approximately a saving of f per cent, to Australia. That is what was held out to the public when Federation was advocated, and, that is what they expect to see realized. Until it is realized the Commonwealth will not have given satisfaction. The Treasurer, in outlining the subject to which I have referred-althoug h I am not quite sure that he has pledged himself exactly to what I have saiddoes say that there should be an understanding with the States Treasurersthat money should not be raised outside Australia by them for internal purposes. can be raised by the States on Treasury bills on a 4 per cent, basis. not, therefore, be very difficult for the States to raise money on short-dated notes in Australia; and such securities would not clash with the stock of the Commonwealth that would be quoted upon the London money market. But there would have to be a reserve of from one-half to one per cent, on the part of the States for the purpose of redeeming, at intervals, part of the £31,000,000 sterling that re^mains we have power to take over under the Constitution. With that 1 per cent, accruing, there is little doubt but that the selling price of the bonds could be regulated in London to such an extent as to keep the price fairly level. The tendency would be, under such circumstances, for bond-holders to realize, and take over the Commonwealth security, as being better than the security of any individual State. There would be another great advantage in the Commonwealth consolidating, the debts. Whilst in England there is power to invest trust funds in Australian securities, it is not availed of to any great extent, because the Commonwealth guarantee is not at the back of the security of the States. The Customs revenue having; been taken from the States, financiers in London would much prefer Commonwealth stock to that of the separate States. Australian security is excellent, but the taking up of bonds in England is like the taking of securities in Australia or anywhere else. They are held by large corporations, and in large sums by investors, and are dealt with in the ordinary course of business., Persons going to their agents for investment would have these securities placed before them, with a recommendation ; and we can depend upon it that such persons -would always prefer the' security of the Commonwealth to that of any one State. In time the rate of interest would be much lower, the Commonwealth stock being a better security than a State stock. Nevertheless, the State of Western Australia has issued debentures in London at 3-4.0 per cent, on the security of Western Australia alone. at 3 per cent, at par. slates that Western Australia floated a loan in London at 3 per cent, at par. course, was when Western Australia had It will conlrol of the Customs. I take it that that loan was raised to be invested in railways or water-works in Western Austrlia. The point I was making was that while there would be the Commonwealth securityoffered to the bond-holders, there would also be a reserve of 1 per cent. This would be an additional inducement for the investor to tender for a large sum of money. The point that I am working, up to. is that there are hundreds of millions of trust funds in due over the amount that England of which we can never get a penny until we offer the best security available in Australia. The best security available to them is the Commonwealth security. This Parliament, by passing an Act, could make",39,Budget

We hear a great deal about the difficulties involved in taking over the debts of the States. But the more one thinks over the subject, the less difficult the problem appears. To my mind, it has become a question of ordinary performance. There is no need for an alteration of the. Constitution. We know that £2*02,000,000 sterling might be taken over at any time by the Commonwealth, and the balance could be arranged for by the States themselves, and the interest paid periodically as it is paid now. Buti f we take over the debts of the States, we have an enormous responsibility. How are we to be recouped for this heay,y expenditure, covering something like £8,000,000 per annum? It would necessitate an alteration of the Constitution to abolish the system that now prevails, under the Braddon section, of returning to the States th'ree-fourths of the sum raised in Customs and Excise. That, I think, could be easily effected, if necessary; but it might be advisable to wait until the Braddon section has expired, and then not to renew it . The Treasurer's remarks on that point were a part of the Budget speech which I admired very much. I take it that the right honourable gentleman is not in favour of an extension of the period within which the Braddon section is to operate. not think that an extension of the time would be in the interest of the States. with the right honourable gentleman. I think it would be an advantage to the States to discontinue the section, either by an alteration of the Constitution, or by waiting, an£l not renewing, it on its expiration.

Sir JOH N FORREST I did not mean that the States should receive nothing from the Commonwealth. think the Treasurer stated that the States should receive out of Customs revenue a m-2 fixed sum-, which is practically the system that prevails in Canada to-day.

The payment to the States must of necessity cease, because the Commonwealth will want all the revenue to meet the indebtedness. However, the States still say they want part of the money. But the Commonwealth would still be responsible for some hundreds of thousands of pounds-the amount payable on the bonded debt, in addition to that which is now returned to the several States of the union. about £ 1 , 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 . that is the sum the Commonwealth would still be short. time? every State of the Union would be largely indebted to the Commonwealth-that is, every State except Western Australia, which to-day' raises more than £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year above the amount necessary for the payment of . the interest on her debts. The State of Queensland^ on the other hand, would be indebted to the extent of I quite agree something like £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year. AndT suppose it would be necessary for the Commonwealth to be indemnified for the very large expenditure of, say, £1,500,000 that would be undertaken in addition to the amount of revenue raised from the Customs.

I may further say that the Government to which 1 am now referring were very fortunate in having the honourable member for Coolgardie as Postmaster-General; indeed, the Commonwealth has been very fortunate in our Postmasters-General. There has never yet been a bad Postmaster General; and had the House allowed the honourable member for Macquarie to remain in that position for two or three years longer, I think we should have been able to get enough revenue from the Department to almost run the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Macquarie, when Postmaster-General, must have saved the country about £ 7 1 , 0 0 0 a year, and, no doubt, the present Postmaster-General will, in his speech by and by, show us how the scheme then laid clown will effect savings in the future. the Government must be reconstructed byand-by, because it can never go on as it is now doing; and I hope that the Prime Minister will in future be also Treasurer.

Why should we go to the States to ask them what we should do in Commonwealth affairs? Arbitration Court against us. Minister is not of that opinion. government has passed away. That Government did a number of things to which I might refer if time permitted, but it must not be forgotten that it was a coalition Government. I might say that the Government now in power came into office under very excellent auspices. in with a possible majority, quite apart from the labour section of the House, if they submitted progressive non-contentious legislation. There was no coercion on this side. It was never once intimated to me that I might not support any particular measure. The Government has, however, brought in certain measures which I do not feel that I can support. Before concluding, say something upon the question of defence. I hold that it is not at all necessary that the Minister of Defence should be an expert in the profession of arms. We have not yet had a professional man in thatposition, and it will be better for the Commonwealth if we never have such a man as Minister. In the last Administration, however, we had at the head of the Defence Department an amateur military man, who evidently had imbibed all the extravagant ideas of the expert. He made a long speech last week, which secured for him a good deal of praise outside the Chamber, and a certain amount of kudos among some honourable members. I followed that speech with considerable interest, and was very much pained to find the honourable and learned member posing as an expert in military affairs. Shortly after the inauguration of Federation, the Commonwealth engaged a gentleman of high military reputation and wide experience, who had seen active service in South Africa,, and who had served both in Canada and New South Wales with great success, to place our military affairs on a satisfactory footing. He was here for some time, and before leaving issued a very long report, in which he estimated that the expenditure necessary to place our defences on a war footing was £ 5 2 5 , 0 0 0 . The honourable The Treasurer mentioned that and learned member for, .Corinella, (the other evening, had a great many comments to make upon that report of Sir Edward Hutton, and seemed inclined to disparage it, notwithstanding the fact that the Major General gave general satisfaction in the work of organizing the forces of the Dominion of Canada, had previously carried out similar work in New South Wales, and The Prime had been practically loaned to the ComThe last monwealth for the same purpose. Major General Hutton had nothing to gain by attempting to please those who rule the Commonwealth. He was a man of independent means, and of equally independent character and standing. Although he pledged his great reputation on the They came statement that £ 5 2 5 , 0 0 0 was sufficient to put our defences on a proper footing, this amateur military m'an, tine late Minister of Defence, who follows another profession than that of war, and knows something of a great many things other than military affairs, went so far as to suggest that the necessary expenditure had been under-estimated to the extent of nearly £800,000. When he was asked by I think that I should the Treasurer if that amount was arrived at on expert evidence, he said that he would take the responsibility for the statement. This is an extract from that part of his speech in which the matter is referred to : Major-General Sir Edward Hutton proposed to spend £525,000 to place the equipment of our forts upon a war footing. The Government thought at the time that it would cover everything. He (Lieut -Colonel McCay) wished that it would. But apart from Major-General Sir Edward Hutton's scheme, he had a little list comprising items that would involve an expenditure of £800,000. In reply to an interjection by the honourable member for Grey, he stated that we could not do what was wanted out of revenuethat is, we could not obtain an additional £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 from our Commonwealth revenueTo get into a proper position, the Commonwealth should take the bull by the horns, and obtain the necessary funds by an issue of Treasury bills repayable in the course of five or ten years. He advises the Government to adopt a scheme which will increase our military expenditure by £800,000. He. would raise the necessary money by Treasury bills, payable in five or ten years. But during his speech he stated that guns purchased now would be obsolete within that time, therefore, when the Treasury bills fell due, we should require another set of guns to",44,Budget
305,Mr Deakin,They may appeal to the,45,Budget
306,Mr Henrywillis,"replace those which he would buy now, at a cost of another £800,000, or more. As we should have to redeem the bills as they fell due, our expenditure in principal would be ,£100,000 a year, and in interest £30,000 a year. economy in an arrangement that would involve the Commonwealth in an annual expenditure approximating the amount now paid in bounties to the Queensland sugar growers-a n expenditure which bears very heavily upon the impecunious States of the Union. It is about time that the Government put up a responsible Minister who has been in charge of the Department of Defence to reply to the speech of the honourable and learned member for Corinella. That speech was applauded by Government supporters, but I should like to know from them if they think that the expenditure he recommended is absolutely necessary for the defence of Australia, and to offer protection to British ships visiting these waters ? are practically those of the ex-Minister of Defence. a great deal of credit to himself for them, patting himself on the back, and saying that every line of the Estimates but one, had been passed by him. If that one line, about which he made a minute, had been adopted by the Government, he would have taken definite action. Now, however, he says that the Government should expend another ,£800,000. that. in print. .Hutton's estimate is £525,000, but, in addition, the late Minister had a little list costing £800,000, and in* volving £30,000 in interest and £100,000 for the redemption of the Treasury bills. I think it is only due to us that some Minister should express the views of the Government with regard to the speech of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, which has been received with a good deal of approval. We should, know whether any such sum is necessary to make provision for the proper defence of Australia, to meet the requirements of the British fleet in these waters, and to protect our trade. that such an expenditure will be absolutely necessary if we are to have an adequate defence. , There is no very guarded statement. The honourable and learned member for Corinella went further, and stated that we could not do what was required out of revenue. He said the Commonwealth should take the bull by the horns and raise the necessary funds by means of Treasury bills, redeemable in five or ten years. He advised the Government to do what he was not prepared to recommend when he himself was Minister of Defence. Only an amateur would speak in that way. I would not presume to offer an opinion upon military matters, becaus.5 I am not an expert. It is because we are not experts that we employ the best available men to advise us, and yet we find an honourable and learned member who is an amateur in military affairs coming, here with all the swagger of a Major General, and posing as an expert. He says that he will take the responsibility of recommending the expenditure of £800,000, which is to be raised by the issue of Treasury bills, redeemable at the rate of '.£100,000 per annum,, and involving an annual charge for interest of £30.000. The proposal appears to me to be outrageous. It has received the commendation of the Age, but that is of no particular value. That newspaper commendsthe honourable and learned member to-day butt it may denounce him to-morrow. A great deal of notice is taken of that newspaper, which, although it has no responsibility, influences the legislation passed by this Parliament. This is undesirable, because the Government, who are responsible, should , Major-General Sir Edward frame their policy and carry it out independently of the Age, or any other newspaper. member's remarks apply equally to other newspapers ? I think the newspapers are well and ably conducted. I should like to make one more reference to the proposal of the Government to encourage immigration to AustraliaWe have all heard of the good old days when colonists had the strongest faith in the future prosperity of Australia, and took care to select immigrants from the agricultural classes of England, Ireland, and Scotland-me n of honesty and integrity, and",45,Budget

It is well that we should go back to the good old policy of selecting agricultural immigrants, and providing them with land. In Western Australia the Government are giving 160 acres of land to any man who will apply for it, and we should bring pressure to bear upon the other States Governments to offer similar inducements to go on the land. In New South Wales, hundreds of thousands of acres of cultivable land, superior to anything I saw in Western Australia, are locked up in leaseholds, and it is desirable that steps should be taken to have these lands thrown open for agricultural occupation. In Queensland, also, millions of acres of land suitable for agricultural purposes aire being thrown open weekly; but, unfortunately, settlers upon such land would labour under certain serious disabilities. water supply be provided? member has touched upon one of those disabilities. water is to be tapped in that country.

I compliment the Treasurer upon his Budget statement. It was the finest that has been delivered in this Parliament. At the same time, I think that it would be very much better if the Treasurer of the Commonwealth also filled the position of Prime Minister, for reasons which I gave in the earlierportion of my address. honourable member for Robertson has made some most interesting observations. One of his statements was that the Government possess a majority in this House, quite independently of the Labour Party, which means that they have a very considerable majority indeed. stances, we may hope for a very speedy conclusion of the pressing business of the session. I did not altogether agree with the honourable member when he roundly rebuked the ex-Treasurer, the right honourable member for Balaclava, for having consulted the 'States Governments upon the question of the transfer of the States debts. whether there is such a party on this sideI t seems to me that that question, above all others, is one upon which the States have a right to be consulted. In dealing with the consolidation of the States debtsa question that has occupied a prominent position throughout the debate-the Treasurer said that the chief objection to the extension of the Braddon section was that it led. to friction and to charges of extravagance being levelled against the Commonwealth by the States. did. WhatI said was that if all States loans had to be raised through the Commonwealth there would be friction. right honourable gentleman is under a misapprehension. Whether or not he made that statement, however, is a matter of no moment, for, in my opinion, the conditions arising under the Braddon section-the inter-dependence of the States and the Commonwealth-mus t lead to a certain degree of friction. The chief objection to that provision in the Constitution lies in the fact that it hampers the Commonwealth, inasmuch as under it we have to raise four times as much revenue as we require. It is said that the Braddor* section protects the finances of the States,, and, under existing conditions, it certainly does to some extent. There appears, however, to be a tendency in certain quarters to regard it as a fetish, which must be preserved at all hazards. I , for one, f a i l to see what special guarantee is afforded through its agency to the States. As a matter of fact, the guarantee which it offers from the point of view of the StatesTreasurers is not half as good asthat which would follow the adoption of the proposal made by the Treasurer that the Constitution should be so amended as to provide that a fixed sum should be necessarily returned, per capita, to the States. The Braddon section merely provides that three-fourths of the revenue raised' by the Commonwealth shall be returned to the States. It does not declare what sumshall be annually raised by us. That being Under such circumso, if we had a real free-trade party in a majority in the Parliament, this so-calledguarantee would go for nought: a provisionthat three-fourths of nothing should be returned to the States would not be of much value to them. The position would be the same if we had an out-and-out prohibitionparty in power. I question, however, of the House, or whether there is a truly free-trade party in opposition.

To my mind this question is so inextricably involved with that of the transfer of the States debts that we need not be greatly concerned about it. With the taking over of the States debts the Braddon section would become inoperative, because, as has Already been pointed out, the whole of the Commonwealth revenue would not be sufficient to pay the interest on those debts. have to be raised from the States. the means by which it should be raised would be a matter entirely for 'the consideration of this Parliament. Treasurer observed that there was not much force in the objection that by at once taking over the whole of the debts of the States the Commonwealth would enhance the value of the present stocks to their holders, inasmuch as we should be sellers. We must recognise, however, that we cannot hope to at once convert all the debts of the States. process, each debt being converted as it falls due. duce the holders of the stocks of the States to give them up in return for a Commonwealth issue, unless we could give them something that would be more advantageous to them than are their present holdings; but if we were to .give them something more valuable than they now have, what benefit would be reaped by the Commonwealth ? In ""these circumstances we must realize that we shall only be able to take over the States debts as they f a l l due, and to raise fresh loans on' better terms than the States individually could obtain. I wish to say a few words on the method in which the bookkeeping sections of the Constitution are administered. For the fust two or three years all new expenditure was debited against the State in which it was incurred. Under that practice, for in stance, South Australia had to bear not coola, amounting to £ 1 0 , 0 0 0, but also the loss on the working thereof. That, I think, was a perfectly fair and clear position. So long as the bookkeeping system is' retained, it should be administered in its JOHN FORREST -It w ill take some integrity. But since then we have had a different system under which the cost I believe that it of additional advantages in connection with the transferred departments has been debited, not against the States concerned, unless we substituted for it but against the Commonwealth on a per capita basis. Two or three years ago the late Treasurer introduced the practice of debiting the cost of new works against the Commonwealth, and the present Treasurer has gone somewhat further in that direction. The bookkeeping system as now administered is f u l l of most absurd anomalies. The Estimates contain an item for a telephone line from Sydney to Melbourne, and an item for an additional telegraph line from Melbourne to Adelaide. The balance would The revenue will, of course, be credited, not to the Commonwealth, which'erects the line, but to the States concerned. That is a very anomalous position, when in each case the line will run parallel to, and be I think that the worked in conjunction with, a line , which was erected by the States. Assuming for a moment that all new works were built out of loan funds, and not out of the general revenue, the Commonwealth Would erect a line, and pay the interest on the outlay, while the tqtal revenue would be credited not to the Commonwealth! but to the States. That is the extraordinary position we havv; That must be a gradual got into. Then,"" as regards replacements, I am never quite sure where I It would be impossible to inam. In looking over the Estimates, it is difficult to know whether a work is to be undertaken on a per capita basis or debited against a particular State. Originally the States felt aspecial interest in keeping down the expenditure on new works therein.

It would be to the advantage of the Queensland Government to get as much as possible out of the Commonwealth, because the greater part of the cost of a work would be borne by the other States. Queensland because it made that special request. Of course, the argument ^applies to all the other States. The Treasurer said that the bookkeeping system could not be abolished at once, because it would cripple Western Australia as compared with the other States. I admit that it could not be abolished straight away without in some way or other indemnifying the States for the losses which they would sustain. sliding scale would have to be adopted, so that the discrepancies and disparities might gradually disappear. pointed out that, under the present system, so far as new works and buildings are concerned, Western Australia is gaining enormously at the expense of the other States. Take the proposed expenditure on additions to post-offices and erection of new post-offices. £ 2 1 , 2 5 0 in New South Wales, £ 2 0 , 1 3 7 in Victoria, £ 2 5 , 4 2 5 in Western Australia, £ 5 , 6 2 4 in South Australia, and £ 7 , 1 4 5 in Queensland. Again, if we take the items for additions and new works in connection with the Defence Department, we find that it is proposed to spend £ 1 3 , 8 1 8 in New South Wales, £ 1 1 , 7 1 7 in Victoria, £ 7 , 5 7 7 in Queensland, £ 4 , 9 8 5, in South Australia, £ 3 , 1 9 6 in Tasmania, and £ 2 5 , 2 2 3 in Western Australia. In other words, it is proposed to spend nearly as much in Western Australia as in any three States. at Fremantle. until recently all these items were charged against the States in which the expenditure was incurred. instance, the whole cost of the telegraph line to Tarcoola was charged against South Australia, but Western Australia is getting all these works constructed on a -per capita basis at the cost of the Commonwealth. Sir, JOHN FORREST -But I did not do that. The system was changed before I took office. Now, any such proposal able gentleman is extremely inconsistent when he agrees with this proposal, and yet protests that it would not be advisable to introduce a proposal under which the bookkeeping system would cease jn a short time on a sliding scale. If the revenue and expenditure of the transferred Departments are to be charged against the several 'States that I simply instance system ought to prevail throughout. Western Australia is'deriving any particular benefit over any other State. able gentleman must admit that the expenditure of very much larger sums of money in one State than in others means that that State is deriving an advantage.

357,Mr Batchelor,"We had a specificing at matters from a purely Federal point of view. We have had an interesting speech from the honourable member for Kooyong, in which, he dealt with the population arid the financial question. I tried to ascertain just what it was that he proposed, but unfortunately he did not develop any scheme. He outlined several ideas for increasing the population, and for establishing a committee of finance, which would do something or other, but he did not develop them sufficiently to enable one to decide whether they would be useful or otherwise. One point which the honourable member did make clear was that the condition of the workers is better.in Australia than in any other part of the world. He said that our workers are better housed, better fed, better clothed, have more money in the Savings Banks, and that their productions are unequalled anywhere. Most of those statements are true. But then the honourable member went on to say that the reason why workmen from other parts of the world did not""flock to this working man's paradise was because of the pinpricks that the .Commonwealth and the States are administering to capitalists and to commerce generally. That is a somewhat remarkable statement. The honourable member tells us that conditions in Australia are better for the workers than they are anywhere else, and apparently he argues that workers in the older countries of the world will not come to Australia because of legislation, which has made the conditions better, and of proposals by which it is hoped to make them still better. pears to think that the only way to bring a large population of workers to Australia is to reduce the emoluments of labour, and to make the conditions less generous for wage-earners. Surely that is a curious argumfent. It is sometimes said that the cities of Australia are overgrown. To some extent they are. bate, reference has been made to the population of Adelaide as being 45 per cent, of the population of the whole State of South Australia. must lation of a city is reckoned within a ten-mile radius; and a ten-mile radius in the case of Adelaide includes a large number of primary producers. bulk of the fruit-growers are, I suppose, within ten miles of Adelaide, and-many persons grow produce for export as well as for the local market. Within ten miles of the the Levels. The huge aggregations 01 population in Australia are not all engaged in purely city pursuitsin manufacturing, and so forth. That idej is entirely erroneous. If the facts are inquired into, it is found that the overgrowth of our cities is' more apparent than real. Of course every one of us would like t see more of our country lands cui tivated, and put to a higher use I do not think that the Treasurer's speech showed any-material advance in regard tt, the States debts and other questions of thekind. No speech is likely to advance such matters; but the question of the States debth must become of pressing importance shortly. When the time comes, I believe that the House will grapple with the matter, readily enough, and the sooner steps are taken in this direction the better it will be for the community generally. I shall not detain the Committee further, because I know thathonorable members are anxious that this debate shall close. Sir PHILIPFYSH (Denison) T hesitated for a long time as to whether 1 should take part in this debate, and I cannot say that I have been very much encouraged to do so by the want of interest shown in the -proceedings during the last two or three days. Yet when I speak of a want of interest I must not forget that during the past week there were several speeches delivered on the Budget, opening up subject after subject, and vista after vista-speeche s that were not only interestHe aping, but were delivered in a manner worthy of the best traditions of the various States Parliaments. I do not desire to be invidious, but I think I may mention the speeches delivered by the honourable and learned member for Corinella and the honourable member for Gippsland. The latter gentleman spoke under stress of great physiDuring the decal weakness, which ultimately overpowered him; but those who listened to that old statesman,as he is, with all his eloquence and force, could not help congratulating the But it Commonwealth on haying amongst us such be recollected that the popua representative. The speech of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, elevated the debate to the tone which many of us, when we were advocating Federation, The great led the electors to believe would result from the association of a number of the best statesmen of Australia in the Commonwealth Parliament. That speech dealt mainly with our defences, citv there is a pastoral run, and it-is exceedingly to be regretted that party exigencies compel, from time to time, changes in the Ministry, which remove ""men from positions which they are Lest able to fill, and very frequently replace them by men of not equal calibre. I know, from officers of the Defence Department, that there has not been a Minister who has shown himself more capable of carrying on the work of administration. This is just one of those cases which may lead us to support motions which have been submitted by two. honourable members of this House in reference to the election of Ministries. It is suggested that the Ministry should be selected, not by one man, who may be the Prime Minister, but by the House itself, the members of which know better who are the men most capable of filling the special positions apart from any consideration of party exigencies. The honourable and learned member for Corinella, in that speech, dealt with the various suggestions which were made by the late General Officer Commanding, Sir Edward Hutton, and he led us to the conclusion that if the recommendations of the military experts were carried out we should find ourselves, perhaps sooner than we expected, pledged to an expenditure of at least £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 for equipment, in'addition to the expenditure already incurred in connection with garrisons, mines, artillery, and other land forces. Sir year. which the honourable and learned member for Corinella referred was specially in connection with tfie suggestions made by Sir Edward Hutton. penditure Was£ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 altogether. was largely in connection with expenditure which must be incurred year by year. a number of years. Sir PHILIPFYSH at issue with the honourable and learned member for Corinella, and the late General Officer Commanding, in this matter. The honourable and learned' member did not convince me that we could wisely make any further expenditure on our land forces than that which is now being incurred. I have in my mind the recommendations of the various experts who have visited these shores in years gone by. Those experts were sent out here by the Imperial Government, and they have from time to time called attention to the fact that these shores can never be invaded except by a desultory marauder. It may be that artillery and other armaments become obsolete every ten years or so, and require replacing at further expenditure. Whether that be so or not, there is the fact that every expert who has yet visited these shoresfrom Colonel Scratchley and Sir Edward Jervois down to Sir James Bevan Edwards -ha s come to the conclusion that these shores cannot be invaded except by some desultory marauder. enemy that the honourable and learned member for Corinella proposed the expenditure. and learned member very wisely pointed out that while we have been warned .that attack was more likely from privateers of the character of the Shenandoah, or the Chesapeake, a new order of things has arisen in the Pacific during the past few years. So far as the navyj is concerned, we know that war ships, once away from their own shores, cannot return unless they have been permitted to coal by some friendly State. But of late years, as the honourable and learned member -for Corinella reminds us, Germany has established coaling stations in the Southern Pacific, and may in consequence place us in a position which hereJOHN FORREST,-Not £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 a tofore we have had no reason to contemplate. That being so, I would remind honourable members of facts which have been forcibly pressed on their attention in sessions gone by. It is true that we may have to look for our defence and protection' not to the immediate waters of Australia. We may have to depend for victory on some great battle fought 2,000 miles away from our shores, as Great Britain had to depend for victory on the battle of Trafalgar. If an enemy had a force sufficiently large to enable him to disregard the fleets which were harassing him, and to leave them, he might run the gauntlet, and, picking up coal at I am altogether various coaling stations, at length reach these shores. Then would begin our responsibility, and we must consider what should be our first line of defence. It was my duty for. many years in the past to suggest to a State Parliament what course it should adopt and what should be its fair share of a contribution to something like a naval defence. I had therefore to consider what' was the first line of defence for Australia.

I intend to supplement the Treasurer's figures, in order to emphasize this progress. His statistics deal with what the commercial and trading communities have done. what has been the result of personal exertion and thrift among the masses generally. The Treasurer has .shown that our primary products are worth £120,000,000 a year, and the output of our factories £60,000,000 a year, while £14,000,00 0 a year is expended in capital and machinery. Buti f we ask what the people have done personally, we find that our Savings Banks, whose books record the thriftiness of the public, have accumulated deposits to the amount of £34,000,000 , while our building societies and friendly societies have accumulated £[5,000,000. Our life insurance societies have accumulated the amazing sum of £35,000,000, which represents £120,000,000 on the lives of 400,000 persons, or half the manhood of Australia.

The greater proportion of the hats, boots, flannels, and blankets that were formerly imported have been displaced by locally manufactured articles. manian blankets and flannels are sold wherever they are shown all over Australia, and articles of similar value could not be imported from England and sold here after payment of the duty at prices which would permit of successful competition. fore Federation.

Comparatively fore, there will be a falling-off of less than £i-,ooo,ooo in five years. It must not be concluded that there has been any great falling off in general imports, because the difference is mainly due to the fact that our importations of grain and sugar have practically ceased, at a loss to the revenue of £ 1 , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Therefore, we have nearly passed through the first five years of our experience of the Tariff, to which the right honourable member for Balaclava referred when, in introducing his first Budget, he said, "" I have to warn the House that the Estimates which are now produced will have, to be reduced year by year as The Tasour manufactures increase.""

The Treasury The right honourable member for Balaclava predicted that the revenue would gradually be .reduced to about £ 7 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0, the value, as he stated, of the normal year; but our Ten per cent, experience does not point to any such probability. The bookkeeping sections of the Constitution were inserted in order that we might learn what were the possibilities of the Commonwealth within Under such a Tariff, the that period.

I am exceedingly sorry to observe that our population has, to a small extent, decreased. The number of emigrants from Australia exceeds that of our immigrants. I do not know how we can stop this leakage. That observation, leads me to pass more rapidly than I had intended to another subject, which relates to the settlement of the people upon the soil. Until we can settle our own population upon the lands of the Commonwealth, we cannot attempt to introduce strangers. Too many of our sons, wearing stiff collars and starched cuffs, are to be found wasting their time in our cities. We want to induce them to go upon the land. Western Australia. into pursuits which they do not understand without providing them with a certain amount of capital, we should be more likely to facilitate their downfall than to secure their prosperity. I observe that the Treasurer proposes to seek a conference with the States Treasurers upon this subject. He may arrange a conference with them, but he will find that every State is doing what it can in this direction. Some of the States have found it necessary to hold on to their lands in order that they may maintain their revenue. Others have found it imperative to retain possession of them, because, having sold them previously for j Q i , ios., and 5s. per acre, it would be ruinous to those who have purchased if the Government now commenced to give them away.' idea. The same argument was used in ""Western Australia, but there is nothing in it.

Sir PHILIPFYSH is not. It is gratifying to learn that the States are providing opportunities for the settlement of the people upon the soil. In Victoria the Credit Fonder system is in vogue. I believe in that system-in fact, Budget. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Budget. I have always been a Credit Foncier advocate-and I endeavoured to introduce a similar system into Tasmania, but my efforts were baulked by the Legislative Council of that State. That, we must assist our own people before we help outsiders is an article of my creed. In picking up our stalwart sons, who are at present resident in our cities, and placing them upon the lands of the country, we have a great work to perform. A t Dookie, Hawkesbury, and other institutions they may become familiar with agricultural pursuits, but if subsequently their parents are unable to provide them with the capital necessary to place them upon the land,' the Government must step in and assist them. That means that we cannot hold out any inducements to immigrants at present. Consequently, when I hear the Prime Minister or any member of the Government talking about the encouragement of immigration, and of the desirability them go to of arranging conferences with the States Governments to discuss that subject, I am inclined to say, "" T a l k as you will, it wiil result in nothing."" There can be no immigration of the class of people we desire to see settled' upon the lands of the country for some,time to come. In this connection I would point out that Canada offers much better inducements to immigrants than we can. Where is the State in Australia which will give an intending immigrant 160 acres of land? will do that. character of that land ? Canada has flooded its lands with a very likely class of settlers, and now that no further areas are'available within twenty-five miles of the railway it intends to duplicate the line from the Atlantic to the Pacific, in order to make its other lands more accessible.

Therefore, the planter has paid, in order to get rid of coloured labour, £ 1 a week, or £ 5 2 a year, for every labourer more than he would have paid had he used all coloured labour. If a bounty of £ 2 per ton is paid when white labour only is employed in producing the 170,000 tons of sugar, then the Commonwealth will pay £340,00 0 a year.

Sir PHILIPFYSH anything about that; it is a matter for the growers. If these figures are approximately correct, it merely shows that we were monstrously misled in giving a bounty of £ 2 per ton for white-grown sugar. We have given the planters not onlythe advantage of the protection between the excise duty of £ 3 and the import duty of £ 6 , but also a bounty of £ 2 per ton, which-as suming that all the labour is white, and it will be some time before it is-represent s £ 1 9 2 , 0 0 0 a year, or more than £ 1 a ton, in addition to the extra cost they can show they have incurred by employing white rather than coloured labour. but in lieu of that. can substitutes white in lieu of coloured labour, and we have given him enough to pay for the extra labour, and £ 1 per ton in addition thereto.

All through the period when t , with others, was asking the people of Australia to federate, I boldly told them that Queensland must be considered, as she had an enormous product which I I do not know hoped would satisfy the requirements of all Australia. Five years ago, I used the same number of tons for the purpose of my calculations as I am using now, because I was told by Sir Hugh Nelson, in correspondence, that 170,000 tons was the quantity which was needed; and that before very long it would all be produced by Queensland.

What was the position of the planter prior to Federation ? I bought tens of thousands of tons of sugar from Queensland at a fair price-the price of Mauritius sugar. We are told that prior to that time, the planters held their own. The Commonwealth does not exist for the purpose of 'assisting men to make fortunes. We all had to hold our own, with difficulty indeed, prior to Federation. Therefore, the Queensland planters must be satisfied to do that. were paving £ 6 a vear for labour then. have the market, and we are going to continue, I hope, to give them the advantage of the proportion of £ 3 a ton. If that, which is equal to 20 per cent, on their raw product, is not sufficient, I do not know that the raw product is worth producing. When the question of the sugar bounty was submitted, many of us, perhaps, voted out of consideration' for those who had plantations on the tropical line. When you get to the so far as to say that the cost might be 2s. far north of Queensland, I exceedingly doubt, whatever may be said to the contrary by Queenslanders, whether the atmospheric conditions will enable families to work in the cane-fields. I have heard representatives of that State say, "" The planters have only to pay the price, and labour will be found."" last three or four years we have offered the planters every inducement to pay the price. We do not find that in that district the coloured labourer is being dispensed with as rapidly as we had hoped. I am not an authority on hygiene, and if ,a medical man resident in the district tells me that while the white man may endure, his wife and children must suffer, that there must be ennui, dementia, and early decay, and all those weaknesses which extreme climates induce, I accept his testimony. It is the only testimony I can find, and it convinces me that tropical Queensland is unfit for the wives and children of white men. aware that doctors disagree as to that ? disagree I have to arrive at a conclusion by exercising my own common sense, and basing my judgments on my own experience. has had no experience on the subject. Sir PHILIPFYSH I have had quite enough experience of tropical climates. I have been in Mauritius, and have seen something of cane-cutting there. When the rain falls upon the land the extreme heat causes the moisture to rise in dense clouds, by which one is enveloped. The climates of such countries are not such as white men can live and work in . When the time comes for the discussion of this question, I shall feel compelled to arrive at the conclusion that the sugar industry must depend upon, itself for support, except so far as concerns the difference between the Excise and the Customs duty. There the Commonwealth very considerably. Questions affecting Federation and the Commonwealth cannot arise in conversation without the matter of Federal extravagance being discussed. It becomes ouite monotonous. I am pleased to know that the Treasurer has given figures to show that Federation is costing Australia only is. 5^d. per head. At the time of the Convention, and when we were recommending the Constitution to the people at the referendum, I even went 6d. a head. But when the Treasurer mentioned the actual expenditure as is. 5^d. per head he omitted to include cerEuropean tain items of expenditure which are really consequent upon Federation. There is the sugar rebate, for instance, which for the year 1905-6 is estimated at £ 1 5 1 , 0 0 0 . During the That expenditure is consequent upon Federation. It is no reply to say that the people have been relieved through the Customs to the extent of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year in respect of tea and kerosene duties. BeforeI have done with the subject. I think I shall be able to show that these reliefs which, in my opinion, w'e so unwisely granted, have been a serious contributory cause of the difficulties of some of the States-especiall y of Queensland and Tasmania-in respect of their finances. The abolition of the tea and kerosene duties certainly cost Tasmania£ 2 5 . 0 0 0, and Queensland very nearly £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 a year. Queensland has accumulated deficiencies of , .

Tasmania is, therefore, in the rather serious position that she has, to an extent, got to the end of her tether. the surplus for the year 1905-6, estimated to be paid by the Treasurer to the Government of Tasmania, is within £ 4 , 2 2 7 of the actual amount realised; in other words, there is only that amount, so far as Tasmania is concerned, to reckon on for any further expenditure. nearly consume the whole, while the transcontinental railway would consume twice as much. in Tasmania, with the increased expenditure, the Commonwealth is likely to have a second State thrown on its hands, though not in default, because I hold that under the Constitution, there can be no default. Although the Commonwealth receives the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue, three-fourths of it must be distributed to the States in proportion to the amount collected.

The opimeter of 1900 showed this disparity between New New South Wales the people spent £ 1 per head on tea, sugar, spirits, narcotics, and dried fruits, the luxuries and semi-luxuries, Tasmania spent at least ios. per head COOK -Does Tasmania less, and I am not sure that it . was not 15s. per head less on these articles. That was the measure of their ability, by reason of good wages, to spend on articles of luxury liable to Customs duties. If honourable members will go through the returns on\ these items of luxuries, and semiluxuries, they will find that the measure The Treasurer knows that when his of ability to consume these articles has approximated throughout Australia, until it is now almost the same in each State. It is somewhat astonishing to find that iru this respect the ability of The Tasmania has so nearly approached that of New South Wales. When we consider the position of Western Australia, with her enormous Customs duty of £ 8 per head', we shall find that that-was due to a much greater proportion of adult males living in wattle and dab, or tin huts, upon luxurious whiskeys and beers, and paving very heavily for narcotics and spirits of all kinds. But there is a normal condition of things, and by reason of the progress of mineral development on the west coast, Tasmania has so improved her position as a consumer of luxuries and semiluxuries, that she has in the last five years more closely approximated to the position of the other States in the value of dutiable goods of this class which her people consume.",61,Thomson Th E Planters Is Another Point Which Affects The People Of

442,Sir Philip Fysh,"The last statisticsference in ability or a difference in computation ? Sir PHILIPFYSH pute with the statisticians of the time as to whether they were not over-estimating this ability to consume dutiable goods, but whichever of us was correct, there remains the fact that on these articles-luxurie s and semi-luxuries, in 1900, the people of New South Wales consumed a quantity per head which gave to the exchequer £ 1 per head, whereas Tasmania only paid some 10s. per head. of that difference having been made up in so short a time. that the payments have become closely approximated, and New South Wales, in 1904-5, paid Customs duty to the amount of £ 2 is. 7Jd. per head, whilst Tasmania paid . £ i 16s. 8d. per head, a difference of only 5s. Tasmania has therefore picked up 5s. in the time. Honourable members will not wonder at that when I tell them that Tasmania has improved her position from that of an exporter to the value of £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 to that of an exporter to the value of £ 3 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 . She has been paying off an old debt which existed; and she has increased considerably the value of her primary products-wool , .gold, metal, root crops, and agricultural products generally. In every line she has shown a progress as marked as will be found in any one of the most important and progressive States of Australia. ture of her cities, "" has pulled down her old barns, and built greater structures,"" and has, in fact, "" laid up much goods for herself for many years."" splendid position for the people of a young State. jured Tasmania so much after all. only injured Tasmania in the way I have said, that she is paying 4s. 2d. per head of her population on account of Federal expenditure. AlthoughI pointed out that she lost in revenue, plus new expenditure, £ 2 3 0 , 0 0 0 , I did not forget to say-and if T did, I am glad the honourable member for Herbert reminds me-that for 180,000 people she has saved £ 1 per head per annum under the Tariff. Under the Tariff in force to-day, her people pay £ 1 16s. 8d. per head, whilst under the Tariff of 1900, they paid £ 2 17s. per head. They have, therefore, saved £ 1 per head, or £ 1 8 0 , 0 0 0 . That amount has gone into, or has remained I had a great disin, the pockets of her people. We shall probably not find many of them who will admit it, but it is nevertheless a fact. So that, although there is a black side to the picture, when we are dealing with the position of Tasmania in the Federation, there is also a brighter side which we can hold up to her people. We can tell them, for whatever it is worth, that though they may be in the position of having to submit to a new class of taxation, it is a substituted I cannot conceive payment, and their taxation has only been increased to the amount of 4s. 2d. per head as the result of Federation. Unfortunately, they have had to enter upon a new class of taxation as I have said, but it is only fair to admit in the Federal Parliament, that so far as that is concerned, the people of Tasmania were entitled to a new class of legislation. With the exception of Western Australia, there was not one of the other States in the year 1900 in which the people were paying £ 2 17 s. per head in Customs and Excise taxation. That was an extravagant rate of payment, and I am not at all sorry that the people of Tasmania are, under the Commonwealth, only paying £ 1 16s. 8d. in Customs and Excise taxation. It therefore seems to me that we have approached the time when the Treasurers ought to more closely investigate the position, so far as the bookkeeping period is concerned. If they do, I feel certain that New South Wales will not now say, as she said at the time of the Convention, She has' enriched the architecthat, so far as her revenue was concerned, she was like a lamb about to be consumed by the wolves,, namely, the weaker States, but will find that the CusThis indicates a toms and Excise receipts of the States so closely approximate that there' should be no difficulty in amending the bookkeeping inprovisions under the powers given to the Parliament by that section of the Constitution which says that the bookkeeping system shall last for five vears, or until the Parliament shall otherwise direct. That time will soon arrive, and I wish that it had been during the Treasurer's year of office, so that he might have come boldly to the front and said that Western Australia would not stand in the way. to give up £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year.

They were brought to Australia subject to the condition that they would be returned to their island homes at the end of three years, and every coloured man to whom I spoke on the sugar plantations expressed the desire to be returned to his island. I do not include within this category the coloured men living in Rockhampton, who called upon the members of the parliamentary party, and asked that they might be permitted to remain. I do not think that any one anticipated when the Pacific Island Labourers' Bill was before Parliament that coloured citizens who had lived for thirty or thirty-five years in Australia would be deported under its provisions, and I fail to understand how these men could have been led to believe that they would be deported. But some persons are ready to make any statement in order to serve a party purpose. As an illustration of this, I may mention that a coloured man in Launceston, who earns his livelihood as a chimney sweep, was led to believe that he would be deported in a short time. He came to me shortly before I left Tasmania to attend the Parliament, to learn whether this statement was correct, and he informed me that he had a wife and a large family, w.hom the Government of the State or of the Commonwealth would have to maintain if he were deported. This case shows to what extremes some persons will go when they are anxious to arouse feeling against a party. I do not know that it is necessary for me to refer at greater length to the question of the sugar bounty, because a Bill relating to the subject will be submitted work together for the good of Australia.

After reading Canada as it Is, I feel that it would be well if we had in Australia a little more of the spirit that actushall hear no complaints of votes not havates the people of the Dominion. The Canadians will hear nothing said against their country, for with them Canada is everything that is good. realize the progress that Australia has made within a comparatively few years we have a right to be proud of our position. We have everything which nature can provide us with, and all we want is the true courage to go forward and develop our resources. There is one difficulty which stands in the way, and that is that some matters are managed by the Commonwealth, and others by the States. I trust, however, Mr Starrer. that we shall be enabled to work together for the good of the whole community, so that our resources may be more fully developed than they have been. I hope there are not many men who hold the same opinion of the people of Australia, and the members of its Parliament, as does the Treasurer of Tasmania, who was pleased in his Budget last week to refer to the representatives of that State in this House and in the Senate as not truly representing its interests. I do not take that statement to refer to me personally, for I am here, not of my own will, but because the electors sent me here, as they did every other representative of Tasmania. When the Treasurer of the State passes a reflection on its representatives here, he. passes a reflection on the wisdom of the electors. I am very sorry that he spoke as he did. I think that very great mistakes are made by States Treasurers in referring to the Commonwealth as they do, with reference to matters of expenditure. It was known by every one in Tasmania who cared to think that there would be a large expenditure in connection with the Commonwealth, and that the State would lose a large amount of revenue through Inter-State free-trade, as its people import largely from Sydney and Melbourne. For the Treasurer of the State to blame the Commonwealth for any loss of that kind, when the people who cared to listen to the other side of the question knew that such would happen, is, I think, altogether beside the mark. I trust that States Ministers, instead of saying anything which is likely to stir up strife between the States and the Federal Parliament, will always hope that the next Budget will be found to moneys which we may vote will be spent for the good of the various States, and that we ing been spent.

I am simply stating facts. I hope we have not got to that pitch in Parliament when the domination of a caucus shall rule, and when proper consideration! will not be paid to the wishes of those who desire to have a reasonable opportunity for debate. Here is ah important proposal, affecting the resignation from the Standing Orders Committee of an honourable member, who has been a member of this House for five years, and was previously a prominent. man in State politics [66] for twenty-five years. He has felt impelled to resign as a protest against what he regards as an unwarrantable and unreasonable interference with the rights of the members of this House. The members of the Labour Party ought to be the first to My only complaint see that a matter affecting the privileges of Parliament is reasonably debated. Yet they are trying to poke fun at any proposal of the kind now. They are amused at it.

I have sufficient confidence in the methods of the Opposition to rely on the matter being discussed at length. standing order will come before us. does not come before us, in what way is the honourable member aggrieved? interjection would tend to show that the Opposition are only anxious to get a grievance, or to be able to say that they are being deprived of their rights. ally, and not foi the Opposition. orable member for Gippsland has asked to be relieved of his attendance on the Committee, honourable members will consent to reserve the discussion of whatever principle is involved until the standing order is before us, and may be discussed in all its bearings. able member for Bland has rolled up with the House, until a Committee has reported, all his merry band of followers to endeavour to push through the House a certain proposal.

But a rather regrettable attempt has been made on the liberties of the House. An effort has been made to force through the Standing Orders Committee a certain proposal designed not in the interests of the House, but in Order to ease the Government in its control of the House-and certainly the control requires easing--by a means which I do not think reflects credit on its originator or the Government who supported it. It is a great pity that the Prime Minister does not see fit to consent to an adjournment, because the House, after honourable members have been travelling all night,, is certainly not in a state to calmly discuss a question affecting its liberties.. I That, do not know whether I shall be in order in referring to the causes which led to the resignation of the honourable member for Gippsland. The new standing order of which we have heard, would enable the business of the country to be carried on anywhere within the precincts of the House, and that is surely a proposal which we ought not to endorse. That, I take it, is the cause of the honourable member's resignation, and, therefore, I. assume I am in order in as briefly as possible going into the question.",71,Orders Committee I Do Not Wish The House To Pass I T I

Mr Speaker,"The position is thatany proceedings of a Committee; and, therefore, it is impossible that we can tonight, or at any time, until the Standing Orders Committee has reported, discuss any proceedings that it may have taken, or proposes to take. But I recognise all the difficulties of the case, because it is understood there are reasons, reotherwise provides, but until the Parliament, sulting from the work of the Committee, whyj the resignation was tendered, and why the assent of the House is sought to be obtained. question, I must rule, are open to discussion. The question may be fairly debated now as to whether the honourable member for Gippsland has, or has not, been fairly treated by the Standing Orders Committee Honourable members may discuss the reasons which led the honourable member to retirereasons which, I understand, he stated in the House as' sufficient. But as fo the wisdom or unwisdom of the proposed standing order, any matter bearing on its accepthave received fair consideration. The honance by the House or otherwise would present phases which could only be discussed when the Committee reports, and then only if the report contains the suggested standing order. I think that makes the position very clear. In order to keep myself within your ruling, I shall for the moment place myself in the position of the honourable member ^or Gippsland, when confronted with the proposal which members of the Government and their supporters in the Committee asked him to endorse. nothing to do with it. for Gippsland recognised that the proposal would, without any doubt, lead to a false system in our legislative methods-that it would lead to a system whereby honourable members could be said to be carrying out their legislative duties when-and I say this in no invidious sense-the y were in the bilvernment desired. liard-room or the refreshment-room upstairs. The honourable member for Gippsland naturally realized, in such circumstances, that this Chamber is the only proper arena for legislative effort. That is shown by the honourable member's resignation. honourable member has given evidence that he realizes that the right of the people to govern themselves, through their representaduty to his constituents, and probably, tives, demands that there shall always be a quorum in this Chamber to insure that every measure submitted to Parliament shall '[66]2 95 I receive consideration. In order that that right of the people might be properly safeguarded, it was actually provided in the Federal Constitution, in section 39, thatUntil the Parliament otherwise providesnot until the Standing Orders Committee which comprises not only this House, but both Houses of the Federal Legislature otherwise providesTherefore, those phases of the the presence of at least one-third of the whole number of members of the House of Representatives shall be necessary to constitute a meeting of the House for the exercise of its powers. That safeguard was definitely inserted in the Constitution in order to insure the fair discussion of all measures submitted to this Parliament. The people have decided that at least one-third of their representatives must be present in this Chamber before any measure under discussion can be said to orable member for Gippsland was obviously correct in taking the view that the proposal which he was asked to endorse is one which strikes at the very root of the principle underlying section 39 of the Constitution. A number of inroads have been made upon the representative character of our institutions, and it is all the more necessary that we should have no more of them. Honourable members do not appear to recognise their high duty to the people of Australia in the exercise of their representative position as members of this House. The honourable member for Bland, when this matter was last discussed, told the House that, at any .rate, he did not believe in such fair discussion as members of the Opposition were giving to all the contentious measures submitted . by the Government. The honourable gentleman laid down what he regarded as his duty in the matter. He said that he would be prepared to stay within the precincts of the Chamber, and to come in andmake a quorum whenever the Goto the state of the House.

I wish to know if anything which the honourable member for Bland proposes to do has anything to do with the motion before the House? ever to do with the motion. At the same time, the honourable member for Bland has spoken, and the honourable member for Wentworth is entitled to reply to any remarks made by the honourable member for Bland bearing on the question -ver^' simply, it is his duty as leader honourable member for Wentworth have been to something which the honourable member for Bland said on another occasion, and not to what that honourable gentleman said tonight. at the moment, and if the honourable member for Wentworth refers to such remarks, he is not in order. numerous interruptions to my speech took place, that the honourable member for Gippsland, confronted as he was with, such a proposal as that out of which the motion now before us has arisen,' necessarily recognised that the right of the people to have measures submitted to Parliament properly considered was in danger of being infringed. that in view of the apathy with which, during this session, the House has treated all public measures, the action taken by the honourable membei for Gippsland was the more necessary. I mentioned that the honourable member for Bland had distinctly stated in this Chamber that he regarded the honourable his public duty as no more than that of coming in and making a quorum for the Government whenever they desired. The question of the formation of a quorum is I s the honourable memat the root of the resignation of the honourable member for Gippsland, and as the honourable member for Bland has so much weight-no t in this Chamber, but within I am sure the honorits precinctsI take it that all that he put forward as to the duty of honourable mem bers in making a quorum will be relevant I withdraw it. to the debate.

If he will consent to an adjournment of the debate till tomorrow, and also promise to bring forward the motion relating to the new standing order, which has been the cause of all the trouble, in the immediate future, no difficulty will arise.

If he had mov6d that motion immediately after he had risen, I should have at once submitted it to the House. thing more at present, except to tell the Prime Minister that the action he has taken to-night will not conduce to the despatch of public business. I hope the Opposition will accept the challenge he has thrown out. that the Prime Minister has seen fit at this late stage of the evening to move a motion with regard to which honourable members of the Opposition feel very keenly, inasmuch as it seriously affects the privileges of honourable members. We all remember how quietly the Prime Minister gave notice of motion-so quietly that no honourable member could hear what he was saying. His conduct in that respect was quite in 'keeping resignation. with the way in which the proceedings of the Standing Orders Committee were carried out on a recent occasion, because so far as I can understand, no intimation? was given to members of the Committeethat ""an important matter was about n> be discussed. As the action taken by the Committee was considered by the honourable member for Gippsland to be of so much importance that he decided to send in his resignation, I should like to direct attention to the fact that, in section 39 of the Constitution it is provided thatUntil the Parliament otherwise provides, theof the members of the House of Representativesshall be necessary to constitute a meeting of the House for the exercise of its powers. able and learned member is now discussing; the merits of the proceedings of the Standof the resignation of the honourable member for Gippsland was the action taken by theStanding Orders Committee in recommending the adoption of a new star ding orderrelating to the quorum in this House. honourable and learned member's attention"" to the fact that if he succeeded in proving,, not only that the proceedings of the Standing Orders Committee were unconstitutional,, but that for many reasons, their recommendation was unworthy of being accepted by the House, neither of those pointswould touch the question of the resignation of the honourable member for GippslandThe fact of the'Standing Orders Committee having passed an unconstitutional standing order, or one entirely bad in principle, or injurious in practice, would not irr itself be sufficient to justify a resignation. Therefore, I cannot allow the honorable member to discuss the merits of the proceedings of the Standing Orders Committee. thing very serious must have happened in the Committee to induce the honorable member for Gippsland to take such decided 1 action. signation. that, because it would be ungracious on thepart of the House. refusing to accept the resignation of the honorable member for Gippsland if he de-",75,Orders Committee I Do Not Wish The House To Pass I T I

I told him that if he were willing I would bring it on later in the evening, after the Budget debate had been disposed of. At my request he consented to this being done. I had to act against my own will in moving that his resignation be accepted, and submitted the motion at a time to which he agreed.

I then asked him when he was going to setthe matter down for discussion. He said he did not know., but perhaps it would be for Tuesday or some other day. He knows nothing. If honourable members expect that we on this side are to be treated as so many automata, to be moved hither and thither at the behest of the leader of the Government, I venture to say that he entirely misconceives his position. If he wishes to get business through the House he had better observe the rule which has always obtained here of treating the Opposition as they ought to be treated-by letting theiri know what he proposes to do, and not by treating them as if they were a set of fools, and it did not matter to him whether he spoke to them on any subject or not. That is what I complain of in. his treatment of honourable members. Do what we will, he will not tell us anything about the business which is to come on.
