Prime Minister will remember that he promised to have independent inquiries made. Can he say what has been the result of. those inquiries ? promise to the letter. Every investigation has been made, discoveries have revealed information qualifying the charges made by the honourable meniber. The matter is now finally in the hands of the Attorney-General, and the honourable meniber for Bourke may rest assured that the report and the facts will be brought to the House as soon as the investigations are completed. honourable meniber will find that they will qualify, to a great degree, the statements which he has made. new regulation issued under the Public ServiceA ct and relating to promotions during the war, will the Prime Minister ascertain whether the rights of persons, such as mechanics, who have qualified for positions by examination, and whose rights to appointments may expire by effluxion of time before the war is over, will be conserved ? ber has raised a point worthy of consideration. The policy in this regard is that those who, before they enlisted, were equally qualified with others remaining behind should not be at a disadvantage with respect to tlieir absence on such war service. enlisted and those who remain behind will neither gain nor lose their comparative status, so far as it existed before the war. of Trade and Customs noticed that the Victorian Minister of Agriculture still claims the power to prevent the export of meat? Has the Commonwealth abrogated its constitutional right to control all imports and exports? has not abrogated its power to control imports and exports. F u ll power in that matter rests with tlie Commonwealth; and if the Commonwealth had not proThe hibited the export of meat before the State Government took action their action would have been of no effect.

The statement has been made as brief as possible. of the House that the Attorney-General have leave to make a statement? Those who have Leave granted. I made a statement dealing with the base metal industrj in the press, in the course of which I saidThe agencies tlirough which the metallic products of Australia find their way to British and other markets of the world arc still dominated mainly by German influence. I know this to be a very serious allegation to make, but it is absolutely true. Names have been changed, English names have taken the place of German names, but the German influence remains. It would be folly to assume that this influence has been exercised for the benefit of Great Britain",9,Rabaul Courts Martial

14,Mr Hughes,"On 10th July instantI then went on to deal with the attitude of t h e m in in g companies towards t h e i r contracts w it h the enemy. Not one contract has been filed. This fact speaks for itself. It may lie that there is room for doubt as to the validity of the Act. I do not for one moment admit that it is so. Surelyi t is not asking too much of the great companies of Australia that in this life-and-death struggle some risk and make some sacrifice. calls aloud for munitions. Our metallic products are essential for tlie production of munitions, yet it is still trne, as it was before the war, that the metal market is dominated by our mortal enemies; that tliey control the selling agencies, manipulate the market, and thus bleed Great Britain and the Allies of money, and so strike a blow right at her heart. Patriotism and common prudence alike, suggest nt this juncture the wisdom of controlling those metals upon which, indeed, success in the great war must depend. I quite realized that this statement contained grave charges against certain persons, but, in my opinion, tliey were absolutely warranted by the facts. Some effort has been made to confuse the minds of the public by stating that tliese charges meant that the metals were finding their way to the enemy. Millen is reported to have said so in Saturday's press. No such deduction can be drawn from my statement,. which is clear and unambiguous. ment of the Commonwealth is now and has been determined since its accession to oflice not to allow goods of any sort or kind to reach the enemy. My charge was not that the metals were reaching the enemy, for that would be a charge against the Government of which I am a member, but that the channels through which Australian metallic products found their way to British and neutral markets were still dominated by German influence, and that Britain and the Allies were being bled of millions of money in order to secure the necessary munitions. That was the charge. It is a most serious one, and attempts to evade it by confusing the minds of the public canuot be allowed. Since my statement was made on 10th July instant, great concern has been exhibited by some of the mining companies. They have always assured me that they were prepared to sever their contracts with enemy agents. Some have now in dicated that they are going to do so. Several contracts have been filed for annulment under the Enemy ContractA n nulment Act. All this is satisfactory as far as it goes. But I must remind the Australian public I said that the consequences of the refusal to do so long ago are irreparable. The war has now been raging for nearly twelve months, and it has been a war of finance as well as of armsa war of munitions, in whicli lead, zinc, and copper were eswitli Germany they will take sential to victory: Great Britain has Britain been and is compelled to pay prices for lead, zinc, and copper very greatly in excess of those which the enemy were payiug, and this is largely due to the fact that the Australian metallic products were marketed through agencies 1 dominated by German influence. In this way Britain has been and is being bled of millions during the war, while the great: German metal firms' accumulated share of these profits arising out of these high prices, and renewed control of the metal industry after the war, are assured. W ill any one say for a moment that this conduct is one compatible with true patriotism ? This is a war of resourcesof money. If Germany can buy spelter, as she can, for £ 3 0 per ton, wliile Great Senator ""Britain has to pay £100, and if , without zinc, lead, and copper, we cannot make munitions, the handicap upon us is too heavy; victory is almost impossible. But The Governeven the victory would be a barren one if the industry were to f a l l back into German hands after tlie war. In order to avoid this, two things are essential: That British and Allied Governments or firms should control metal during the.war. and that British and Allied influences should control the industry after the war. In order to insure this latter it is essential that all enemy influence should be stamped out and that British firms should be assured regular and continuous supplies. These conditions do not now exist. It may be said-it will be said-thaf c fche statement that German influence has dominated the Australian metal market during the war is nofc true. It is true, and I propose to givefcheHouse some facts to prove it . The whole of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company's output of pig-lead"" sold in Britain was handled, up to 30th June last, by H . R. Merton and Companythe London house of Mertons of Frankfort--in other Words, Metallgesellschaft. Most of the argentiferous lead and lead bullion produced and exported from Australia is desilvered and refined by Enthoven and Company. This is another company trading in Great Britaini n which Mertons are interested. British Government has appointed supervisors over both these firms-a fact ""which speaks for itself. Numerous offers by ""English firms who are anxious and eager to get r i d of the German influence in the lead market, to purchase the whole of the Commonwealth's output of lead, have been received from time to time. But they have not been accepted. As a result of very strong pressure by the Pederal Government, the Lead Convention was dissolved on 30th June last, as far as Australian lead was concerned. The Lead Convention was dominated by German influence, and it fixed prices and controlled the market. English buyers, through British agents, were led to believe that after its dissolution they had a clear field, but this is not the case. For offers submitted by bond fide British agents during this month were not accepted. On Saturday an offer was made on behalf of the board of the Associated Smelters of their lead output to the British Government. This offer was submitted to the Federal Government, which immediately cabled its approval to the Imperial authorities. But this offer is not enough. It is just as patriotic to supply genuine British manufacturers who require metal for munitions of war as to supply the War Office itself. And , further, so far as the future is concerned, it is to the Britisli manufacturer that we must look to take our products after the war. The war will pass, but the industry will remain, and it is necessary that permanent customers for our products should be secured, and that, in order that these can be secured, they must have an assurance that supplies will be available after the war as well as during its progress. Owing to the costly nature of the distillin g process, the disposal of zinc concentrates is a difficult problem. But it must be solved, and without delay. Limited quantities of concentrates have been despatched to the small distilleries in England, and some parcels have been forwarded to Hollandf o r treatment only, the metal itself being returned to England. Eecently a parcel 'has been sent to the Vieille Montagne, in France. Cargoes to American distilleries are to be the United States. Mr Hughes. registered as American, but there is a The considerable amount of German capital invested in some of them, and German influence is very considerable in many other cases. It is most difficult to learn the true position as to how far this in fluence goes. There is no doubt that it is very far-reaching. From the information at our disposal it appears that, at any rate, the Bartlesville Zinc Company is largely controlled by Mertons, of F r a n k for t ; the National Zinc Company, by Beer Sondheimer and Company, F r a n k for t ; the American Zinc, Lead, and Silver Company, by Aaron Hirsch and Company; while among the shareholders of the Minerals Separation American Syndicate are Beer Sondheimer and Company, Aaron Hirsch and Company, and Metallgesellschaft. A t the present time nearly all metallic zinc used by Great Britain comes from America, and the prices are about 400 per cent, liigher than pre-war prices. Prior to the war Germany (Silesia), Belgium, and Northern France, and the United States were the world's greatest producers of metallic zinc, and although Australia is the second largest producer of zinc minerals in the world, only 5,000 tons annually of metallic zinc are distilled within the Commonwealth. Great Britain under normal conditions consumes 180,000 tons 1 annually of metallic zinc, but distills less than 30,000 tons, hence she is dependent on imports for the major portion of her home requirements. To instal plant in Great Britain to treat any considerable portion of Australia's zinc concentrates will occupy at least eighteen months to two years, and a longer period would be occupied if the plant were erected in Australia. Had the contracts providing for the sale of zinc concentrates through enemy agents heen annulled at the outbreak of war, ancl a regular and continuous supply of zinc concentrates during the war and subsequent thereto heen guaranteed to British buyers, British enterprise oould have grappled w i th the position, and distilleries would have been now nearly completed. But this was not done. The result is that the spelter market is "" cornered"" in America; there is a dearth of the metal; famine prices rule, and Ausconsigned to several works in tralia is unable to market the zinc conThe companies are centrates, of which 400,000 tons per annum are produced, containing 180,000 tons of metallic zinc. Britain is paying £105 a ton for a product that her enemy can get for £29, while the Australian producer is no better off than before the war, for he does not share in the high price of spelter. So much for zinc. Let me now deal with copper. This terrible war has been raging nearly twelve months. The position of the metal industry has been set out again and again with great emphasis. The ramifications of. German influence, and the power of Merton's and thc Metallgesellschaft have been made clear to all save those who will not heed. Yet one of the largest companies producing copper in Australia to-day is selling its output through Merton's and Smith's. Merton's is the very fountain-head of the German metal domination, while the latter, prior to the war. were one of the London agents of Aaron Hirsch and Sohn. Twelve months of war has raged between Germany and Britain, but Francis IF. Snow is still-o r was a few days ago -thei r solo purchasing agent. Hirsch and Sohn still owns one-third of the total shares in their refining company. For many months the Government have endeavoured, by every means at their disposal, to persuade this company to cut itself free from all these enemy influences. The Oommonwealth Government have offered it substantial inducements to establish the manufacture of copper goods in Australia, only asking in return that it should free itself from all enemy domination or connection, but they have failed. The company has been fertile of excuses and explanations for its failure to comply with our reasonable and proner requests. Since my recent statement it has been roused to protest and some semblance of aotion. Nevertheless, the position remains as I have said. Yesterday, the crowning point in this display of patriotic ineptitude-to use no stronger term-wa s reached. I am indeed at a loss to find words to express my opinion of those responsible for it. But I give the facts, that honourable members may judge for themselves. About a fortnight ago the Australian Metal Company, the agent in Melbourne of the Metallgesellschaft and Merton's, was declared an enemy firm, and so forbidden to trade at all. A few days earlier I had taken such steps as made it obvious to the company that the Government would use whatever remedies were at their disposal to comnel it to put an end to all German influence here, and that, in consequence, its arrangements with Smith's, of London, must terminate. The German metal group had thus lost the services of their agents here, and were certain to be similarly treated in London, and it became necessary, if German interests were not to be sacrificed, to secure other agents. These, of course, could not be German, as -no German firm is permitted to trade at all. It thus became necessary to obtain an Australian firm to act as the agent of the great German Metal Combine during a war in which Britain and Germany were locked in death grips, and the control of metals, by Britain was essential to victory. This has uot been found impossible. An Australian firm has made application, and yesterday, in set form, applied to me for permission to act as sole agent in Australia for H . B. Mertons, the firm lately represented in Australia by the Aaron Australian Metal Company-the agent of the Metallgesellschaft-for the purchase of copper, zinc, lead, and other metals. 1 shaJl add nothing to this except to say that the two directors of this firm are also directors of the mining company above referred to. I place these facts before the House and the country. They speak for themselves. They demand action, and the Government have decided to act. Our powers are limited to the control of the metallic products at this end. We cannot deal with them after they leave Australia, but we can do something towards destroying German control over our products here and elsewhere. And this we shall do. It is proposed to create an Australian metal exchange under Government control. No metals or metallic products will be allowed to leave Australia unless they are sold in Australia under the rules and regulations drawn up. No persons will be allowed to buy unless they are registered members of the metal exchange. No persons will be registered unless the Government is satisfied that their application is bond fide and the applicants pro-British. ask the Attorney-General the question I put to. him earlier.

It isA BILL FOR AN ACT To authorize the Raising and Expending of the sum of Twenty million pounds for War purposes. B Majesty, the Senate, and the House of Representatives of the Commonwealtli -of Australia, as follows :1. This Act may be cited as the War Loan Act (No. 1) 1915. 2. The Treasurer may from time to time, under the provisions of the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911-1915 or under the provisions of any Act authorizing the issue of Treasury Bills, borrow moneys not exceeding in the whole the amount of Twenty million pounds. 3. The amount borrowed shall be issued and applied only for the expenses of borrowing and for War purposes. A year ago, when most people were dreaming of universal peace, Germany fell upon Belgium, with which nation it had no quarrel, and crushed it with the might of its armed forces. This involved Europe and the world in the greatest war in history. Belgium's aid, and Australians rushed to the colours before they were called. Since then there has been no looking back, nor can there be u n t i l the day our brave soldiers and sailors return witl i victory and the assurance of a lasting peace. It is to hasten that day that I present this B ill , and ask for it a speedy passage.

It should be made clear at the outset that the whole cost of our Naval and Military Forces within and without Australia is borne by the Government of the Commonwealth. I think that that statement is necessary, because many people are of the opinion that the British Government pays our Forces when they are overseas, and quite a number of them think that the States contribute proportionately to the cost of the recruits raised within their borders. As a matter of fact, however, the Government of the Commonwealth alone is reGreat Britain sprang to sponsible for the whole cost of equipping and maintaining the Australian troops, that are engaged overseas or are in training in Australia.

57,Mr Fisher,"to take immediate steps to appeal to the people of Australia to provide the Commonwealth with a loan of £20,000,000, to be used for war purposes only. The people of Australia have conducted themselves with admirable courage in most dimcult and trying circumstances, and we feel that they will rise to the occasion now when so much is required from them. A t this stage I embrace the opportunity to reply to some of the criticism of friends and opponents. I understand that the States would have preferred the Commonwealth Government to have consulted them more in this matter, but time was the essence of this legislation. We could not, under the circumstances, go upon the Australian, or any other, market at the present time to raise money for any purposes except the war, and the States,as States, could not be helped by any discussion whatever in regard to any money that could be raised now. Therefore, we had to take occasion by the hand and accept the best advice available to deal with this matter as one of urgency, and to communicate that fact to the States. I wish to assure all of the States, and every Australian citizen, that in this matter tliere has been no tinge of political feelvernment paid a higher rate of interest ing or any desire on the part of the Commonwealth Government to obtain an advantage. patriotic and urgent, task before us, and we have set ourselves to carry it out to the best of our ability and with the greatest expedition. It has been well pointed out that the Australian people are at their best when dealing with a big problem. Their soldier sons have borne themselves with unflinching bravery in face of unparalleled dangers, and have won the admiration of the world. The Government feel that such a people will not fall short of their expectations; that they will respond to the call of duty, and that they will gladly provide the sinews of war, which are essential to our success in this great struggle. The Government have availed themselves of the best advice obtainable. I desire to thank the representatives of large financial interests in Australia who readily responded to the invitation to confer with Ministers in regard to the flotation of a Commonwealth war loan. While Ministers had full confidence in their official advisers and in the ability of the people to raise large amounts of money for war purposes, their position has been strengthened by the conferences that have taken place, affording a ful l discussion of all phases of the financial situation, the present position, and the future prospects of the country. The banks have generously agreed to charge neither commission nor exchange in connection with subscriptions to the loan. It is intended to raise an amount of £20,000,000 for war purposes only, at A\ per cent., issued at par. It will not 'be underwritten. The term of the loan will be ten years, and the loan will be issued in instalments. The first instalment will be of £5,000,000, subscription lists for which will close on 31st August next. The amount asked for in the first instalment is £5,000,000, but the full amount subscribed will be accepted. Interest will be payable halfyearly. Perhaps the question may arise in Committee as to whether the Government should have given subscribers a guarantee, as was done in connection with the last Imperial loan, that if the Gofor a subsequent loan, or if this stock were at a discount and another loan were We had a desperate, but raised later, the subscribers to this loan would be given stock in the new loan in exchange for their stock at par. That matter was considered in all its phases, and I am glad to say that the advice offered by outside authorities coincided witli the views of the Government that such an undertaking was unnecessary. The general opinion is that this loan will be successfully floated in Australia, without a serious disturbance of the money market if it is floated in four parts of £5,000,000 each; but, as I pointed out earlier, if the amount subscribed on the ""first issue exceeds £5,000,000 and I should not be surprised if we got £10,000,000 the amount so subscribed will be retained as though we had asked for it . It is the opinion of experts that if we were to make the same offer as was made by Great Britain, it would have prevented, rather than have assisted, the success of our loan. Interest is to be paid halfyearly, the first payment being due on the 15th December next. should be a considerable inducement. The amount that this earlier payment will add to the interest on the loan is practically nominal, and the advantages to be derived will override any little disadvantages. £20,000,000 is subscribed, will the f u l l amount be accepted ? to bring in a further B ill . The Government would be very happy, with the consent of the subscribers, to hold the surplus pending the passage of the necessary legislation. Government are prepared to take an unlimited amount? take any surplus subscribed; but I do nofc look for a subscription of £20,000,000 at the present time-in fact, it would not be an advantage to have that amount subscribed at the first issue; we shall do well if we get £10,000,000. By December next we hope to be in tlie position of -having a record grain harvest, and'if the crop can be transported to the markets -of the world, the money available ior the next issue of £5,000,000 should be comparatively easily got. Another important factor to be considered is the fact that more than three-fourths of our expenditure for war purposes is made in Australia, so that the question of exchange .oversea does not arise to as great -an extent as many people believe. It is to the credit of Australia that, owing to -our having the necessary factories, we -can carry out the equipment of our troops to a very large extent. We have -also the advantage that our people who are fighting our battles overseas are leaving behind them for their wives, families, -and relatives a considerable portion of their pay. The disabilities, therefore, are not nearly so great now as they would have been a few years ago in the matter of equipping forces to fight overseas. The stock will be inscribed in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Inscribed Act 1911-15, and -the inscription books of the loan w ill be kept at the Commonwealth Treasury at the Seat of Government, where all transfers of stock will be made. This is considered necessary, because there may be This fact a single subscription running into hundreds of thousands of pounds. The loan may be taken up in the shape of inscribed stock or Treasury bonds, and, at the option of tlie holder, one form of security may be exchanged at any time for the other. If more than Thus, a person who has taken up in scribed stock may have it converted into bonds which, being documents made payI t would be necessary able to bearer, can be more easily negotiated> and are really personal security that may be used in any way whatsoever commercially. The minimum for in scribed stock will be £ 1 0 0 , and the smallest bond will be for £ 1 0 . The honI n other words, the orable, member for Melbourne Ports has suggested that the bonds might be of a lower denomination than £ 1 0 , b u t the honourable member will see that the prospectus is only for the first portion of the loan. If the £ 1 0 bond proves a success, it will be an inducement to provide for the issue of bonds at, say, £ 5 in the next prospectus. I have made a suggestion to the oflicers in the Treasury, which will be communicated to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank on his return from Tasmania, with reference to bonds which may be taken up by people working in the country, or people who have not places of security in which to keep them. My suggestion was that arrangements might be made so that these bonds could be held by the Treasury and by the Commonwealth Bank for their owners at nominal fees or free of cost. The difficulty in regard to documents payable to bearer is to recover them once they are lost; and if , through our Commonwealth agencies-which , I am glad to say, are always increasing in number-w e are able to provide for safeguarding these bonds, there will be mutual advantage to bhe nation and to the people who purchase them. the bonds an additional attraction to country people. ' Mr' FISHER I am rather proud of the idea, because i u my earlier days I remember that even in the case of mining scrip, which gives more security, there was always trouble to know where to p u t it or to make it secure. If this arrangement can be carried out, the small man as well as the large man will be equally secure. I am glad to be able to say that the Attorney-General has",18,Warloanbill No 1 Second Reading

If we rise to the occasion, we shall probably make a name for ourselves in the world's history that those who come after us w ill never regret.

In the first place, I should like to say that we are proceeding in this matter in a way in which people do not proceed in countries where they have much larger obligations to face, and where they are really carrying the whole brunt of the financial consequences of the war. LoanB ill placed before the Chamber as a segregated b it of our finance. We are told nothing whatever about our general ways and means; and it does appear to me that we are putting the cart before the horse. What we require is a statement of the outgoings for the next twelve months in relation to the whole oost of government, including the war and everything else. When we had that general statement of our finances before us, showing the outlook for the year, both as to income and expenditure, and more especially with regard to expenditure, then, and then only, I submit, would be the time to bring forward proposals in [188] aid of the general revenue to meet the totality of the obligations of the Government.. Instead of that, we have only a partial financing of the immediate obligation arising out of the war. It is proposed to raise £20,000,000 to meet an estimated outgoing of £40,000,000 on account of the war expenses alone. account. other £20,000,000. to be made up ? W h a t is contemplated in regard to the residue which we are told will be required before the financial year closes? As to the sum of £40,000,000, may I say that I welcome the statement that so large a sum is to be expended on the war? Why do I welcome the largeness of the sum ? It is because it indicates to me that at last the country has awakened to the necessity of sending an adequate army overseas-the necessity to maintain 100,000 -men at the front . I cannot but congratulate the country on a statement of the kind, and I am glad to have this expression of the Government's determination. A t last we have a definite objective to work to in .connection with I have listened to the statement the wjar. WhyI wanted tliat definite objective to be stated in clear terms as a binding intention on our part many months ago was not because I felt it could be done at once, not because I fel t that we could raise an army of 100,000 men by stamping on the ground, as some one has said, but because to put such an army at the f r o n t would require a reconstruction and expansion of our military organization. Had we begun with a definite objective like that many months ago, we should have been in a WhatI mean is that we have this much better position to-day. However, we have now come to the conclusion that we must have this army in the field, and I suppose our organization will be expanded with a view to placing that army there, now that the recruits are flowing in more freely. All this, of course, requires a tremendous military expenditure, estimated,, as the Prime Minister said, at £40,000,000 for the year. That seems a large sum, and yet really it is a very small one. While the Prime Minister was speaking I figured out that our total outgoing for the year of £40,000,000 represents about one twenty-seventh part of the outgoing of the United Kingdom for the same period.

I remember distinctly, at the I suppose the outbreak of the war, one of the foremost financial authorities in Australia telling me, with complete confidence, that he d i d not think Germany could last more than three months-that she would be financially bankrupt by then. That was said by a man whose opinion to-day is entitled to the fullest confidence and respect; and yet he evidently misjudged the whole financial situation. When Germany is spoken of in this connection, one salient fact in connection w i th German finance should not be forgotten. A t the outbreak of the w a r Germany not only issued notes, but she fixed the price of everything that these notes could buy, and in that respect may have been able to maintain an I am afraid I must agree internal parity. I know there will be trouble later; but the mere cutting off of occasions for exchange, outside Germany, has had the effect of relieving Germany's internal finances. Therefore, we should not. underrate the capacity of German finance. Germany can travel a long way yet, although I hope she w ill not have to go much further before she is beaten thoroughly and p u t into her proper place.. As I understand it , the loan the Government now ask for is imperative. We have been told by the I m p e r i al Government that, for the immediate future^ we must look to our own resources.

We have now to look to our own resources, and, in my judgment, we are quite able to do so. It is difficult to get accurate figures, but it does not appear to me that a £20,000,000 loan is a tremendous difficulty, when we consider that our annual production reaches a value of £230,000,000, and that we already have in the Savings Banks-Fede ral and State-deposit s amounting to £95,000,000. to disturb that. gest that it should be disturbed; but it -an go to maintain the national credit when loan money is wanted for war purposes. hold £170,000,000. money is out earning interest,'as it should be, but both sums form a reserve of credit which may be drawn upon for war purposes in the last resort. current accounts? think these figures establish the soundness and solvency of our position as a nation, and, therefore, a loan of £20,000,000 ought not to make any serious inroad either into our real resources OT into the money we need for ordinary purposes.

In other countries they believe in making the reserve two-thirds of the issue, and more if possible. orable member suggest that gold is the only security for the Commonwealth note issue? the pressure of the war is over, the Prime Minister may be required to redeem many million pounds worth of notes. To-day about £34,000,000 worth of notes have been issued, but for ordinary purposes a circulation of not more than £10,000,000 or £.12.000,000 is required, and when the war is over the balance will have to be redeemed. I am afraid that those who are supporting the Prime Minister will then see that there has been a kind of borrowing after all, and it seems to me that he will have to borrow to get gold with which to redeem his surplus notes. However, we need not worry much about that now. I should like to look for a moment at the general financial situation. The proposed loan is only for the financing of the war, and has no relation to our incoming and outgoing for the ordinary purposes of government. Minister very astutely, and very wisely, confined himself strictly to war questions connected with the proposed loan. He proposes to borrow £20,000,000, but he has not told how he will make good the other £20,000,000 which he will need to cover the war expenditure of the year. He has said that he intends to impose further taxation. If this loan were all that Australia had to make provision for, we could arrange for it without any trouble. It will mean an interest charge of less than £1,000,000 a year, and I do not think that any one would say that Australia could not find that amount in addition to her ordinary expenditure. But on top of the war there ia the trouble caused by the drought, and the burden of the direct taxation for ordinary purposes. We often imagine that Australia is a very lightly-taxed country, but when I compare it with other countries, I am not so sure that she is. We are now threatened with more direct taxation, and I do not suppose that any of us will cavil at it if it is seen to be necessary and is imposed equitably and put on a proper basis. We must stand up to the war, whatever the consequences may be; we have to see it through. If we cannot borrow, we must pay further taxation, and we are. concerned only with the discussion of the best and most equitable methods of raising the money that is needed. Taxation for war purposes ought to be placed fairly and justly on the back of every man in the community, no matter how high or how low his position, financially or otherwise. In the imposition of a war tax, above all other taxation, we should do substantial justice, and every man should be made to stand under the burden to the extent of his ability to bear it. Australia who desires to .be treated as a pauper. so. A wa r tax is the one tax to which every one will willingly subscribe, if you get it into the heads of the people that they are being dealt with fairly and squarely. The other day we were told of the gigantic burden of taxation that the wealthy people of Great Britain have to bear. The income taxation and super-taxation of one kind and another imposed in Great Britain will produce this year about £103,000,000. A proportionate contribuThe Prime tion by the people of Australia would be a little over £11,000,000, but I find that for the ordinary purposes of government .we pay almost this amount in taxation now. According to Mr Knibbs, the revenue raised by the States from direct taxation in the year 1913-14 was: Erom probate duties, £1,345,529; from stamp duties, £1,122,929; from land tax duties, £56S,S04; from income and dividend taxes, £2,869,005, making a total of £5,906,267. Since then the Premier of New South Wales has levied an additional £1,000,000 from direct taxation, and the Premiers of Western Australia and Tasmania have also increased the direct taxation of their States, so tliat it is safe to say that the State direct taxation now amounts to over £7,000,000 per annum. In addition, £3,000,000 is obtained from the Commonwealth probate and land taxation, and therefore, for the ordinary purposes of their Governments, the people of Australia contribute altogether over £10,000,000 from direct taxation, whioh.",25,William Irvine Bu T Will It Be

That is when a financial statement will have to be made. trust that the Government will endeavour to impose its war taxation fairly and equitably on all classes if they must do so. meniber object to exemptions? just at bhe moment what I would propose; but if the statements of Mr Knibbs are anything like accurate, the wealth of Australia is about £1,725,000,000. Assumingi t to be only £1,000,000,000, a general wealth tax of 1 per cent, on wealth would produce £10,000,000 a year for war purposes. I am not suggesting this taxation; I am merely thinking aloud, in the-endeavour to elucidate the general problem of direct taxation. I have always been in favour of a general wealth tax, but I know how difficult it is to collect it . I should prefer to see the Commonwealth confine itself to a general wealth tax rather than see our direct taxation as at present. The more you impose income taxation the more tlie anomalies you create. income tax must bear unequally upon the citizens of Australia, because they are treated differently in different States. For instance, in New South Wales a super-tax has to be paid in addition to the ordinary income tax, and the Victorian citizen pays much less income tax than is paid by the citizen of New South Wales. The scale and tlie range of the direct taxation of tlie States are so ereat that any uniform additions of direct taxation must create more anomalies than they cure. member in his mind the taxation of all wealth ? enough of the factors to say now precisely what I would suggest. One can only take rough, broad figures. 1,000,000 people possessing wealth in f u r niture, & c , to a considerable amount, but that form of wealth cannot be taxed. orable member is quite right, and many things perhaps would require to be excluded fro m even a straight-out wealth tax. However, the point I am making is 1 that I hope that whatever taxation is proposed, the obligations placed upon us by ' the war will not be laid upon a few We shall soon begin. shoulders; nor do I think we should be asked to shoulder the whole of the obligations in a few years. We are fighting to preserve this country for those who will come after us, and they have a righ t to take a share of the burden. That is all I am suggesting, and if honourable the burden be extended reasonably and equitably over the range of those whowill gain the benefit from the fighting we are doing to-day, we will have approximated to justice as nearly as possible. loans is £ per cent. fund to apply to this loan ?

148,Mr Fisher,"Does the right honourable-the whole burden of taxation both by the States and the Commonwealth, and adjust our taxation as far as possible so as not to increase unfairly the total burden they w ill have to bear. I have already said that war loans deplete the national stock, because we have no assets for them. In .addition to that, 100,000 men have been withdrawn from production; therefore, while immensely, our income must be decreasing because of the number of men who -are withdrawn from production. I read a statement that in Europe this year there will be 2,000,000 less men engaged in the primary industries than were engaged last year. That fact must make a tremendous difference both in the value -of commodities and in the wealth of the various countries that have to support those workers in their unproductive labours. There is less production, therefore, with correspondingly increasing obligations-les s income and larger outgoings. These facts point . w i th warning -finger to a duty that is obvious and imperative. First of all, we should t r y to increase our production by every and any means, and we are fortunate in this respect, inasmuch as while, the enemy is losing trade, we need not lose any. We. can pick up the trade which the -enemy has lost, and many opportunities for doing so are presenting themselves. Thanks to the British Fleet, the seas are -open, and I hope they may continue so until in the end victory crowns our efforts. endeavour to increase our production. We should t r y to reduce our outgoing in a reasonable way. There is a duty, which is being stressed by various newspapers, and properly stressed, that there shall be individual economy as well as national economy. There are plenty of luxuries of which we could r i d ourselves, and be the better for their loss. When America was passing through a financial crisis, some years ago, and was letting out some of the wind and water which had brought her to a stand-still, a great many of her people suffered, and I remember reading a, statement that the doctors were complaining that their occupations were £one. Simple living on the part of the -people had abolished the doctors' bills, and I 'am not sure that we could not deny ourselves in these times in many personal ways. day. not for me. That is good enough for the K in g, no doubt, but I shall not follow him in that respect. There are many ways in which we could make our meals simpler, and lop off a great many of the extras and luxuries in which we our outgoing is increasing are still indulging, notwithstanding the continuance of this world tragedy.. We should also save nationally as far as we possibly can. Before the Government impose fresh taxation and borrow these huge and towering sums for war purposes, they are under the necessity of undertaking a rigid and stern review of every shilling of our expenditure.. I hope the Government will betake themselves to that unpleasant but imperative duty, shear down our expenditures wherever it is possible to do so, and save by other means also. does not mean retrenchment on reproductive works ? might be a stricter inquiry than there is ordinarily as to what are reproductive works. In any case, the test ought to be, not whether a work standing by itself is reproductive, not whether it would be advantageous to carry it through, and not whether we should all like the work done, but whether it is absolutely necessary. That is the test we should apply to all proposals for additional expenditure at the present time, and I believe But we should do more than that while the war lasts we can shear immense sums of money from our ordinary outgoings in that respect alone. In other words, waste at the present time is nothing more nor less than wicked profligacy. As to the loan itself, the interest to be paid is 4£ per cent. Whether that is enough to maintain the loan at par remains to be seen. I think we are very fortunate in being able to float war loans as we are doing in the present circumstances. This rate of 4^ per cent, is the rate being paid in the Old Country and in France. Leti t be remembered that our standards of value are a great deal higher than those of France or the United Kingdom, and yet we are raising money at the same rates as those countries are paying.

It is a great thing to be able to start off our borrowing in this way, upon a basis which is so advantageous to us, compared with the rest of the world. It was said when we initiated Federation that the Commonwealth would get better credit than the States. Whether that be so or not, we shall not quarrel with the credit of the Commonwealth to-day if this loan be a success, having regard to the fact that we shall be getting the money for the same purposes as the Imperial Government are raising their loans, and at the same rate as is being paid in England and in France. In this respect we are more fortunate than a great country like Russia, whose last loan was floated at 5^ per cent, with a currency of a few yearsI think until 1921. After that year the rate of interest will be 5 per cent., or the subscribers will have the option'of redeeming the loan and taking the money again in 1920. It seems to me, therefore, that we may congratulate ourselves on the price we are proposing to pay for this money, although I notice that, in addition to the 4-iper cent., we are making the subscribers a present of accrued interest for about ten weeks for this half-year. more. difference be, if we can get this loan floated at 4^ per cent., and maintain parity, we shall have done a good stroke of business for Australia.

Above all, I hope that in this war we shall not impose anything in the shape of further taxation which will have the resemblance of punishing success, or be anything in the nature of penal taxation. If we avoid doing this, no one can complain. The task is not an easy one, but the obligation rests with the Government. I hope, also, that posterity will take its fair share of this war obligation. of sacrifice is that if one person is earning £10 a day, and another person is earning £ 1 a day, both should give a day's pay. the right honourable gentleman applies such a rule-of-thumb principle, he will find many other factors tending to make inequality of sacrifice.

I close my remarks with these observations: strenuous days-w e are already in the midst of them-bese t with difficulties on every hand, and the only thing for us to do is to push through them with as much energy and determination as it is possible for us to display. The sooner the war is ended the better for us financially, as well as in every other respect. Therefore, I welcome this large expenditure; I could wish it were larger if it would indicate that even more men were proceeding to the seat of war. Men and munitions are needed to end the war, requiring the expenditure of a tremendous amount of money; and the more we spend-alway s supposing it to be spent wisely and economically-the more efficiency we shall have, and the more efficiency we have the sooner this war wil l be over. already said that not to fight through, and to conclude the matter prematurely would be but perpetuating the tragedy we now have. There is no need for fear. We have only to call upon the resolute determination of this great country, and if these burdens are laid equitably on the people, they will respond to a man. As for the future, we can trust to the initiative of our people, and the resources, as well as the other vested interests and sentiments of the great land in which we are pleased to dwell. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [5.40] The Prime Minister, in the course of his remarks in introducing the B ill , stated thatWe were performing a desperate but patriotic task, and it was the duty of the Government to set out to fulfil it with the utmost expedition. Apparently, the right honourable gentleman had weighed these words well, because he fortified himself with a prepared document from which he quoted them. The Leader of the Opposition, in the concluding remarks of his speech, said thatThese were desperate days, and we were beset with difficulties on every hand. Another remark made by the PrimeM i nister during the course of his speech wasThe Australian people are at their best in dealing with big problems. This Parliament has been in session since October last witli a brief adjournment, but we have had no complete statement, of our financial position, or as to how we are. to meet it either immediately or iii the future. We are entering on On the 14th October last, wheu the subject of the grant of £100,000 to Belgium was"" before this Chamber, I voted against the proposal, on the distinct and specific ground that we had had no statement of our financial position; not because I was lacking in sympathy w i th the urgent conditions of the Belgian people, but. because even then I considered that we should have had a free and f r a n k discussion, possessed of every information in the hands of the Government, and that this Parliament should even then set about making the financial arrangements which every one must have seen would have to be made to meet the crisis bound to arrive at some time or other. Again, on the 21st May of this year, I urged that we should have what I call I have a non-party meeting of some description in this House, where, as one important matter becoming increasingly urgent, the financial situation might be thoroughly discussed, canvassed, and dealt with by the best ability and experience, and in the light of the best information, that this whole House could bring to bear on the subject. The Prime Minister has stated that he has had the best advice obtainable. Presumably he means that he has had the advice of those connected w it h ' banking and financial institutions, but there certainly has not been a conference of the public men of this country elected by the people to deal with the matter. However sound the views of a few outside persons may be in dealing with a situation of this kind, the value of consultation, conference, and advice in a national assembly should not be under-estimated. The way in which to deal with a difficulty is not to postpone it , but to face it and grapple with it . Difficulty avoided is difficulty accentuated. In this matter we are merely following circumstances. We are not moulding circumstances. The National Parliament is the creature of circumstances. As these desperate circumstances arise we are compelled, from sheer desperate and urgent necessity, to deal with them in some piece-meal, unrelated, unscientific way. Surely to foresee difficulties and to face them as a whole, to work out a solution, not of some temporary difficulty, tout the whole financial problem which is developing here and all the world over, we should discuss matters comprehensively. would enable us to face these crises as they arrived with principles and machinery thoroughly considered and adequately prepared. It is quite evident that the whole of the possible to have this consultation beforecredit of Australia is involved at the present time. The ""position of the States, as well as that of tlie Commonwealth, is involved. It is announced that the Im perial Government have notified Australia that further loans cannot be raised iu London. The embargo applies equally to the -States and the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, it is nearly twelve months since the State Governments found that they could not go on the London money market for the purpose of successfully negotiating loans, and the Commonwealth, in co-operation with the Imperial Government, had to come to their rescue; and the fact that the Commonwealth is also not able to raise loans iu Loudon does not render any less urgent the position of the States in regard to loan moneys.

There has been a great deal of talk about mobilizing, organizing, and utilizing the resources of Australia to their utmost in this time of war. It is generally admitted that that should be the object aimed at, but it does not appear to have been found necessary although this is the very basis to nationalize or socialize the public credit of Australia. This is lef t to be operated by the States and the Commonwealth separately-to be operated by private banking corporations separately. under the competitive, not under the cooperative, system. It is regrettable that the Labour party's programme in regard to the national bank was not given f u l l effect to. was that prepared for the establishment of a national bank, and agitated for a number of years by the honourable member for Darwin. In A p r i l , 1908, that scheme was printed and issued as a parliamentary paper, and in July of that year, at the Brisbane Labour Conference, there was a notice of motion on the business paper practically for its adoption. That Labour Conference, at which I was present, did adopt the scheme, and included it in its fighting platform-that was a Commonwealth Bank of issue, deposit, exchange, and reserve. that the Conference or the party were bound in every detail to the scheme of the honourable member for ""Darwin, b u t they were committed to the fundamental basis and broad outlines of the scheme. When, however, we came to the establishment of the Bank, it was done only in a piece-meal fashion. We have established the note issue as a separate aud distinct activity of the Government, whereas it should never have been separated from the Bank. carrying out the Labour party's platform in regard to the National Bank, which should be the bank of issue, deposit, exchange, and reserve-the great i-eserve bank of Australia. should be financing the States now! Mr J. H . CATTS -If the scheme prosecond mulgated by the honourable member for into the banks, and will be used in the second Darwin had been carried out, and the instalment. bank had been jointly owned and controlled by the States and the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth, at this crisis, would have been able to .finance whatever loans are necessary to carry us over our difficulties. The revenue of the States amounts to nearly £41,000,000, and that of the Commonwealth to £21,000,000, or a total revenue of £62,603,627; and that volume of money could now have been passing through the Commonwealth Bank. The municipal and other local governing authorities in the various States depend very largely on the directions of the State Governments; and they also could We are to utilize credit have been doing their business through this Bank. This volume of business would create trading balances which would enable extensive credit or loans to be issued. Commonwealth and State loans could then be arranged tlirough the The scheme I am alluding to Bank. The whole positiou is illustrated by a statement made by Senator Pearcei n the Senate on Friday, and reported in the press of last Saturday. Senator Pearce is reported to have saidThe Government intended to submit proposals for a loan of £20,000,000 for war purposes. Arrangements were being made that would insure the success of Australia's first war loan. It was entirely a war loan. It was satisfactory to know that at least three-quarters of the money raised would be expended in Australia-Australia n material and Australian people. By placing the loan in instalments when the first lot had been received I do not say and expended, that money was still available in Australia for investment. The money would not leave the Commonwealth, but would be circulated in the country and among the community. The Commonwealth, therefore, would be in almost as good a position to face the second and third instalments as it was to face thc first. . . . Tlie position was weakened only to the extent of the money spent outside the Commonwealth. Senator Pearce went on to give details showing that only a very smalf amount of this money would not be spent inside the Commonwealth. The time is now rotten ripe for The Adelaide Register, a Conservative paper, discussing this loan on 15th July, saidA loan for purely local objects and local expenditure would simply be circulating money in. channels whence it would revert back to its original source. He a r , hear! It By reason of the fact that this loan is being raised in instalments of £5,000,000, when the instalment is required,, most of the original money will have found its way back",32,William Irvine Bu T Will It Be
181,Mr Kingo ' Malley,"The Commonwealtli itself, through the Commonwealth Bank, ought to have heen in a position to finance all the loans that it would have been necessary to raise for the conduct of the war and for the States; but the actual position is such that the private money lenders-the private banks-d o all the business and reap all the profit. lenders of the country it is a grand thing that there is a war now and again. I can only express my own opinion in this matter, but there is, under our present system, no way in which a member can insure tliat notice w ill be taken of his remarks. Parliament are merely uttered and put down as records of their views. It is quite at the option of the Leader of the Grovernment whether any notice whatever is taken of them. achieve anything in the nature of a definite objective is to propose some kind of a motion. House is compelled to "" toe the m a r k "" and to vote. Such a course, however, may mean a challenge to the very existence of the Government. If a Minister refuses to accept auy such proposal, a l l members can do is to range themselves in oue camp or the otlier. Under such circumstances, it is ours not to reason why, it is ours but to do or die. As I have said before during the past few days, that is the result of our parliamentary procedure. It has nothing to do w i th the party machine. It is tlie principle of parliamentary procedure that prevails on both sides of the House. W it h such problems of outstanding importance in fron t of us, the Government should invite the whole of the in telligence, experience, and ability of Parliament to help. We should have all the cards on the table. All the information at the disposal of the Government should be placed before Parliament, and members should state their views upon that information. An effort should be made to ascertain the mind of the House as to the best course to follow. If any matter of party principle arose the parties could arrange themselves on their respective party sides, but no party principle is involved in this matter party principle affecting a question of public finance on an occasion like this.

In that there is a very f r u it f u l field who is now, unfortunately, absent from of inquiry into which one might be tempted to embark in connection with a B ill of this k in d ; but I take it that the occasion is not appropriate. It seems to ' me that the questions of raising loan money and of adding to the permanent revenue strength of the Government are separable, and ought at the present time to be kept separate. If we read the press communications aright, the Prime Minister w ill very shortly give this Parliament the opportunity of deciding upon the recommendations of the Government on questions of taxation, and then we shall have the opportunity of going into the whole matter. Another field upon which I hesitate to tread is that alluded to by the honourable member for Cooki n many of his veiy striking and forcible utterances. finance, of how far Germany or Austria is capable of self-sustenance during this critical time, is surely not a question for us to consider, let alone to decide. It seems to me that the issue before us is narrowed down to a question as to whether the Government deserve the support of Parliament in their proposition to raise, by means of bonds or inscribed stock, the sum of £20,000,000 in one or more stages, and on that question I beg leave to speak for a few niinutes. I agree with the honourable member for Cook, if I may say so, before coming to the subject-matter of the B ill proper, in his view that it is time we had a complete statement from the Treasurer regarding revenue and expenditure. Members on both sides of the House have exercised considerable restraint in permitting the right honourable gentleman who presides over the Treasury to take liis own time and hour for the consideration of questions of finance. It is plain to us, especially those of us who have watched I the preparation of Budgetsi n other spheres, that this is not the time to expect-a t all events before we rise, if we intend to rise within the next fortnight-anythin g in the nature of a f u l l Budget for the year we have I gathered just entered upon. I think it would be a mistake to attempt such a statement. But a pre-Budget statement, giving in broad outline a review of the year just concluded, and an allusion to the general prospects of the year upon whioh we have now entered, ought to be given before we rise, and I hope the Prime Minister, the chamber, will hear from his colleagues that this request has been put in quite a reasonable spirit, not with the object of embarrassing him in the discharge of those heavy financial responsibilities that hang around his shoulders at the present time, but with the desire that we should discharge our consultative obligations f a it h f u l l y . We are sent here to control the affairs of a united Australia. We cannot control them if we sit in darkness. We cannot, by merely nodding our heads as each financial proposal is brought along, be held to be discharging our obligations to our constituents.

200,Mr Watt,"If we guarantee freedomnot be advisable to give to the investing public the explicit and unmistakable assurance that the loan will be free from taxation of all kinds. Sitting suspended from 6.SO to 7.1/6 p.m. journed for dinner, I was generally supporting the measure before the House, and alluding more particularly to the guaranteed which is embodied in the first paragrapli of the prospectus. I was suggesting the application of a wider form of that guarantee to insure the success of this Joan. I do not t h in k » I need elaborate that point any further, b u t will proceed to two or three other matters that seem to me worthy of consideration. Further down in the prospectus there is the statement, "" A f u l l half-year's interest will be, paid on the 15th December, 1915,"" and reading onward to the mode of demanding instalments in connection with the loan, this phase opens up: Applications for the loan close on the 31st August. The first instalment of 10 per cent, is due on the date of application, 15 per cent, ou the 15th September, 20 per cent, on the 15th October, 25 per cent, on the 15th November, and the balance -3 0 per cent -o n the 15th December, so that over a long period during the six months for which interest is guaranteed these graduated instalments extend, with the result that for two months of the half year for which interest is f u l l y paid no money at all is lodged. By the end of the thir d month, 15th September, there is only 25 per cent, of the loan paid up, liy the end of the f o u r t h month 45 per cent., and in the last two months the balance of 55 per cent, is paid. Broadly speaking, on an approximate calculation, tlie Treasurer will have possession of the whole £100 for only two months out of the six. That is to say, he will pay f u l l interest for six months, and have the use ancl enjoyment of the money for an average of two months. This is the problem generally referred to as accrued interest in the flotation of all loans. But I do not think that I know of any case-and I speak as a supporter of the B ill and the loan propositionwhen so vast a dividend in accrued in terest has been given to the investing public as this proposition means. the loan much more attractive public would make it appear as if the Treasurer had been guided by the very skilful external advice which I am glad he has had the courage to avail himself of. I am not aware of the source of that advice, but it does seem as if it has been tendered somewhat in the interest of the lending fraternity. The effect of this proposition is that for two months out of immunity from taxation the six monthswe enjoy the money, and we pay interest on it for the whole six months. For the first six months this money is going to cost three times what it will cost annually after tliat date? That is, it is going to cost the Treasurer three times 4 i per cent, for this period of beneficial enjoyment between the 15th June and the 15th December. That is a huge and unreasonably high rate of interest to pay as a bonus to the investing public in the shape of accrued interest. Another calculation may be put in this for m : If we were not paying accrued interest, but were paying interest as the instalments fell in , the money would cost at the rate* of 4ij[ per cent., whether we were enjoying it for a long or a short period. But as we shall be enjoying it for only a thir d of the period we are giving away interest at the rate of an extra 3 per cent, per annum. £300,000 for tlie six months. the total; 3 per cent, is the extra rate we would pay per annum, but as it only operates for half a year it is 1^ per cenfc. that we shall be giving away as accrued interest. That rate is in excess of underwriting charges. This loan is not underwritten. We depend on the attractiveness of it , the methods of flotation, and th© need of the moment to bring the loan to a successful culmination. But if we desired none of those risks we would have undertaken underwriting. The highest underwriting price during the last ten years-has been 1£ per cent. Sometimes the loans have been underwritten at 1 per cent., the price at which the last two Victorian loans have been underwritten. thafc is worthwhile is what is the added interest during the term of fche loan. that. . i r",36,William Ibvine N O Arrange The First Time I N The History Of Our Coun

208,To The Mr Fisher,"I do not think it is halfsimple one, and the Secretary to the Treasurer would he able to tell his M in isterial chief in a minute what the extra interest would be. But I am not dealing with that subject. 1 am trying to test whether the course which the nnanciai advisers on whom the Government now rely have suggested that the Treasurer should take is, after all, the wisest course. I take leave to doubt whether it is. It seems to me that to insure the success of the loan, underwriting would have been preferable. We probably insure its success by this tempting morsel of accrued interest, but we shall be doing it' at a greater cost than underwriting would have meant. extra amount to the underwriters rather than to the holders? that should be done, but we are right in trying to analyze what this, our first big loan transaction, means. During recent years, all the States-and , in fact, al) other parts of the British Empire-hav e had their loans floated with the protection of underwriting. That has been the invariable process in London during the last seven or eight years. tion for a loan. that in a period of trouble, when there may be some doubt as to whether this in stalment will succeed-as we all hope it will-w e ought to put the matter beyond all doubt and risk, especially if we can do it at less cost than the proposed method will involve. I recommend tliese considerations to the attention of tlie right honourable gentleman, not to f a u l t the procedure, but in order to suggest that, although he is probably committed to the terms of this particular instalment, he should consult with his advisers inside and outside the Department before the second instalment is offered to the public in order to see whether the loan can be floated in a surer and cheaper way. was not privileged to hear the Treasurer's remarks upon this motion, but on reading the first paragraph on page 2 of the prospectus, it seems to me that he relies on and accepts the services of the Commonwealth Bank for the reception of applications for the loan, and I am nofc clear as to whether that bank is to be paid any fee. fee. banks are not to enjoy the 5s. commission which the ordinary stockbrokers get. question of the sinking f u n d , the parent Act, if I remember rightly, provides for the payment of afc least £ per cent. The object of that self-denying ordinance, and a very proper provision, was to sink the loan during a term of extended currency. We did not contemplate that the first Australian national loan floated within Commonwealth borders would have a currency of less than ten years, and £ per Cent, cannot be regarded as an adequate sinking f u n d for such a loau. cannot contend*-that that is a reasonable I am not suggesting that argument.

The average duration of Australian loans ia, roughly, between twenty and t h i r t y years, and it would mean a substantial addition to \ per cent, with compound interest reckoned in sinking-fund fashion, to sink them at the end of their time. I have sunk them, and sometimes they have been enabled, out of a £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 loan, to put aside a quarter out of the redemption sum, and say to the underwriters, ' ' We do not want the whole of this loan renewed, but only three-quarters of it .

AndI think we may say that a close study of the Australian national debt will frighten nobody. The more we look at the national debt of the States or the nation, the larger the assets loom against the indebtedness. debted at all. without any strain on the imagination, but by a legitimate argument on facts, that some States are not in debt. Most of the older countries of the world which have national debts have shot the money away in dynastic wars or wars of conquest, and have nothing but the general status of the nation to show for it. But the States of Australia havo really, legitimately, and advisedly expended bheir loans on policies of public works, and in most cases the money has been wisely invested. As the result, even thus early in our history, we are able to show a substantial credit in the shape of receipts from public works against the interest bill of the nation. In regard^ to two States in particular, after paying working expenses on public works in which loan money has been spent, during the last five years there has been a net credit more than equivalent to the whole of the interest bill of the two States. In tions of Australia. I cannot conceive > fact, the receipts from public works in Victoria have gone to the relief of revenue wealth for war purposes, or otherwise, to' the extent of between £30,000 and £50,000 a year, showing that the capital sunk in these enterprises has been wisely and advantageously spent. other countries in which private individuals do what we in Australia do with public money. In Canada, for example, there are vast railways corporations which go almost every year to the London lender and ask for increased capital, in order to construct some branch services or new trunk lines. They ask for an increase of capital of £5,000,000-w e ask for a loan, of £5,000,000; in the case of a private^ corporation it is called "" increase of capital""; in the case of a State it is called "" borrowing,"" but the process is the same and the purpose to which the money isapplied is identically the same. We are able to say that the Australian debt, ascarried by the States, is, broadly speaking, earning its own interest. has done more. can safely say that Australian public worksj payable and non-payable, on which loan money has been spent, ,are nearly paying the interest bill that Australia has> to meet. that I gave in my Budget speech established that fact. the provision for a sinking fund, except that, if we are to deal with a loan of short currency, anything up to ten years, w& shall need to consider the question of increasing thc i per cent, for which provision is made in the parent Act, or else, at the expiration of this loan, our contributions towards its reduction will be somicroscopic as to be almost laughable. As we have no desire to see that, we should: increase that per cent, sinking fund in. regard to loans on short currency, and revert to that basis for the longer loans.

On the question of how far the taxation which may folloAV this loan is likely to injure or cripjile the States, a question of importance to the Treasurer as well as to the State Governments, I cannot conceive, if Ave put on a special land tax on top of the old Federal land tax, and special estate duties, and follow with a tax on income or surplus wealth, that all these taxes are to come off immediately after the Avar; because, as the Leader of the Opposition very wisely suggested, if we Avish to spread tlie provision we make for our expenditure on war out of revenue, Ave can only do so by continuing the taxation for aperiod after the war is closed. wise Ave would have to borrow , thus 1 largely increasing the permanent interest bill .

I regret that the Treasurer did not give the bankers a small sum to guarantee the underwriting of the loan, because, as we know, "" b o o d l e "" is very timid, and I know what it means to have a failure in a flotation. We are constantly asked where wise in bringing down this can be got a safe security with a fair rate of interest. Men of ordinary experience and superficial knowledge of finance will answer at once, but the man who is very cautious will not answer at all, because he cannot. One of the hardest things in Australia to-day is to get a safe security with high profit. rally ! rency of this loan is only ten years, and I think it would be far better if it were made that term, with the right reserved to the Government of conversion or continuing it if tliey so desire. tractive a loan. not know. of interest will he down before ten years.

I wish honourable members to understand that this is not the total bullion; the total bullion in Australia is only £34,578,000; and if we deduct the bullion from the figures connected with the Savings Banks and the commercial banks, which total £256,000,000, we have £222,000,000 in deposits expansion tion is, is that available for investment? The total bullion in Australia is only £34,578,000, and so I say that, however we may look at it , we canvest, and our imports are restricted, as not get away from the fact that there is £222,000,000 expansion of credit. In 1893, when we had the great banking crisis in Australia, the banks had more f old than at any time in their history, 'et their deposits were millions behind what they were in 1892, because of the contraction of credit. note-issue into consideration in that expansion of credit? the note-issue does not represent wealth. of credit. not represent wealth. When a man grinds out notes from a machine his action does not represent wealth any more than my borrowing of £10,000 from the bank would. Another point of view that I want to discuss-and it is a very serious one-ha s reference to the rate of exchange. We are going to be not only a debtor country, but our exports to foreign countries are going to be millions less than our imports. They are now. Will not that affect the rate of exchange? And if it affects the rate of exchange will it not affect the rate of interest? That is the next point we ought to consider. a record harvest? Mr KI NG O'MALLEY -Yes; I am looking into the harvest very carefully. I am very interested in the harvest. If the amount of our commodities exported to foreign countries next year is less than the amount of commodities imported into Australia, that will immediately cause a demand for foreign exchange. now. A man with money to sell in London can get a good price for it. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY -We are at that stage now. When money is sent away it is sent by means of an international system of exchange through credits. If our balance in Great Britain, or America, or anywhere else, is against us, we let it stay there, and pay interest on it , if they will agree, until such time as we can send away shiploads of wheat which represent only an or wool, sell these, get bills of exchange, of credit. The quesand cancel our debts. We are not in a position to do these things now, and we shall not be. ' they are, the balance of trade will rapidly come in our favour. That will immediately affect the price of exchange. I wonder if my lionorable friends are aware that if they want to get a sight draft to-day they can only get $4.78 cents in Australia for the sovetaken the reign. The legitimate currency when I was in America was always $4.87 cents per £ 1 . cents down? Mr KI NG O'MALLEY -Yes. I ' ascertained that the other day when I was in the bank looking into the whole thing. I wanted to see if these statements were correct, and I found they were. The moment we have a bigger foreign balance than we have here the rates of exchange will come down. Our foreign trade and commerce do not alone regulate foreign exchange or foreign interest, and we must not forget thafc if rates of interest are high in Australia, if this is a very enticing loan, our local merchants, bankers, brokers, and capitalists representing large groups of security seekers will invest tlieir money here instead of sending it out of the country to buy, or investing ifc in foreign bills of exchange. On the other hand, if interest is low here and high in other countries, then they will immediately cable their money to the country where they can take advantage of the higher rate of interest. If money is 6 per cent, in other countries' it only requires a cable message to send it out, and a cable does not cost much.

According to Mr Knibbs, on the 30th June, 1914, the deposits in our banks amounted to £93,659,000, and their paid-up capital value to £31,142,000a total of £124,801,000.

Therefore, I suggest that those who are engaged in recruiting endeavours should impress upon the public what this B ill means to Australia generally. would like to say a few words on this Bill-jus t to give it my blessing. I do not suppose anybody will a eree with my remarks ; I am sure nobody on the Opposition side will To my mind, the most pleasing thing about this debate is the marvellous unanimity on the part of the leaders of both parties in this House. Wlio says we have not a National party, when we find two leaders who are in such thorough agreement ? If they do not share the responsibility, they at least share the honour of having opinions that are akin. From the commencement of this war we have beeu told that there are immense responsibilities to be borne. There have been 'most remarkable consultations. We have received the advice of men of in fluence, of men who know something about business, and are conversant with banking propositions, and it did not matter whether it was before the elections or After them,, whether the Liberal party was in office or the Labour party was iu office, or whether Joseph Cook or Mr Fisher was Prime Minister-alway s there have beeu triangular consultations between the managers of the banking institutions and the presidents of the stock exchanges -of Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, and the political chiefs of this continent. And out of the latest of these consultations -there has been evolved a national finanoial policy perfectly satisfactory to vhe leaders of the great financial interests of this countrya policy sound and diplomatic, if not from the Labour point of view, at least from the stand-point of the managers of the great financial institutions of the country. Who are they ? The Attorney-General told us this afternoon about the leaders of tlie great mineral resources of BrokenH ill and Mount Lyell, of the administrators of thr, copper, and spelter, of their alliances and associations with the Germanic -enemy. Who are the managers and d i rectors of the great banks of this count r y , and of those big financial institutions which have their head offices in this city ? I desire merely to say You have just to look at their principals -the directors of the BrokenH ill Company and of Mount Lyell, or Jamieson or Baillieu,. or all that crowd. Whereever you find men associated with Germanic interests, you find the men who hold the reins of the financial institutions in their hands. And we consult them for a great national financial policy! In (Bourke) [ 9 . 6 ] -] Queensland and New South Wales the position is the same. You need only look to the heads of the Sugar -Company on the one hand, and of the Sydney gaslighting mouopoly on the other, and there you find the men who control the Bank of New South Wales and. the Bank of Queensland. W it h those gentlemen we enter into alliances and deliberations in order at this crisis in our history to evolve a national financial policy. And we have evolved thisa B ill for a £20,000,000 loan. W h y , if I close my eyes and listen, whether the voice be that of Beaconsfield or Gladstone, of Joseph Cook or Fisher, I hear the same language, and the same phraseology. Whether gathered from the Tory camp or the Labour Caucus they all talk the same language, they all trade in the same principles. We are to float a loan for £20,000,000, and interest for the six months is to be paid on the 15th December. This policy was developed apparently after consultation with the leaders of the stock exchanges and tbe leading lights of the great bauks. that one more will not matter. were not consulted in this matter. they had been consulted.

In the first place, the Treasurer is to raise £20,000,000, and is to pay six months' interest on the 15th December. The last 30 per cent, of the loan is to be paid on the last day in November, so we will have the use of 30 per cent, of the £20,000,000 for a fortnight, and for that fortnight's use of about £6,000,000 we are to pay a half-year's interest. Good patriotism! These men will make sacrifices for their country while oth-ir men are dyiug on the battlefields. This means that the lenders are to get £135,000 for a fortnight's loan. That is the sort of policy we have evolved. A sum of £5,000,000 will be available to the Government for a month, and for that the lenders will get half a year's interest; £4,000,000 is to be available for two months, and for that they will get half a year's interest/.; £5,000,000 is to be available for three months, and for that they will get a half year's interest; so that, on the average terms between this and December, on a loan which, over its entirety will have an average duration of six weeks, we are going to pay a half-year's interest. Workingi t out for six weeks, whether it be £5,000,000 or £20,000,000, we will pay £450,000, whereas the normal interest for the period would be £112,000. We make a gift of £338,000 to these ""patriots"" who so dearly love their country ou this one item alone, but we are told that it is not to be the total. member believes that this £20,000,000 is the total amount that we shall have to borrow. Before the end of the year we shall have to double the loan, and the people of Australia will, on the present terms, have to pay £2,000,000 a year in interest. To whom? To those who give their money? who lend their money without interest? No. It is to be paid to those who, while others are struggling and suffering to maintain the nation, are trying to make a profit out of the national crisis. body of men who are here assembled. We started the war with interest at 3^ per cent. To-day the "" money-grubbers "" have raised the level of the money market to 4£ per cent., and, let the war go on another six months, and they Avill raise the rates to 5$, 6, or 1 per cent. Every increase in the intensity of the struggle of the nation to maintain its existence will mean an increased rate of interest that these "" bloodsuckers "" will put on the Government and the community. While one section of the community aresacrificing their lives, why should another class be permitted to reap a harvest out of a nation struggling for its* very existence? W hy should the woT men and children of those who are fighting on the battlefield be called Good business! upon to pay £2,000,000 more to people who stop at home and invest their money? This Bill says that the interest upon this loan shall be free from any income tax, and we are also to have a war tax. The position will be that any man who now has £50,000 invested at 3£ per cent, in a private institution will draw it out and put it into the waT loan; because, glory be to God, the more blood spent on the field of battle, the higher becomes the rate of interest on the suffering nationalities, and money will be drawn from national enterprises and invested in highpriced loans. As the honourable member for Balaclava has said, we shall suffer from a higher rate of interest, because war means a high rate of interest; and when the Avar is over money will flow back into industries at that liigher rate. Peace means accumulated profits and a diminished rate of interest. If a man leai es his money in a bank Avhere he i» r getting 3^ per cent., or puts it into an industry, or invests it in any path of peace, he will be called upon to pay the Avar tax; but if he draws his money out No honourable of the bank, or out of the industry, and puts it into the war loan at per cent., he will not only draw a higher rate of interest, but will also escape the Avar tax. There is to be no tax upon the man whoinvests his money in the Avar loan, and yet I am asked to support that proposition, that has been developed after conNo. To those sultation with the leaders of the great financial institutions.

Now is the hour when the principles on which the Labour party stands can demonstrate their validity or falsity. If valid, bhey will be true for all time. In the first place, we say that the troubles that afflict the human race are the result of certain forms of exploitation, the accumulation of rent, the accumulation of interest, and the accumulation of profit. monopoly of land, and out of this we have evolved our land policy. The second rests on tlie forces of monopoly in production, and out of this we have evolved a system of anti-monopoly and the demand that we should nationalize all those processes that tend towards monopoly. But when we come to the question of finance, it is most remarkable that men who are essentially Radicali n all that appertains to land and industrial enterprises should be found to be absolutely Conservative. has been evolved to-day in modern society? are no longer based on gold. have evolved the cheque system, or a system of credits, and vast organizations, known as banks, have grown u p ; and as these banks are in the hands of a few men, who hold what we describe as the monopoly of the instruments of exchange, it is essentially the policy of the Labour party that we should nationalize them. Mr Anstey. honourable member for Angas was speaking on the note issue. A t that time. I did not agree with the note issue. It was the first speech I made in tliis Chamber. I I have not onlysaidI support this Bill, but not because it goes as far as I wish it to go. I have no hesitation in saying that I am an advocate of a National Bank to utilize our national credit, free from the limitations and restrictions of any private corporations whatsoever. ThoughI am opposed to the proposed method of raising money to meet the national needs at this particular juncture, I say that if we believe in the u t i l it y of the National Bank as we have established it , we should not leave it , as the honourable member for Darwin puts it , to be a mere dog's tail to the private institutions of the country, but we should make it the darker the night, the great oentral Bank of the Continent, servI f a man has ing tlie requirements of the Government in this crisis. I went on to sayI hold strongly to the opinion that that bank should precede any note issue, but I can give the fullest measure of respect to men whose honesty of conviction has stood the .storm and stress of many years. AlthoughI disagree with the order of precedence adopted, it is sufficient for me to know that we are at least taking one step towards the realization of the definite policy which this party has been advocating for twenty-five long years. That was the step we took four years ago, and we got no further. The honourable member for Angas, on that occasion, was The first rests on the quoting M.r. William Liston, a bank manager, and saidA paper currency is the spontaneous outgrowth of modern commercial life; natural and safe so long as it is based upon the certainty or very high probability that its component parts can, when required, be converted into gold to an amount equal to thc amount represented, or into commodities which gold to an equal amount would procure. No one has ever disagreed with that proposition, but the last Quarterly Beview states that the gold theory has been abanWhat doned. The very position of the world has compelled its abandonment. The The instruments of exchange Quarterly Beview says that however it We may be discussed, and whatever views may have been adopted, the fact remains, describing it in the terms of the bulletins which are familiar to the generals of defeated armies-that the gold theory has been abandoned, and it is recognised that the only basis of the currency of a nation is the credit established by the attempt to nation itself, outside of which there is Four years ago the no stability. Mr White, speaking in the Canadian House, in reply to SirW i l f r i d Laurier, saidI t is an object of the Government to conserve gold. Every country in tlie world recognises the absolute necessity of not leaving gold in private bands, but of mobilizing it under the control of the Government, so that it may be concentrated wherever it may be necessary to serve the national purpose. Americans, individualists as they are, have found it necessary to combine among themselves as bankers, in order to keep a national reserve. sayTherefore, we have made notes legal tender and discontinued redemption. Tbat was found necessary, in order' to conserve the gold resources of the country. At the present time, like other countries, we are not on a gold basis. The honourable member for Calare said that a banking friend of. his has suggested that the banks ought to issue £20,000,000 of notes on their securities. is nothing wrong with position. The very same thing was proposed at the Bankers' Conference in 1895. Jt was laid down at that Conference that a uol6 issue was absolutely sound. As long as the currency was issued on good security, saleable on the market, ifc wasabsolutely good and solvent. mission was held in Victoria ahour, the same time, and Mr Gyles Turner said that paper money issued on good security was as sound as the Bank of England. Ten years later, when Mr Watson was putting forward his proposals in this Chamberi n connection with the Canadian system, the bankers wished the Government to ieave to them the note circulation. There is no banker in this country who has not admitted in some place or another at some time or anotherI am saying this because it is leading up to what I am going to put forward as a counter proposal to the proposed loan-ther e is not a banker of eminence in the country, whether it be Mr French, Mr Finlayson, or anybody else, who, at some time or other, before some Commission or other, or in some written article in the Bankers' Record, has not laid it down that a currency, whether based on cheques or on notes, is absolutely safe, so long as it is based ou a saleable security. Whether that currency be based on things that represent property, loans that national power of taxation, or bills that represent products, or on taxation, it is absolutely good. The Round Table, in its article on Lombard Streeti n War, said that loans are the basis of transactions and the basis of credits; and credits are given in bank-books. How are credits circulated ? By the medium of cheques. As the honourable member for Angas and others have admitted, modern currency is not gold; it does not consist of a few trivial notes circulated in the form of small change; currency consists wholly and solely of cheques. That is not my Mr White went on to statement, but it is based on the opinion of every commercial man and banker. gold basis at the back of the cheque. sumption is that there is. sume that you have had a drink, but you may not have had it . The Round There Table goes on to say that behind that proall the cheques that are circulating in England, as the proper instrument by which credits are transferred, tliere is not 1 oz. of gold. In the same article we are told that, according to the report of the Commission of 1895, Mr Finlayson and MrH . Gyles Turner, A Comboth bank managers, said that money issued on good security is as sound as the Bank of England. Then McLeod said that the amount of banking credits had increased by scores of millions, and that these increased banking credits, being circulated by cheques, are currency in exactly the same way as notes. Sir Felix Schuster, of Smith's Bank, has said that the currency of the country is supplied by cheques insteacl of, as the BankA c t in tended, by Bank of England notes. . run the banks, and all the business? by Germans here. what the Attorney-General said this afternoon, it would appear absolutely true that German influence is running the -banks in this country. said that the men who control the metallic resources of this country are under Gerrepresent the man' influence.",48,William Ibvine N O Arrange The First Time I N The History Of Our Coun

If the private banks can draw on national confidence, surely that is a good enough foundation upon which a National Government can conduct operations without having to pay blood money. honourable touched upon this aspect of the situation this afternoon. When speaking about international complications, he said that Germany had been rendered solvent by the fact that a ring had been put round Germany through which she could neither import nor export, and that, therefore, she was driven fco production for use, and not for profit. Germany is engaged in producing munitions of war and food for the population and army, and so long as it is possible for Germany fco continue doing as she is now, so long will she be able to conduct the war, and keep her own money market practically undisturbed. But, as the writer in the Bound Table pointed oufc, the Allies, and England especially, are being disastrously affected in their carrying on of this struggle. The operations of fche British Government are restricted by the fact that England has to obtain enormous quantities of munitions and other supplies from America, the payment for which is transforming her credit balance into a debit balance, and England can only meet her debit obligations by the export of gold, or by floating bonds in America, as has been done through Pierpont Morgan. England is in this danger: that she cannofc export her gold without at once in terfering with the basis of her financial structure. will have to be paid to America will be met by the transfer of American obligations due fco England. done now, but how long will it continue? as well. there are influences at work which go to bear out what the honourable member for Parramatta said. B ut so f a r as a country like Australia is concerned, whilst we can continue producing the requisite food, clothing, and munitions of war, this process of borrowing through the private banks can only have the effect of piling up our debt obligations. When we talk about the little investor coming in w it h his £10 loan, we know we are talking about a mere fly-something to make it appear that the loan is popular-to fill the public eye. The men who w ill contribute to this loan are those associated with the great financial institutions. The They will take up these bonds bearing 4£ member for Parramatta per cent., and you w ill get nothing else but cheques and credits in the private banks. WhatI affirm should be done is that this £20,000,000 should be put into the National Bank, and upon that the Governor should be instructed to write up credit to the extent of £20,000,000. When he does that, he w ill do just exactly as the private banks w ill do under the operation of this B ill . We may be asked where the credit is to come from . Where does the credit of the private banks come from? They w ill merely write up credit in their books, yet the'result w ill be that before the end of the war £2,000,000 additional interest-bloo d money-will "" have to be paid to the men who have not risked their lives. Who is going to j u s t i fy the proposition that one class of men shall shed their blood, that another class of men shall be taxed to pay the cost, and that a third and exclusive class a privileged section in the community -shal l neither shedtheir blood nor contribute anything to the cost of the war, nor be subjected to any war tax upon the income they obtain from any contributions they have made to the national exchequer. Yet this small and exclusive class is to draw £2,000,000 per annum as the result of this war, whilst higher prices are to prevail as the result of the additional taxation that w ill become necessary. W h y should we not do all that is necessary by giving the Commonwealth Bank security for the £20,000,000, and if we are to pay 4£ per cent, or 5 per cent, for it , let it be by means of an annual redemption, so that, after a period of, say, twenty years, we shall be free of any obligation. D u r in g the C i v il Wari n A t the same time, .Americai t was said that the private banks could have gone on for ever lending out tbeir money in a circle. They wanted Lincoln to float his loans in s m a l l ' amounts, so that the money could be issued again and again. Lincoln refused to do anything of the sort, for such reasons, as I have referred to.

The question of finance is one that a layman has some difficulty in discussing amongst men who have had large experience, like the Leader of the Opposition, who has been Treasurer, or the honourable member for Balaclava, who for years was Treasurer in the State Government, or the Prime Minister, or the honourable member for Darwin, who was trained as a banker; but I confess that some of the ideas used in the argument of the honourable member for Bourke have been running in my mind for some time, and I would like to know from those financial experts who are in this House whether it is not possible to have some different and better scheme of financing the war loan than that proposed. The Leader of the Opposition said that Germany would be up against bankruptcy if she had to go into the open market, but bhat in her internal finance she was adopting methods for the conduct of the war which were satisfactory. If Germany can finance herself internally, why should not the Commonwealth attempt to do so? The honourable meniber for Bourke, with his characteristic vigour, painted in vivid colours the sacrifices that are being made in agree with him in failing to see that [189] ^ / investors will make any corresponding sacrifice in lending their money to the Government, notwithstanding what has been said by the honourable member for Balaclava. The honourable member for Bourke has moved an amendment to provide for the payment to the Commonwealth Bank of £20,000,000 worth of bonds as a credit of the National Government. Why should we not have a special issue of war notes to that value ? For the conduct of the war an immense sum of money will have to be raised by the taxation of income or of wealth, and why 'should not that be redeemed out of the war-note issue. I do not claim to be a financier, nor to be as well versed in finance as some honourable members, b ut the honourable member for Cook has suggested that we should say what is in our minds, and what we think the best way of financing Australia in the present crisis. It has been pointed out that if the Commonwealth borrows £20,000,000 in the ordinary way the money will be drawn from the ordinary channels of industry. WhatI propose is to avoid that. Even if the Government risked the depreciation of the notes which they would issue-and I cannot see that that would happenwould it nofc be better to take the risk and allow the States to appeal to. the Australian public for what they need for their own purposes? It seems to me that something better can be evolved than the proposition of the Government. I find myself practically in agreementwith many of the main ideas of the Jhonorable member for Bourke. I think that we should do better than we are doing. MrJ . H . CATTS (Cook) [10.5] -As a division is to be called for, I do not propose to give a silent vote on tlie amendment. The amendment proposes that the Government issue £20,000,000 in bonds to the Commonwealtli Bank, and obtain in return a credit or loan to that extent. If the Commonwealth Bank had been established in accordance with the platform of the Labour party as a bank of issue, deposit, exchange, and reserve, operated aud controlled by a Board, on which the Commonwealtli and the States were represented, I would say, without hesitation, that it should handle the loan in the manner proposed by fche honourable inember for Bourke.

But I shall take the earliest opportunity of discussing the matter. [10.13] I am very much inclined to vote for this proposal. Why? Because, if the Commonwealth Bank is not able to finance it , we ought to t r y to give her a show to do it . The Commonwealth Bank now ought to have £100,000,000 worth of deposits. As the author of the Bank, the establishment of which I preached for fourteen years, pointing out what the Bank could do if we could get her to the state of perfection that she ought to have attained, and whioh, I am sure, it is not my f a u lt that she has not attained Sir WILLIAMIRVINE able member suggest how the Commonloan, and the whole of the loan requirewealth Bank could do what is proposed to ments of Australia.

In the first place, there is can the Commonwealth Bank, to-day, a credit put on the ledger, and the Comwith £11,000,000, finance a loan of monwealth w ill order machinery, trans£20,000,000?

The sovereigns that the Commonwealth Bank cannot be made are in the Bank w ill not be paid out. a big national institution. There is the ledger, and there is the debit, and at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, when they balance, they simply clear by offa speech that was very eloquent, and, in setting indebtedness.

I do not agree with his proposition; I do not think it is practicable or sound. The assumption seems to be that this credit is an ephemeral thing that can be passed alone, and picked up again and still be substantial. A woman comes long with £10, representing her savings, and says "" I put that money into this loan; what are you going to give for the use of it during the time you hold it? I can get 5 per cent, for it in a commercial transaction; what will the Commonwealth give?"" We are told that we do not want the money. The honourable member for Darwin says that we should issue a 5 per cent, loan at a premium. sinking fund. Tf no one needs to provide this substantial or ephemeral thing that the honourable member for Bourke says is required, why should we pay interest? One honourable member suggests 5 per cent, interest, and the honourable member for Bourke says that no interest at all should be paid-that we should simoly write the Commonwealth's name to a cheque, and draw upon it . Draw upon whom ? This is very serious business. Few people in Australia recognise the gravity of the situation. Whatever we may do, let us all be together. We can debate academic matters later on. I pretend to no financial knowledge, but I have met a great number of men who are supposed to know something about finance, and we have taken the best of advice. The credit of the Commonwealth will be as good as that of the Empire; and if we can do what is set for th in the prospectus, we shall be starting on a financial expedition that will do credit to the country and to the people. J hope that the honourable member will withdraw his amendment. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE (Flinders) [10.31]I should not have spoken on this amendment had I not felt that I could persuade even the honourable member for Bourke that there was at least one fallacy lurking in the reasons that he advanced with so much fervour and eloquence. I endeavoured to follow the arguments of the honourable member with all the ability I could apply, but I found my mind in a perfect whirl. Gleaming visions of a financial paradise came before us, only to be followed by apparent and obvious fallacies. The honourable member commenced by assuming that the banking institutions would absorb a large portion of this loan, and get great benefit by so doing. I desire to assure the honourable member that tlie business of a bank is to borrow money from the very class of people who look to this kind of investment and desire it . The banks who are giving their depositors per cent., haye to take the money deposited with the .small amount of capital subscribed as the amount they have available to advance at higher rates, in order to support commercial and trading credit, and also every other form of industry requiring financial support. No bank in Australia could venture to invest a considerable And 1 per cent, portion of the funds at its disposal in these bonds, because it would become To be paid to whom? bankrupt in a short time if it attempted to do so. do so. . Sir WILLIAMIRVINE No . This is the point to which I wish to direct the attention of the honourable member for Bourke. It is quite true that, though all banks and insurance companies, if they are to survive at all, must be prepared to advance moneys at greater risks, and at higher rates of interest than Government securities provide, they do invest a very small proportion of the moneys available to them in various Government securities, and this war loan will be one of those securities which possess attractive features. W it h regard to that very small proportion of capital these insurance companies and banks can afford to keep for the purchase of any Government securities, they will probably regard this war loan as being quite as good as other Government securities, and perhaps better than others; but it is but a very small proportion of their funds that they could afford to put into this form of security. The effect that this war loan will have on banks will be that it will at once withdraw from them a considerable proportion of the money which they now draw on: that is, the deposits deposited with them. This money will be withdrawn from the capital now available to the banks for the purpose of making advances and supporting trade credit.

One of the objects of the Prime Minister, and of the party, supporting him, in establishing the Commonwealth Bank was that it should not merely do business for the Government iu financing loans, but that it should also enter into the ordinary commercial business of the country. Whetheri t w ill succeed in doing so remains to be proved, but if it is to do this ordinary business it could not allow its funds to be invested in Government securities. tain have taken up a great deal of the Imperial loan. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE think that they havs in the sense that the honourable member means. that a good many of the banks have underwritten a certain amount, or taken up certain bonds in order to sell them again. The commercial banks in England cannot keep more than a small percentage of their funds in this for m of security. The rate of interest is too low. They take greater risks, and get a greater rate of interest, ancl they have to do so, because they act as the medium of exchange between thousands of small depositors and the persons who require the money and take business risks. The banks merely act as collectors of the funds of the people who are themselves unable to find investment and deposit their money with the banks, and the latter lend it out at higher rates of in terest than can be got from Government securities. tioned the names of about a dozeu banks in Great Britain who' have subscribed many millions to the British war loan. have subscribed £62,000.000. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE have done so, they have clone it merely in the way of underwriting. If we wanted any institution to undertake that work I should say that the Commonwealth Bank, if ifc were in a posifcion to do so, would be the one fco which the Government would first look. But I have explained the complete fallacy at the bottom of the honourable member's argument that the banks w ill absorb a quanI said "" if it were doing tity of this loan out of the funds at their disposal. It is quite impossible; they cannot do it . BeforeI sit down, I wish to refer to some other remarks made by the honourable member for Bourke. He spoke of fche posifcion of bank and insurance directors in Melbourne. Such statements, if they are allowed to go abroad uncontradicted, bear f r u it . The honourable member said that the bank directors and those who control our banking and insurance companies in Australia,, especially in Melbourne, are the same persons who control the companies which deal in fhe metals that the Attorney-General said were largely under Germani n fluence. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE It is an absolutely incorrect statement. I do not that assertion? I dare say know. knowledge is just as good as that of the honourable member. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I challenge the honourable member to give names. able member to contradict my assertion.. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I do contradict it . Usually a man who makes such a damnatory allegation is asked to give some facts in support of it . It should not rest w i th those who deny it to have to disprove his assertion.

The proposal looks so attractive to any one who does not understand the actual operations of banking, and how it would work out, that it is just as well to put something on record alongside the honourable member's statement. I admit that he put his proposal, in very attractive language and in a very eloquent form, but if we are to follow the operation right through-that the Commonwealth Government should place £20,000,000 worth of bonds into the keeping of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, and the latter should then give its credit to tbe Commonwealth to the extent of £20,000,000what would happen f The Commonwealth Government would immediately start to draw on that £20,000,000 worth of credit in the books of the Commonwealth Bank and the cheoues would be paid out all over the Commonwealth and abroad, and the people who would receive them, not being for the most part customers of the Commonwealth Bank, would pay them into their credits at the other banks. Every one knows that when the banks come to settle among themselves they ascertain the exact amount of money which they owe to each other in the process of the exchange of cheques, and inasmuch as this is a vast sum of money, the net result would be that for a long time the exchange would be against the Commonwealth Bank. These balances have to be met in cash. It is thc only way in which the banks can. finalize thc exchanges and come to a definite settlement. They pay these balances in cash. MrJ . H .

If tbe honourable member carried his argument, to itsultimate result he would find, in the end, the Commonwealth paying interest on the greater part of the loan of £20,000,000, for which it would be receiving nothing at all.

I take advantage of this opportunity to announce to honourable members the names of those who will form the non-party Committee, to whom matters connected with the war will be referred by Ministers, and who will sit at convenient times. The Opposition members of the Committee will be Senator Millen, Sir John Porrest, Sir William Irvine, and Messrs. McWilliams, W a t t, and Glynn. The members of the Committee from this side of the House will be Senators Long and Findley, and Messrs. Poynton, Webster, Page, and Sharpe. I hope that honourable members generally will assist the Government to get the War LoanB ill through to-morrow, so that the prospectus of the loan may be sent out. The matter is extremely technical, and I ask honourable members to refrain from speaking at length, and assist the Government to bring the consideration of the B ill to a conclusion early to-morrow. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.57 p.m.",60,William Ibvine N O Arrange The First Time I N The History Of Our Coun
