I propose, in the course of my remarks, to address to the Prime Minister a question that I would have addressed to'him during question time had events not shaped themselves as they have. I have reason to believe that the speech which the Minister for Transport and External Territories ( Mr Ward) made in this House last week-to which reference has been made-ha s been the object of a censorship embargo, the effect of which is to prevent the transmission overseas of any portion of that speech. I desire to ask honourable gentleman wish to discuss the statement of the Minister? the matter that I desire to raise concerns the censorship. I ask the Prime Minister whether or not, as the result of a censorship instruction, no portion of the speech which the Minister for Transport and External Territories made in this House last week has been permitted to be transmitted abroad. If the answer be in the affirmative, then I ask the right honourable gentleman whether or not he will give an explanation of the imposition of censorship upon a speech by one of his Ministers?

Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) has told honourable members that there is urgent business for this House to transact. That statement will have the concurrence of every responsible member. The present attempt to deprive the House of time for discussion which would otherwise be available to it, is not only a piece of arrant humbug, but also, quite definitely able gentleman must address the House in temperate language. the Prime Minister is taking the view that this is a motion of censure and that it is usual in such circumstances for the House to adjourn.

25,Mr Holt,"I suggest that the Minisleft without adequate fire protection. Perhaps the Minister will take advantage of this motion for the adjournment of the House to tell honourable members why it is that, although it was the duty of his department to see that such an industry was properly safeguarded, no precautions were taken. Perhaps honourable members are not aware that many vital industries in Victoria are at the moment paralysed, and it is difficult to say just how far the damage will extend. Perhaps the Prime Minister could devote some time, which would otherwise have been devoted to the business of the House, to making a state of the critical position that has developed ment, either in the House or outside, upon what emergency action the Government proposes to take to ensure that Victorian industries shall be set going again. It is a piece of bitter irony that and because war production is being on this day he should give notice of another motion dealing with the control nf the coal industry. member may not refer to anything which occurred in the House before the motion now before the Chair. week that the name should be altered from coal-miners to code-miners because the industry has become completely entangled in codes of one kind or another. As I said, it is a piece of bitter irony that, at the very time of this disastrous outbreak of fire in Victoria which threatens the supply of coal and power in that State, all the southern coal mines in made to the miners, in spite of the triNew South Wales should be idle because of a dispute which this Government apparently can do nothing to settle. A few days ago, the Prime Minister told the House quite frankly that the measure of the country's war effort during the next few months, and perhaps the whole of this year would be the quantity of coal which could be produced. Then he waved his arms, and said that he wished some one could tell him how to get more coal. As a matter of fact, we do not need to tell him, because he told the House on the 14th October, when he outlined a carefully prepared policy for coal consergoing to give those States which are so vation and increased production. He told us of the measures which the Government proposed to enforce, and we were so impressed by them that, in spite of our concern over the dangerously low level of coal stocks, and over the fact .that industry would necessarily be interfered with owing to the shortage of coal, we raised no objection to his proposals. In fact, we approved of them. His policy seemed to be eminently satisfactory and sound. Here are some of the features of the Prime Minister's scheme: He proposed to bring into the industry 600 exminers; he proposed to weed out the undesirable element from among the miners by an examination of their attendance records; he was going to mechanize many of the mines. Because in Victoria, because responsible men in charge of industry and in control of public utilities in New South Wales have declared that stocks are dangerously low, hampered, we are entitled to expect from the Prime Minister something more than a gesture of helplessness. If that is the best he can do it is time this country had another government. It is significant that the Government has had to admit that production has seriously declined during the last twelve months, although during this period the Government has had a full measure of electoral support. It could not complain that its parliamentary position weakened its capacity to deal with the problem, yet during this very period production, instead of increasing, has declined. In spite of all the concessions that have been bunals that have been set up to deal with their claims and disputes, production has declined. The people of Victoria are vitally concerned in this matter. They have discovered almost overnight in what measure the successful conduct of commercial operations in that State defends upon the production of coal either m Victoria or elsewhere. I remind the Government that the coal is here to be won, and we have the men here to do the job. Does the Prime Minister propose to allow this condition of anarchy to continue, or is he drastically affected by the present coal shortage some idea of what emergency action he proposes to take?",12,Adjournment Statement By Mr E J Ward M P Notice Of Motion Of Want Of Confidence Censorship Bush Fires In Victoria Coal Mining Industry

27,Mr Holt,"It was suggested lastdesire to add something to what has been said by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt). Since the House is to adjourn, and as it is not proposed to proceed with the important business of which the Prime Minister has spoken, I suggest that he might, in the interval between the adjournment of the House and the resumption of the debate tomorrow, look into that code which says that men who cause strikes in coal mines may be called up for military service or for work with the Allied Works Council. I ask the Prime Minister whether any one has yet been called up under that provision? I do not think that any one has. These miners, who can earn from £7 to £15 a week-wit h a minimum amount of labour a man can earn £7 a week in the coal mines-migh t well be called up, and men who have served for three or four years in the Army might be released to taketheir places. The present position is acute. Munitions factories have closed down, and others will close shortly. It is high time that action was taken along the lines which I suggest. I wish to identify myself with some of approached the Attorney-General (Dr. the remarks made by the honourable memEvatt). ber for Fawkner( Mr Holt).

It has been found that the safest way of working the pillars is by means of the scraper loader. Between 40,000 and 50,000 tons was taken out by the scraper loader without the slightest accident over a period of three years. Then, on representations being made by the miners, who thought that their jobs were endangered, the Minister for Mines, Mr Baddeley, had the act amended in order tocompel the removal of the scraper loaders. I remind honourable members that Mr Baddeley represents Cessnock and is, therefore, dependent upon the miners for his seat in the State Parliament. The miners continued working the three-lift system with picks, and it was found that the time factor in taking pillars was the main factor to be considered. The quicker the pillar was taken out, the more coal was saved. The miners know that they cannot control the roof with two men on the pillars and yet they object to a threeman lift.

It is necessary for the House to understand the true position about this particular hold-up and that the country should know the general conditions which obtain in the coal-mining industry. I have a question to ask the Prime Minister and I think that he should answer it, because, if the answer is in the affirmative, it is time that action was taken by the country to see that this humbug about the winning of coal was done away with and the facts were brought to light. I ask the Prime Minister whether he proposes to appoint the Commonwealth Coal Commissioner as the supreme authority in the coal-mining industry and that Mr A. 0. Willis is to be his industrial officer? Will the right honourable gentleman inform the House whether the Government or any member of the Government has issued or proposes to issue instructions to the. Coal Commissioner that he must: (1) refrain from allowing the employment of free labour in the mines; (2) if the miners threaten a general stoppage at any time, give way to their demands ? I charged Mr Willis last week with being completely biased. I declare now that he has taken instructions from Commonwealth Ministers in regard to the coal-mining industry. ter must give a clear-cut answer. ister) [3.27] -in reply-D o I understand that the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) says that I have issued instructions to the Coal Comhonorable gentleman whether he has. man said that I had done so. Prime Minister, or any other Minister, had issued, or proposed to issue, such instructions. We are debating a motion for the adjournment of the House. It was moved Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) moves a censure upon the Government, that matter must be decided before the Government can confidently continue public administration. That is the invariable practice of all parliaments and has been the practice of this Parliament. 1 did endeavour to find a way in which the notice of motion could be debated with a minimum of delay in the conduct of public business, but the right honourable gentleman, no doubt for reasons that he thinks proper, and which are not for me to question, desires that the matter shall be dealt with to-morrow. Therefore, unless I was prepared to do what I would never do, namely, treat the views of the Leader of the Opposition with disrespect, I had only this choice-eithe r to continue the public administration and the business of this House as though the motion were not seriously intended and could have no possible effect, assumptions which I am not prepared to make, or move the adjournment of the House. Honourable gentlemen sitting behind the right honourable gentleman desire to treat his motion with far less respect than I have treated it. They have treated it as though it were an intrusion into matters which they deem more urgent or more vital. That is their business. But I have a duty to the authority of Parliament. I endeavour to respect it. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition, next to myself, has not only a duty to Parliament, but also rights in Parliament, which even the head of the Government cannot claim.

Contracts have been let for supply of a suitable three-piece civilian suit and hat to members of the forces, upon request, at the time of discharge. The cost to the Commonwealth is approximately £3. Supplies are now becoming, available but in any case where suit and hat cannot be supplied, a cash allowance of £.3 is made to the member. The question whether the price of the suit should he increased is now receiving consideration. 2. No. The general conditions of pay and allowances in the case of the New Zealand Forces are not the same as in the case of the Australian Military Forces. For example, members of the New Zealand Forces who do not serve outside New Zealand are not eligible for deferred pay, whereas members of the Australian Military Forces receive deferred pay after six months' service in Australia. Also the rate of deferred pay in the case of the New Zealand Forces is substantially less than in the case of the Australian Military Forces. Commerce and Agriculture, upon notice1. Is it a fact that there is a serious shortage of cases in the Stanthor.pe fruit district threatening an approximate loss of £60,000? 2. If so. will he indicate what action has beeu taken to meet the position? answers to the honourable member's questions are as questions are as follows:1 and 2.

Can he say why regulation 27EA of National Security (Coal Control) Regulations was invoked against the management of Abermain No. 2 Colliery? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The approximate total cost of the campaign since its commencement on 6th December, 1943, is £11,000. Precise information as to the total tonnage of coal lost through strikes and absenteeism since that date is not yet available, but approximates 400,000 tons. 2 Tonnage loat. State. Strike?. New Wales Queensland . . 1,732,300 Victoria Western Australia Tasmania Losses from absenteeism disclosed above cover those resulting from both avoidable and unavoidable absenteeism. It is estimated that at least 50 per cent, are due to unavoidable causes. 3. Tbe tonnage of coal lost in New South Wales from all causes during the month of January was 248,797 tons. Precise information from the other States is not yet available. Prosecutions have been launched against 114 persons. 4. A stoppage of work occurred at the mine over a question as to whether or not the safety of employees was endangered or likely to be endangered by methods of working then in operation, or proposed to be put into operation, at that mine, and having satisfied myself that' the question was one which ought to be determined in accordance with the regulation I took the appropriate action provided by the regulation to meet such circumstances. General, upon noticeWhat arrangement, if any, has been entered into between the Attorney-General and the miners' federation with respect to prosecutions for offences against the National Security (Coal Control) Regulations? entered into between the Attorney General and the miners' federation at any time with respect to prosecutions for contraventions of the National Security (Coal Control) Regulations. As to contraventions of any National Security the Regulations committed prior to the 1st November last, an amnesty was granted by the Government as a result of the conference held in October last. Since that time there has been a substantial number of prosecutions for absenteeism. War Organization of Industry, upon notice1.

If so, will tbe Government transfer the subsidy usually paid to the shipping company to tie airways company, who are providing extra services, to enable them to make provision for citizens to travel by air at steamer fares during the period the shipping company is unable to provide a substitute vessel7 honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The steamer service between Tasmania and Melbourne will be suspended from 18tli February, 1044, for approximately five weeks to enable the steamer concerned to undergo essential repairs. It was intended to utilize another vessel on this run during the period that the regular steamer was undergoing repair but thiB vessel is being used for other essential duties. 2. The Postmaster-General's pays a subsidy in respect of the mail service. The subsidy amounts to £30,000 per annum and is paid on a trip basis. Tlie basis of payment iB as follows:-Summe r time-table, £15,000--13 0 voyages equal to £116 7s. 8d. per voyage; winter time-table, £15,000-9 0 voyages equal to £156 6s. per voyage. As the steamer concerned is under requisition to the Shipping Control Board tbe subsidy is paid to the board and not to the owners of the vessel. 3. The subsidy is paid only when the trips are carried out and will not be payable whilst the service is suspended. The exigencies of war have to eome extent interfered with transport generally and citizens generally are put to inconvenience and in many cases extra expense in necessary travelling from place to place. To grant a subsidy to Australian National Airways to enable citizens to travel by air to and from Tasmania at steamer rates would invite similar applications from many directions in the other States and would create a precedent which the Government could not resist in considering those applications. In the circumstances it is regretted that a subsidy cannot be granted in this case. upon notice1. Isi t a fact that rising costs of all requireinto consideration. ments and labour for dairying have made it unprofitable to carry on the industry T 2. Isi t a fact that the aim to have more factory butter available for export has brought about prohibition on the sale of cream and restriction on the output of dairy butter, causing farmers to Bell their dairy herds and resulting in a reduced number of farm-fattened pigs? 3. Isi t a fact that, for the year ended the 31st March, 1943, dairy cows in Tasmania were reduced by 6,830 and one and two year old heifers by 13,023, or nearly 20,000 potential dairy cows? 4. Is it a fact that, as a result, there is likely to be a very serious shortage of milk in Tasmania, and that unless action ia taken to alleviate the position of dairymen by an immediate provision for a fair return for their labour, serious chaos will result in the industry ? 5. Did he recently receive a copy of a resolution carried at a public meeting in Hobart emphatically protesting against the unjust The answers to the treatment being meted out to these dairymen, and requesting him to take necessary action to relieve the position? 6. What action docs he propose to take to bring about better conditions for this section of the community? Mr 'Curtin -The 'answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The dairying industry Bu.bsi.dy of £6,500,000 for the year April, 1943, to March, Department 1944, is calculated to build up the return to dairy-farmers to at least Is. 6d. per lb. commercial butter, which figure covers average production costs as estimated by the industry's own accredited representatives. 2. The restrictions on the sale of cream, icecream and processed milk and the rationing of butter, were introduced as a means of partly bridging the large gap as between total essential demands and prospective production. No restriction has been placed on farm butter reduction, other than the condition imposed y the Rationing Commission to prevent a large potential black market. There is nothing to prevent a registered dairy-farmer from ceasing to manufacture his own butter and forwarding the cream to a butter factory-in fact this is a course that should be encouraged. 3. According to the Commonwealth Statistician, the figures stated are substantially correct. 4. It is not expected that there will be a shortage of milk in Tasmania for essential civilian needs. 5. Without further information as to the name of the correspondent it is difficult to trace the receipt of the resolution in question. 0. A special sub-committee, appointed by the industry's own organizations, is now revising production costs as the basis for a submission for a renewal of the dairy industry subsidy as from the 1st April, 1944, and this sub-committee is definitely taking all factors",17,Tasmanian Shipping Sebviob
