Front immediately with the Imperial Government, to ascertain whether all necessary steps are being taken to safeguard the trade route through tbe Suez Canal and the Mediterranean, with a view to the protection of the Australian export trade. steps have been taken by the Imperial .Government to safeguard its domestic and Empire interests, but we may rest assured that it will not take any action that wilt weaken its prestige or power in any sea in which it is necessary to maintain its strength. Important as is the Commonwealth among the oversea dominions, this Government is hardly called upon to inquire of the Imperial Government whether it is taking, adequate steps for the protection of the Empire, though, no doubt, if notice is taken of the question and answer, additional vigilance will be exercised for the safeguarding of all interests. honourable member for Capricornia asked me whether the British Government had yet recognised the Republic of China.

I wish to ask the Minister whether the facts to the existence of which he refers in his letter as a reason for refusing long-service leave are not ordinary contingencies which should be provided against; and does not their existence indicate that the Western Australian Customs Department is understaffed ? Will the honourable gentleman take steps to bring the staff up to the strength necessary to enable officers to enjoy the leave to which they are entitled under the regulations?

How does he ' discover the grounds ? I think they will be found in the Journals of the Senate. I think the ground was that the Commissioners had acted on prospective population, rather than on the population at the time of the re-distribution. The motion carried by; the Senate was submitted by senator Henderson, and was as follows :That, in accordance with section of the Electoral Act, the distribution be disapproved of intimation that due consideration does not appear to have been given to the diversity of interest and the absence of means of communication between the districts of Mount Magnet and Cue and the other portions of the proposed Division"" D , "" and that the Commissioners be requested to make the distribution on the basis of existing enrolment and not by way of anticipation, so as to give each Division as nearly as is practicable an equal number of electors. I gave the opinion to the Department of Home Affairs that the Minister would be justified in referring the matter back to the Commissioners, and that it was not necessary or proper to include in his reference the grounds given by the Senate, but that he should accompany his reference with the",14,Western Australian Customs Officials

The Minister of Home Affairs must comply with the terms of the Act. It is not the business of this House, or of the Minister, to dictate, or indicate, to the Commissioners in what way they sliall make the proposed re-distribution. It is sufficient for the Minister, and for the Commissioners, that one House of this Parliament has rejected their proposed scheme. It is perfectly proper, however, that the minds of the Commissioners should be informed of the reasons for carrying the resolution, and those reasons they may take notice of or they may not. The Commissioners may give due weight to everything the Senate suggested, or, if they please, they may wholly disregard it.

(i) Nine months occupied in making survey and obtaining necessary poles. The delivery of the poles was retarded owing to the Department having to reject a number which did not comply with the specification. (c) A delay of three months due to shortage of supplies of wire, caused by a shipping strike in London. \d) A further delay of three months and three weeks caused by failure on the part of certain officials at the General Post Office, Melbourne, to forward to Ravwood the wire to be used in the construction of the line.

I do not blame a man for taking the easiest job offering, but this predilection for Government' employment shows distinctly that' the day-labour system, is not the best to adopt. A system under which we do not get out of the men the equivalent in labour for the remuneration paid must be a bad one. We all know that there is a. great deal of the "" Government stroke "" going on. We have seen it going on for many years, and we know that many men employed by the Government take things very steadily. Only three days ago a friend of mine heard two men who were travelling from Victoria to New South Wales say that they were going over because there was "" any quantity of work in Sydney at 9s. and go as you please."" The general feeling is that employment under the Government means an easy billet and good pay.

Under it we do not get out of men the work that is obtained from them by a contractor. system we are saving money, as compared with prices paid for works done under contract. prove anything, but 1 doubt very much whether it can be proved that the day-labour system is more advantageous than the contract system. I was pleased to hear the honest admission made by the honourable member for Gwydir that undoubtedly some men employed by the Government were not prepared to ""do a fair thing."" Other honourable members of the Ministerial party have declared that those who are employed by the Government would undoubtedly be honest enough to give a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. That may be true of some men. There are many who will give an honest day's work for their pay, but there are a great many who will do as little as possible for it. Honourable members, if they are candid, will admit that there are hundreds of men employed on various works who will do as little as possible for their wages. What is going to induce them to give a fair return for their pay? We know how the system is carried on. If one man in a gang is doing a little more than the others think he ought to do, he is told to go steady, and if he declines to do so he gets, in camp, the life of a dog. men are working together under the day labour system. This practice cannot be followed in the case of men employed by a contractor, because the contractor himself is constantly on the work, or"" has overseers to look after his interests. Men employed by the Government under the day labour system are all unionists; or, at least, the Minister of Home Affairs has decided that only unionists are to be employed. the matter of contract work. of a Government job, the ganger himself is a unionist, and is it reasonable to expect that he is going to run the risk of getting himself disliked by his fellow unionists by "" speeding them up.""

When I . first entered this House, two )-ears ago, I raised the question about the Flemington rifle range in my electorate. Since then, members of the rifle clubs at the Sydney end of my constituency have had to pay their own train fares to the Randwick range, and, of course, buy their own meals. Some twelve months ago, it was decided to close the Flemington range owing to the resumption of the land by the State Government; and the members of the rifle range had to go to the Baulkham Hills range, the fare to which men find, however, that, very often, when they go to this range, it is occupied by the regular soldiers, and they have to wait about until dark sometimes without getting a shot. The dispute which prevents the provision of a proper range concerns about two acres of land ; and the whole scheme is hung up simply because the State surveyor cannot find time to send a man to complete the arrangements. This is not a solitary case, for my experience is that of many other honourable members. The present unsatisfactory condition of things has lasted now for about three years; and if men are willing to join clubs and give their time they ought not to be treated in this shabby way. Members of rifle clubs are not paid, and do their work from patriotic motives. We certainly ought not to discourage them in their efforts, because they may prove very useful at some time. The system of voting money for post-offices, and not using the money, is not good from any point of view.

We might as well make the vote ,£10,000 if we do not intend to spend it.

The Minister of Home Affairs and the Postmaster General ought to be just as up-to-date as any private owner of land in those places, and should make provision for the business that will eventually have to be done. The Katoomba Post-office was not quite finished when I was elected, and though something like £1,000 was spent on it, any one could see that it would prove too small. Within two years we are asked to extend that post office at an expenditure of another £|i,7oo; and this, in my opinion, is an example of false economy. In growing districts, where the population is assured, the Department ought to take a sensible view, and provide adequate post-office facilities.

Nowadays we can hold the secretaries of the unions responsible for what, happens. wish to say anything unkind, because every man has to earn his living; but before the establishment of unionism work was not done as it is to-day. weed out unsatisfactory men. and I sa.y now -and I propose to prove it-that we have in the Department of Home Affairs a staff, including officers, overseers, gangers, and If he will do so workmen, equal, if not superior, to any other 600 men in the world.

It is as followsOn the subject of the relative merits of the day-labour system as compared with the contract system, in my opinion, the day labour or departmental system should generally prove to be the more satisfactory, provided that the supervising officers carry out instructions and insist upon a fair day's' work fb r a fair day's pay. The Department pays the same wages to its employees as a contractor, and should be able to purchase material at reasonable prices. success of the System depends, to a great extent, upon efficient supervision and a willing cooperation of all concerned. This having been secured, there should be no question as to the results. Secretary, Department of Home Affairs, -th August, 1912. Let me read thisIn response to your verbal inquiries, I am not aware of an instance where an employ^ whose services had been dispensed with for misconduct or inefficiency has been re-engaged under your direction-n o such direction has ever been given. I did not make my own life a success without efficiency, and I know that no man can make his business a success if he does not get' an opportunity. We, therefore, put those officers there, and give them a chanceAs a rule, the men engaged by the Department on day labour do a fair day's work; the services of any man found to be unsatisfactory are dispensed with. Naturally, at the inception of any great day-labour system a certain proportion of men taken on f a l l short of requirements-thes e men are not retained. ThenI have the followingIt is reported by the Director-General of Works that the construction of forts by day labour has proved unquestionably the most economical method. A fort has recently been That is exactly what the Department of constructed at Point Nepean under difficult conHome Affairs has done. The following ditions of access and isolation, and the cost has figures will be of interest as showing the been much less than a fort of the same size growth of the expenditure on new works erected a few years ago under contract, notwithsince the year 1909-1.0standing the increased value of labour and maComparison of the Amounts expended under "" Ac Litions, New Works, and Buildings "" during the current and the two receding Financial Years.

The actual cost of the fort at Nepean has been somewhat over one-half of the original rough estimate prepared by the War Office. The alterations to forts for new armament done by day labour have been done within the estimated cost and economically. I have further reports as followsThe largest building constructed by the Department under day labour is the new Treasury Building, Melbourne. My Department's estimate was £27,000 for a gross floor area of 41,000 square feet. (The building is costing The about £3,000 more than the iqio estimate, accounted for by all-round increase in cost ot construction.) As a comparison between the cost of the building by day labour and under contract, the Commonwealth has just received tenders for a large building in Adelaide; the lowest tender works out at about 20 per cent, more per cubic foot than the cost of the dav-labour job in Melbourne. A few years ago rifle ranges were constructed by contract. The Director-General of Works advised that the works should be executed by day labour. The result has been that ranges of two or more targets cost, under the latter system, from £ 5 0 to £ 8 0 per target complete, as against the cost under contract of £ 8 0 to over £100 per target. I did not introduce this system. I believe it was introduced by my predecessor, the honourable member for illawarraProbably one of the most striking examples in this country of the all-round advantages of the day-labour system is that of railway construction in Queensland. It has been an almost exclusive operation in that State for over ten years, with the well known results that costs are lower, and there is an absence of expenses, lawsuits with contractors in settlement of more or less righteous claims. I understand the success of the principle there is that officers in charge of works have extensive individual powers, and there seems no reason why the Commonwealth should not proceed on similar lines under suitable men.

The primary object of acquiring the 85,000 acres was to enable tlie Department to proceed with the initial works in connection with the establishment of the city. The area embraces the city site, the lands traversed by the pipe line to the Cotter River, some of the land lying between the city site and Queanbeyan, the sewage farm, the afforestation area, and the weir site on the Cotter River. The initial works proposed include power plant; brick works; weir, Cotter River; rising main; bridge and tunnels; railway to Queanbeyan; road-making and deviations; joinery timbers; further building work at Acton; accessory accommodation for workmen; afforestation; and surveys for various purposes. works are shown in a printed statement of works attached to my memoranda. just as ridiculous for members of the Opposition to ask me to have an inquiry regarding the Argus statements as it would be for me to ask them to institute an inquiry concerning the various councils all over Victoria which are saying that there ought not to be a Federal city built at all, but that the Federal Parliament should sit in Sydney or Melbourne. A great many people have the foolish idea that tlie Federal Capital is not a paying proposition. hold that the Federal Capital is the greatest asset that the Commonwealth possesses, right from its start. The following is the revenue from it:-Rates and taxes, £ 2 , 8 0 0 per annum ; licences of various descriptions, say, .£500 per annum; premises, & c , leased by departmental officers and employees, .£1.500 per annum ; rentals to be derived from land recently acquired, about £^30,000 per annum ; total actual and estimated revenue, .£34,800 per annum. penditure of £'60,000? we shall have to pay for the land.

That is very necessary, because, unfortunately, in the past the Postmaster-General's Department has been greatly starved, and the Government are to be commended for coming forward with a bold policy of expenditure, although, of course, they are fortunate in having a large and expanding revenue, which other Governments have not had. to blame the Minister for what has taken place at the Federal Capital site, but he seems to be looking at the matter from too commercial a stand-point. Why should he glory in the fact that he is receiving a very large revenue from the men living in the Federal Territory, in the shape of rates and taxes and \ents? Those people are not receiving the same consideration from the Commonwealth that they received from the State. They have no representation, and they ought to have it. it to them ? is impossible. Why not put all the Territories together, if there is not sufficient population in any particular case? The honourable member for Gippsland laughs, but there should be no taxation without representation. These men are having their lands taken away from them, and they do not know when they are going to be paid for them. The men who pay the revenue that the Minister speaks of have to be considered. promptly for their land? ister is not to blame for that, because it is difficult to take over a big area and immediately arrange all the details. I am not going to join in the slandering of the officers or the men working at the Capital site. I have been there a good many times, and I can say that Colonel Miller, Colonel Owen, MrH ill , Mr Oakeshott, Mr Haigh, Mr the difficulty, because private people in the Oxenham, Mr Brilliant, and the paymaster, Mr Piggin, are all good men, and have done good work. been charged against the day-labour system there, because a few "" wasters "" have been employed there, and it is of no use trying to gloss over the fact. I understand that some definite charge has now been made, into which the Minister has undertaken to inquire. For instance, a large made. nite charge is made, it should be inquired into. If I knew where men were wilfully loafing and ""sponging "" on the Government, I should not consider myself an informer if I made a charge against them. It is the duty of any member of the House, or of the public, in such circumstances, to take action. At the same time, when the I am not going Minister knows that a controversy is going on, it is his plain duty to make further inquiries, and see if what is alleged really exists. I am sure the Minister will do so, or that his officers will if he does not. I have heard a great deal about intoxication in the Federal Capital area, ' b u t there is only one hotel there, and that is miles away from the works. 1 do not join in the cry that it is -i crime for a man to take a drink of whisky. Some of the best men in the country do so. From my knowledge of the officers of the Department, I am sure they would not allow drunken men to work there. The Minister speaks about establishing a branch of the Federal Bank at the Capital, but greater expedition should have been shown in establishing a postal Savings Bank there, so as to give the men a chance to bank their money instead of spending it in ways that, perhaps, were not wise. The Minister said he was acquiring 85,000 acres of land there now. When he does acquire it , the owners should be promptly paid for it. They are asking for some certainty in the matter, and they should be given it . The Minister has not got as far as giving the Capital a name yet. gress at the Capital, although slow, is pretty sure, but I think we ought to insist on a bigger expenditure than is provided for in these Estimates. The sum of £ 1 1 0 , 0 0 0 is to be voted, but that includes no less than .£31,755 of a re-vote. That ought not to be, but I can quite understand district have often to wait for months to get work done through the want of sufficient A good deal has artisans.

Provision ought to be made on these Estimates for the proposed railway from Jervis Bay to the Capital. Surely there should be a vote proposed to provide for a fresh exploratory survey to try and include Braidwood. The Capital must have a port, and a port without a raihvay to it is useless. future residents of the Capital to reach Jervis Bay by means of flying machines ? I should like to ask the Minister whether the proposed railway from Queanbeyan is to be a temporary or a permanent line? manent one. to have that assurance. The railway ought to have been constructed before now, and so have rendered it unnecessary to use teams to carry materials to the Capital. I trust that the Minister will tell the Committee that it is not intended to yield to the agitation in Victoria to delay the building of the Capital. It is idle to talk about making Melbourne and Sydney alternately the Seat of Government. against the selection of the Yass-Canberra site, believing that a better one could be secured ; but we ought to recognise now that the matter has been finally settled. We ought not to bow down to any parochial feeling, but should proceed to establish the Capital as soon as possible. I have visited the site, which adjoins my electorate, more often than have most honourable members. I have seen the men working there, and know many of the officers, and my opinion is that good work has been doneThe roads are a credit to those responsible for their construction, and I believe that the public money has been well expended. Of course, there are some wasters on the Capital site, just as there are some wasters everywhere ; and, in view of the charges that have been made by responsible journals, and repeated in this House, it is the duty of the Minister to institute inquiries, and to give honourable members a straight-out reply like those with which his officers have furnished him to-day. If allegations are made that men are loafing on the Government and no action is taken by the responsible Department to ascertain the truth or otherwise of such statements, disastrous results must ensue. I do not decry the prinThe best assurciple of day labour. I have had some work carried out under that system, and have obtained from it good results. Men, however, are prone to take things easy if they are not well supervised, and unless precautions are taken to prevent anything of the kind in connection with Government works, the outcome will be disastrous to the day-labour system. It is the bounden duty of the Minister of Home Affairs to make Are the inquiries into this matter, just as it is the duty of every member of Parliament, and, indeed, of every citizen, to place the Ministry in possession of the facts, when he knows that the Government are being robbed -becaus e loafing is robbery-by idle workmen. A man need not necessarily be an informer, but if he knows that men are loafing while in the Government employ, he I am glad ought to acquaint the responsible Minister with that fact. I hope the building of the Federal Capital will be pressed on, and I should like, also, to see a name chosen for it. It is absurd to call it Yass-Canberra. Let us call it "" Austral,"" or what honourable members please, but by all means let us give it a name. I think it unwise to make the Department of Home Affairs responsible for all the work at the Capital site. It would be preferable to have a He a r , hear ! Commissioner, or Commissioners, to superI fought vise the large expenditure that must be made there. I should be very glad to see the work handed over to the present Secretary of fhe Department, for he is an able, energetic, and praiseworthy officer. At present he is overworked, and I think that the Government should either hand over the supervision of the Federal Capital works to him as sofe Commissioner, or give him some assistance in that regard, and let some one else take charge of the Department. He ought not to be sweatedThe expenditure at the Capital site will be very great, and we ought to take every precaution to see that we get good value for our money. In the expenditure of public money we should display the same common sense, caution, and enterprise that we would show in spending our own private funds. I know that there is a great deal of unrest in the Capital.

When I was in the Parliament of New South Wales, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in this House, who was then a. very sturdy Democrat, andheld office as Postmaster-General in the State, decided to construct large telephone tunnels in the city ing men generally know the benefits of the of Sydney under the day-labour system. There was at once a huge outcry on the part of the Master Builders, and Contractors' Association, as well as others in symsible. No quarter should be given to the pathy with the members of that society. Charges quite as strong as those made during this debate were then levelled against those carrying out that work, and the honourable member for Hume, who was Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly, was so impressed by them that he A Committee was appointed, evidence was taken, and a thorough and complete inquiry made. The honourable member for Hume admitted that, prior to the inquiry, he was biased against the day-labour system, because of statements which had been made to him by interested parties, but, having gone into the matter thoroughly, he became converted to the system, and has stood firmly by it ever since. After all, day labour is the bed-rock of all public works undertakings. Contractors may occasionally sublet, but, in the end, the work is done by day labour. If contractors can use day labour efficiently, why should not the Government do so? Those who advocate the day-labour system admit that amongst the honest workers there is a certain number of shirkers, and that, therefore, effective supervision is required. Given that, a Government can pay its workmen better wages, provide better conditions, and do its work more cheaply by the day labour system than by the contract system. Of evidence to support this statement there is ample. In the well-known McSharry case, the New South Wales Government, after a dispute with contractors, had to pay, not only the sum in dispute, but many thousands of pounds for the law expenses in arbitration proceedings, which lasted for a very long while. It has been the general experience, in connection with the contract system, that, by reason of the occurrence of conditions which were not foreseen when the plans and specifications were prepared, contracts have often to be altered, and when this happens the Government seem to be in the hands of the contractors, and have to pay dearly for re-adjustments and Equally strong compensation. By the day-labour system this trouble and expense is avoided, and both the Government and the workers gain. All that is necessary to insure the success of the day-labour system is the appointment of competent supervisors possessing sufficient authority. I am sure that workday-labour system, and will use their best efforts to make it as big a success as ppssiuie. No quarter should be given to the sent about his business at once, because neither the Government nor the private contractor can afford to pay f u l l wages to men who are not doing a fair day's work. An attack has been made on the system of preference to unionists. This system has been discussed thoroughly on previous demanded a full investigation. occasions. The employers have always been opposed to giving preference to unionists, because they have found that in the fight with employees they are at an advantage so long as the employees remain unorganized. In the past very many employers have been supporting preference to non-unionists, and the only reply that the unions could make was to claim preference for unionists. When employers are ready to treat all men alike, whether they be unionists or non-unionists, the former will be prepared to meet them; but, so long as black-lists remain, and men are tabooed for being.good unionists, and striving to better their conditions and those of their fellows, the only thing the unionists can do is to demand preference. The Minister should see that he gets competent, capable, and fair officers and men, and that they are given the amplest opportunity to give the best results. Under these circumstances day labour and the recognition of unionists is bound to be a success. Should it be made clear that there is general laxity in the conduct of public works, I shall be prepared to assist in securing an investigation, because nothing could damage the day-labour system and preference to unionists more than to allow a loose state of doing things to continue. As for the Federal Territory, I have not recently visited it, and have no personal knowledge of what is being done there. Like other honourable members, I have received from the Minister invitations to go there, and I know that special provision is made to enable members to see all that is taking place, but, unfortunately, I have not had time to do that. If the press reports in regard to the manner in which the works are being carried out are correct, honourable members are to blame for allowing this state of things to obtain. It must be remembered, however, that these statements are being made when an election is looming, and personally I would take the reports of responsible officers like Colonel Miller and Colonel Owen in preference to newspaper statements. If those who have drawn attention to the press statements here can produce evidence in support of them, 1 shall not hesitate to vote for an investigation to sheet home any wrong-doing to those who may be responsible for it. Passing to another matter, I learn from an interesting and informative pamphlet which the Minister has issued to honourable members that on the 17th October, 1910, he approved of the erection of a new post office at Koorawatha, at a cost of something like £ 1 , 2 0 0 . The work was again approved on the 15th May, 1911, and was supposed to be finished on the 14th June, 1912, a considerable time after the period allowed in the contract had expired. Yet, according to information. I have received from residents of the town, tlie building remains unoccupied, and the postal business of the place is still conducted in the old premises. Perhaps the Minister or the Postmaster-General will inquire why this is, and see that the new building is brought into use as speedily as possible. the statements of the Minister of Home Affairs been made yesterday, there might have been some curtailment of this discussion; but possibly the honourable gentleman was not then fortified with, some of the official reports which he has read. It is not clear from the dates that these reports meet the complaints to which attention has been directed. attack on the administration of the Works Department generally, nor on the day labour system, which has been adopted by every Government for a number of works, and must often be followed. The charge is that certain works are not being properly carried out. This is based in part on the statements of newspaper reporters, men of trained observation, whose word can be taken at its surface value. They are practically never guilty of w i l f u l fabrication; there may be misinterpretation, but, if so, it is probably unTelegraph Department. intentional, and can be removed. the weakest point of the Minister's reply is that he gave us general assurances to meet particular complaints; there is nothing, so far as I can see, to indicate that any of the officers, whose testimony he has read, cover the particular matters to which attention has been drawn by the comments in the press. There has been no definite charge. finite charges in the Argus.

Buti f that be fhe state of affairs, I should be the last to expect the Minister of Home Affairs to say anything of matters that do not come within his jurisdiction, which is ample enough, even for his ambition. I do not attribute to him any desire to annex any portion of the work of the Post and made charges against me.",34,David Miller

There were references made to work done in the Federal Territory, which is under the Minister of Home Affairs. To those references the Minister has read a general reply, although the charges were, so to speak, particular, relating to particular men neglecting a particular part of their duty. As I say, the certificates read by the Minister of Home Affairs are of a general character; for instance, we were told that, ""as a rule,"" the .men do a fair day's work for their wages. Nobody disputes that fact j but the clear implication was that some men were neglecting their work. effect in course of time. The charges were against certain people, and they are not disposed of by a general reply that, ""as a rule,"" the men do a fair day's work. We have also been told that, "" generally speaking,"" the work in the Federal Territory is being well done. No one disputes that fact. What, as I understand, the press alleged, was that there were particular instances of neglect of particular portions of work; and it is no answer to them to quote such general testimonials. orable member advocate the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate those isolated cases? the statements to have been classified and examined in a preliminary inquiry made by the Ministers concerned. should need very little, indeed, to satisfy them that an inquiry is warranted if they found a number of persons in the community under the impression that the state of affairs alleged exists. their work have nothing to fear; the system of day labour is not attacked. It simply remains for Ministers to dispose of particular cases, in which there are alleged to have been departures from the good, sound rule of a fair day's work for a fair day's wage. No one is more interested in having those statements disproved than are the workmen themselves, and none are less well served by attempts to have them disposed .of, or apparently disposed of, by I said they were general assertions not applying to those particular cases. My attention has been called to the fact that, in the important State of New South Wales, according to the newspapers this morning, a Commission of some kind is to be launched on apparently a mere suspicion that the construction of a particular tram line was sought with personal motives. On mere suspicion an inquiry is to be made. was a direct statement, and charges were made against the Government. newspapers, that there was very slight ground for an inquiry. In any case, what has any one here to lose by a fair inquiry ? The Ministers have it in their own hands to appoint the persons to make the inquiry, and to direct the particular subject for examination. No one who is doing his work fairly can be injured by an inquiry. This must have a demoralizing made. in the newspapers. and then we can go on. sufficiently material, perhaps, to merit a reply. Let me say that among the persons who are not called upon to make personal charges are the representatives of the people. We are here to represent the people, and are not justified in assuming any personal oversight of particular officers of the Public Service. They can be reached in a proper way by the regular channels.

There never was a time, either in State or Federal politics, when I held any other view.

I held that view against other Governments; I hold it against this Government. But, when sitting in Opposition, I never knew any kind of Government that did not defend themselves with the contention that the Opposition ought to make a definite charge. I did not agree with that attitude then, and I do not agree with it now. I hold that it is the duty of any Government, whenever any question is -raised as to the honesty or cleanliness of .any Department, to investigate it at once by the instrumentality of men against whom there can be no suspicion, in order immediately to sweep all suspicion away. If the Government and their administration are cleared by the inquiry, the men who have made the accusation are correspondingly -discredited.

Again, if there be any permanent official who, in his capacity as a departmental officer, is called upon to properly execute * certain works, but neglects the obligations of his office by keeping on incapable men. then he is utterly unfit for the position he holds and should be dismissed or suspended. The facts relating to the Postal Department which I conceive to be the proper subject of inquiry, are that most of the permanent officials were hostile to the introduction of the day-labour system, When the Labour Government and almost unanimously reported against it. member seen the reports? that the right honourable member has not seen. The question is one in which I took a keen interest long beforejt was raised in this House. The day-labour system is worthy of investigation. If permanent officials are to blame for any trouble that has arisen, or public men have used their influence to keep on incapable men, they should be exposed. WhilstI take this view, I consider that there is no reason why I should not give a letter of recommendation to a man whom I know from long experience to be a capable and conscientious worker; but I should abuse my position as a member of Parliament if I recommended for employment in any Department a man whom I knew to be incapable. To return, however, to the matter to which I was referring when interrupted, I may say that it is well known that a body of permanent officers reported against the The Argus made a day-labour system in connection with the Postal Department. Only one officer reported in its favour. The Labour party are, of course, bound to the day-labour system. It is well known that our party has always favoured it, and believes that it ought to be extended. That being so, we were bound to pursue that policy, even if the whole of the departmental officers were against us. We did pursue it, and I venture to say that the whole trouble that has arisen, so far as the Postal Department is concerned, is due to the hostility of the great bulk of the permanent officials to the day-labour system, and their endeavour to discredit the one officer who reported in its favour. That is a matter that should form the subject of investigation. We should",40,David Miller

He was shifted on to another gang. ported upon, his reply would have been a Thus kindly do Ministerial comrades protect their fellows. slip? him. The article continuesMeanwhile the public are paying a weekly bill on this work of £1,700. There are those amongst the officials who declare that as much as 30 per cent, of the money is being wasted. T h a t is a f a i r l y definite statement. A couple of instances are given in support. On one contract in Melbourne where £91 worth of material was put underground, the cost of burying it was £1,000. On another, in Flinderslane, £105 worth of material was laid at a cost ot £1,000. From the inspectors' point of view the position is exceedingly awkward. They can put on 20 men to-morrow, but woe betide the inspector who put off one of the elect-o r even suggests that he be put off. If they send in a report they are reprimanded either for not having brought the matter under notice before or for bringing trifling matters under notice. There we have a distinct charge that reports made to the Department have been ignored. One inspector while inquiring into an accident criticism upon himself. at one of the contracts found three watchmen asleep on duty, in one instance, with the tent locked. This was reported-withou t result. If that is true, then there is a. report in the Department to that effect. We are now told by the Minister of Home Affairs that this work is not controlled by his Department. Vesterday, however, when I put questions to him, and clearly indicated that I was basing them upon the Argus article, the honourable member did not tell me that the matter referred to another Department. No; he used language wholly unfitted for Parliament, and quite unfit for a Minister to utter. Instead of saying to me, "" You are finding fault with me, as a Minister, in respect of matters which have nothing to do with my Department,"" he accused the Argus, in very unsavoury language, of suffering from paralysis and Chinese leprosy. It may be all very well for the Acting Postmaster-General to tell us now, twenty four hours after these complaints have been brought forward in this Chamber, that an inquiry into them is being made, but this side has heard of it. If the Minister of proper one. But we heard nothing of an inquiry until to-day. yesterday clearly and emphatically. four Ministerial supporters have expressed the opinion that there should be an investigation. The speech of .the honourable member for Bourke was as refreshing as a lung full of sea breeze on coming from a sick room. In to-day's Argus the gauntlet is thrown down to the Minister of Home Affairs, and 1 challenge him to pick it up. The journal saysHe takes every opportunity to publicly disparage his responsible officers and to indulge ia sickening palaver over the men whom he terms "" brothers"" and "" comrades."" If the party adopts the ""hush u p "" policy and refuses to bring him sharply to task, scandal after scandal will be discovered and hundreds and thousands of public money will be literally thrown away. The honourable gentleman has brought that journal has been attacking me all the week. journal which has a good deal of influence. The Minister went off into the subject of day labour, on the discussion of which a great many hours could be occupied. When Secretary for Public Works in New South Wales, twenty years ago, I tried a very interesting experiment in regard to day labour. There were a good many unemployed asking for employment, and there was a public work which I saw could be carried out by piece-work. I therefore got the engineer at the head of the Department to put on two gangs of navvies, to see at what rate per cubic yard stuff could be taken out of a canal to give the men employed on the work good wages; and it was reported that the rate of 9d. per cubic, yard would give a wage of 7s. 3d. per day.

What they wanted was a fair day's wage for less than a quarter of a fair day's work. The experiment satisfied me that it is absurd to estimate men as on an equality in regard to work done, and that to pay them all alike demoralizes the best workers, and makes the others objects of charity. whom the honourable member experimented were navvies?' of them men wanting work, and were willing to take the work that I offered. I could not give them needlework. The Minister is right in saying that if you employ an army of inspectors at large salaries to overlook contract work you make it more expensive than the day-labour system. In my opinion, the best system is the contract system under competent officers paid to see that the public gets value for its money. backed up by the serious charge against the Minister, constitute, if true, a public scandal. I agree with the honourable member for Bourke that, not only in the interests put into the Law Courts by the contractor. of the public, but also in those of the Government, Ministers should vindicate their character for carrying out these works in a manner that will not permit the gross abuses represented to have taken place. The fact that four Ministerial supporters have courageously stated in thisi chamber that the charges are sufficiently specific and serious to demand an inquiry should induce the Government to have one made. long before any mention was made of these matters in the chamber. pity that honourable members were not made aware of the fact yesterday, when I put my question to the Minister of Home The men Affairs. Had he said that the work complained of was in another Department, and that an inquiry was proceeding, we should have awaited the result in patience. In the opinion of every business man who has read the Argus articles, there is evidence of a public scandal, and unless the Government vindicates its administration by an investigation which will give the lie direct to the newspaper statements, Ministers will be under the suspicion of having been guilty of a gross neglect of public duty. One could not take much objection to the courteous sentences of the Leader of the Opposition, but the same thing cannot be said of the speeches of other honourable members. The statements which have been made took my thoughts back to an effort I made when I first entered the Victorian Parliament to obtain a Royal Commission to inquire into the manner in which the Parliament House in which we assemble was constructed. On two occasions I endeavoured to obtain such an inquiry. Honourable members can see evidence of the bad work of the contractors by going into the Queen's Hall. A man who was too honest to take a bribe was dismissed. Sir Bryan O'Loghlen, previous to my entering the Victorian Parliament, endeavoured to assist him, and the present Chief Justice of Victoria, then Dr. Madden, also tried to do so. My attempt to get a Commission was hopeless. The contractors outside held the Victorian Parliament under their control. The Queen's Hall is said to be the finest hall in Australia, but one has only to tap The statements in the Argus, its walls with a knife, and listen to the hollow sound, to know that the plaster is what the trade calls ""rotten.""

335,Dr. Maloney,"In the second storyevery stone is spotted like the Dalmatian hounds that used to be kept to follow carriages. What is the reason of that? The model stone, with which every other stone was to be compared before being accepted for the building, was stolen. The contractor advertised his reward alongside the Government reward, but he put in rotten stone on the top of the second story, where it can be seen to-day. Mr Francis Gunn asked me if I could obtain an inquiry. He was in the gallery when the scandal was exposed. The honourable member for Kooyong, the honourable member for Ballarat, and, I think, the honourable member for Bendigo, were all. then members of the Victorian Assembly. I could not get an inquiry, and that man, who would not receive a bribe, or take palm oil, could never get employment afterwards. That was the reward of his honesty. Part of the library of the Law Courts fell down, and nearlykilled a man. This noble building in which we meet must be the only one in the world in which timber is used to support stone work. That may be seen by viewing it from the gardens at the rear. The old Treasury, a noble copy of a Venetian palace, is another building which was put op under contract with rotten stone. The statue of the Queen in the Queen's Hall is a sham and a fraud, the head being let in at the hem of the -garment. I learned When the statue was moved to where it now stands, I attempted to climb the steps, but the officer in charge tried to prevent me, and ployed. I remember that when the late I had to threaten to hit him on the jaw. Contract work has been a curse in Victoria. In every single instance, up to the date when I obtained the figures in 1897, contractors had claimed in extras and other charges, more than the original estimates. On the introduction of the butty-gang system, the reduction in the cost was so great that I estimate that day labour has saved close on £2,000,000 to the State. This is shown by the fact that, in the case of subsequent works, the estimated expenditure was never reached, and it is a fair deduction that the old prices would have had to be paid under contract. The honourable member for Parkes, when a Minister in New South Wales, made an effort to meet an unemployed trouble by giving work on the butty-gang system, on the basis of 7s. 3d. for a fair day's work. T dare say the standard was set by good men. stance, could not possibly compete with the more experienced men: so that it is no wonder some could not earn more than is. 6d. a day. but some of the men did, and 1 told them that they had done only is. 6d. worth of work. would be a good way of getting rid of the unemployed-by starving them slowly to death. This experiment was tried at a bad time for labour, there being more men than there was work for ; and I submit that it was an unfair test of the system to have the standard set by the very best men. a navvy at that time was 7s. 3d. a day. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m. have to inspect the work do not do their duty, it is bad for the community, and puts an unmerited slur on day labour, but it is not so bad for the community as having officers who take palm oil from contractors as was done in Victoria.

It is unfair to take the ringers that in Paris. of a shearing shed, or the best two navvies in a gang of 100 to 300 as the test of the work to be done by the whole of those emSir Thomas Bent, afterwards Premier of Victoria, asked me to support his proposal to construct the tramway to Brighton, my vote being sufficient to carry the Bill, I made the stipulation that the conditions of the work should be six days of eight hours, and £ 2 a week as a minimum wage. Sir Thomas Bent, in that jovial way which some honourable members will recall, agreed as to the six days of eight hours each, but instead of fixing the wage at £ 2 a week, he offered to pay 7s. a day. Thus it happened, for the first time in the history of the world, that iii the Parliament of Victoria a section was inserted in a Tramway Bill embodying those terms. the wages before? 6s. 6d. a day, and Sir Thomas Bent, than w,hom there was no man keener in his appreciation of good work, declared definitely that any man was worth 7s. a day, and",44,Smith Th E Article Is The First Time That Any Member On This

We are further informed that the Railways Commissioners do all the deviation work £[10,000 by day labour, as contrasted with contract work. As a sample of how the public are fleeced, six cases are quoted in a pamphlet by the honourable member for Darling, where charges for extras were contested by the Government, and the awards and costs were as follows:Cootamundra-Gundagai-McSharry ... £82,495 Murrumburrah-Young-McSharry ... 12,000 Marrickville-Burwood-Proudfoot ... 5,600 Molong-Parkes-Forbes Baxter and Saddler ... ... ... ... 12,651 Narrabri-Moree-Smith and Finlayson 5,083 St. Leonards-Milson's Point-Owen and McMasters ... ... ... 10,000 These total £'127,829.

In all my experience of political life, I have never found a Department better managed than the Department of Home Affairs, and T compliment the Minister on it. No doubt he is fortunate in having splendid men of great parts under him, and I would raise my voice iu opposition to Colonel Miller being sent away even to take charge of the splendid work of building the Federal Capital. I would rather have him near, where I could, as a representative of the people, make use of his splendid capacity.

359,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"opinion. The real questions are, "" Are men loitering on these works? Are they being paid good wages and not giving a good day's work for them?"" The Minister's statements this afternoon were entirely wide of the issue. All we have had from him is a series of reports written prior to any of these allegations being made, and therefore having no relation to them. Only one general statement has been made since the allegations of the Argus were made, and that is in the form of a report of a very non-committal character by Colonel Miller. is Colonel Owen's report of 7th June, concerning excellent work done on the roads of the Federal Capital. Nobody has said that the roads are not well made there. The statements regarding the Federal Capital are that the, buildings are not being constructed as well and expeditiously as they should be, that loitering is going on there, and that other things are in progress there which do not tend to the speedy building of the Capital, or reflect credit on the Department. The statements made here with regard to the trenches that are being made are that the men are under no sort of adequate control, or that the men are rather controlling the inspectors than being controlled by them. stated that tbe men have had deputations to the Postmaster-General, and that, when the inspectors as a body sought to be represented, so as to put their side of the case, they were refused the opportunity. Those allegations are either right or wrong, and should be susceptible of easy proof or disproof, but the only reply we get is that the Minister is inquiring into the matter. But the Minister is the man responsible for these things. of the Department against which the allegations are being made. He is responsible to the House for the way in which the work will be carried throughIs he, therefore, the man who should report upon the matter, and should his report be accepted as the final statement of the case as far as the Government are concerned? When these matters are brought to issue as between the Government and the public, some independent authority should give an authoritative judgment to the public upon them. No matter what report the Minister presents to this House, it will not settle the matter. about it if that is your attitude ?

If anything were wanted to complete the case for an inquiry it has been supplied by the honourable member for Bourke. He asserts that things are far from being right in the Postal Department. He makes the allegation that there are almost as many inspectors as there are workmen, and that these inspectors are tumbling over each other, so to speak, and are in deadly hostility to the principle that the Government is trying to carry through. That in itself is a sufficiently serious statement to warrant a most searching inquiry. the honourable member's leg."" It has been to know that there are amongst the Ministerial party honourable members who set out to try to fool the Opposition, and in their effort to do so, make very serious statements concerning public officers. I do not believe that the honourable member for Bourke was trying to do anything of the kind. honourable member has the courage of his He is the man in charge convictions. My experience is that he generally says what he means in this House. Five members of the Ministerial party have declared that these matters ought to be inquired into, and my own impression is that quite half of the party think that they ought to be inquired into as promptly as possible. They stand, of course, to their Government and their party, but five of their number have had the courage to say that these matters ought to be investigated. I entirely agree with them. If honourable members opposite are the staunch believers in day labour that I believe them to be, they ought to be the very first to hunt out statements of this kind, and to prove their falsity or establish their truth.

I remember well, however, with what great favour the people, at a meeting held at Darwin, received the announcement of the Minister that the Government would erect a steam laundry there, and that meeting was attended by practically the whole of the local residents. Honourable members generally are not fully seized of the situation in the Territory. Although we were there during the winter months, we found it necessary to change our clothing at least once a day, and during the summer months many men-especi ally those employed indoors-hav e to change their clothing two or three times a day, because of excessive perspiration. -The people of the Northern Territory find that their washing bill is a very big one, and it was suggested to the Minister, on the occasion of his recent visit, that the establishment of a Government laundry would lead to economies. At present all the laundry work is done by Chinese, and .that for many reasons, some of which I should not care to mention to the Committee, is very objectionable. Listaiing to the various speeches made during this debate, I came to the conclusion that the -efforts of the Opposition were specially directed against day labour. I was employed in the Public Works Department for many years, and during that time had the .supervision .of certain works. We came to the conclusion that day labour was preferable to contract labour for the carrying out of those works, and determined to give it a trial. The result was that we found that men employed in making excavations under the day-labour system could do the work at 6id. per cubic yard, although the same work under contract cost ad. per cubic yard. The country was identical, and the same class of men was employed in both some of the men who had been employed by the contractors, the only change made being that we had a different ganger to look after the interests of the Department. With that experience to guide us, we carried out about 90 per cent, of our work by day labour from that time forward, and. in every instance thesystem proved satisfactory. Among all bodies of men there are always to be found one or two who are not willing, or are unable, to do their fair share of work. I am not here, however, to assist the loafer, for I have no time for him. As to the charges, that have been made, my experience in the Public Service of the State teaches me that whenever charges are made against a public body the responsible Minister should have an inquiry made, not by a Select Committee, as is apparently desired by the Opposition in this case, but by responsible officers, with a view of ascertaining whether there is any foundation for them. In many instances I know that there was no foundation for complaints made against a branch of the Service to which I belonged, though in some cases complaints were well founded, and it is possible that some of the men employed on public works by this Government are not giving an equivalent in labour for the wages they receive. Having heard the able statement of the Minister of Home Affairs, I feel sure that in his Department matters are satisfactory, and I hope the report presented to the Acting Postmaster-General will also disclose a satisfactory state of things: The honourable member for North Sydney found fault with those who say that Opposition members favour preference to unionists. I , for one, say that leading members of that party have expressed themselves in favour of it. This is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said in 1904, when speaking on the Arbitration BillI have no sort of sympathy with the man who will work alongside another man and see that other paying every week of his life into an organization to protect his rights and maintain his position, while he himself is skulking and deriving the benefit for which the other is paying and working.

Last year we voted £[2,000 for artesian water bores. Of this amount £[330 was spent; and this year we are again asked to vote -£[2,000. If there is any experimental work on which the Government may freely spend money it is in securing a water supply for the Northern Territory; but I should say that £[2,000 would hardly be sufficient to put down one decent bore, and I am rather surprised at the modesty of the Minister of External Affairs in this regard.

Last year we voted ,£231,000 for post-offices, and only That is very unsatisfactory. I agree that the time has arrived when we should have a staff of our own to carry out our public works.

439,Mr Sampson,"It does to the extentthis year the amount is only £[249,000. That reduction of £[16,000 requires explanation. An effort is being made to extend the telephone system throughout Australia. 1 believe that there is serious cause for complaint in regard to both our telephone and telegraph lines, and I regret that the Postmaster-General is unable to be present to take a note of some of the statements that are being made relative to their construction. When the General Estimates are under consideration, I shall probably have an opportunity to refer to the"" question of private telephone lines, and shall, therefore, not allude to them to-night. I find that, in a report issued by Mr Hesketh in 1910, it is shown that the principal cities of Australia are a long way behind those of other countries in respect to telephone services. I know that during the last three or four years great efforts have been made to improve and extend our telephone and telegraph services. But until about 1909, when the honourable member for Bendigo, as Postmaster-General, provided for an expenditure of something like £[2,000,000, to be spread over two years, in order to bring our post and telegraph services reasonably into line with those "">f -other progressive countries, the Commonwealth Parliament had been remiss in its duty in that respect. 'been hampered very largely by the operation of the Braddon section; but there is now no such excuse for delay. Money has been flowing into the Treasury in the most prodigal manner, and we should be able to push on with these works with greater -expedition than has previously been displayed. Mr Hesketh, in the report to which I have referred, shows that in San Francisco 12 out of every 100 members of the population are connected with the telephone exchange; and that in Pitts""burg, 7 out of every 100 are so connected; -whilst in Melbourne, only 3 out of every 100 citizens are connected' with the ex-change. It ought to be our endeavour to make our Australian cities as up-to-date as are other great cities in the matter of the telephone service. «I have referred only to San Francisco and Pittsburg, because their population is somewhat similar to that -of Melbourne; but the figures in this report show that, whilst we boast that Mel1x>urne and other large centres of population in Australia, are cities of which we might well be proud, we are a long way behind the big cities of other countries in -the matter of the telephone service. 1 thought that the attack made on the Ministry with respect to the day-labour system would have ceased, in view of the excellent reply given this afternoon by the Minister of Home Affairs to the criticism levelled at his Department. The attack is based on reports which appeared in Building, a journal conducted in the interests of builders and contractors; but the Minister, backed up in an excellent way by his officers, has defended his Department, and succeeded in showing that ihe statements made by that journal are untrue. By interjection this afternoon I sought to draw an admission from the honourable member for North Sydney, and also from the honourable member for Moreton, but they failed to respond. The honourable member for North Sydney, together with other honourable members and myself, visited the Federal Capital some time ago, and,' so far as we were able to judge, the buildings there seemed to have been erected in a praiseworthy manner. Every member of the parliamentary party who visited the Capital site on that occasion, admitted that excellent work had been done for the money expended; yet we find honourable members of the Opposition continuing this attack on the Minister. In my humble opinion, It had previously the attack has been made simply because we are on the eve of a general election. In like circumstances, similar attacks have been made, for years past, on all State Ministries. From year to year we hear the cry on the part of the Opposition that some body of Government employees are not carrying out their work effectively. They raise this cry in order that they may go on the hustings and assert that they were the first to make the discovery; but, in this case, they have discovered what is really a mare's nest. We were assured by the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Postmaster-General, that an inquiry would be made into the allegations made by the Argus as to waste of time on works in the Postal Department. Speaking with some knowledge of the question, I do not hesitate to say that it is difficult for a layman to say whether a man who is stringing or undergrounding wires is doing a fair day's work. For instance, when wires are being strung, the supervizing officer will be careful to have a man on the watcha man who appears to be doing nothing at all, but who is really taking care that the wire' is well strung, and is not left sagging over the roadway, 'so as to lead to an accident.",54,Smith Th E Honourable Months At The Present Time I Have Only
440,Mr Laird Smith (Denison) [9.14].,"I am well acquainted with an officer, who, on the report of one of the Opposition members, had preferred against him the charge that he was not utilizing his men to the best advantage. pears that, whilst engaged in stringing wires, he placed a man some distance back to see that the wires did not sag down so low as to obstruct the traffic. An inquiry was held, and the officer's explanation was accepted by the experts, because they knew that in so placing this man he was taking precautions to avert what might, perhaps, be a very serious accident. read in the press of a gentleman who, while driving along a roadway, was fouled by a sagging wire, and received injuries which led to his bringing an action against the Government for ,£2,000 damages. Mr J. H . CATTS -He obtained a verdict for ^650. man had been watching the traffic that accident, probably, would not have occurred. Judging by their speeches, some members of the Opposition, if they saw a postal employee standing on the roadway with his hands in his pockets, would say that he was loafing, although, perhaps, he was keeping an effective watch on the wires that were being strung. I agree with the honourable member for Franklin when he says that it is wrong for members of Parliament to go round spying on public servants. It should be beneath our dignity to do anything of the kind. As to the employment of day labour in excavating trenches, what is the position? trenches were being excavated for undergrounding wires, long before the Labour party came into office, so that every engineer should be able, from practical experience, to determine the actual cost of putting down conduits and undergrounding wires. When it is proposed to carry out such a work, the Minister asks the engineer for an estimate, and the engineer in turn applies to his officers to furnish him with one. pared and submitted to the Minister. Long experience teaches me to say, "" Woe betide the engineer who exceeds his estimate."" The Minister thus knows what the work is going to cost, so that if loafing were indulged in, perhaps half-a-dozen of them have been it would be quickly discovered. Mr J. H . CATTS -If the men loafed the that it is, I think the Minister will be work would exceed the estimated cost. gineer would have to furnish an. explanation. Judging by the speeches of honourable members of the Opposition, it is assumed by them that every officer, whether he be a lineman, an inspector, or an assisI t aptant engineer, is able to go direct to the Minister. Experience shows, however, that that is not the case. A sub-inspector obtains a report from his overseer, and submits it to the Chief Electrical 'Engineer, who in turn submits it to the Minister. Every one of those officers would have to be in collusion not to carry out these works effectively, if there were any substantial ground for the charges that have been made y Only the other day we yet we find honourable members opposite accepting as true a report that states that men, when spoken to by their superior officer, run straight away to the Minister. No self-respecting Minister would receive a subordinate officer in that way. If he did,, there would be no discipline in his Department, and the Chief Electrical Engineer would very quickly furnish a report on the subject. Mr J. H . CATTS -The officers would not put up with such a system. immediately protest. The Chief Electrical Engineer surely has the courage of his opinions; if he has not, he has no right to be in the position that he holds. No Minister, no matter to what party he belonged, would insist upon an engineer retaining in the Service men who were drunk or incapable, as is alleged in this report. If any report on the subject had been submitted to the Minister, or to the responDay labour was employed, and sible officer, the Minister would be already conversant with, the fact; but the Prime Minister told us yesterday that he would have an inquiry instituted at once, and would report to the House. What more could be desired? I fail to see why honourable members of the Opposition should have made such grave charges as they have during this debate. The honourable member, for Wakefield has made a general charge The required estimate is then preagainst all men employed on the day-labour, system. He has asserted that every one of them is shirking his duty. There are some thousands of men employed in the Postal Department, and it is asserted that guilty of idling away their time.

According to information I have received from the secretary of the Workers Union, men employed on excavation works at the Sandy Bay rifle range are asked to find, not only a shovel, but a pick. their own shovels. complain of that; but to ask them to find their own picks is lo ask too much of them. 1 found during the recess that the wireless telegraph station in my State was being effectively constructed by day labour. Indeed, '(some who were employers of labour abandoned contracting, and themselves accepted employment. The Commonwealth Public Service is not made up of men who merely seek to while away time for the sake of dirty lucre; it is a conscientious body, prepared to do good work for the remuneration it receives. If things were as honourable members opposite say they are, there are practical men in this Committee who would soon become acquainted with the state of affairs, and the officers responsible There is a fair amount on the Estimates would not continue' in their positions. I am delighted that there is on the Estimates .£1,500 for a post-office at North Hobart, a very progressive part of the city, which, for a long time, has needed better postal facilities. The new office will be a great boon to the public. When I approached the Minister of Home Affairs about a property in my constituency that is for sale by the State Government, he went to Tasmania at his earliest convenience, and purchased it for £[7,000 or £7,500. than two years ago. I saw a telegram which he received a few months afterwards offering £[10,000 for the property, and today, judging by the price paid for land on the opposite side of the street, it would fetch £14,000 at auction. That was a transaction carried out in a business-like way. Honourable members have complained that sums voted by Parliament are not spent quickly enough, but I have ascertained that the Home Affairs Department has only eight months in which to spend the parliamentary votes, and that prior to the advent of this Government a much larger staff was -needed. There has been great difficulty in getting suitable men, and had things been rushed too much, employers and others would have complained bitterly against the Government for absorbing all the available labour. Now there is more labour offering, and an effective staff has been . organized, so that greater expedition may be expected. of the money voted for Tasmanian works was spent last year. ment has to use the services of Tasmanian officers, who naturally give precedence to State works; but the time has come when the Minister of Home Affairs should have a staff of his own in Tasmania. The Commonwealth work there will increase by leaps and bounds, and the State officials will be unable to cope with it. Moreover, no man can serve two masters, and recently the Tasmanian Minister for Works stated that he would not recognise the principle of preference to unionists. apply to Commonwealth work. was made in regard to Commonwealth work. Therefore, we are likely to have trouble under this system of dual control. for the extension of telegraphs in Tasmania. A great deal has been done in the Denison and Franklin divisions, by increasing the number of telephones, to bring the people closer together, and almost every fruit-grower is now connected with Hobatt. This is good, and, I believe, profitable, work. If it would not be too costly, I should like to see a system of bookkeeping followed which would show how much the Commonwealth spends out of revenue on works which, under State control, would have been charged to Loan Account. The Commonwealth Government must save the taxpayers a great deal in connection with telegraph and telephone works alone by paying for construction out of revenue, instead of charging it to loans, and thus creating a big interest debt. I thank the honourable member for Franklin, and the other Tasmanian representatives, for the assistance given to me in trying to procure the location of the Commonwealth woollen mills within the State. The honourable member for Franklin not only showed Mr. Smail over his district, but also helped me to show him over mine, and I am sure that Mr Smail appreciated the assistance that he got. My connection with h m con; vinced me that he is a conscientious and fair-minded man. who, in making his choice of a site, consulted what he believed to be the best interests of the. Commonwealth.

I have no desire to destroy Socialistic institutions, and feel that it is wrong for honourable members to fight in the interests of their districts, regardless of the Commonwealth interests. SinceI listened to the remarks of the honourable member for South Sydney yesterday I have made some inquiries regarding the work carried on by the Public Works Committee of New South Wales, seeing that a similar body has been proposed for the Commonwealth. I understand that this Public Works Committee, after a railway or other undertaking has been suggested, simply decides whether or not the money shall be expended; and I have heard it said that the Committee, deal only with works which are estimated to cost over a certain sum of money. ther said that when the Committee reports unfavorably in regard to any work, the Government, if they desire to carry it out,, simply split it up into sections, each of which will cost under £[20,000. dare not do that. No work reported against by the Public Works Committee has Wales Government. hear that my information is not correct. I am told that when once the Public Works Committee have submitted their report, they have nothing further to do with the work.

The complaint made by honourable members opposite is that there is a lack of supervision; but that difficulty is at once got over by the suggestion that efficient officers to supervise should be appointed. I am well satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister of Home Affairs; and I feel sure that the Minister* of External Affairs, as representing the Postmaster-General, will carry out the inquiry he has undertaken to the satisfaction of every honourable member. [9.44] I must take exception to one or two statements made by honourable members opposite, particularly by the honourable However, I do member for Denison, who declares that I have made a general charge against one and all of the men employed by day labour. The Honorary Minister made a similar statement very persistently the other day; and, in reply, I have merely to say that the Hansard report of my speech, which I have not altered in the slightest degree, will speak for itself. I have not a word to retract that I said.

Further, what I said yesterday has been endorsed to-day almost entirely by the honourable member, and also by four honourable members sitting behind the Government; indeed, fhey endorsed, not only what I said, but what has been said by each honourable member on this side. Unlike the honourable member for Denison, I amnot in the least degree satisfied with the explanation of the Minister of Home Affairs, who, in my opinion, sailed all round the question, and did not touch the salient points on which we require information. -by the Honorary Minister is the first I have heard that an inquiry is now going on into the charges made by the Melbourne Argus. At all events, I am going to press this matter, in the interests of the people, until we have a satisfactory answer by the Government. If Ministers can clearly and absolutely refute the allegations made tions ? ister of External Affairs willknow what they are, if he does not know now; at any rate, four of his own supporters have -spoken pretty clearly regarding them. I shall not press the question any further, but await the report from the Minister responsible for the inquiry. The Minister of Home Affairs has not, as I say, refuted the charges made against the administration of his Department. I have as much admiration as anybody for the training, ability, and integrity of the officers in the Department of Home Affairs; and I should be very glad to be satisfied that they are allowed to control their branches, and supervise the expenditure under their control, without any political interference-inter ference which may be responsible for inefficiency and wasteful expenditure of public money. The Minister told us that, according to the Director of Public Works, it is impossible to institute a comparison between the cost of works carried out by the Department and works carried out by contract. -difficult, not that it was impossible. Willing to make that concession, but I took the words down as the Minister said them. He told us that it was impossible to have A comparison, because no two pieces of work are precisely alike. Later on, however, the Minister of. Home Affairs, quoting, I believe, the ""Director of Public Works again, congratulated himself on the success of the Department in completing the new Treasury buildings without much exceeding the estimate. I think the honourable gentleman said that the excess over the estimate was something over £[3,000. 10,000 more square feet:-w e put on another story. place a report has been called for, which will show in detail the estimated cost of this building, the amount of a tender that The intimation was put' in, and what the actual cost has been up to date. This report will also, I believe, make allowance for the size of the building as originally designed, and the size with the additions spoken of by the Minister of Home Affairs. We shall then have, perhaps,"" some evidence on which to form a judgment as to the success of departmental works. I should like to point are the allegaout that, according to the Minister of Home Affairs, the Director of Public Works, while declaring, for the reason given, that a comparison could not be instituted, proceeded to institute one between the new Treasury buildings and some new buildings in . Adelaide, for which, I believe, a tender has been called. A comparison cannot be instituted between a building in Melbourne and a building in Adelaide, unless all the details are available. The industrial turmoil of the last year or two has been such that contractors will not undertake buildings in Adelaide unless they have an enormous margin to work upon. There are contractors there who infinitely prefer to put up a building on the percentage system, charging about 5 per cent, for supervising the work, to taking the risk of the contract themselves. It is a question of the unions that is troubling the men. If it were not for this, there -would be scores of houses going up in Adelaide for the workers, constructed by the State Government under an Act of Parliament. inaccurate statement. lutely correct.

Possibly that is correct; but the honourable member did not tell the Committee why the Government did not want the work. I will tell the Committee for him. Just about this time Mr Verran, the then Labour Premier of the State, had in hand another railway-fro m Port Lincoln out in the direction of Minnippa. He declined the contractor's price, and undertook the railway himself. While he was struggling to build it, he was repeatedly sparring with the union organizers; and at last he publicly told the organizers that they made it impossible for him to continue the work on the day-labour principle. He sent for the contractor whose tender he had declined, and asked him to take the work off his hands. The contractor did so, and I believe he has completed the railway which Mr Verran said it was impossible to complete by the Government policy of day labour, because of the labour ""troubles. rary Minister to say to that? wild than anything the honourable member has ever previously said: orable member for Hindmarsh will not make the same statement. thing about it. ments were made in the public press, and have been discussed over and over again in South Australia. When the new Government came into power in South Australia, a Labour organizer at a meeting of the unemployed at the East End Market, came into conflict with one of the Labour members of Parliament, who turned on him and told him that they had just gone a bit too far, and that if they continued kicking the people, the people would kick them back again. He charged this union representative, and others associated with him, with being the cause of the overthrow of the Labour party in South Australia. All these things help to refute the statements made by the Honorary Minister; but in South Australia the people are so accustomed to the way he twists statements for his own ends that they discount all he says. .Australia never kicked me out of the State Parliament as they did you. I never had to seek another district, where I was not known. to; but I will put my record up against the honourable member's with the people o£ South Australia any day in the year. Let me tell the Honorary Minister, also, that one of the present Ministers in South Australia says that the responsible officer over one of the big spending Departments tells him that since the change of Government he is getting 25 per cent, more work, and ten times more contentment among his men. ister is Mr Butler, and the officer is Mr Beyer, who is in charge of the Waterworks Department. The people of South Australia do not need to be told these things, because they know for themselves how the union representatives were chasing the men about from camp to camp. It is because of what I know, and what the people of South Australia know, that I am determined, if possible, to find some means to let the House know how Government money is expended under the day-labour system. At least four honourable members on the other side agree with me. Let me tell honourable members opposite that when they face the music at the next election, they will not ridicule the question of the cost of day labour to the people, as they are doing in connection with this debate. Moreover, I hope that honourable members on the other side who 'have ridiculed the question will, very shortly, have the privilege of recording their names in a division on it. I speak in the interests of every true worker in Australia.

I did not say any such thing. without any qualification, my request for an inquiry. many of the accusations the honourable member has made. He said they were told to him by somebody else, who had heard them from somebody else. Those are certainly not the kind of accusations that I am prepared to endorse. My statements were very clear. I said that whenever aspersions were made upon a public Department, they ought, whether true or not, to be investigated by the Government, in order to clear the name of the Department. T made no assertions as to whether these charges were true or false. I did not even say that there was a vestige of truth in them. So far as the men are concerned, T do not believe that there is; but I said that, even if there were no truth in the statements, the Government ought to accept the challenge and clear the matter up, in order to deprive the Opposition of the weapons which they would otherwise possess. That is why I said I would endorse the request for an inquiry in this case. charges made in the Argus, they are found to be absurd. standing, and that is the allegation of political influence. The honourable member for Wakefield said he was prepared, as a member of this Chamber, to accept the assertion of the newspaper that political influence was used for an improper purpose, But nobody gave the officials a greater endorsement than he did. He, therefore, stands here as a public representative, believing that his colleagues on one side of the chamber or the other, are guilty of conduct unbecoming to public men. Why does he believe that? Is he judging all other members by his own conduct? If his own actions are clean, why does he assume that other public men are not as free from interference in these matters as he is? Why, on the other hand, does he assume that these public officials are free from all blame-that they are clean, independent men who are not to be turned aside from their public duty by a crowd of politicians using their influence improperly ? What sort of public officials are they, if they will allow themselves to be seduced from their duty to the country and to the Departments which employ and pay them, by any class of men in this Chamber? The honourable member for Wimmera actually quoted eight charges made by the Argus in connection with Commonwealth public works. What is the first one? It is that a navvy was seen drunk. .Good God! Is it only on this job that men have started to get drunk ? Have there been no private jobs on which men took too much to drink? If the work was placed under a private contractor tomorrow, would not some man have the privilege of "" liquoring up"" when he wanted to? Of course he would. The next charge is that some of them have smoked. Is this the only job on which they have smoked? Next, it is said that some of them knocked oft when it was raining, and that some of them did not want to work. Things of this kind occurred before ever this woik was started, and will go on long after it is finished. The honourable member for Parramatta very cleverly sought to fasten certain statements upon me As a member of the profession, I have no objection to the honourable member using all the tricks of the trade. I pointed out that the foundation of the practice in the Postal Department to which I referred was laid by a Government having at its head the honourable member for BalWhen one comes to examine the larat.

That was carried on, not under the day-labour, but under the contract system. what system it is carried on, it ought to be inquired into. The point that I wish to make is that I did not say that the practice was commenced in connection with the day-labour system. The honourable member for Ballarat has declared that the day-labour system is not on trial, and the honourable member for Parramatta has expressed a similar opinion; whereas the honourable member who has just resumed his seat has asserted that at the next general election we shall be on our trial because of the introduction of the day-labour system.

The Public Service Act requires the Public Service Commissioner to keep an employment register for recording applications for work, and the distribution of work among applicants according to their order of priority; but that provision applies only to work in a State. My attention was drawn to that fact last night by the Prime Minister. the Act makes no provision for the registra£5'°°°tion of applicants for employment in the Federal Territory. Department has no guiding principle and, so far as I can understand, there are no regulations bearing upon the subject. In view of the debate that has just taken place, it is highly desirable that the Minislast year, but we do not know what it was ter should take action to secure either the passing of regulations bringing the distribution of labour at the Federal Capital into line with the system followed in respect pleted. Year by year we vote money withto employment within a State, or secure an amendment of the Act. Thousands of people who might feel disposed to seek a share in any employment that is to be obtained in the Federal Capital do not know what to do in order to obtain employment there. We are asked here to vote ,£IJO,OOO in respect of the Capital, and it should proing the expenditure of last year, after the' vide employment for a large number of men. Those seeking work, not only within the States, but in the Federal Territory, ought to understand what procedure is to be adopted to secure a chance of obtaining work there. I suggest, therefore, that an employment register should be opened in all the States, so that those who desire work there shall have an opportunity to have their claims considered subject to cerparty stated deliberately that he had it on tain guarantees as to efficiency. By adopting that suggestion, the Minister would save himself a lot of trouble. about time that we had laid before us a definite scheme in regard to the expenditure on the Federal Capital. Year after year a large sum is placed on the Estimates to enable Socialistic experiments to be carried out there by the Minister, who believes in the day-labour system and preference to unionists, and yet we find the most rabid anti-Socialists on the other side voting for expenditure under those conditions. When the Minister was asked last year to explain what a proposed vote of £100,000 on the Works and Buildings Estimates would commit us to, he said that it would commit us to an expenditure of £313,000, made up as follows:-Brickworks, £30,000; Cotter River weir, £30,000; water supply, mains, pipes, reservoirs, pipe tracks, pumping stations, &c, £140,000; pipe bridge over the Murrumbidgee, £40,000; £[25,000 in building a railway from Queanbeyan-which, by the way, he said would be only a temporary line-road making and deviations of existing roads, £10.000; offices at Acton, afforestation, It would seem that & > £ 3!° > c J 00 and joinery timbers, That being so, the honourable member quoting? speech last year, as reported at page 2262, vol.

For instance, we do not know whether the power plant has been finished, or whether any part of it has been comout being told the nature of the works on which it is to be spent, or when they will be finished. We were told last year that £[24,000 had been spent in anticipation of parliamentary sanction, leaving £76,000 of the £100,000 still unexpended; but this year there is a re-vote of .£31,755, makpassing of the Estimates, £44,245. It is, therefore, farcical to propose for this year an expenditure of £110,000, and I intend to move the reduction of the amount by ^50,000, and to press the amendment to a division. I shall do this because of the party aspect which has been given to the matter by the People's party in Victoria. I have been told to-day that one of the most rabid members of the People's excellent authority that the Labour party were bound in Caucus to vote solidly tor this item.

Buti f there is one question which has not been made a party question it is this. I move That the item, ""Federal Capital, £110,000,"" be reduced by £50,000. is time that the Minister gave us a statement as to how far the expenditure of the last two years has carried us. Many electors throughout Australia fear that we are being committed to an expenditure of millions of pounds. Indeed, the Minister has hinted as much, and that this expenditure will take place, regardless of the need for important developmental works and other public expenditure. Very serious protests have been made against the expenditure 011 the Federal Capital by representative bodies throughout Victoria. I have received resolutions from a large number of municipal councils protesting against the way in which this expenditure is increasing. regarded by Ministers as unimportant; but I look upon them as very important.

We have taken possession of the Territory and have resumed 85,000 acres within it. During the year 1911-12. £68,245 was spent on the construction of roads, a bridge over the Molonglo River, the erection of temporary offices and quarters at Acton, the placing of gauges on the rivers, and other preparatory works.

The expenditure on re. sumptions over a series of years will be: between £[600,000 and £[700,000. The Committee is now' being asked to vote money for the laying of pipe lines, the construction of a weir on the Cotter, sewerage, afforestation, and other works of the kind. It will not do everything that must be done in the laying out of the city, but it will do part of the work. Included in the expenditure is the cost of a line from Queanbeyan to the site of the Capital. year that a temporary line was to be constructed at a cost of £[25,000. that line can be made permanent without the slightest trouble. The original intention was to construct a tramway, but now we intend to have a permanent railway. cost more than a tramway? little more; but the sum will not be large enough to destroy Australia. I hope that the Committee will respect the pledge given to the people, and reject the amendment. [ -35]-I have been referred to in con10 nexion with a meeting at which I was present as a delegate from my own district. I regret that some honourable members, probably because they have had little experience of modern and up-to-date municipal government, are prone to belittle the efforts of the municipal councils, and the positions of the councillors, who are doing most useful work, without fee or reward. their own work? in this matter they have not gone beyond their legitimate functions. like Parliament to interfere in their concerns ? does interfere.

When they find that the sources from which their revenue is derived are likely to be depleted by the action of another authority, they have a right to meet together and to protest. If honourable members opposite thought little of those local bodies, they would not be so anxious to decry them every time they are mentioned.

Under the circumstances it is fatuous on the part of the Government to ask for £[110,000.

560,Mr Page,"I think the same. I fopportunity was not given to tfie people of Australia to decide whether they would have a Federal Capital built at all. Sydney could have been decided upon as the Capitali f the amendment fixing the site in New South Wales not nearer than TOO miles to Sydney had not been put into the Constitution at the instance of Sir George Reid and Sir George Turner. I rose chiefly to say that I regret that the plans of these large expenditures are not submitted to the House before the expenditure is incurred. In all the States there is a provision either that the plans of large works should be put upon the table for approval, even though the works have been sanctioned by Act of Parliament, or that a Works Committee, as in New South Wales, shall recommend the expenditure if it exceeds a certain limit, I believe in New South Wales the Committee must recommend any expenditure exceeding £20,000. We, in this Parliament, have no such control over the Executive. Expenditure upon the Federal Capital is of sufficient importance to justify a plan, of whicn this annual expenditure is a part, being ap proved of by the House. There is no provision, for instance, for the deposit of the plan. In most of the States there is a general Act, under which plans have to be deposited in the Surveyor-General's office for the inspection of the publicIn the special Acts there is a provision that the plans shall be deposited with the Surveyor General, and laid upon the table of the House, and that the expenditure on an undertaking sanctioned by Act of Parliament is not to go beyond a certain limit unless those plans are approved of by the House. We have absolutely nothing of that sort in our Acts to control the expenditure of the Federal Government; and I ask honourable members if it is not time for us to have some check upon the aberrations of even the wisest of Ministers. There may be a plan for the Federal Capital approved of by a departmental head, but it has never been laid before the House. It ' may involve the expenditure of two or three million pounds, and it may afterwards be discovered to be wrong. I can understand the honourable member for Gippsland moving an amendment if his desire is to impose some check upon the Administration in this matter, but the real fault is that the House has no opportunity of seeing the plans of large public undertakings.
