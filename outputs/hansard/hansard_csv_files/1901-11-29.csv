1,"Mr Speaker Took The Chair At 11 A.m.,","Fort Augusta, in South Australia, and Kalgoorlie, in Western Australia. The Prime Minister stated that he had not received any such reports. I now desire to ask him when he expects to receive reports on the subject, and whether he has received the communication from the Premier of South Australia referred to in the press this morning. papers a telegram relating to yesterday's proceedings in the Legislative Assembly of South Australia, in which it is reported that the Promier of South Australia, Mr Jenkins, stated thatIf he does not receive a reply from Mr Barton the Premier of South Australia, and the by to-morrow concerning the first section of the western Australian railway, he will telegraph to him again on the subject The Premier in referring to the reply given to the question asked by Sir Langdon Bonython in the H01190 of Bepresentatives yesterday, said that, with all due respect to the 'Prime Minister, the report on the route of tbe railway from Fort Augusta to Western Australia was telegraphed to Mr Barton directly the surveyors returned, and documents were subsequently forwarded. I do not think this can be an accurate report of the statement made by the Premier of South Australia. In response to inquiries made by me, the following replies were on the 20th instant received from the State Governments. From South Australia/A full report, and plan of survey of route of proposed railway to Western Australia will be ready in a few weeks, when a copy will be forwarded. And from Western AustraliaReport ro survey for transcontinental railway is now in print, and copies will .be forwarded immediately they are. available; It is apparent from these telegrams that it was'impossible for a report to be sent to me. In consequence of instructions which I gave immediately I saw the statement in the press a further examination-on e examination had already taken place-wa s made of the< records in my office, with the result that the reply I gave on Wednesday in answer to the honourable member for South Australia, Sir Langdon Bonython's, question was confirmed. No trace appears of any telegram or other document from the Premier of South Australia, forwarding a report on a route for a railway from Port Augusta to Western Australia. In view of the letters from me to the Premiers of South Australia and Western Australia of 20th August the file has been kept open, but no reports from either State have cometo hand. I may perhaps direct attention to the fact that in the telegrams from t>e Premier of South Australia already mentioned, and dated 20th November, no reference ia made to any reports having been forwarded. MinisterWhether any decision has been arrived at with I observed in to-day's regard to the matter mentioned in the following newspaper paragraph :The Premier stated that though he had telegraphed to Mr Barton.a week ago concerning the construction of the first section of the West Australian Railway, no reply , had yet been received. I may say that the Premier referred to is communication referred to a resolution of the South Australian Parliament. orable member's question is as follows :Admittedly, the construction of the line cannot be undertaken without the authority of the South Australian Parliament. On the same principle, the Commonwealth cannot take it over without, consulting the Federal Parliament, and there has. not yet been time to consider that policy, even in. Cabinet, by reason of the pressure of business. YeBterday, or the day before, I sent to the Premier of South Australia a telegram stating that the matter had been awaiting consideration in Cabinet, which has not yet been able to reach it byreasonof numerous urgent questions. the Prime Minister, without notice, if he has received any definite information from the Postmaster-General relative to the increments of the postal officials about which I spoke to him the other day ? made the subject of an official communication from the Treasurer to myself,, and I will give all the information that is available as soon as I possibly can. senting the Postmaster-General, upon notice Whether, in view of the fact that some inland mail contracts have several years to run, the Postmaster-General will negotiate with the contractors so as to facilitate the establishment in Western Australia', of the inland parcel post system, and so extend to the people of that State a convenience enjoyed: elsewhere ?",14,Surveys

P REFERENTIALRAILWAY RATES. ral, upon noticeWhether he is aware that the South Australian Government are charging preferential railway rates over their railways, viz., charging £1 17s. 7d. per ton from Adelaide to Broken Trill on South Australian bacon, and. £5 14s. od. on Victorian, New South Wales, and New Zealand bacon over same distance; and £1 17s. 7d. per ton on South Australian cheese, and £A 12s. per ton for same distance on Victorian, New South Wales, and New Zealand cheese. If so, is it legal, under the Constitution Act, for any Government within the Commonwealth to charge such preferential rates. to the correctness or otherwise of the figures given by the honourable member, but, assuming them to be correct, they are astounding. The Constitution provides that, before the railway rates charged by any State can be dealt with, a law must be passed by the Commonwealth prohibiting preferences and discriminations in such rates, and it can only be enforced on the finding of the InterState Commission. Perhaps that circumstance may indicate to the honourable member the reason why the Government have been anxious that a measure for the establishment of the Inter-State Commission should be assented to before this session closes. Until it is passed there will be no means provided for dealing with such cases as that to which the honourable member has called attention. I may add that my honourable colleague, the 23 H 2 Prime Minister, has placed himself in communication with the different State Governments in order to discover if it is possible to remove some or all of the existing anomalies even without the passage of such an Act, but the question addressed to me, of course, relates to the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth. THE TARIFF. In Commitiee of Ways and Means:Consideration resumed from 2Sth November, 1901 (vide page 7960.) Item 48-Salt, n.e.i., per ton, 20s. Special exemptions Salt, brown rock, and manure. worth) -This is an article which is used in such a large number of industries that we ought to look upon the proposed duty to a very large extent from the point of view of the consumer. The rate of duty proposed is equivalent to from 100 to 125 per cent, ad valorem, and the freight and other charges that have to be paid in connection with such a bulky article as salt, would bring the protection to tlie local salt producers up to 150 per cent. I venture to say that that is a very extreme figure, particularly when we consider the nature of the article. I know that there are different kinds of salt, some of which are of a very fine quality, and that it may be difficult to differentiate between the qualities without leaving loop-holes for fraud. I do not wish to offer any facilities in that direction. In New South Wales and I have no knowledge as in Queensland salt has been admitted free hitherto, but a duty of 20s. per ton was formerly charged in Victoria. I think even the most ardent protectionist will allow that in many of these matters our Victorian friends have taken a very extreme view. It is most difficult in framing a protectionist Tariff to deal justly with the large population of the Commonwealth. Immediately a protective duby is placed on one article there is a clamour for similar assistance on behalf of another industry, and it is often very difficult for the protectionist to so allocate the duties as to give fair protection all round. I am perfectly satisfied that a lower duty would yield a larger revenue. Only £19,600 is expected from this duty, and that I regard as absolutely ridiculous. I do not intend to move an amendment at",15,Inland Parcels Post For Wester Naustralia

13,Sir William Mcmillan (Went,"this moment, because it is very questionable whether the duty should not be reduced to5s. I leave it to others with fuller knowledge to further elaborate the subject, and ask honourable members to look at this question from the broad view of the Commonwealth interest. In addition to this duty, which means about 60 per cent., the local producers have the further advantage of the freight on English salt, which in some cases represents neatly 100 per cent. It is true that salt is brought out as ballast, but that is only on very rare occasions. The effect of the duty will be to raise the price of the English salt, which is largely used by butter makers and bacon curers, and it is a very unwise thing to further harass those engaged in the dairying industry, which has a great future before it, in the way of exporting. America, Denmark, and other countries enjoy special advantages on account of their geographical position, Denmark monopolizing something like 45 per cent, of the import butter trade of Great Britain. lish salt is used in the dairying industry ? that in dairying a large proportion is not used, but the quantity used by bacon curers, stock-owners, and others is considerable. It may be admitted that the Australian product is a good article,' but we should not create protection so as to give the local manufacturer a monopoly, and enable him to raise prices to the detriment of other industries. AVe ought to do all we possibly can to lessen the cost of production in order to put Australians in a position to compete for the trade of Great Britain, and other parts of the world. We are fast taking a position of importance in trade, but there is still a great deal to do; and in the interests of the export trade in butter, hides, and meat the duty ought to be reduced. A large quantity of salt is used by pastoralists and settlers in order to keep their herds healthy, and a duty which will amount to over 100 per cent, should not be imposed. member aware that rock-salt, which is used for sheep and cattle, is on the free list ? brown rock-salt is on the free list, but I am speaking of fine salt and white rock salt, which is largely used by stock-owners, and there is no doubt that sometimes the latter article is crushed up and sold in Australia, as of the higher quality. I move That the words ""and on and after 30th November, 1901, 10s."" be added. Treasurer) -No doubt this is an important question affecting large industries. The State rates are not necessarily binding on us, but it is worth noting tliat in Victoria the duty was 20s., in SoutE Australia 25s., in Tasmania 30s., in West ern Australia 20s., while in Queensland and New South Wales salt was free. The imports into New South Walesi n 1899 amounted to 28,000 tons, and into Queensland 20,000 tons, as agsinst 7,000 tons imported into Victoria, 344 tons into South Australia, and 354 tons into Western Australia. The amount of revenue which we hope to derive at £ 1 per ton is nearly £20,000 ; so that it is evident that even with a large impost there will still be a considerable amount of importation. I do not know how much salt is used in connection with the dairying industry, and as the honourable member for Macquarie did not reply to a question on this point, I take it that he is It may be in a similar state of ignorance. Erom an outsider's point Of view, however, I should not think very much salt is used .in connection with that particular industry. immense quantity used. supply can be obtained from Australia, as is proved by the fact that Victoria imports only the small quantity I have mentioned. This would seem to show that what we are importing are the finer table salts. Brown rock-salt has been placed on the free list because it is used to a large extent in pastoral and similar industries. that freedom to the dairying industry ? mit white rock-salt free, it will be imported and crushed to take the place of the local article. From tlie Melbourne Jowrnal of Commerce, of 10th September, I find the following prices quoted, including the duty the honourable of 20s. per ton:-Higgins' Patent Dairy, £ 5 7s. 6d. ; Liverpool coarse, £ 3 5s., fine, £ 3 10s. ; "" Black Horse,"" fine, £ 4 10s., I know that coarse, £ 4 ; German, £ 2 15s.; ""Castle"" South Australian, fine, £ 3 10s., coarse, £ 3 5s.

As to the natural protection which is so constantly referred to, I should say salt affords rather a bad example, seeing that it is sometimes brought out as ballast. Indeed, according to a letter I saw in a newspaper some time ago, that is frequently done. cannot afford to wait until salt arrives in ballast. is so brought, salt can be landed very cheaply. get? should get the good thing from Australia, and not import it from Germany, more especially seeing that Germany not only subsidizes the steamers, but gives a bonus on the salt. tage. If the Germans gave us salt for nothing, would we object 1 take it. I would rather have the salt produced by our own people, and afford them an opportunity of earning money to spend amongst themselves. farmer must not expect to get everything, but should consider other people who consume his produce. Sir seven years 17,000 tons of salt have been imported into Melbourne, at an average cost of less then 9s. per ton. Sir correct. deavoured to establish this industry in Victoria, and there are large salt works at Moolap, owned by a company who lease an area of Crown lands near Portarlington or Geelong. This company have spent large sums of money, and undoubtedly afford considerable employment, especially at certain periods of the year. South Australia turns out first-class salt, and has an advantage over Victoria in that in that State there are large natural deposits to draw from. This industry provides employment for a large number of people,, and in South Australia the Castle Company alone disburses in wages no less than £17,000 a year. We hear a lot about the natural products of the country, and as to how we should assist them. Surely the production of salt should be regarded as a natural industry. On the grounds, therefore, that we can produce this article locally, and tliat it provides healthy employment to a large number of persons, we ought to give the industry sufficient protection to enable it to command a fair share of the home market. The rate proposed is not a adopt it . MrA . C. GROOM (Flinders) I have been looking up Coghlan, and I find tliat the total number of hands employed in this industry, is 179. Salt is an article of more general consumption than is any other which enters the country. There is about I propose we 30 lb. per head of it used annually throughout Australia. manufacturers. MrA . C. GROOM -No. The passage from Coghlan is headed "" Food Supply and Cost of Living,"" and the writer says :Considering the comparatively high rate of wages which prevails, food of all kinds is fairly cheap in Australasia, and articles of diet which in other countries are almost within the category of luxuries are largely used even by the poorer classes. The average quantities of the principal articles of common diet annually The dairy consumed in the various colonies are given below. Then he goes on to state the quantity of salt used in each State. In New South Wales the consumption is set down at 42 Queensland at 57 8 lbs., in South Australia at 27 lbs,, in Western Australia at 17'8 lbs., in Tasmania at 18*3 lbs., and in New Zealand at for the whole of Australia is 30 lbs. The salt industry is really one of the primary industries of the Commonwealth, and ought not to require any protection. A t the same time salt is an article upon which a fair revenue duty might be imposed. Therefore I think that the Government should consent to the proposal to levy a duty of 10s. per ton, which represents a protection of 25 per cent, upon it . feel inclined to assist in placing salt upon the free list. It is one of those articles the production of which seems to require no protection.. The only reason why I am disposed to vote for the imposition of a small duty is because those who use the highly subsidized German steamers which come to Australia would otherwise enjoy an advantage over our local producers.

32,Mr Sawers (New England),"I almostagree with the remarks of the Treasurer, who practically says that for the sake of helping an industry in which a few hundred people are engaged he will act to the detriment of thousands of producers to whom salt is almost a necessity. the pastoral industry salt is essential as an article of diet for sheep. In the richer districts where salt-bush flourishes it is not required for sheep, but in more elevated country, such as that of New England, where the natural grasses are somewhat sour, it is an absolute necessity to the pastoralists. to rock-salt, which is upon the free list. pastoralists use only rock-salt, but practical men of to-dayuse Liverpool salt. In the New England district I use a ton of Liverpool salt for every thousand sheep I have. It costs, as a rule, £ 4 or £ 5 a ton. I have long since abandoned the use of rock-salt, and use only Liverpool or Adelaide salt for my stock. I never use less than 2 lbs. per sheep each year. Yet the Treasurer says that he would not give the thousands who are engaged in pastoral pursuits the benefit of cheap salt, because of the few hundreds who are employed in the salt industry. I may also point out that although in New South Wales there has been no duty upon salt, Adelaide stilt has practically beaten the Liverpool article out of the market. I notice tjiat brown rock-salt is placed upon the free list. Why not white rocksalt ? Brown rock-salt, as a rule, is perfect rubbish, and the pastoralists prefer to use white rock-salt. I shall vote for the lowest duty proposed. I intend to move that the word "" brown "" be omitted from the list of special exemptions. Some honourable members who call themselves protectionists, when, a duty is proposed for the advantage of an industry which does not exist in the State which they represent, and upon an article in which they are interested, immediately become free traders. I would point out that the sheep salt, of which the honourable member for New England spoke, can be obtained from Geelongi n any quantity at 20s. per ton. He can also get South Australian salt at the same juice, but if tlie local salt industry is crushed, as it will be if the duty upon salt is removed as certainly as if we were to pass a law prohibiting its manufacture here, he will not. be able to obtain salt so cheaply. Indeed, he will have to pay a good deal more than 20s. per ton for it if the amendment be carried. The honorTo able member for Wentworth said that the duty proposed represents 100 per cent, upon the value of the article, but in to-day's ArgusI find the following :In salt, Black Horse and Higgins' Dairy are selling at £5 15s., Black Horse fine at £4 17s. 6d., and Castle, fine, at £3 5s. The Castle: works are now overtaking the demand. German fine is depressed at £2 15s. Coarse salt is quoted at £4 4s. for Black Horse, £3 15s. for Liverpool, and £3 os. for Castle. Rock-salt is scarce, and is quoted at 75s. to 80s. according to parcel. Then the Age saysRock-salt, finning, 70s. to 75s. quoted. German salt depressed and cheap; lots.have been sold at 55s. Black Horse fine salt, 95s. to 97s. 6d.; do. dairy, 115s.; Castle fine salt, 65s. The experiments conducted in South Australia during the last few years have resulted in the production there of salt for dairy purposes equal to the best imported article, although some dairies will continue to use Black Horse salt because of the world-wide reputation which it has acquired. That is shown by the estimate of revenue which the Treasurer expects to derive from this duty. Protection so far as salt is concerned has resulted in a reduction of price to the consumer. member account for the increase in the price of Castle salt in Queensland by 13s. 6d. per ton since 8th October1 is the result of the duty, but as a set-oft* I may mention that in Victoria the price of salt has been reduced by 10s. per ton. There has been no real difference in the duty so far as Victoria is concerned, but notwithstanding the continuance of the duty the price has been reduced as stated. It has been contended by some honourable members that the increase in price is always equivalent to the amount of duty, but in this case they have been proved to be at least 50 per cent, out in their calculations. I admit that salt is of the very greatest importance to a great number of industries, and notwithstanding the importance of the salt industry to South Australia, I would not for one moment do anything that would permanently increase the price. But we know that nothing keeps down prices so",18,Williammcmillan T H A T Is Not 32 Lbs The Average Consumption Per Head

37,Mr Batchelob,"I admit that, thatmuch as competition, and the fact of our having a local salt-producing industry in Australia operates in that way. Where there is no local product prices are kept up to just as high a figure as the foreign manufacturer can obtain, but where he has to compete with a primary local industry lie has to bring his prices down to a much lower rate. Prior to the imposition of the duty in South Australia £ 5 10s. and £ 6 per ton had to be paid for salt suitable for dairying purposes. have produced our own salt the prices have been reduced tosuch an extent that all Australia can now procure salt, which is admittedly as good as the best imported, at £ 3 5s. or £ 3 1 Os. per ton. The salt industry -affords one of the very best instances of the advantages of judicious protection. The immediate result of the imposition of the duty has been to increase the price of salt in Queensland. Just as was the case i u South Australia when protection was imposed, I admit that the immediate result of imposing duties is to increase the prices, but with competition amongst local producers prices come down to a reasonable level. I have a number of documents here, which show that freight on salt from Liverpool to Melbourne averages 9s. per ton. From 12,000 to 15,000 tons of salt have been introduced at that rate during the last few years. but to the best of my belief it is good Livercharges are:-Freight, per ton, 8s. 6d.; insurpool and Cheshire salt, and not the cheap German article. The leader of the Opposition questions the accuracy of these figures as to freights, but I can assure him that the figures I have are absolutely beyond question, and that I have seen the bills of lading from which they were taken. member cannot tell us whether it is fine salt upon which these rates of freight were paid. matter 1 The question is as to the extent of the natural protection which is enjoyed by the local producer, who has to compete against these importations from abroad. As against the freight of 9s. per ton on imported salt, the freight on salt from Edithburgh, which is the nearest port to the chief salt lakes in South Australia, to Port Adelaide is 3s., and the freight from Port Adelaide to Melbourne is 5s. per ton. rate of freight from Liverpool to Melbourne. been charged for small lots. it was tlie rate at which several large lots were brought out here. The Silberhorn brought out 2,700 tons at 8s. 6d. per ton, less 2|per cent. The Bollock Myle brought out 1,8S0 tons at 8s. 6d. The Samoa brought out 1,740 tons at But since we 9s. 6d. per ton, less \ \ per cent. The Loch Caii-in brought out 2,820 tons at 10s., less 5 per cent. ; and the E a r l of Hopetoun brought out 2,550 tons, at 10s. 6d., less 5 per cent. The introduction of these large quantities of salt must dislocate the local market, and it is in connection with that aspect of the matter that freights have to be taken into consideration. The cost of conveying salt from Edithburgh to Melbourne is 8s., via Port Adelaide, or 7s. fid. per ton direct. The cost to Sydney is about the same; to Brisbane, 10s:; and to Rockhampton, 12s. 6d. Therefore, the natural protection enjoyed by the local producer in the leading markets is only Is. per ton.

W h a t does that which imported salt is subject which does not also apply to local salt is for exchange, and the rate of exchange on one ton of salt would bea mere trifle. In South Australia, we have a number of large salt, lakes, which were absolutely useless until we were able to convert the salt, deposits into an article of commerce, and distribute it all over Australia.

I believe that last year South supplied more than half the consumption of Australia, besides which there was a considerable export to other countries. matter of fact, the total production in South Australia last year was equal to two-thirds of the consumption of Australia. If we protect salt much further we shall, three or four years, practically hand over to one company the profits on the consumption of Australia. The honourable member -for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, has referred to the question of prices. If we take the prices of salt from the Sydney Trades Review of June 30, last year, and from the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce Journal, -of July 3, of the same year, we shall find that there was a difference between the cost of the article in the two States which was -almost equivalent to the duty. where salt was admitted free, the price of the Black Horse brand was 48s. 6d. per ton; in Victoria, where there was a 20s. per ton duty operative, it ranged from 80s. to -8.5s., and in South Australia, with a maximum protection of 25s. per ton, it was 85s. Mr Glynn. in such comconditions account for the difference. shareholders, and so obtained the fact that the price in South Australia Comwas more than the price in Sydney with the was made by the competing duty added. If we go back to 1894, when there was a rate of 20s. per ton operating in New South Wales, we shall find that the price for the particular brand mentioned was £ 3 12s. 6d. per ton, whilst in 1898, when salt -was admitted free of duty, the price was £ 2 7s. 6d. per ton. I do not Parliament that the Castle know what more honourable members want to demonstrate the inexpediency of bolstering up one particular company. We are told the that there are 500 men engaged in this industry in South Australia, but I would point out that that number is not directly employed in the industry. The number directly engaged was given by the honourable member for Elinders. What on earth has the carting, which is done by the farmers, to do with this duty 1 I fail to see how the statement made by the Commissioner of Crown Landsi n South Australia in advocacy of the somewhat doubtful At that time the output was about policy of extending the leases, that the industry employed 500 men, can upon and with improved analysis be maintained. I think that as a to increase that to 60,000 compromise honourable members ought to agree upon a reasonable protection being given to the industry. As a representative Australia of South Australia.

That fact can be proved by reference to the South within Australian Hansard. A fair concession to make would be the suggested duty of 10s. per ton. istry apparently support the high duty of 20s. per ton upon salt because of its protective incidence. But I wish to direct attention to the very large extent to which salt enters into consumption within the Commonwealth, and especially in connection with the primary industries. I ask the In Sydney, committee to consider whether it is reasonable that the thousands of people engaged in other industries should be penalized in the interest of the few who find employment in the salt industry.

62,Mr Brown (Canobolas),"The Minanalysis I think it will be conceded that the statistics quoted are quite within reason. I need scarcely point out' that salt is used largely in the dairying industry, in the preserving of meat and for stock. It has been urged that the requirements of stock would be met by placing rock salt upon the free list. But the pastoralist of to-day relies more upon ordinary salt than upon rock salt. The pastoralists use an immense amount of salt in order to secure for their stock immunity from fluke, worms, and many other diseases to which they are liable. So largely is this article imported into New South Wales that the Treasurer expects to derive a revenue from that State of £.10,000, which is more than half of his estimate for the whole of Australia. The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, has thrown a good deal of light upon this industry so far as his own State is concerned. His colleague, Mr Batchelor, claimed that the industry was a primary one, and should therefore be encouraged. But 'judging by the utterances of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, the people of that State regard it as a monopoly. If the committee assent to the highly protective duty proposed by the Government, the whole of the Commonwealth will look upon it from the same stand-point. I am disposed to agree with the suggestion of the honourable member for Fremantle, that this article enters into such general consumption that the Commonwealth cannot afford to allow its manufacture to become a monopoly. One way in which to obviate that danger and to prevent the necessity of State interference, is to allow of amount of salt used in connection with a reasonable amount of competition. The Queensland Chamber of Commerce recommends that a duty of 5s. per ton should be imposed, which they estimate would represent about 25 per cent., f.o.b. at Hong Kong. Considering that this article has hitherto been allowed to enter New South Wales and Queensland free of duty, and in view of the important part which it plays in connection with the primary industries, it is only reasonable to ask that a duty of something like 25 per cent, should be imposed. I shall support the proposal to reduce the rate to 5s. per ton, and failing that I shall v&te with those who desire to fix it at 10s. per ton. It may be urged that under this Tariff the primary industries are protected, and that they should be prepared to concede something in return. But I would point out that our primary producers have to compete in the markets of the world, and that the protection which is afforded them by the Government is a mere sham and make-believe. prone to give special attention only to the immediate object before us, and deal with a proposal for protection from the point of view of the number of employees who may be engaged in the industry, and the advantage which may thus be derived from the duty. If , however, we applied this narrow argument to the whole of the industries in our midst, we should probably be reduced to the production of wool and minerals only. These matters must be viewed from a broad stand-point, and with a recognition of the fact that all our industries are interdependent. We have been told that we should get all our supplies in the cheapest markets, but honourable members who hold that view should, to be logical, also permit the employer to procure his labour in the cheapest possible markets. ThatI am sure they are not prepared to do, and, moreover, it is not desirable that they should be. I believe that, owing to the extended market which will now be open to salt manufacturers within the Commonwealth, they may be able to carry on successfully with a lower duty than has hitherto been collected. If the duty were fixed at 10s. per ton, the reduction would be equivalent to 50 per cent, upon the lowest existing rates, and I think that that would be too much. °A duty of 15s. would be a fair thing, taking into account all the interests involved. The dairying represents a very small factor in the expense of carrying on the industry. If we were to not only take the duty off salt, but give it to the dairyman absolutely free of cost, the money thus saved to him would not pay for one milk-can in each season. The actual cost of salt to the dairyman is only about 7d. per 100 lbs. of butter. I am engaged in dairying myself, and I say that it would be more to the benefit of the dairymen, particularly in New South Wales, if they were to improve their herds and thus increase their milk-producing capacity. They would then be able to ignore such small considerations as the price of the salt used in their butter. Any one who knows anything about pastoral pursuits is aware that the best salt for stock",23,Smith The Honourable Of The Local Producer
63,Mr Kennedy (Moira),"We are toois the brown rock salt, which contains a considerable proportion of iron and sulphur. If the squatter uses other salt for his stock, as he sometimes does, he has to also give them iron and sulphur in some other form. Brown rock salt is specially exempted from duty, and, therefore, the pastoralist will not be affected by this tax. By giving a little assistance to those engaged in saltmaking we shall encourage them, so that in a very short time they will produce all the salt that is required within the Commonwealth, and the consumer will derive the benefit of the reduced price resulting from the increased production. The freight charged for the conveyance of salt from the seaports to the various inland districts where it is required represents a far more serious item of expense than any judiciously imposed duty. article of such universal consumption that I think the Treasurer may very well expect to derive some revenue from it . There is one way in which it is consumed to which no reference has yet been made, and that is in the treatment of tailings by tlie chlorination process. A large quantity of salt is used in the treatment of low-grade ores by that process, and in order that mining operations may be encouraged it would be well for the Treasurer to consider the desirability of reducing the duty on salt' to 10s. per ton. One of the companies in which I am interested has taken 3,500 tons of salt per annum from the South Australian works, and it may be again necessary to continue to take a similar or even a larger quantity, if reasonable encouragement is offered to those engaged in mining. I represent 120 workmen who will probably be thrown out of employment if the duty on salt is reduced to 10s. per ton. These men are receiving good wages at the Moolap Salt works near Geelong, and the committee should not lightly come to a decision which would operate to the prejudice of such a large body of men. We are told that the duty has had the effect of increasing the price of salt in New South Wales by 7s. 6d. per ton, and in Queensland by 13s. fid. per ton, but when it is considered that these increases are not at all commensurate with the amount of the duty, it is clear that the consumer has not been called upon to pay so much as might have been demanded of him. It has been conclusively shown that one of tbe companies engaged in salt making in South Australia has lost £4,000 in 3^ years, and that not one of the South Australian companies has paid a dividend. It is only fair that those who have invested their capital in this industry should receive some return for their money, and if we can assist them by imposing aduty on salt we should do so. out the Commonwealth now. has been putting money into its business year after year without getting any dividends, and it has been the same in South Australia. The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn,, says it is possible to have a monopoly. Australia is an island, however, and everywhere on the Australian coast the establishment of a salt industry is possible. If free-trade is established in salt, or only a duty of 10s. per ton fixed in respect of it , the result will be that the industry will be wiped out in Australia. The effect w ill be similar to that which followed the introduction of German bounty-fed sugar into the West Indies. As Mr Eroude points out, in his work Oceana, sugar was the natural industry of the West Indies. In 1859, however, the Germans established bounty-fed sugar works, with the result that the West Indies sugar industry rapidly declined.' In the same way the introduction of German bounty-fed salt into Australia will have the effect of destroying thesalt industry here, and as soon as that, takes place the Germans will raise tlie prices. The process is already going on.. The Financial News of the 8th July last shows that a big trust is in the course of formation, with the object of stamping out all competition in salt. Under the heading of ""The Salt Combine -The Formation of a Trust again Asserted to be an Accomplished Fact,"" it sets forth thatThere have been specific denials of the accuracy of cables on the part of the Salt Union of England; bub a New York correspondent informs us that the formation of a trust to control almost the entire salt output of tlie world has been definitely announced at the offices of tlie National Salt Company, located in the Standard Oil Buildings, No. 26 Broadway.

Last year the earnings of the National Salt Ccnnpauy were 1,207,569 dollars, and the company paid 7 per cent, -dividends upon the preferred and 6 per cent, upon the common stock. The Tariff of 1.60 dollars a ton on salt, it is said, is sufficient to permit of foreign competition, except at seaports ; but the freight rate on American salt is so much greater .than on English salt, that the railway companies generally get the benefib of the Tariff protection.

I can hardly imagine any honourable member of the labour party voting against this duty, seeing that it is so necessary for the protection of the workers in the industry. It is said that a certain quality of salt is necessary for the use of daiiy farmers. I have here the details of analyses of salt-produce d in differenb parbs of the world-by MrA . N .

Mr Pearson, but requested him to send some one down to select samples of salt member is in the House when that time from any of their stocks. This was done, and in April, 1901, Mr Pearson furnished a report onSamples gathered by Mr P. R. Scott, ot laboratory staff, from bulk stocks at the company's works, Greelong. The report makes a comparison of the Victorian samples with Cheshire stored salt, St. Malo sea salt, St. Ube'r sea salt, ""Strassfurb salt, and anobher sample of Cheshire salt. It shows that the proportion of sodium chloride-that is the pure salt-is 98-25 in one case, 96-00 in another, 89 04in another, 98-76 in another, and 97-59 in yet another. The proportion in bhe salb from the Moolap works is 98-77. I am bold it is the same in regard to the South Ausbralian salb, bhe quantity of pure salt bo be found in bobh cases being larger bhan that found in salt obtained from outside sources.

I have a circular issued and published last year, which gives the price of the Moolap secure Company's No. 1 salt 'at 22s. per ton, and thab of ibs agricultural salt at 20s. per ton-the exact amount of the duty.

I represent a constituency in which a very large quantity of salt is used, and I look at the matter from a different point of view. We are told that if we adopt this duty we shall obtain permanent cheapness. How is it that the prices have gone up in Queensland ? The object of those honourable members who are advocating these duties is to compel those who use salt in their industries to use the colonial article. Other things being equal, I should prefer the colonial to the imported article. In at least one great industry colonial salt is not equal to the imported ; and, as the representative of a constituency largely interested in dairying, I object to people being forced to use an article which is not so suitable for their requirements. In this Tariff everything is being done to put the farmer at a disadvantage, and here the dairyman, who depends on the prices in London and other parts of the world, is compelled to use salt which will not keep his butter in a state of preservation to enable him to compete with Denmark and obher butter-producing countries. honourable member for Kennedy has referred to this as a small matter, and no doubt 7d. in every 100 lbs. of butter may appear unimportant. But when we come to consider bhe millions of pounds of bubber produced, nob only for local consumption, but for export, we see that this 7d. becomes very serious, amounting to an export duty of thousands of pounds. I am very glad to see that the butter-box duty has been abolished, but I object to the farmer being penalized in connection with his supply of salt.

I have proved that position, South Ausfrom the testimony of experts; and I do not think any one in the ChamberI t can pretty well. desires in the slightest degree to sneer then, is the at the quality of South Australian butter. When they recollect that solely South Australian salt is used for the purpose of making it, I am sure honourable members will think that at least with regard to these two branches of the case, I have been able to sweep away some of the contentions of the other side. Of course I speak with the knowledge that the State from winch I have the honour to come is particularly interested in this industry'; but at the same time.

But the industry is not confined to South Australia. tralia and in Victoria, and there is no -doubt that salt could also be produced to advantage in other portions of the Commonwealth. a good article can be turned out from a particular State, we should be very careful in coming to a conclusion as to whether we ought not to deal with it upon protective principles. consider that federation has broadened our views. We now find that there are many industries in the other States which can -fairly claim greater liberality of treatment than we might previously have been inclined to grant off-hand. Iask that the salt industry should be accorded fair treatment with other ind ustries. Even in Western Australia there is a local factory. nexion, surely representatives of Western Australia will not vote to deny the other States that protection which under the special provisions of tlie Constitution relating to the graduated scale of duties, their own State will retain for five years. Let us go a little further. what has been the attitude of the Government throughout the Tariff discussion? Have we ventured to suggest that simply because an industry belongs to one State alone it should be accorded no protection ? Nothing of the sort. We regard the sugar industry, for example, as one of great and have done whatever we could for it. I appeal to honourable members generally to extend the same protection to the rest of Australia in connection with the salt industry as they will, no doubt, properly extend to Queensland and New South Wales in the matter of sugar. We simply wish to do a fair thing. made believe is not at all unfair. At the same time, for the purpose of meeting honourable members generally, we are prepared Mr Kingston. to consent to a reduction of the duty from 20s. to 15s. per ton, and we hope and expect that the committee will see their way I think that in connection with to accord us that. There is another matter and everything else to which I should like to refer. Honourable members have heard me speak more than himself. once of the propriety of preventing the consumers' interests being sacrificed by combinations of manufacturers or producers. All these arguments confirm us in the idea which we have previously expressed -that it would be a proper thing in connection with our CustomsA ct to introduce a provisionsimilar We have it in Western Austo that which is contained in the Canadian Customs Act, givingpower when theexistence of a combination is established as a matter of fact, to the detriment of the consumers, But I claim that when we know to relax the import duty so as to prevent the continuance of such a combination^ I think, under all the circumstances, that treatment should be accorded to the native industries of the various States similar to In this connection I venture to that which has already been given in many cases, and I believe that honourable members generally will be disposed to take that view. object which I have in view in the framing of this Tariff is to see that equally the workers obtain fair conditions. We all know that England is the principal exIn this conporter of salt to the Commonwealth. I know what are the conditions of the workers in the Cheshire district where most of the salt comes from. The wages paid are only 6d. an hour, and the men are required to work 60 hours per week. As honourable members are aware, Norbhwich is the head centre I ask the people of Queensland of that district. I well remember reading an article in the Manchester Sunday Clvronicle, written by the present proprietor of one of the finest journals in England, namely, the Clarion. It set forth the conditions of the workers in the salt trade there, when they were worse than they are to-day. importance, It was a melancholy picture. It has been urged that a duty of 20s. per ton upon salt is prohibitive. How can such an argument have any force when, with a similar duty operating last year, Victoria imported 7,498 tons? I admit that the consumption of salt enters largely into the chlorination process, and that is the principal We have reason why some honourable members are a certain proposal, which we anxious that the duty should be kept as low as possible.

They have been unnecessarily modest ""in regard to this duty. I must thank the Minister for Trade and Customs for having reminded the committee that he has dealt fairly with all 'the Statesi n connection with the Tariff proposals-; but I am afraid that Western Australia has been left out of consideration. We have very extensive deposits of salt, where the article can .'be shovelled up without any trouble; but unfortunately the industry has been languishing. I have, however, been so very much struck by the arguments adduced by honourable members on the other side of the chamber that I have at last realized that this industry is a very important one, and as far as Western Australia is concerned, I wish to make a proposal to the Government. The duty on sugar has been referred to, and if the Minister for Trade and Customs will only extend to the ""salt industry the same treatment as he has meted out to the sugar industry, and place, an insignificant duty of £ 6 per ton on salt, I will support him. If he will also consider the great danger of native labour being introduced into the salt industry in Western Australia, and give an additional £ 2 per ton bonus to those who produce salt by means of white labour, I feel sure the industry in Western Australia will progress enormously, and reach a tremendous development I hope that in view of the great importance of this industry to the Commonwealth my suggestions will be seriously considered. I am further emboldened to make these proposals because I have been continuously reminded by honourable members opposite that an increase of duty really means a reduction of prices, and therefore I presume that the imposition of a duty such as I suggest would be hailed with delight by consumers. If , however, as sometimes happens, the theory of the protectionist should not exactly be borne out in practice, and the price of salt were raised, the consumer should be thoroughly satisfied with the reflection that by paying slightly enhanced prices he would be placing the Commonwealth in theproud position of being able, not only to supply its own requirements, but to export large quantities of salt to other parts of the world at a much lower figure than would be charged for it locally. I hope the suggestion I have made will meet with the serious consideration of tlie Government gratulate the Minister for Trade and Customs on the consideration he has given to this subject, and thank him for the information he has afforded to the committee. There is no honourable member who has had more practical experience of the use of salt in connection with the meat industry than I have had.' I have tried the South Australian salt, and I am very happy to be assured that a great improvement has taken place in its preparation and manufacture, because up. to eighteen months ago, although we were very desirous of using Adelaide -salt, we could not utilize it for any purpose, except curing hides. If it be true that the salt is now prepared in such a way that it is quite equal to tlie English product, I am very pleased, indeed, to hear it. In that case I do not think it will require to be protected. I am anxious to see that no injury is done to the meat industry, which is even more important than the salt' industry. One meat works uses as much salt every day as a city of .100,000 inhabit tants, and a duty of £ 1 per ton on salt would be particularly oppressive to Queensland, wherethereare so many meat works. A t the same time, I sympathize with the desire of the Government to help native industries where assistance can be given without inflicting injustice, and I would, therefore, support a duty of 10s. per ton. Any higher duty would be outrageous. It Would mean that some of the meat works would have to pay more than £1,000 a year duty on salt. Queensland has been a protectionist State, and yet she has recognised the' necessity for admitting salt free of duty. The South Australian salt is used entirely for the curing of hides; the fine salt alone is used for the curing of-meat, which requires a great amount of care. Reference has been made to the question of dividends, and it is said that the salt industries of South Australia have not paid any, therefore they have made no money. I can sympathize with them, because I was connected with a company which made enormous profits, but did not declare any dividends. That is a matter for the directors to decide. Independent!y of that question, however, I think it is unjust to Queensland to propose to tax its meat industry to this extent.

Many honourable members will be denied an opportunity of declaring the amount of duty which they think ought to be imposed upon salt, unless they are allowed to vote for a rate of 15s. per ton. -of asking the honourable member for Moira not to press his aniendment. It is not that we are wanting in sympathy with it, but I think that the course proposed would establish a mischievous precedent. It is much better that we should have an honourable understanding as to the course which is to be followed in such circumstances. I therefore ask the honourable member to withdraw the amendment. duction in the amount of any particular duty is involved in an amendment-as in the case of the proposal to reduce the rate upon salt from 20s. per ton to 10s. per .ton it is advisable that the Chairman should ask if any honourable member desires to move for an intermediate duty. In the present instance a number of those who thought that 20s. was too high and 10s. too low are precluded from voting for an intermediate duty. to be followed by those who desired the imposition of a duty of 15s. per ton was to negative the amendment for a 10s. per ton rate, and subsequently to move for a duty of. 15s. per ton. As matters stand, the committee have already decided that the rate shall be 10s. per ton. and we cannot get away from that decision. that any understanding had been arrived at. A t the same time. I have no wish to disturb the good feeling which prevails. I realize -the position in which some honourable members are placed, and I now recognise that the better course for me to have followed would have been to endeavour to amend the amendment by fixing the rate at 15s. per ton. Holding these views, I ask permission to withdraw the amendment. MrA . McLEAN J was one of those who voted with the intention of subsequently supporting a proposal for a duty of 15s. per ton.

I should now like to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether he is prepared to lay on the table the report drawn up by the Associated Chambers of Commerce in Sydney, and forwarded, with a suggested Tariff, through the Minister for Home Affairs to the Federal Government.

Mr ""KINGSTON (South AustraliaMinister for Trade and Customs) -There was some Official report drawn up at a joint meeting of the Chambers of Commerce, and I shall be happy to lay it on the table. the following letter in reference to the Fifth Victorian Contingent:. Dear Sir,In reference to the fifth contingent I beg to inform you that my son, Saddler Fred Brearley, 1,318, A Company Eiftli V.M.R., has not communicated with me or any of my family since the beginning of July, when no said that lie had been put under arrest and sent to Middleberg for trial, for surrendering (with another man) to the Boers, the third.man being shot-in his attempt to get away and dying two days after from the wound. T have since heard, through another mini writing to his friends, that he had been sentenced to two years' imprisonment, but I cannot get any further information as to what has become of him. Previous to this he used to write every mail, so that his silence since has caused me a great deal of anxiety. Hoping that tlie agitation you have started will have the effect of clearing up a lot of the mystery surrounding the unfortunate fifth'contingent. In consequence of some previous statements I madej a. great deal of agitation' has been caused'amongst parents who have not heard from their sons in Africa for some time past; and as my action then had the effect of bringing about some sort of inquiry, I think it desirable to placo this letter before the House. This is another case where the rights of Australian citizens are being sacrificed by the Imperial authorities, who, although they have drawn men from Australia, refuse information to our Defence department. The state of things disclosed in'the letter is; I think, disgraceful and I would like the immediate attention of the Minister for Defence to the matter. SirM ALCOLMM c EACHARN (Mel. bourne) I .should like to know whether it is not possible to have such questions as this sifted in the department rather than brought up here on bald statements such as we have heard. to the department, but only to Members of Parliament.
