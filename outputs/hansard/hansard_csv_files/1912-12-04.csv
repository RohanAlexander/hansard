Debate resumed from 3rd December That this Bill be now read a second time. There are a few remarks with regard to this Bill which I could not well include in my previous speech. It proposes to take powers in regard to the control of corporations, not only on their formation and (their dissolution which might be a reasonable thing to ask, but also throughout their existence. There are, however, a few types of corporation, which are to be excluded. I wish to suggest to honourable members opposite that, by making these -exclusions, they have shown that they do not think that there is much claim with regard to the general control of organizations throughout their continued existence.

58,Mr West,"Then the honourable gentleif we pass a measure dealing with the creation and dissolution of corporations retaining the control, in the first instance, of the creation of such institutions, and in the second place, of the circumstances under which they should cease to be, we should be doing work which the Commonwealth Parliament is qualified to do, and which only the Commonwealth Parliament can do. If we enter into subsidiary fields of legislation on the subject, we shall intrude upon areas for which the State Parliaments are better qualified, for which we have many disqualifications and practically no qualifications, while they have many qualifications and few disqualifications. That would be a natural and reasonable division of the work, saving the Commonwealth, and the bodies liable to be affected, expense, difficulty, and delay, which, under the measure submitted by the Government, it seems tome we shall be imposing upon both, through a mere abstract ambition to deal with the institutions completely, merely because they are in our midst. creation and dissolution any more than with their regulation and control? and control of corporations must require us to provide for the whole of the details and minutiae connected with their daily working, including minor matters, which there is no reason for dealing with in the same way throughout Australia. I repeat that the attitude of the Opposition and their desires are still faithfully represented by the amendments they moved on the last occasion when a similar measure was before the House. This is the same House, composed of the same members, the same, parties confront each other; and we hold that there is little to be gained, though a good deal of time might be lost, in again going over the ground that was traversed on the former occasion. sufficient to say that the amendments previously moved represent the general attitude of the party on this side. inclusion in this measure of the regulation and control of corporations once they are constituted, and when it is not sought to dissolve them ; our plea being that the work of the Commonwealth Parliament in connection with this matter is to safeguard the creation of corporations, and to provide for the conditions under which they cease -to be, leaving all the details and minutae of their general operations, as they have hitherto been, in the hands of the State Parliaments. By the adoption of this course, we shall be able to exercise an effective control and supervision over all corporations, while they would continue their operations generally under that sanction, but more particularly under the legislation of the different States. Speaking generally, 1 have not heard the legislation of the States in this regard seriously impugned. No doubt it is open to improve ment, as all legislation is. Having made it clear that the attitude of the Opposition to these proposals as a whole is precisely the same as it was on the last occasion when they were submitted, that we are in favour of the creation and dissolution of corporations by the Commonwealth, we have submitted a fair alternative solution of this question. ister and Treasurer) [ II .

H . CATTS -The Leader of the Opposition nods his assent. I was merely conveying by my nod the fact that I was following the Prime Minister. uncertain law is no law. We need to make our laws as secure and certain as the Constitution will allow. If there is one branch of legislation that ought to be uniform throughout Australia it is that relating to companies. It is and its ramifications. It is of no value to the poor man who has a little to invest to be told ""You are secure up to a certain point, but beyond that we can give you no security."" A man should know when he is making an investment that he is investing with a company working under a uniform law for the whole Commonwealth, and that no corporation, whether well or badly managed, can depart from thafc law without suffering the consequences.

68,Mr Fisher,"Both in its foundationis that there has entered the minds of honourable members opposite, and some of the people outside, the idea that this is a Parliament that cannot be trusted. In my opinion, such an idea is erroneous. I believe that the electors will take care to elect to this Parliament, at each succeeding election, men competent to express the views of the majority of the people, and that they will from time to time correct any error. In connection with the exercise of this power over corporations we should be just as capable of acting fairly between the States, and of protecting the general interests of the people, as are the Minister of Trade and Customs and the Minister of Defence, in the administration of their respective Departments. indeed. ticulars, but the Leader of the Opposition knows that the Minister of Trade and Customs, if he chose to exercise the power he possesses, could prescribe to-morrow that no man should work in a ship's hold unless he wore a dress suit and white kid gloves. by the Minister would apply to the whole of Australia. make is that, although the Minister has power to direct that a man shall not ""work in the hold of a ship unless he wears a dress suit and white kid gloves, he does not think of exercising that power. If he did, he would not remain long in office. And so with the exercise of this power over corporations for which we ask. It is a power to protect, and not to abuse. No Government or individual member of Parliament could gain any advantage by violating or straining the law to the detriment of the public interest. Any Government that did so would certainly suffer. My own opinion is that the States would not be prejudicially affected even if these powers were granted to us in their entirety. The powers asked for are not in excess of the necessities of the situation, and the granting of them to the Federal Parliament has already been too long delayed. I believe that there is a majority of the people in favour of the grant of this particular power to the Commonwealth, and I trust that the Bill now before us will not be in any way modified. Indeed, I was hopeful that it would be unanimously agreed ta hold the view that we should not take powers from the States until things in the realm of Federal politics have found their true level. The time has not yet arrived for granting ro the Commonwealth Parliamait such a power as that for which this Bill provides. The point that I wish to emphasize is that, if this Bill be passed and endorsed by the people, power will be given this Parliament to control even corporations formed under the law of a State. So great is the power which we propose to take that, even in regard to corporations brought into existence under the cegis of State laws, we shall be able to dissolve, re gulate, and control them. That is a gravt power for this Parliament to assume, and, if granted, will, I am sure, lead to friction between trie States and-the Commonwealth, and pave the way to a great deal of litigation. Several exemptions are embodied in the Bill, including the proviso that it shall not apply to corporations formed ""not for the acquisition of gain by the corporation or its members."" I should like the Al torney-General to state whether that exemption means that trade unions having a corporate existence are not to be brought under the control of the Federal Parliament ? find the same words in the Victorian Companies Act. titled to ask the Attorney-General to answer my question. I know that he can decline to do so, and that is practically the attitude which he is taking up. honourable member knows that the Attorney General has not heard what he has said. ney-General sometimes does not hear what is said. It seems to me, however, that if corporations, are to be brought under the control and regulation of the Federal Parliament, trade union corporations should also be brought under our regulation and control. I should like some one on the Ministerial side of the House to give me a definite answer to my question. Ostensibly, trade unions are not corporations for the acquisition, of gain, but actually they are. Trade union corporations are not formed to make gains in the way that a commercial concern does, but they have a political basis, and work largely for political ends, and to that extent, for gain.",19,Hughes

Corporations formed under the law of a State, including their dissolution, regulation, and control, but not including municipal or governmental corporations, or any corporation formed solely for religious, charitable, scientific, or artistic have mentioned it. purposes, and not for the acquisition of gain. That would exclude companies. pressly says that if the corporations are for the acquisition of gain, they are'not excluded. power being granted to the Federal Government, it will be compelled to inquire whether certain organizations are run for the purpose of gain. I maintain that trade unions are run for the purposes of gainnot for the purpose of gaining what their members believe to be advantageous to themselves. there are no corporations in the Commonwealth which have a more important bearing upon all-the commercial, manufacturing, and producing interests than the Labour corporations. They may be called unions, or whatever honourable members like, but they are corporations; and we certainly ought to be in a position to know that corporations having such a dominating influence will be subject to the same legal control and authority as are any other corporations. It is not exactly a party question, because the Government in power today will not be in power to-morrow. There are bound to be changes in the political circumstances. The"" in s "" of to-day are the "" outs "" of to-morrow. We are legislating for the control of certain organizations until the law is amended.

It is, to my mind, an extremely dangerous precedent for us to establish. Buti f we are to have control over any corI venture to say that porations at all, we ought certainly to have a larger control over the corporations in which the members of trade unions are operating. The Attorney-General does not hear what I am saying. That is very inconvenient from some points of view. But other Ministers have heard, and I should like to know from them how far this Bill goes in regard to bringing trade unions under the purview of the Federal law. could quite understand the Government asking for power to deal with corporations whose ramifications extended beyond more than one Statei f they had not that power already. But I believe that they have it, and, therefore, I wonder at their asking for it. But I object to their asking for power to deal with all corporations. I do not know whether I am correct in my surmise, but I take it that there is very little difference, if any, between a corporation and a company. I believe that a corporation may be defined as a combination which is authorized under the law. A company which is registered under the law is, I take it, precisely the same as a corporation;",20,Hughes

92,Mr Ryrie (North Svdney) [11.28],"Iand I certainly object to power being granted to the Federal Government to control and regulate all companies. I see no -reason why companies within States should ! be controlled from a central authority. To do so is absolutely to carry out the principle -of centralization in its very worse aspect. -In my opinion, decentralization in all these matters is the policy which should be pursued in the interests of the people geneTally. How can this Parliament expect to deal satisfactorily with companies carrydug on business in the smaller towns of the -different States? At all events, it must be more dimcult for the Federal Government to exercise properly such control ""than for the State Governments to do so. Control of small companies in country towns cannot be nearly so well exercised toy the Central Government as by the State -Governments, and that is the reason why -decentralization has been sought by the -creation of local-governing bodies, even -within States. The parliamentary representatives in the State Houses possess all the requisite local knowledge to enable them to attend to the interests of companies of the kind; and it is only right that those interests should be looked after in that way. -there are local representatives in this Parliament ; but the two authorities are not on the same plane, members here not possessing that knowledge of local details which are always at the command of Slate members. All these proposals tend in the one direction of concentrating the control in this Government-in the direction of Unification-and I distinctly object to anything of the sort. It has been asked whether the proposed power will extend to that most powerful corporation or combination in our midst, known as trade unionism. Such questions, however, are rather amusing, because, in my opinion, the "" boot will be on the other foot,"" and the trade unions will control this Parliament with that active outside influence which dominates the constitutional machinery. At the present time trade unionism practically -controls the State Legislatures; and so we see the New South Wales Parliament markedly influenced by the Trades Hall. I do not see what greater power the Commonwealth could have than the control of all companies and combinations, which, I take it, include all trusts and similar bodies, and any two or three men banded together for trade, and registered, would come within this legislation. The Bill before us looks a very simple one; but I do not think that honourable members realize its scope and far-reaching effects. It means the control of the thousands of private, but registered, trading companies throughout Australia, including the wool-selling firms, the great stores, and so forth, which are nearly all limited liability companies. Whether a combination be a trust or a company, and whether it represents a monopoly or not, or whether it be inimical to the public interest or not, it will come within the Bill. ber say that a trust or a combine is a registered body? is registered, may be a trust or a combine. is not registered? would not come within the B ill ; but all companies, whether in restraint of trade or otherwise, would be within the control of this Parliament. what matter? It might be said, of course, that to give to the Commonwealth the control of all companies of which this Parliament knows nothing. Of course, I know that honourable members opposite are in favour of all trading and industrial matters being brought within the purview of this Parliament. I notice that corporations formed for religious, charitable, scientific, or artistic purposes, and not for the acquisition of gain, are excluded, although they were included in the previous proposed amendment of the Constitution, and I take it that that is because of the serious and reasonable objection? that were raised. Then, again, I see that municipal or governmental corporations are not included; and there is no doubt that, if these amendments be carried, these institutions will very much increase in importance. If we take from the State Parliaments much"" of their importance and many of their functions, more work must devolve upon the municipalities and shire councils, which eventually will be entrusted with the whole of the local governing functions of the State. them. work on their shoulders, and to increase",21,Hughes

When addressing the House on a previous occasion, I drew attention to what I thought was the view of the people at the time when Federation was adopted. I feel confident that they thought then that under Federation they would get a companies law applying to the whole of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition admits that such a companies law is essential. occasion. Opposition wished to have the issues submitted separately, so that electors of all manner of opinions could express their views on each proposal, among them that which we are now considering. Most of the members of the Chambers of Commerce and Chambers of Manufacturers in the various States have, at their annuals meetings, pointed out the disabilities whicb arise from the want of a universal companieslaw, and at the last Premiers' Conferencean attempt was made to arrive at an understanding which would enable this Parliament to pass such a law. No proposal put. forward at the Conference met with a better acceptance, but those who, like myself, have taken an interest in the publiclife of Australia for the past thirty or forty years, know that it would be' impossible to pass a universal companies law through the six Upper Houses of the States. The members of those Houses are connected with companies, and would try to frame a law in the interests of the companies, and the Premiers soon saw howdifficult it would be to arrive at an agreement by striving to make the State legislation uniform. In some of the States the investors are not properly protected now, while in other States there are good companiesMunicipalities are laws. It was intended when Federation* took place, and thirty-nine specified powers were conferred on this Parliament, that we should be able to make laws applicable 10the whole of Australia in those respects. The whole object of the Federation is to make laws on certain subjects to have effect throughout Australia.

This measure seems to have caused a perfect nightmare amongst honourable members on the other side. Judging by their speeches, I think that they cannot get much rest.

I certainly think that «ome honourable members on the other side would be better in a State House than here; they are not Federalists. honourable member confine himself to the question ? sir? At the last referendum there was a -complaint that the issue was confused, but now the issue is made perfectly plain, and the people can give a clear vote on this question of extending the Federal control to corporations. power in this Bill is very concise, indicating clearly that it is not intended to interfere with the control of the municipalities, which, of course, was not really intended -at the previous referendum. Our opponents then knew very well that the proposed power over corporations did not apply, and was not intended to apply, to those institutions which the States themselves controlled, .because that would be offending against an essential of Democracy. So long as an institution is controlled by thc people they are satisfied. palities are controlled by the peopie, and -so, too, are the State Governments. The Federal Parliament never intended to in-tefere with the control of such institutions, but now the proposed power is defined so plainly that I cannot understand the attitude of the Opposition, that is, apart from their belief that the present Government -should not have any other power. That is .apparently their real objection to this proposal, and to my mind it does not show much confidence in the Parliament, be-cause no Parliament will ever go beyond the will of the people. Mr J. H . CATTS -It shows no confidence in the people. have no confidence in themselves, how can they have confidence in the people? l t will be purely for the people to decide how far we should go in any direction, and what we should do. Under none of these proposals will the Parliament go any tuither than the people permit. No Parliament has ever done that yet, for all the powers we desire to secure to this National Parliament have been exercised by the State Parliaments. All the awful things that weTe depicted to the people as likely to happen if the powers were transferred to this Parliament have never happened under the exercise of them by the State Parliaments. This gloomy talk has been indulged in ever since I have been acquainted with politics. I remember that the same predictions were made in conWill the nexion with the British Parliament when the question of reform was under discussion, things would happen if the Reform Bill were passed.

We all know that many of our friends have suffered losses through not having a Companies Act to protect the interests of all parties concerned in the ramifications of industrial life under corporations.

It contains only two clauses, and yet some honourable members experience a difficulty in arriving at its true meaning. This morning, the honourable member for Echuca asked the Honorary Minister, in the absence of the Attorney-General, what position trade I am satisfied that it was always inunions will occupy under it? That seems to me a very simple question, but it elicited no reply. The Bill will empower the Commonwealth to deal with corporations; formed under the law of a State. That iy a very far-reaching and dangerous power tovest in the Commonwealth. It is one which will affect not only the big corporations, but the smaller corporations and companies which have been established by primary producers on co-operative lines, in order to improve their position. In Chambers' Encyclopedia a corporation is defined as "" A body or society authorized by law to> act as one individual."" Under the proposal of the Government, therefore, all ourbutter factories, our co-operative institutions throughout the length and breadth of Australia, which at the present time are subject to State laws, will be brought within the ambit of Commonwealth legislation, and will be dealt by one centralized authority. We all know that in every country to-day the tendency is to get away from centralization, and consequently it seems the acme of absurdity to attempt to deal with all these organizations from one centre, like that of Melbourne or Yass-Canberra. On behalf of the producers, who have done so much to add to the wealth of Australia, and who will be specially affected by this, proposal, I enter my protest against it.

That vend -as has already been pointed out-wa s created at the instance of the coal miners of Newcastle. It was at their request that the colliery proprietors in that centre entered into a combination for the purpose of raising their wages. We have had Ministers representing that district who have proclaimed that the Vend is a very beneficent institution. No doubt it is. But it cannot ever become a monopoly for the 1 simple reason that the Newcastle field is not the only coal-field in New South Wales. Some eighteen or twenty fields exist in the southern district of Illawarra, and there is also a field at Lithgow. The Vend, therefore, can never become a monopoly, because keen competition exists between the northern, the southern, and the western fields. Consequently there is no necessity for the Vend to be dealt with by Commonwealth legislation. This morning, in answer to a> question by the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister stated that what the Government wanted was one law for the whole Commonwealth, so that the poor man would know that his small investments would be secure. It is not usually suggested that the corporations with whicb rethe Government are so anxious to deal are institutions in which poor men have thein savings invested, although the share-list of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company includes a number of comparatively poor people who are,, to some extent, dependent upon the dividends paid by that company _ We are all anxious that, in every walk of life, the interests of the poor man shalt be properly protected, but what I should* like to know is how the Government conclude that the poor man's investments inpublic companies will be better protectee* if their operations are controlled by the Commonwealth Parliament than if they are controlled by local Parliaments possessed of a much better knowledge oflocal conditions than this central Parliament can possibly have. In my opinion,, the savings of the poor, and of other persons in the community, can be bettersecured under State legislation and administration than under Commonwealthslegislation with administration from Melbourne or Yass-Canberra. The acceptance of this proposal might give rise to a peculiar anomaly. If the Commonwealth Parliament is placed in a position to deaB with corporations in the way proposed by the Government, we may have two businesses conducted in the same street, one by a corporation, the other by an individualcarried on under the provisions of entirely different laws. The corporation would be carrying on its business under Commonwealth legislation which'would not affect in any way the business carried on by theindividual. When this matter was previously before the House, I made my position perfectly clear, and I have also madeit clear to the electors. Believing, as P do, that the grant of these powers to the Commonwealth Parliament would be injurious, I trust that the people will not-accept the Government proposals.

It should always be .remembered that these powers are to be taken from the States. The proposals of tiie Government do not involve any increase in the total sum of sovereign power exer-cised by the different Legislatures of Australia, but rather a change of venue of the -exercise of particular powers from one Parliament to another. In the circumstances, -any change of the kind proposed should :be amply justified by reasons given to this .House and the country. This particular Bill exemplifies what I may term a desire --to grab the greatest amount of power possible for this Parliament, without any de-finite reasons being given, and I venture to -say without the existence of any such reasons. What we have to guard against more than anything else is the .asking of power for its own sake. The tendency -amongst men is always to secure as much power as they can. I confess that at times I feel the difficulty of this Parliament bepowers to the Federal Parliament. When, ing unable to do certait. things owing to -the limitation of its powers. Honourable members opposite ask over and over again, "" Can we not trust the Federal Parliament witb this poweT? "" It is not a question of trusting this Parliament. We can always trust it to do its best according to .its lights, in the interests of the country. 'It is a question of the wisdom of investing -this Parliament with any particular power. We have to ask ourselves, "" Can this Parliament exercise the power asked for better than can the State Parliaments?"" We -should not forget that once a power is granted to this Parliament, and is exer-cised, our legislation overrides that of the ""State Parliaments. It has been said that 'the grant of power asked for on the last -occasion did not include the power to deal with municipal corporations, but we have it on the authority of eminent constitu-tional lawyers in Australia that it did, and, in my opinion, they took up a very logical ground. ber refers to Mr Mitchell, he did not sustain his contention as regards municipal corporations. chell gave it as his strong opinion that the last measure did ask for that power.. It shows the danger of granting unconditional powers to this Parliament. Once they are given in such terms, they are inclusive of everything coming within them. I do not regard the Constitution as sacrosanct in any way. I quite recognise that as we continue under a Federal form of government circumstances will arise proving the necessity for giving this Parliament additional powers. The necessities of the case at the present time show conclusively that this Parliament has not the power to pass a general companies law in regard to the creation, dissolution and winding up of companies in Australia. That has been proved. I am willing and ready to vote in this House for, and to advocate in the country afterwards, the granting of that power to this Parliament. If this Bill had been so limited, it would have had my vote in this House, and my support in the country. There are other proposals in these measures to which I partly agree, because I think we have had proved the necessity for the granting of certain additional however, the Government propose to go beyond the proved, necessities of the case, then I think they are asking for power for its own sake, and not to advantage the community. I think that they are asking for this power, not because this Parliament can exercise it better than can the States, but simply because the Attorney-General is desirous of so clothing this Legislature with authority that whatever legislation it passes in regard,to corporations, whether it be for the benefit of Australia or not, cannot be vetoed by the High Court. He desires that this Parliament shall take so wide a power that it will be able to pass any law that it pleases in regard to almost any subject touching corporations, and that that law shall not be subject to the veto of the High Court. That is a very nice position for the Parliament itself to occupy; but, from the point of view of the Australian public, I doubt whether it is wise. The question at issue is not whether this Parliament is to be trusted, but whether.",26,Hughes

156,Mr Greene,"I know that Mr Mitin the division of sovereign rights between the Commonwealth Parliament and the State Parliaments, it is wise to give to this Legislature such wide and far-reaching authority as the Government propose. The honourable member for Flinders and others have dealt so fully with the confusion that must necessarily arise if this Parliament exercises the powers proposed to be taken in regard to the regulation and control of corporations that I do not think I need make any further reference to it. What we unquestionably need is the power to pass a general companies law. As honourable members are aware, a law relating to the creation, dissolution, or winding up of companies does not cover their operations in any way. It has regard only to their creation and dissolution as legal entities under the companies law. It goes no further, and that is all that is necessary from a commercial stand-point. If we attempt, through this Parliament, to build up a whole code of laws under which companies may trade and conduct their business-law s which are bound to conflict with some of the laws of the States-w e shall not only create endless confusion, but override those State laws. We would practically have an automatic power of veto over the whole range of State law in this regard. That, whatever else it is, is certainly not in accordance with the scheme or ideal of a Federal system of government. As Mr Justice Higgins once pointed out, the proposal is big with confusion. Mr tempting to deal, but to enter upon a long, Mitchell described it as a bastard form of government, which would mean neither a Federal nor a Unitary system. It was an attempt; he said, to graft on to the Federal form of government a Unitary system, with all its consequent confusion. If this Parliament obtained and exercised the powers that are now being sought, it would not be long before the people, owing to the confusion that would arise, would cry out for relief, and would accept a Unitary system of government as the easiest way out of the difficulty.

Any company which fails in these respects is liable to considerable fines. It is quite true that proprietary companies are not compelled to file balance-sheets for public inspectiop. There is really no reason why they should be. None of us is compelled to file a balance-sheet in regard to our private affairs. Proprietary companies are really private companies, and there is no reason why they should be required to disclose their private balance-sheets. But where the public is interested, and is invited to take shares good faith is a vital factor, and the law requires full publicity. The utmost precaution is taken. I was a member of a State Government which introduced, I suppose, the most rigid and stringent company law which has ever been in force in Australia, and many of the features of which are now being adopted elsewhere. I am now dealing with the contention of the Attorney-General that, under the present law, sufficient information is not given to the public, and that, therefore, it is necessary that the proposed powers should be given to the Commonwealth Parliament. So far as public companies are concerned, it is provided, by section 115 of the Victorian Act(2) Every company, and the directors and manager thereof(a) shall cause to be kept proper books of account, in which shall be kept f u l l , true, and complete accounts of the affairs and transactions of the company; and (b) shall once at least in each year, and at intervals of not more than fifteen* months, cause the accounts of thecompany to be balanced, and a balance-sheet to be prepared, which, balance-sheet, after being duly audited, shall be laid before the members of the company in general meeting; and' (c) shall cause a copy of such balance-sheet so audited to be sent to the registered, address of every member of the company at least seven days before themeeting. . . . (d) shall forthwith cause to be filed with the Registrar-General a copy of such balance-sheet, and of any auditor's report attached thereto or thereon referred* to; and (e) shall cause to be forthwith posted up, and until the posting up of the next following balance-sheet, kept posted"" up, a printed copy of the same in aconspicuous place in tbe registerd office of the company, and in every .branch, ofiice where the business of the company is carried on, and every creditor of or shareholder in the company, o r any person acting in his behalf, shalb be entitled to a copy thereof on payment of Sixpence. (3) The balance-sheet shall be audited by thecompany's auditors as hereinafter provided, and* shall contain a summary of the share capital of the company, its liabilities, and its assets, giving such particulars as will disclose the general"" nature of those liabilities and assets, and thebalance-sheet shall include a statement of profit and loss. The balance-sheet may, in the case of a banking company, and shall in the case of any other company, be in one of the forms in the Second* Schedule to this Act, or to the like effect, and comply with the directions (if any) at the foofr of the form. Not only are the requirements very stringent in regard to public companies, so far as the disclosures to be made are concerned, but in the schedules, which I need not quote now, further information is provided for. The Attorney-General, I think, quite overlooked the public requirements made by the laws of the several States in thi* regard; and it is not necessary to clothethe Commonwealth Parliament in order to get more complete information than that already obtainable.

That is a contingency which has to be contemplated. The Attorney-General has not attempted to meet the practical difficulty which has been raised by members of the Opposition, and, from his stand-point, by a greater tice Higgins. Take the law of libel as an example. A particular law of libel may be enacted by this Parliament in regard to corporations, and a totally different libel law may be enacted by a State applicable to individuals carrying on the same business. Under the circumstances the Bill is incomplete, and I would urge the Government, having regard to the real and practical difficulties which have been pointed out by men of great experience, to consent to strike out of clause 2 the words "" regulation and control."" If that course be followed, it will certainly alter my views on this Bill, because I am prepared to support a proposal to empower the Commonwealth to legislate in regard to the creation and dissolution of corporations, and I make that statement as one who has had some little practical experience in connection with company law. provement upon the present system? great improvement upon the present system from the stand-point of creation and dissolution of corporations.

I think that every honourable member would welcome an amendment of the powers vested in. this Parliament by the Constitution so far as corporations are concerned. Experience has demonstrated the necessity for such an amendment. The difference between honourable members opposite and* members of the Opposition, seems to reIntra-State corsolve itself into one of degree. This is a question which requires to be dealt with deliberately. An amendment of the companies law, which would render it possible for this Parliament to legislate for companies all over Australia, is a question* which has not merely an Australian' but an Imperial interest. I would remind honourable members that at the Colonial Conference which was held in London in1907, the question of a uniform companieslaw was debated. At that gathering MT. Lloyd-George moved1 That it is desirable, as far as circumstancespermit, to secure greater uniformity in the company laws of the Empire, and that the memorandum and analyses prepared on this subject by the Imperial Government be commended to theconsideration of the various Governments represented at this Conference. Sir Wilfrid Laurier thought that the proposal might be accepted. The chairman* agreed with him, as also did Mr Deakin. So that the Conference affirmed not only that we should have a uniform companieslaw in Australia, but that, as far as possible, a uniform companies law should' operate over the whole Empire. Consequently, this question is one of more than? Australian interest. That should be a sufficient justification for action being taken to empower the Commonwealth to deal witb corporations all over Australia. In the Huddart Parker case it was clearly shown> that the conflict between Federal and State laws rendered both, to a large extent, ineffective, and that some amendment of the Constitution was therefore essential. Thepoint at which the Opposition part company with the Government has reference to the regulation and control of corporations. No impartial reader of the speeches delivered by the honourable member for Angasand the honourable member for Flinders can be other than convinced that if we include the words ""regulation and control "" in this Bill we shall propagate the endless confusion which was alluded to by Mr Substantial results can be Justice Higgins. I am sure that honorable members are not anxious to secure an amendment of the Constitution which will cause Commonwealth laws to be enacted; which will come into direct conflict witb State laws in matters over which the Stateshave complete jurisdiction.

200,Mr Sampson (Wimmera) [3.20],"confusion exists in regard to corporations, trusts, and combines. I believe we should have power to enact a uniform companies -law, and that we should have power to prescribe the methods to be followed in the creation and dissolution of companies. The -question of corporations is distinct from that of trusts and combines. Not long ago I read of an American trust which was formed out of quite a number of companies. The trust held a majority of the shares in each of those companies, although the corporation existed separately from the trust itself. It would be possible, of course, for the different companies to disappear. In one instance, they did disappear, so that what was formerly a trust became merged in a huge corporation. In cases of that kind it might be necessary 'incidentally to have control over trusts and combines after they have merged into a huge corporation. Possibly that could be dealt with' under the heading of monopolies. If we could prescribe the conditions under which companies or corporations shall come into existence, and the methods of dissolution which shall be followed, we should go a long way towards preventing the development of trusts and combines. Why should it not be possible for this Parliament to prescribe that a comthe merits of the case. pany starting in any business shall not be allowed to hold shares in any other company, and thus prevent trusts which might be formed out of corporations from springing into existence? would cripple some of the best companies in Australia. Nearly all our dairy companies are registered in that way. we cannot foresee how far legislation ought to operate. means of legislation to prevent the growth of huge trusts and monopolies out of the operations of individual corporations which may pool their shares in order to gain a monopoly in any industry. When this question was before us on the last occasion -it was submitted in a very similar form. But I am glad to see that the Government fliave recognised the danger, which we then pointed out, of the possible encroachment of the Federal power upon municipal and State powers. But the most objectionable portion of their proposal still remains, namely, the "" regulation and control "" of corporations, to which legal members of the House have already referred. On the last occasion the Government sought to substitute for the power vested in the Federal Parliament to deal with corporations, the power to regulate and control them. On behalf of the whole Opposition, I believe, the honourable member for Angas took exception to the introduction of the words "" regulation and control,"" and moved their omission so that the Parliament would have power to make laws with respect to the creation and dissolution of corporations. That amendment was rejected, but Ministers apparently have not profited by the weighty arguments which were then adduced in support of it. we had proposed such an amendment on this occasion some other objection would have been raised by the Opposition. ber should be able to discuss a question of this kind on its merits. to make was that even if some honourable members ot the Opposition on the last occasion did speak in favour of a certain amendment it is quite possible that on this occasion, if a similar proposal had been made they would have spoken against it. allowed to change his opinions. of our party is that we are entitled to hold different opinions on various questions. Members who are not prepared to profit by information obtained in the course of a debate in this House are not fit to represent the people. The whole House is unanimously in favour of power being secured to pass a uniform companies law, But it may be possible by but one cannot read the debate that has taken place on this question, or listen to the criticism levelled at the Government proposal, without feeling convinced that its adoption would lead to endless confusion between the States and the Commonwealth. On the other hand, the proposal made on the last occasion, by the honourable member for Angas, would give this Parliament all the power it requires to pass a uniform companies law. According to leading authorities-includin g Mr Justice Higgins -whos e opinions have been quoted in this House, the proposed amendment of the Constitution now before us would lead to endless confusion between the States and the Commonwealth.

It ought not to be mentioned. ber is referring to a Bill which was dealt with last night. There seems to be a disposition on the part of honourable members opposite to side-track the issue. WhilstI admire the Attorney-General's eloquence, and have listened with great interest to many of his speeches on important questions, I certainly think that the speech in which he dealt with the proposed enlargement of our powers in respect of corporations and companies was disappointing. He scarcely dealt with the merits of the question, and we have had to depend on the analytical legal elaborations of the honourable member for Angas, and the honourable member for Flinders, to enlighten us as to the real scope of the proposed amendment. At the Imperial -Conference in 1907 a resolution in favour of a uniform companies law was agreed to. Surelyi f the subject was of sufficient importance to be considered by the Conference-if it vitally affects the financial and trading concerns of the whole Empire-thi s Parliament should lose no time in asking the people to give it power to deal with corporations and companies. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That would be a useful proposal, but would provide very poor political capital. is so. party was in power for about two years after that Conference was held; but, as usual, it did nothing in regard to the passing of a uniform companies law. that is any reason why we should delay any further. On the last occasion, the present Government rejected an amendment proposed by the Opposition which would have given the Commonwealth full power over companies, whether operating in one State or more; and they come forward to-day with the same old proposal which would lead to the difficulties so graphically member for Indi does not address himself described by Mr Justice Higgins in the Huddart Parker case. It should have been possible to arrive at a unanimous vote on this question, considering that there is no difference of opinion on the part of honourable members as to the necessity for a uniform law. Instead of dealing with the question separately, however, the Government are mixing it up with something else relating to corporations which is foreign to the subject, andi must make the exercise of the whole power confusing, if not abortive. _\ am glad that the honourable member for Indi is present, because I wish now to refer to a statement made by him a few evenings ago. ber will not be in order in replying ro a speech made by the honourable member for Indi upon another Bill. ber for Indi made the charge that the defeat of the Government proposals at the last referenda was due to the expenditure of large sums of money by this party. ber cannot deal with that matter. whole question of corporations. had ample opportunity, during the discussion on the first of these Bills, to deal with all such matters.

In our every honourable member is entitled to address himself to any argument relevant to corporations and in doing so is entitled to refer to any utterance by any other member at any time.

I submit, however, that in dealing with the Bill before us an honourable member is entitled torefer to any utterance of any honourable member relevant to it no matter when the utterance might be made. If such reference is not allowed it certainly completely cripples discussion on these measures. of undue length. Mr W. H .

That honourable member distinctly stated that he was going to reply to the speech made by the honourable member for Indi the other evening; and I ruled that such a reply is not in order.

UntilI heard the honourable member for Echuca and the honourable member for North Sydney, I understood that all parties were agreed that it was desirable to have a uniform company law; but now I find that on this, as on many other matdesire for a uniform company law, it appears to me not sufficient to confine ourselves to the words ""creation and dissolution."" When the subject was last disFlinders pointed this out very clearlyI think that if this amendment (to leave out "" regulation and control "" ) were carried it would* give a general control over corporations, but limited to what lawyers call the status, or, inmore general terms, the constitution of companies, the oonditions under which they arebrought into existence, and those under which they come to an. end.

If there is no one to suggest the words that will give us the exact control desired, the best course is to take the greater control, and trust to the sanity of the Government and Parliament to limit its exercise to the management, balance-sheets, and so forth. take it that the idea of this Bill is to give the Commonwealth Parliament an opportunity to pass a uniform company law to meet the varying conditions of the country. With that idea I am heartily in sympathy; .and it may easily be carried out without .going to anything like the extent now proposed. The judgment of the High Court : in the Huddart Parker case shows that our present power does not allow us to exercise .any control over corporations after they .have once started operations; and I do not know that, as a Federal Parliament, we need any such power. control of the starting and the dissolution of companies, we can impose such conditions as to insure that only corporations -of which we approve shall come into existance. When once a company is launched under the conditions to be imposed, it is only right that it should then come -within the various State laws. There has ""been no demand on the part of the business people for more than I have indicated; and the Attorney-General has not, in any of his speeches, shown why any further power should be granted. I am afraid that at the election the public will become very confused as to the distinction between this amendment and the amendment to give us power to deal with trusts and combines ; and if they read the Attorney-General's speeches they can only become the more confused. Huddart Parker case, pointed out the peculiar position that would arise if the words "" regulation and control "" were retained. We should have the Commonwealth passing a law to regulate a business carried on by a corporation, while a precisely similar business, carried on by a private person, would be quite outside the -powers of the Commonwealth. Under the circumstances, the retention of the words is not only unnecessary, but ridiculous. I hope that honourable members opposite will remember that this is not a question for Parliament, but for the people, and will as possible, by laying the facts before of Australia are sensible enough to see how unnecessary this proposed amendment is, and to reject it as on a previous occasion. My only fear, as I have said, is that the people will confuse this particular Bill with the Bill relating to trusts and combines ; and this makes it all the more necessary that the case should be fairly put before them. said just now that the people would be intelligent enough to reject the proposal. put, the intelligence of the people will prevail. member allow me, as a layman, to say that he will lose his legal reputation if he goes to such lengths? judgment of Mr Justice Higgins at length, but I merely allude to it, considering that If we have the it has been quoted before; but if there is one Judge on the High Court Bench who ought to appeal to my honourable friends opposite he is the man.

There is great danger that the public will not get fairly and clearly into their minds the distinction beagain when following the Attorney-General tween this amendment and another that is proposed, and great harm may thereby result to the community. If we take the power over corporations which is proposed, it is a guinea to a gooseberry that endless the amendment proposed to the people trouble will afterwards arise from the clashing of Federal and State laws, which will cause taxpayers to be heavily mulcted in a series of law suits. The power asked for will enable us to go much further than is needed, and harm will result. I do not know why the Attorney-General asks for an excessive grant of power, because he has to regulate trusts, combines, and monosaid nothing in support of his demand. His speeches only tend to inflame the pubState or part of the Commonwealth. lic mind against ""corporations as against trusts and combines, although much that he has said has been contradicted by the speeches of those on this side of the Chamuse in this Bill. The power asked for ber. With a little common sense, the Government might bring about a satisfactory solution of our difficulties, and then we might have on the statute-book before very long a proper company law for the whole of Australia. The words "" the creation and dissolution of corporations"" would give us all the power we need. corporation has been formed, each State is able to police it better than the Federation; but the power to pass laws governing the creation of corporations will enable us to lay down all the conditions with which they must comply. The power asked for, however, would enable us to pass all sorts of laws clashing with State legislation, to the injury of the taxpayers. I appeal to the Attorney-General to dismount from his high horse, and propose what the people need. He has not told us why he makes an excessive demand, or what he intends to do with the powers for which he asks, and the judgment of Mr Justice Higgins shows that the adoption of his proposals will in the end produce a silly state of the law.

This proposal is a modification of that submitted at the last referendum. The word "" trusts "" is now added. That is an improvement.

In all the cases whicb have been decided in England and America the gist of the charge has been operations in restraint of trade. The Once a Bill gives a power to legislate for the control of operations which may not amount to a restraint upon trade, production, or manufacture. The use of the words "" production "" and ""manufacture"" widens the scope of the power still further. "" Manufacture "" includes primary products transformed by labour, as I shall show by referring to the Sugar case decision in America.

It is the tremendous complexity and extent of the interests involved in such cases as those of the Standard Oil Trust, the Steel Trust, the Tobacco Trust, and others that has, to some extent, discounted the effects of judgments sustaining the application of the provisions of the Sherman law to the operations of the trusts. the States, except New South Wales to some extent, have not yet legislated in this matter; but whether the Commonwealth or the States exercise the power we shall still be faced by the mass of obstacles which, by the growing complexity and magnitude of modern commerce and industry is placed in the way of all legislative attempts, however well directed, to control commercial or industrial operations. If one looks into the American decisions, and into the reports presented for the guidance of Congress and some of the State Parliaments, it will be found that it is these obstacles chiefly which have made ineffective some of the judgments of the Federal Court, and many of the judgments of the State Courts. have legislation directed against trusts, and there is nothing to prevent the Australian States from passing even more efficacious laws directed against the growing tendency to form trusts and combines. That there is a growth which in time will certainly become pernicious none would deny. Whetheri t is due to the protection afforded by our import duties, or would occur under ordinary conditions, is a question that I shall not discuss ""in this debate. It may be asked, If there is a tendency for the establishment of arrangements and combinations in Australia which will ultimately injure the consumer, and the States have done nothing to prevent it, why should not the Commonwealth interfere? I would give the power to the Commonwealth for reasons set forth in the memorandum that has been referred to once or .twice, but I would not give it as proposed in this Bill. ample power to deal with all restraints of trade. have a recognised meaning in English law, and also in relation to our local jurisprudence, because a case, Collins v. Lock, 4, A.C., 674, was decided in the Privy Council about T879, nexion with the operations of some firms in Melbourne, in which the principle of what [3] 2 T was unreasonable restraint of trade by combinations was declared. The political reason advanced in favour of extending this power and making it as wide as the proposition before us is that the States have failed to do anything because their Upper Houses are more Conservative than our Senate. As a matter of fact, no attempt has been made, even by State LaI regret that bour Governments, to introduce measures dealing with combines and trusts. The Upper Houses of the States cannot be blamed for failing to pass legislation which has never been presented to them. In 1908, a measure was passed in the New South VVales Legislature making an offence an act which might be committed by either Labour or Capital, and may be described as a violation of the statutory law regarding conspiracy. The question arose as to whether certain prosecutions should be instituted under our Australian Industries Preservaticn Acts in connection with a coal strike, or whether the matter should be dealt with by the State authorities. It struck me at the time that the State had ample power to deal with it, and that it was not for us to interIn America thirty-seven States fere, if we could not justify our interference, on general and clear legal grounds, with the right of the men to strike. They were prosecuted under the State Act and at common law. Since then there has not, I think, been any attempt made to introduce another measure into the State Parliaments, and, therefore, I trust we shall hear no more of the political reason for agreeing to this Bill, namely, that the Conservative branches of the State Parliaments have blocked legislation in this direction. I do not object to extending the power of the Commonwealth in respect ot trusts. I have looked closely into the authorities mentioned by the Attorney General, and I have read every line of the articles in the July number of the Annals of the American Academy of Social and Political Science, in which this question of trusts is carefully considered. I think that Mr Seager put the case I would give strongly from the point of view of those who are directing their energies against The words "" restraint of trade "" trusts. But something has been said in extenuation of the acts of the Steel Corporation in America, where, however, so far from trusts being beneficial in their operations, the position is that while they did injure l n c o n _ the consumer, they did not protect labour. The hours worked by the majority of the men engaged on blastfurnaces in America,' according to one writer, is twelve hours a day, and 20 per cent, of 153,000 of the employees in blast furnaces, steel works, and rolling mills work seven days a week. Of -course, in their position, as one of the Courts statedwithout some power representing the workman, acting as a check on the great powers of the corit has been decided, in the case of In re poration, there can be no real democracy in the steel mill industries. It is for that reason that on the last occasion when it was proposed'to amend the Constitution to confer power on this Parliament to deal with trusts, combinations, and monopolies, an offer was made by the Opposition to concede the power to deal with trusts, combinations, and monopolies whose operations were in ^restraint o l trade or manufacture, though manufacture may not be necessary no matter whether they were confined to one State or extended throughout the Commonwealth. I still think that it would be better to have one law applicable to all these combines, so that they would not, in respect of tbeir State operations, be subject to one law, and in respect to their Inter-State operations, be subject to another law. The morality of the law would be more recognised in a homogenous community like ours if the same penalty were imposed for the same offence. assist in doing away with the miserable rate of pay to which the honourable member has referred? the plea which was urged that the trust was beneficial to labour is not borne out by recent reports. But I may tell the honourable member, without offering anything more than a prima facie opinion, that if the Commonwealth be vested with direct powers over trusts, combinations, and monopolies, in relation to production, manufacture, or supply, it will be within our power to do what we like. necessary, because, if the commerce power which is sought under another Bill, be conferred upon the Commonwealth, it will be found that this power is included in that. iSimilarly this power is covered, to some extent, by the power which is sought in the Constitution Alteration (Corporations) Bill. Consequently, we are unnecessarily multiplying our powers. I do not know that under the power to deal with trusts, combinations, and monopolies in restraint of trade we could not control prices to the extent that is necessary. The power possessed by the United States of America is the power to regulate jtrade and commerce among the States, with foreign countries, and with Indian tribes. Under that power Green, that Congress can regulate freights and prices in relation to Inter-State commerce. That was a case in which it attempted to regulate the profits of a corporation which was formed under a State law. The Court held that, while Congress could not control the operations of that combination in regard to domestic commerce, it could control its operations in regard to Inter-State commerce.. ferred by the Constitution? be widened in the way that the Government propose, I believe that we could control prices, as they are attempting to do in America. In that country, the power to regulate freights by means of the InterState Commission has been deduced from the commerce power. The power to prescribe freights has been conferred on that Commission, and has been exercised under the commerce power. But I would like to refer to the question of controlling production and manufacture. It has been said that unless we are empowered to control manufacture we cannot possibly deal with alleged trusts, such .as the Sugar Refining Trust in America. I do not want to prejudge the case of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in Australia. But in America it has been held that, so long as the Sugar Refining Trust produces and sells to Inter-State purchasers or directly sends its products into the stream of commerce, whether Inter-State or external, it is, under the commerce power, subject to the control of Congress. The first case decided in America was what is known as the Sugar case. In it the prosecution failed. It was the first case brought under the Act of 1890. Subsequently the company was successfully prosecuted. In 1908, after a little more experience had been gained of the operation of the Anti-Trust Acts, the prosecution was successful. The reason why it failed in the first instance was because the operations of the trust had no relation to commerce or trade at all. The Sugar Refining Company took over control of the four other concerns. They",37,Hughes

257,Mr Glynn,"Yes. Buti f that powerwere all Pennsylvania corporations. The direct sales by the trust were for consumption within the States. The sales for consumption outside the States were made by the primary purchasers from the trust, and not uncler any arrangement between the trust and themselves. Hence there could be no successful charge brought against an amalgamation which directly related to manufacture, and did not relate to sales for the purpose of commerce. In 1908 the question of the trust again cropped up. In the meantime there have been several successful prosecutions. prosecution of a combine in connection with the supply of iron pipes throughout America, in what is known as the Addyston iron pipe industry. In that case the distinction between it and the Sugar case was referred to. It was mentioned that in the Addyston Pipe case, which was decided in 1899, every member of the Court endorsed the view of Mr Justice Harlan, who was the dissenting Judge in the Sugar case, thatTliere was proof that the combine was engaged in disposing of their manufactured goods in diverse States; ""and that such proof, the majority of the Court held, was lacking in the Knight case. In a subsequent case, Pennsylvania Sugar Refining Company v. American Sugar Refining pompany, 166, Federal Reporter, page 254, the latter company was prosecuted, and successfully prosecuted, because it attempted, by controlling manufacture, to control the operations of a rival manufacturing company by limiting the volume of exports from Pennsylvania to other parts of the United States of America. That circumstance shows that, if a prosecution of some of our local companies were instituted under our Anti-Trust Acts as they stand, it does not follow that that prosecution would fail. In that case it was mentionedI f a contract in restraint of trade only affects part of this judgmentproducts within the limits of a State it is subject only to State laws, any remote or incidental effect on Inter-State commerce being insufficient to bring it within the Federal law; but if , in addition, it attempts to control the disposition of the manufactured article across State lines it then directly affects Inter-State commerce, and is within the prohibition of the Federal Act. In the judgment it is statedAn agreement or combination for the elimination of competition, from an economic point of view, may not operate in restraint of trade. It may actually develop and increase trade. Such an agreement, however, from a legal view-point is necessarily in restraint of trade. The law regards competition as the life of trade, and so that which restricts competition restrains trade. [231]2 But a contract in restraint of trade may or may not be in restraint of Inter-State trade. If it directly affects only production in the limits of a State it is in restraint of Intra-State trade, and is subject only to State laws. Any remote or incidental effect upon Inter-State trade is insufficient to bring it within the Federal enactment. If , however, the contract go further, and for example, control the disposition of the manufactured article across State lines, it directly affects Inter-State commerce, and thus may contravene "" both State, and national laws. On the other hand, a conspiracy to prevent a manufacturer who procures his supplies and disposes of his products by means of InterState commerce from engaging in business at There was a all necessarily places restraints upon such commerce. Its flow is restricted and interrupted. The importation and exportation of articles of commerce are directly prevented, and none the less so because the conspiracy may be of so wide a scope as to interfere with Inter-State commerce also. There was an attempt to destroy the competition of a rival manufacturing company by preventing it re-starting. The only relation to Inter-State or external commerce was that the company had to import its raw materials and exported the product. That is very often the case in Australia. Even in the case of sugar, raw material,has to be imported. This company imported its raw materials and exported the finished product to other States, and by suppressing the competition of a manufacturing company, it had a direct relation to trade and commerce, and as such was held to be subject to the Federal jurisdiction of the antitrust laws. So far only one case has been brought before the Court to test the efficacy of our legislation within the present power. It has been said that it would be equally futile tq attempt to prosecute in other cases. My reply is that the Government can prosecute in cases of similar facts under the authority of the more recent American decision to which I . have referred. Let me quote from another It must be clearly borne in mind that the defendants in this case are not charged simply with preventing the plaintiff from engaging in a manufacturing business. If they were, the Knight decision would undoubtedly be applicable. They are expressly charged also with preventing ihe plaintiff from engaging in InterState commerce-wit h preventing the importationof raw materials and the exportation of the manufactured product. In fact, the allegations go so far as to charge a conspiracy to prevent the Inter-State transportation of materials and products. In the face of these allegations this Court cannot say, as a matter of law, that the main purpose of the conspiracy was to prevent manufacture, and that its effect upon Inter-Statetrade was incidental and remote. The combination in the Knight case was for the purpose of procuring control of the corporations in question, and, undoubtedly, of monopolizing the sugar business. The purpose of the conspiracy in the present case was not only to obtain control of the plaintiff corporation, and thus doubtless acquire a monopoly, but to exercise the power of control so obtained to wholly prevent the plaintiff from engaging in a business, the carrybetween the American and the Australian ing on of which necessarily involved Inter-State commerce. We have been told by the Attorney-General within the last twenty-four hours that the operation of a local sugar company extends beyond two States-that the refining process is carried on in one State for the purpose of supply in another. say that theie is or is not an offence in that case. All that I can submit is that in the light of the American decision it is too soon to say, merely because an obstacle on the facts has been met with in connection with the first case brought under our anti-trust law, that that law is a failure. I could point to case after case since 1890 in which the law has been successful in the United States of America. I could point to a tile combinationa combination carried on in a State but whicn affected the stream of 1 commerce by diminishing the volume, and was therefore successfully prosecuted. could also point to a successful coal trust prosecution under circumstances somewhat similar to those alleged in the local case. tion? believe that we cannot get at these bodies here uncler a power quite as ample as that in operation in the United States, although in expression it is not identical. We have amended our legislation by omitting the words "" to the detriment of the public."" When you first include a phrase, and subsequently omit it, you impliedly give to the first words-in the case of our Act the words "" restraint of trade ""a wider significance than they would have had had they been passed originally without the words "" to the detriment of the public "" being attached to them. Is a rule of construction. although the words "" to the detriment of the public "" do not occur in the Sherman Act, they'do in the decisions of the Court. Cook on Combinations defines "" monopoly "" asAny combination the tendency of which is to prevent competition in its broad and general sense and to control and thus at will enhance prices to the detriment of the public. That, according to this authority, is a legal monopoly which may also exist without combination. Under our Act it is open to the defence to show that the matter complained of was not to the detriment of the public, and was not unreasonable in the circumstances. If there is a difference law, it is in favour of the Commonwealth law, because in America a primd facie case of detriment to the public must certainly be established. That is also the law as to restraint of trade in England. A restraint that is merely partial, even although it may involve some I do not limitation upon the right of competition of other people, is held to be good as long as it is reasonably applied. Buti f it is more than partial, if it covers a very wide areaand in America they take the test of "" extent,"" the Court in the Standard Oil case saying literally that the question of extent involved the question of whether it was reasonable or not-the n it may be successfully dealt with. If , in the opinion of any man of common sense the extent is so great as to amount to a detriment to the public, either in its tendency or operation, then it is opposed to the Federal law in America, and also to our law. TheI chances of a successful prosecution in our case, however, are greater than they are in America, because we have so amended our Act that now all that the Crown need prove is that there is restraint of, or an attempt to restrain, trade where the prosecution is for monopolization or for entering into a contract to monopolize or restrain trade. Then the person charged, if on the whole the acts complained of involve some detriment, must prove that the act' is not to "" the detriment of the public,"" and-the phrases are conjunctive"" was not unreasonable in the circumstances."" The defendents may show that it was not to the detriment of the public, and still be convicted, unless they can show that it was not unreasonable in the circumstances. It is not unfair to suggest that there may be in Australia cases That which, if prepared with that care that In America, characterizes all prosecutions by the Crown, would be successful. The Crown Law Department, I believe, does its work very well. We cannot always command success, but I believe, as the result of direct knowledge, as well as of indirect knowledge gained by reading reports of proceedings in Court, that a great amount of energy and zeal is given to the consideration of",39,Hughes
258,' Sir John Quick,Did it affect produc,41,Hughes
259,Mr Glynn,"Yes. Why should wetthe evidence in these cases before they are «ent on to the Court. It is too soon to say sthat we have failed under an Act more -favorable to the prosecution than is the .American Act, seeing that in the United ^States of America a great many prosecutions have succeeded. As regards the scope -of this amendment, in pointing out what its effect will be, I shall confine myself to --What was said in the American Sugar case. ""We are proposing to deal with production. How can a combination in production be rinjurious to the public? One can conceive -of very few cases in which it would be injurious to the public. A man produces -for exchange. Cases where men produce -merely for their own requirements, or to -supply every one gratis, are too rare to be -worthy of consideration. Presumably, pro-duction is for fhe purpose of exchange, and the moment you proceed to the course of -exchange you become subject to the antitrust power. That being so, if this amendment were passed in the terms which I :have suggested, such dealings would be -subject, if not to the power in regard to -restraint of trade, at all events to the .general Inter-State power, and to the special -trust power as regards all trade. Production will cover everything, apart from trade -and commerce, and the supply of services, that manufacture does not touch. What 4he effect would be of including manufacture was pointed out by the Chief Justice in the first of the American .Sugar cases known as the Knight case. He said, quoting the words of the judgment in .another case in which there was a successful prosecutionNo distinction is more popular to the common -mind, or more clearly expressed in economic and political literature, than that between manufacture and commerce. Manufacture is transformation-the fashioning of raw materials into a -change of form for use. The functions of commerce are different. The buying and selling and the transportation incident thereto constitute commerce; and the regulation of commerce in >tlie constitutional sense embraces the regulation at least of such transportation. . . . be held lhat the term includes the regulation of all such manufactures as are intended to be the subject of commercial transactions in the future, it is impossible to denv that it would also inelude all productive industries that contemplate the same thing. Congress would be invested, to the exclusion of -the States, with the power to regulate, not only 'manufactures, but also agriculture, horticulture, stock raising, domestic fisheries, mining-in -short, every branch of human industry. For is -there one of them that does not contemplate, cmore or less clearly, an Inter-State or foreign -market? Does not the wheat-grower of the -north-west, and the cotton planter of the south, plant, cultivate, and harvest his crop with an eye on the prices at Liverpool, New York, and Chicago? The power being vested in Congress and denied to the States, it would follow as an inevitable result that the duty would devolve on Congress to regulate all these delicate, multiform, and vital interests-interest s which in their nature are and must be local in all the details of their successful management. . . The demands of such supervision would require, not uniform legislation generally applicable throughout the United States, but a swarm of Statutes only locally applicable and utterly inconsistent. Any movement towards the establishment of rules of production in this vast country, with its many different climates and opportunities, would only be at the sacrifice of the peculiar advantages of a lfirge part of the localities in it , if not of every one of them. On the other hand, any movement toward the local, detailed, and incongruous legislation required by such interpretation would be about the widest possible departure from the declared object of the clause in question. Then he goes on to deal with what may be called the political considerations against the policy of such an extension of power, which, of course, in a matter of doubtful interpretation, must have some force with Courts of Justice^ I have trespassed, perhaps, more than I intended in dealing with the legal aspect of the case, but it is necessary to do so for the right understanding of what the power is. Let us now take the case of combinations in relation to manufacture, supposing there was no direct relation, in the operations of trusts, between manufacture and commerce. Could we control such trusts under the existing power? I^have said that it is the duty of the States* to do so; and we are not to suppose that the States will fail in these matters when they really become conscious of the substantial growth of the evil. It is true that the evil has not attained very great magnitude up to the present, but it is our duty to check it. Thai is, I think, common ground of policy on the part of honourable members on both sides. I said that no attempt had been made by the States to control these trusts except in New South Wales by a somewhat If it limited Act. I cannot see why, however, if there be a detrimental combination among producers-say , sugar producers-it is not possible to reach it under the Tariff, as well as the commerce power-unde r the The result would be that power in reference to restraint of trade. Why could we not provide, as in Canada, that if any such combination is helped b; an import duty, that duty should be re duced or abolished until the evil is checked ? What objection could there. be to that? ally altering the Tariff. ber found to-morrow that there was a huge trust in Queensland affecting the consumption of a commodity, and, under our policy, inflicting an annual fine of ;£i,ooo,ooo on the people of Australia, would he think it too great a trouble to alter our policy once in three or four years in order to mitigate the evil ? What would the people of Australia say to their representatives if the latter appeared on the hustings and said that, although they had at hand an easy method of automatically affecting the operations of a body which inflicted a fine of jQi,000,000 a year on the consumers, they had refused to use it because of the trouble? of putting it . the logical result; but I shall not prejudge the case until I have read the report of the Sugar Commission. tated to ask why it . is-that the people of Australia should be asked to pay 000,000 a year more than is necessary for their sugar; and I think we could, by the he has made to this debate. Honourable ordinary operation of the Tariff, attain the same result as in Canada. ago the Canadian Parliament passed an Act providing that the duty should be reduced or abolished under the circumstances I have indicated, and I believe that the law has proved pretty effective. There is in Canada a Committees Investigation. Act, passed in 1910, and a similar law has America. That Act provides for the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry where there is any allegation by a representative body of people that a trust exists; and if , after evidence, the Commission reports that a trust does exist, and that it affects the public prejudicially, and the operations of the trust do hot cease, a fine of $1,000 a day is inflicted, with other incidental penalties. that the Attorney-General has not seen fit to propose some auxiliary to the operation of the Australian Industries Preservation Act on the lines so successfully adopted in Canada. It was only within the last week that we heard that the United Shoe Company had been dealt with, and there have been other cases in which combines have been put an end to. Even in America, as we learn from the newspapers, there have been successful prosecutions of some of the trusts originally controlled? by Mr Harriman; and all this has beendone under the unextended commerce power. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition, and other honourable members on this side, would be willing to give whatever power is necessary to deal with trusts on such lines. Mt. GLYNN -Trusts are condemned by no one more than by honourable members on this side; but all that it is necessary to do is to extend the power to cases where there is restraint of trade, whether, within a State or in Inter-State commerce. I am quite sure that Parliament would be quite willing to give legislative effect toany proposals that the Government could* show to be reasonably necessary. Under the circumstances, I again express regret, as on a former occasion, that the poweradequate to the necessities of the case has-not been asked for,, because that would! have resulted in unanimity on both sides. Personally, I feel under a great debt of gratitude to the honourable member for Angas for the very valuable contributionmembers on all sides ought to recognise theA few years untiring industry and thoughtfulness of the honorable member in helping us to arrive at an independent judgment on these various complicated questions. The proposedamendment of the Constitution before us isone of tremendous importance and significance, deserving particular attention and' detailed discussion. I believe that it will been adopted in form the real battle-ground of the parties;, and it is highly desirable that the public should be assisted by the debates in this House as to the possible meaning and development of the proposed constitutional s amendments. I , therefore, desire to subject it to careful analysis in order to seewhat it really means. We have to considerwhether any case has been made out showing the necessity for such an amendment,, I am sorry or whether the Constitution is strong enough, as it stands to deal with the problems presented by trusts and combines. Then, again,, we have to ask ourselves whether Federal' legislation, as it exists at present, is sufficient to deal with such organizations, or whether there is any possibility of improving Federal legislation under the Constitution as it is to meet the circumstances.

In the In the words of the proposed trade and commerce, ""because,"" he said, case of The Pennsylvania Sugar Company v. The American Sugar Company, it was made obvious that the Federal authority is not crippled where production and manufacture are concerned. company alleged that had been to purchase raw sugar in different fer it to Pennslyvania, where it . was manufactured into refined sugar, and, sold in the course of Inter-State commerce. The defendant company, which figured also in the Knight case, had conspired, lt was alleged, to prevent the plaintiff from engagthe States and with other countries are, in ing in the refinery business in competition with it. It was held by the Court that the conspiracy alleged directly operated, not alone in restricting and preventing the manufacture of sugar in the State of Pennsylvania, but also in restricting interState commerce, and the transportation and delivery of raw material and of the manufactured product, and was, therefore, within the Anti-Trust law. The object of the conspiracy, the Court held, was to exclude the plaintiff from the business. The refinery was to be shut down, and the Inter-State shipments would thus have been prevented or reduced. Knight's case turned on the manufacture and production of sugar within a State, without reference to any effect on Inter-State commerce. It was held that if a contract in restraint of trade not only affects production within a State, but in addition attempts to control the disposition of the manufactured article across State lines, it then directly affects Inter-State commerce, and is witbin the prohibition of the Federal Act. It was held, too, that the conspiracy alleged not alone on the manufacture of sugar within the State of Pennsylvania, but on Inter-State commerce in the transportation and delivery of both raw material and manufactured product, and was therefore within the Federal Anti-Trust Act. my opinion, those cases cut the ground away from the contention of the Attorney General that there is necessity for an amendment giving the Federation control over production and manufacture. decision in Knight's case has been modified by the declaration that where production and manufacture is limited and restricted, and there is an interference with Inter-State trade, the Federal jurisdiction attaches, and if the facts are proved, the case comes within the Federal law. \When I say the Federal law, I mean Sir John Quick. both the anti-trust legislation of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Sherman* Act of the United States. I am firmly convinced that a careful and calm survey off The plaintiff the cases decided in the Supreme Court of its business the United States under , the Sherman Act,, coupled with the decision of our Court in-, States, and to transthe Vend case, will show thaf we have astrong power over trusts, combines, and' monopolies engaged in Inter-State trade, whether for good or for evil.

They are strong; enough to give this Parliament authority, to deal with trade and commercebetweenthe States and with other countries in any shape, form, phase, manifestation or development. This Parliament has as strong a power as has the Imperial Parliament in? this matter. Within the limitation that the trade and commerce must be between the States, or with other countries, there is no restriction. If it be thought that our Anti-Trust Act is not drastic enough,, allowing too much latitude, or is not sufficiently specific, it would be easy to amend 1 it. Constitution ? in regard to trade and commerce, subject to the limitation I have mentioned, are asgreat as the Imperial Parliament could' give us. By putting into the Constitution, a provision dealing with trusts, combines, and monopolies in reference to tradedirectly operated and commerce, we do not add to our power; we merely carve off part of thelarger power granted by the Constitution. Why should we do that? It is possibl'ethat the words may prove a restriction oni our legislation instead of giving an extenIn sion of our power. The trump card of the Government in this connection is said to be the proposal of a grant of power to legislate in respect of production and manufacture. I have shown that we have alreadyThe power to deal with any limitation or restriction of production or manufacture interfering with the volume of Inter-Statetrade.

But here the air rings with cries of trusts, combines and monopolies within the States, although we do not find any evidence of their existence. It is singular that though there has been a lot of talk about the Brick Combine in Victoria, and though it has been alleged that it has interfered with the State Government in. the erection of its works, up till a few weeks ago the State Government was hot sure whether a combine existed to the detriment of the public. In a paragraph in the press I read quite recentl) that when the Chief Secretary of Victoria was asked to appoint a Commission to inquire into the operations of the Brick Combine, he assented to the proposal with a view to ascertaining whether there was such a combine in existence which was detrimental to the interests of the community. there is a Brick Combine. combine, but is it detrimental to the public interests? The Minister of Trade and Customs and his party do not denounce all agreements. There may be honourable understandings which do not injure the public, but Which prevent cut-throat competition. My contention is that the grievances or mischiefs which exist, and which are of such a character as to justify Federal intervention, are of an Inter-State, and not Intra-State character. If there are local combines which require fighting we may fairly leave them to be dealt with by the State Legislatures. ber think there is any chance of them being dealt with by the State Parliaments? in New South Wales a Labour Government has been in power for two years, and has not brought forward an Anti-Trust Bill.. Surelyi f there had been any serious complaints in that State it would have utilized its golden opportunity to put such a measure on the statute-book. Yet the old bogy of the Legislative Councils of the States is trotted out on every occasion. Where is there an instance of any Legislative Council in the Commonwealth having rejected an Anti-Trust Bill?

278,Mr Fenton,"Ho w many times did themember of the Legislative Assembly of this State? it upon land questions, but not in respect of trusts and monopolies. I would not be afraid to criticise the Legislative Council of Victoriai f it rejected any measure which was demanded in the interests of the public. But no honourable member opposite can point to any case in which an Anti-Trust Bill has been thrown out by a Legislative Council. The principal area in which trusts and combines operate in Australia is the Inter-State area. In that area we have unlimited power over them. If the present law is not adequate to deal with them, we have a right to amend it. follow the precedents established in the United States of America, in Canada, and in New Zealand. As I have already pointed out, in the United States of America it is intended to establish a Bureau of Corporations to watch the operations of corporations engaged in Inter-State trade. In the same way we might constitute the Inter-State Commission a Bureau of Corporations to watch the flow of Inter-State trade. It could be empowered to do that, and to see that nothing was done detrimental to the public interest. Last night the Attorney-General referred to what he considered to be some defects of the present Act. He spoke of the difficulty of securing the necessary preliminary proofs. If it be necessary to remove any difficulties mission to maintain Inter-State Free Tradein that direction, let him bring down an amending Bill, and I am sure he will have no difficulty in inducing Parliament to pass it.

In that case the onus of proof was, to some extent, cast on the Crown. Under the latest Act all that the Crown has to do is to prove that theoperations of a trust are in restraint of trade, and the onus will then be cast ons the defendants to show affirmatively that that restraint of trade is not detrimental to the public and is not unreasonable. They will have to prove that they are innocent, instead of the Crown having to prove that they are guilty. That may have been oneof the causes of the failure of the prosecution in the recent case. I mention this to show that if the Ministerial party arc earnest in their desire to fight trusts, monopolies, and combines, and the law is not strong enough to enable them to do so,. Parliament should be asked to strengthen* it. But, apparently, they will not adopt In doing that we can that course. What they want is the sanction of the people to wholesale proposals, which are part of a wider scheme of nationalization and Socialism. I repeat: that it would be better to vest in the InterState Commission the inquisitorial power which is at present vested in the Ccmptroller-General of Customs. But whatever may be the composition of that Commission, I presume it will have to obey the mandate of Parliament. If the power to examine records-, and witnesses in order to pave the way to a prosecution be vested in that body, it canbe exercised more effectively than it canbe exercised by the Comptroller-General of Customs, who has other duties to» perform. It will be the duty of the ComThe honourable member for Angas has already directed attention to the manner in-which trusts, combines, and monopolies arefought in Canada. I think that it will befound instructive to look a little more indetail at what has been done there. I wish, to supplement the honourable member's remarks, and to show to what extent assistance and light can be gained from a perusal of the Canadian law. The Act, which is entitled "" An Act to provide for the investigation of Combines, Monopolies, Trusts,, and Mergers,"" and was assented to on 4th May, 1910, begins by providing for the appointment of a Board of Investigation, and giving a definition of what constitutes a combine. I*, declares that"" Combine"" means any contract, agreement, arrangement, or combination which has, or is designed to have, the effect of increasing or fixing the price or rental of anv article of trade or commerce or the cost of the storage or transportation thereof, or of the restricting competition in or of controlling the production, manufacture, transportation, storage, sale or supply-",46,Hughes

283,Sir John Quick,"It was instituted'thereof, to the detriment of consumers or producers of such articles of trade or commerce. : . Then, again, section 5 provides thatWhere six or more persons, British subjects resident in Canada, and of f u l l age, are_ of opinion that a combine exists, and that prices have been enhanced or competition restricted by reason of such combine to the detriment of producers or consumers, such persons may make an .application for an order directing investigation into such alleged combine. Section7 provides that I f upon such hearing the Judge is satisfied that -there is reasonable ground for believing that a combine exists which is injurious to trade or which has operated to the detriment of consumers or producers, and that it is in the public -interest that an investigation should be held, the Judge shall direct an investigation under the provisions of this Act. . . . The order of the Judge directing an investigation is transmitted by him to the Registrar, and then goes before the Minister, who proceeds to appoint a Board, which, it -is provided, shall consist of three members. Section 11 provides thatOf the three members of the Board one shall be appointed on the recommendation of the persons upon whose application the order has been ,-granted, one on the recommendation of the persons named in the order as being concerned in -the alleged combine, and the third on the recommendation of the two members so chosen. Then, in section 18, it is declared thatThe Board shall expeditiously, fully and caref u l l y inquire into the matters referred to it and -all matters affecting the merits thereof, including the question of whether or not the price or .rental of any article concerned has been unreasonably enhanced, or competition in the supply thereof unduly restricted, in consequence of a combine The Board is to make a full report to the Minister, and it is provided, under section 23, thatAny person reported by a Board to have been .guilty of unduly limiting the facilities for transporting, producing, manufacturing, supplying, storing, or dealing in any article which may be .a subject of trade or commerce; or of restraining or injuring trade or commerce in relation to any such article; or nf unduly preventing, limiting or lessening the manufacture or production of any such article; or of unreasonably -enhancing the price thereof; or of unduly preventing or lessening competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation, storage or supply of any such article, and who thereafter continues so to offend, is guilty of an indictable offence and shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars and costs for each day after the expiration of .ten days. . . . This Act of the Dominion Parliament has already been successfully applied. I read in the Argus of 29th ultimo a report from its Canadian correspondent, stating thatThe Combines Act, placed on the Dominion statutes three years ago, has had its first test. The majority of the Federal Government Commission appointed to inquire into the United Shoe Manufacturing Companv have reported that the company is "" a combine in restriction of trade,"" and, as such, liable to a penalty of 1,000 dol. a day. The commissioners recommend that the company be given six months' grace within which to dissolve, or cease its monopolistic operations. It is a United States enterprise, which furnishes Canadian boot and shoe manufacturers with machinery for their factories. It controls the patents, and forbade its customers to purchase from rival machinery men. A large boot manufacturer complained to the Government, and the finding outlined above is the result. The report of this successful prosecution suggests that the Canadian Act contains prohibitions which might be added to our own law, with a view to strengthen and improve it. I think we ought to avail ourselves of any legislation, whether it be American, Canadian, or otherwise, to improve our own, and to make it so effective as to preserve the principle of freedom of Inter-State trade. New Zealand, also, has in force ah Anti-Trust Act, which was passed in 1910. The hearing of the first test case under that Act was concluded in Wellington about the 28th ultimo. In a report, dated Wellington, 30th November, it is stated thatThe Supreme Court has reserved judgment in the prosecution of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the Merchants' Association for a breach of the Commercial Trusts Act. This is the first prosecution under the Commercial Trusts Act, passed two years afro. Besides the Merchants' Association and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, several other firms are concerned. The statement of claim alleged that the defendant firms named were members of the Merchants' Association, whose objects and business included the restriction of competition among its members in the sale and control of merchandise. The firms named were further alleged to be members of a ring or combination of sugar buyers who had entered into an agreement among themselves as to the price and terms on which they would re-sell the sugar purchased from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The provisions of the Act, under which that prosecution was instituted, might well be considered by the Attorney-General's Department, with a view of determining whether they would be of assistance to us in formulating an improved anti-trust law. I propose to refer to several of its provisions. It is provided in section 3 thatEvery person commits an offence who, either as principal or agent, in respect of dealings in any goods, gives, offers, or agrees to give to < any other person any rebate, refund, discount, concession, allowance, reward, or other valuable consideration for the reason or upon the express or implied condition that the latter personfa) Deals or has dealt or will deal, or intends or undertakes or has undertaken or will undertake to deal, exclusively or principally. . . . and so forth. Every person commits an offence who, either as principal or agent, refuses, either absolutely or except upon disadvantageous or relatively . disadvantageous conditions, to sell or supply to any other person, or to purchase from any other person, any goods for the reason that the latter person(a) Deals or has dealt or will deal, or intends to deal, or has not undertaken or will not undertake not to deal, with nny person or class of persons. . Section5 deals witli illegal monopolies; section 6 provides for penalties in respect of sales at prices fixed by a commercial trust; 'section 7 deals with sales by a commercial trust; section 8 provides when prices are to be deemed unreasonably high; and section 9 imposes a penalty of ^500 for aiding and abetting offences against the Act. It will be interesting to observe the result of the litigation in New Zealand to which I have referred, and to see whether it is likely to help us in improving our own Anti-Trust Act. The Attorney-General in some of his addresses, and particularly in the speech he delivered last night, referred to the Vend case. He seemed to cite it as an example of the failure and inadequacy of our anti-trust law, because upon appeal the decision given by Mr Justice Isaacs in that case was upset. There is a rather curious circumstance connected with that case. At the hearing, before Mr Justice Isaacs, the Vend, consisting of eighteen or nineteen companies, was convicted of an illegal conspiracy in limiting its output in restraint of Inter-State trade, and each member of it was fined £s > with costs o<3 amounting to nearly j£i8,ooo. The members of the Vend have paid those penalties and also their share of the costs, and the Commonwealth is now in possession of that money. The Vend, comprising the coal companies, did not appeal against the decision given by Mr Justice Isaacs, and that decision, so far as they are concerned, is affirmed. parently acquiesced in the judgment, and allowed the ship-owners to fight out the case before the High Court. that the ship-owners succeeded in upsetting the conviction, but they succeeded only on Sir John Quick. the ground that the case against them hadl not been proved. The decision given by Mr Justice Isaacs was not upset on the ground of the inadequacy of either the Constitution or the Federal anti-trust, law. I propose to quote a paragraph from. his judgment, portion of which remainsunchallenged even by the decision of theSection4 providesHigh Court in the appeal case. Dealing, with the meaning of the word "" monopoly,"" he saidI have now to ask myself the question, Doesthis amount to monopolizing, or an attempt tomonopolize, or combination, or conspiracy tomonopolize the Inter-State trade or commerce in. Newcastle coal, with intent to restrain, to the detriment of the public its supply or price? The intent is obvious-and to prevent any possiblemisconception I unhesitatingly find its existenceas a matter of fact from the whole circumstances. I invite the attention of the Attorney-General to another quotation, because it showsIsaacs-and his dictum is unchallenged* even by the judgment of the High Courtthe Federal authority extends to production and manufacture which interfere with' the volume of Interstate trade. Here iswhat he saidI have no doubt, ancl I cannot imagine any doubt existing that the intention of the defendants was to monopolize in the sense in whichi I have explained that term. They intended toefface competition in every form-competitio n of production, which is only material here as bearing on the Inter-State trade in the article when> produced, and competition of carriage. They intended to grasp into one huge hand the whoreInter-State supply of Newcastle coal. I lay stress on the passage whicE speaksabout the intention to ' efface competi1 tion."" All this is consistent with theAmerican cases quoted by the honorable member for Angas and myself this afternoon, showing that the authority does extend to production and manufacture whenthere is such restriction as to interfere with, the free flow of commerce between the States. It will be seen, therefore, that there is no necessity for the amendment as proposed. This decision, so far as the shipping companies were concerned, wasreversed on appeal, but stands as against the Coal Vend; and the Federal Government have in the Treasury the ^20,000' paid by the Vend. This, of course, showsThey apthat the Federal law has been vindicated, and the conviction remains in the absence of any appeal. I contend, therefore, that It is true the Federal law has proved strong enoughto d«al with all this class of cases. The Coal Vend, no doubt, had exercised its-",47,Hughes
284,"That, According To The View Of Mr Justice","influence to limit the output and to impose a maximum and minimum price; and it was convicted because its action limited production and interfered with the flow of InterState trade. challenged either before Mr Justice Isaacs or in the High Court. It is of no use for the Attorney-General to continually harp and lay stress on Knight's case, when it is quite obvious that, both in America and in Australia., that case may be differentiated from any in which there has been diminished production resulting in diminished Inter-State trade. The reversal of Mr Justice Isaacs' decision in the shipping case was not on any legal point at all-no t on the inadequacy of the Federal Constitution or law-bu t on the facts themselves; and I should like to quote one or two passages from the judgment, in order to give honourable members and the public generally the opportunity to consider the real facts of the case. I confess that it did seem somewhat strange that there should be a reversal of a judgment so well considered, so elaborate, and, apparently, so well built up. But we here are not in such a. good position to form a judicial estimate of the merits of the case as were the Judges on the Bench. We are in the fighting arena, and we, naturally, have our own bias and opinions, while the Judges are placed on the Bench to deal out justice between man and man and company and company. that there may be some who do not agree with the reversal of Mr Justice Isaacs' decision; but still the judgment is there. Mr J. H . CATTS -Has the judgment against the Coal Vend prevented it doing what it was doing before? prehend that the injunction that was granted is operative and may be enforced, and that if it is not obeyed the Attorney General may move for execution of judgment. The following are extracts from the judgment of Mr Justice Griffith, reported in the Argus Law Reports of 12th November last:Cut-throat competition is not now regarded by a large portion of mankind as necessarily beneficial to the public. Indeed, it is against the evil consequences' of that class of competisuggested intent is an intent to obtain arbitrary tion that the second part of section 4 is aimed. . . . From time to time during the last forty years arrangements have been come to between the owners and the men for the purpose of fixing the hewing rate of coal, which is obviously an important, but by no means the only important, element in the cost of production. In 1873 (if not before), and again in 1886, 1888, and also a common intent to cause such detri 1893, 1900, and iooi, collective agreements, called district agreements, were made between the owners and the men on the basis that the hewing rate should vary with the selling price of coal. Substantially, the basis has always been to fix a minimum rate, with a proviso that This proposition was not for every shilling added to the selling price, fourpence should be added to the hewiftg rate. Other additional expenses at the mine, varying in like manner, raised the total labour additions to the direct cost of extraction to about sixpence halfpenny for every shilling of increase. In substance, therefore, the arrangement was that the owners and the workmen should divide in proportion of about eleven to thirteen any increase in the selling price. This arrangement may or may not have been based on sound principles of political economy, but during a period, as we have said, of forty years, it commended itself as satisfactory to all persons concerned. It may therefore, -prima facie, be regarded as not unreasonable. . . . We now come to deal with the alleged illegal acts with which the defendants are charged. We remark, in the first place, that this appeal is by way of re-hearing, aud that we are bound to form our own independent conclusions as to the facts. We find, as a fact, that at this time all parties honestly believed-and believed on grounds that were not only reasonable but very substantial-that the prosperity of the Newcastle ancl Maitland districts was in danger, as well as their own individual interests, by reason of the excessive competition and unremunerative prices obtained for coal. Whether they were right or wrong in this belief is immaterial, so far as regards the criminal responsibility of the defendants for acts done under it. . First then, as to the Vend agreement. We have already stated the facts as we find them to have existed when it was entered into. In our opinion it was, under the circumstances, a It is true lawful and even laudable transaction, which was intended to operate, and did operate, to the advantage, and not to the detriment of the public at large, notwithstanding that it was intended to operate, and did operate, to raise the price of coal. It would be absurd to attribute to the members of the Vend purely altruistic motives, but a, desire to promote 0 legitimate enterprise from which you desire to obtain pecuniary advantage is not incompatible with an absence of desire to injure the public. When a man enters into an agreement which can be carried out by lawful as well as by unlawful means, the Court will assume primd facie that he intended to do so by lawful means. This has been many times laid down by this. Court. . . . We proceed then to consider whether an intention to cause detriment to the public should be inferred from the acts of the defendants consequent upon the agreement. The detriment primarily relied upon by the Crown is what is called an ""unreasonable"" increase in the price of coal in the Inter-State market, and the and unreasonable prices for coal for the benefit of both the Vend and the ship-owners. . . . The first point made for the Crown is tha 1 the prices fixed by the Vend for coal f.o.b. f c the years 1907 and following years were i i fact unreasonable and exorbitant, from whic! we are asked to infer detriment to the public ment. . . .",49,Hughes
285,Sir John Quick,"Certainly . I apThe argument on which the Court is asked to infer that the f.o.b. prices fixed by the Vend after 1906 were unreasonable appears, when carefully examined, to be based on the following assumptions : i . The price at which a commodity sells in any year is f r i m d facie a price actually remunerative to the producer. 2. That price is f r i m d facie a reasonably .remunerative price, i.e., affords a remuneration with which the producer ought to be contented. 3. Any higher price would be unreasonable. 4. All conditions affecting prices are to be taken as remaining stationary until the contrary is shown. 5. Any rise of prices is f r i m d facie detrimental to the public. In our opinion, none of these assumptions is well founded. . . . We find, as a fact, that the f.o.b. prices of as. a ton fixed for 1907, and ns. a ton fixed for 1908 and afterwards, are not only not shown to have been unreasonable rates, but are shown afiirmatively. to have been reasonable. No inference of intent to cause public detriment can, therefore, be inferred from them. have already said that we cannot find anything on the face of the shipping agreement itself to show that the specified prices c.i.f. were unreasonable. It is not, in our opinion, unfair that the merchants who pay a higher price for 'Coal should ask on re-sale a price higher than a -sum representing the exact equivalent of the increase, in cost price. . . . We are, therefore, bound to decide the case upon the evi-dence, and upon that evidence we are of opinion that the Crown has failed to prove any intent -on the part of the appellants to cause detriment to the public. This disposes of the case as regards penalties. We are also of opinion that the Crown has failed to prove any actual detriment to the public. This disposes of the claim to an injunction under section 10. able member's time has expired. -[5.58] I am very, glad, indeed, to hear the quotations just read by the honourable member for Bendigo, because they bear out the fact that I pointed out last night. They show that, from time immemorial, almost, there has been in the Newcastle district an arrangement between masters and men as to the fixing of the selling price and the hewing rate. There is not a miner or a man interested in the Newcastle district, or any one who knows the district intimately, who will say that the selling price ""at the pit's mouth now is an unreasonable one. The honourable member for Newcastle is present, and will confirm me when I say that the Vend has operated in a beneficial and fair way-that it has been a good thing for both miners and masters. member will recollect that it is only a little while ago when the men were anxious for the employers to raise the price another is., so that 4c]. might be added to the hewing rate. Whatever goes on up there cannot be in the nature of a monopoly. There are several reasons for that. In the first place, there is abundance of competition, so far as at least half their trade-whic h goes oversea-is concerned, and as to the rest there is the curb of the prices ruling in the western and southern districts. There is no trust whatever there, in the sense in whicli we use the word when we apply it to the American combinations. Mr J. H . CATTS -Why was a verdict given against the Vend then? was in favour of the Vend. Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member for Bendigo said the opposite. . . We ring to the decision of Mr Justice Isaacs. Mr J. H . CATTS -The Vend decision was not appealed against. able member for Bendigo said. members are quibbling. They know thafc the Vend case to which I am alluding was specifically excluded by Mr Wise from the consideration of the Court. It was something that happened after the coal had left the district altogether that was complained of, and formed the subject of the trial. I understood the honourable member for Bendigo to refer to Mr Justice Isaacs' decision to show that at no time during the trial had the validity or effectiveness of tice Isaacs indicated that he had complete power, and proceeded to exercise it. The appeal was not on the ground that there had been undue exercise of power, but that there had been a misinterpretation of facts. Nothing was said about the ineffectiveness of the Act. One of those who heard the appeal was Mr Justice Barton, and he had occupied a position enabling him to know the circumstances of the northern coal-field. That is why, in the summing up read by the honourable member for Bendigo, all the details are set forth with such lucidity, and the local circumstances are so fully grasped. Any one comparing the judgment of Mr Justice Isaacs with that of the High Court, will find that the latter contains a clearer and more succinct statement of the local conditions.

336,Mr Joseph Cook,"I was about toentities, if I may so put it, of the various trusts. What he meant was that the combination qr trust itself had been attacked, and he suggested that the proper method was to attack the individuals who compose the trust-to personify the trust, for the purpose of regulation and control-and make the management and the individuals responsible for the actions and depredations of the organization. the manager every month. those rash and silly statements which the honourable member is constantly making, and which do not do him credit. As a matter of fact, a trust manager keeps his position until he becomes a millionaire, and is often there for a lifetime. The management is not changed oftener than can be helped, and it would be impossible to keep changing it, for the success of a trust depends on obtaining the best organizing ability and enabling all the threads to be gathered up and manipulated on a wellconcerted plan, extending, it may be, over years. In any case, it is Dr. Woodrow Wilson's argument, and not mine, at which the honourable member is gibing. So far as I understand, no attempt of the kind suggested has yet been made in America. says, then, that there are no trust depredations ? of those incorrect and silly statements the honourable member is always making, and I suppose he thinks they do him credit. I am as anxious as the honourable member is to deal with trusts, but, to that end, I am not prepared to fundamentally change the character of our Constitution. Two years ago we agreed to a proposal of the Government and their supporters, in order to get more power to deal with trusts; but the Act we then passed has been left religiously alone. The Government cannot know whether the present law is sufficient until it has who passed the first Industries Preservation. been tried, and the non-success of the first and only attempt made is not due to any defect in the law, or the absence of the necessary power. Yet we axe now asked to confer on this Parliament power to control the whole business operations of Australia. In fact, all these proposals rest on an absurd assumption. The present Act gives us large powers of investigation and interrogation, and penalties up to jQs°° a day may be imposed for refusal to answer questions; the proposal before us reminds us of Charles Lamb's Chinaman, who burnt down a house in order to roast his pork. We are told that there aretrusts and combines that are doing damage in Australia, and we have the special instances of shipping and coal. ThreeJudges, one of whom knows all the circumstances intimately, have held that thesecombines are not doing damage to the public; that, on the facts, they are forming; only reasonable combinations with a view to protecting the masters and the men engaged in the industries. The Attorney General contends, however, that these combines are prejudicial to the public, and! produces figures in proof; but, on the same figures, three Judges have held otherwise, and it is for the public to decide. should have said the decison of the Court. The public have now to judge between theAttorney-General, an interested individual, who is using this legislation for political' purposes and propaganda in the interests? of his party, and three Judges detached from all political controversy and prejudice, who consider all such matters purely in the public interest.

The manBill through the House tried the Vend case under the present law, and neither he nor any of the other Judges question the adequacy of our power.

The Attorney-General says we require power to do what we like with any combination, no matter how simple or elementary, or how far-reaching, powerful, or -dangerous; all limitations have to be swept away, ancl the whole industrial arena has to be traversed without let or hindrance. The only test that has been made shows that we have the power already in our law to be used, and the fact that it has not be-come operative, in the direction the Attorney-General desires is because the cir-curnsfcances are not as he has described them. In America this is the outstanding problem, and has been for many years. The Trusts there, due to franchises of -various kinds, by means of which they are .able to wipe out their competitors, get aggregations of power and wealth which sometimes threaten to destroy the Republic itself; and this is better shown in an illustration that I remember. negie Steel Trust was in f u l l blast, another ""Combination was created to fight it . The mew organization had the most up-to-date plant in the world, and everything was seeming f a i r ; only one or two things had been forgotten. The new: Trust had to depend for its raw material on some mines 33 or 14 miles from the works at Chicago, and the Carnegie Steel Trust simply stepped in, bought up the mines and the communicating railway, and compelled the latest organization to merge in the general Steel Trust. That is how aggregations are piling themselves up to-day in America, and acquiring more and more power. kind of thing, however, is impossible in Australia, because the railways are in the hands of the various Governments, and every combination and industrial enterprise as we may, we cannot escape is entitled to equal facilities in land transport. Year by year the effort goes on in America to deal with the trusts; and my All the currents opinion is that by-and-by a way will be found to curb them and make them serve the public while serving themselves in a reasonable way. It is found, so fa r as I can ascertain, in many instances that large management is much more economical than small management-that large management means operations over a wide area, and pressing into its service the best skill and ability in the world. Thus trusts are often able to produce better articles at a cheaper price than is otherwise possible; and nobody has written more eloquently on this The question is how subject than the Attorney-General' himself. Time after time he has told us, in "" The Case for Labour,"" in the Sydney Daily Telegrafh, that it is idle to complain of the trustification of industries-that it is only the following of a natural law, the operation of which is for the benefit of the people alT the time. But you must watch that, while the trust is cheapening its products, is making its management efficient, and is extending its operations, it is not becoming the master, instead of the servant, of the public. The problem is : How can these huge aggregations of capital, these huge combinations of skill and ability, be pressed into the service of the public instead of being used solely to make dividends for their shareholders while they ignore the public interest? In Australia three combines-the Shipping Combine, the Coal Combine, and the Sugar Combine-hav e been recently investigated. The investigation, in the case of the first two, When the Carwas conducted by legal process, with all the legal skill and ability that could be paid for by the Attorney General, and the third by a Commission composed of men for the most part favouring the Labour political view, men who are professed nationalizers of industry, and in sympathy with the Labour programme. These men have now reported against the nationalization of the sugar industry, which, they say, is impracticable, and could not be made to pay. These experts selected by the Government-with , in my opinion, other views-sa y that what we have to do is to regulate and control.

But the sooner we have an effective law to control those managing trusts the better it will be for all concerned. "" Corporations cannot commit treason, nor be outlawed nor be excommunciate, for they have no souls."" But, as Woodrow Wilson has suggested, we must see if we cannot give them a soul and a body in the shape of the soul and body of those who manage them, making them responsible for their actions. When, in this way, we have individualized corporations, and driven home to those who manage them charges of acting injuriously to the public, we shall get at the root of the trouble. done that yet, nor has America. Ifc may be, as alleged by my honourable friends opposite, that America has not succeeded because of the influence of the trusts, but that is not the position here. My honourable friends could bring down a Bill without being influenced by the trusts, individualizing corporations, so that predatory « actions may be sheeted home to those responsible for them. That is the course of action that we should follow. Until we have followed it, it is idle to say, as the Attorney-General did last night, that nolegislation that we can pass will control them. If he thinks that, the Bill is a piece of the sheerest hypocrisy, because its aim and purpose is to control the trusts, there being another Bill to provide for nationalization. His attitude has always been the attitude of the Labour party, and was assumed by Mr J. C. Watson yearsago. He said, "" I shall try this legislation, but I have no faith in it . "" Why do they try it if they have no faith in it? Are they the proper persons to try it ? Why do they not go to the country with a straight-out proposal for nationalization? In my opinion, we can control the trusts, and if our powers are proved to be insufficient, we can get any power needed to make them sufficient, 'assistance to that end being given by every member on this, side of the House. my duty, in regard to this proposed amendment of the Constitution, as it was when the last proposal was before us, to stale the course which will be followed by the Opposition, and to place our position before the House as briefly as possible. Thiswas done last year, when, speaking on behalf of the party, I saidI think the Attorney-General understands that-, whatever power may be necessary to enable this Parliament to deal at once in the most thorough, and complete manner with trusts and combines;, or operations of that kind, the whole Committee Sir Edward Coke once said, is unanimously willing to concede. The Committee included, of course, all members of the Opposition. Again, ber fore the vote was taken, I saidAs to the amendment respecting trusts and. combines, the Opposition has given the Government its support, though desiring that restraint of trade should be a material condition renderingthem amenable to our law. We have given the Government a broad and general assurance that"" any power which' it can show to be required to enable this Parliament to cope in the most effective manner with trusts, combines, and monopolies, would be heartily supported. The amendment moved on that occasion on We have not our behalf by the honourable member for Angas would have extended the grant of power to this Parliament to legislate inrespect ofCombines and monopolies in restraint of trade, commerce, or manufacture in any part of a Stateor the Commonwealth.

357,Mr Deaki N (Ballarat) [8.3 R],"It isour agreement is absolute, our concession unqualified. As I said, when speaking in regard to another proposed amendment this afternoon, we see no reason for changing our attitude in this regard. The amendment which we then moved, but did not carry, can be moved again, but it would only indicate that our views in regard to one of the most important of the proposals that Ministers have placed before the House have not altered. The honourable member for Parramatta has dealt ably and sufficiently, inter alia, with the businessaspects of corporations, their dangers, and the best methods of coping with them. To deal with them effectively, a power of investigation must be intrusted to competent officials above reproach and suspicion and without personal motives. They should make it their business, without disclosing business secrets, to ascertain the exact character and effects of corporation workings, regarding as confidential, as far as that may be possible, the special business knowledge of each, so that those who are managing these concerns honestly will have no. hesitation in submitting the whole of their transactions for scrutiny. Honourable members will recollect that one of the measures submitted by the last Government provided for the establishment of the Inter-State Commission. The intention was that this body should, in its own sphere, have the standing of the High Court, acquire a similar reputation, and be intrusted with a very wide authority. It was to be the arbiter in matters of dispute, its members being assisted by expert skill and knowledge wherever it was required. Its business, among other things, was to inquire into the conduct of organizations threatening private or public interests. Within the last few days, notice of an intention to introduce an Inter-State Commission Bill has been given by this Government.' The efficiency of the body created will depend entirely on the calibre ,_and quality of those who may constitute -the Commission, and the powers with which they are endowed. Nothing is plainer than that the so-called combinations or ""monopolies,"" whatever that means, 'differ in character and purpose as tliey differ in size. SomeI am afraid that they are not numerous-ar e alleged to be innocent, and, indeed, beneficial, to the public. numerous, I suspect that such combinations are not very larg». There are larger combinations whose operations can be fairly measured by intelligent observers,, being conducted, for the most part, in the light of day. They ought not to be difficult to cope with. Behind them, we catch glimpses of trusts of another order, whose processes are secret, merciless, and dangerous to the community.: There is but one opinion throughout Australia as to monopolies of that character,, which use power recklessly and unscrupulously for personal gain. I believe that im nothing are our people more unanimousthan in deciding that the establishment of such trusts within the Commonwealth should be prevented by every means in our power. The gradual growth of such organizations must be watched in order that they may never become powerful enough to> set themselves above the law, above patriotism, and above society, as they are said to have done elsewhere.. For those, I think they will find that theLegislatures of Australia, whatever theircolour, will have scant consideration. The.y will be required to cleanse their processes, and to justify themselves, before they will' be permitted to remain a factor in the Commonwealth. This reference, although crude, issufficient for my purpose, if it remindshonorable members-to return once more to the path of the argument I was pursuinghow necessary it is that there should be a> complete investigation into all the factorsand circumstances concerned before a properdecision can be arrived at, or even expected. Some of my honourable colleagues, notably the honourable members for Angas, for Bendigo, and for Darling Downs, havequoted the researches already made, and thr facts already ascertained beyond question i i the United States of America. They have> shown how absolutely essential it is that there should be a thorough and most search? ing investigation before any step can be taken with confidence. I do not wish, to'detain the House by repeating, although!they deserve to be repeated, many of the official statements already placed before the House, which I trust will be carefully considered by the people. They prove that, just as trusts are discovered operating malignantly in quarters where they werehardly expected, so in places where it seemed perfectly plain that smilar raids upon society were being planned or Eveni f they are executed, investigation has proved that wewere on a false track, and that natural and> ordinary causes will in -some cases, at alt -events, account for phenomena which had can be traced, it had been no material -caused a great deal of alarm.

The two countries that none of us would have expected to be bracketed in such a relation are Russia, with its vast unfilled extent and its unemployed possibilities, and Canada, under very different circumstances, at least in an equally hopeful position. The conjunction of these two countries is the more remarkable since, as I believe I shall be able to show from Canadian testimony, within the borders of Canada trusts and combines practically hardly exist. We find, however, Russia and Canada bracketed together as showing, probably, a more rapid increase of prices than does even the United States of America. The report includes some very interesting tables, with which ' I shall not attempt to deal.

In another summary it is stated that in a decade the products of forests increased by 40.3 per cent, above the prices ruling in 1900; the crude products of the farm by 36.1 per cent., and manufactured products of the farm by 24.2 per cent.; whilst the products of mines and wells increased by 13.5 per cent., and the products of manufacture by only 5.5 per cent.

That appears to me to be the path which the circumstances require us to tread. I wish it had been taken earlier.

As a fact, we are scarcely on the threshold of a great subject, which will require to be investigated before we shall feel ourselves capable of dealing with an issue which assumes sufficient importance to call for national attention. If we turn to Canada we find that the evidence to which I have already alluded is reinforced. An Act passed in May, 1910, in Canada has more than once been referred to in the debate already, and might be profitably referred to again were I desirous of extinguished. This, unduly trespassing on the time of the House. The scope of that Act and its particularity shows that, although Canada is reported to be free from injurious trusts at the present time, a Canadian tribunal exists armed with powers most carefully and elaborately adjusted to the investigation of every suspicious development in trade or production which appears to call for examination. Its definitions are of the widest, and it seems to include everything within the scope of inquiry that could be of service. It actually goes the length of placing in the hands of any six British subjects resident in Canada, who beBut th's should believe a combine exists, and that prices have been enhanced or competition restricted by reason of it, to the detriment of consumers or producers, the power to apply to a Judge to order an investigation to be made. Any six persons in Canada can set the machinery in motion, and the only restriction is the very restriction which we think ought to be applied in the proposal before us. It is a comparatively small restriction in itself, but yet of great value. In Canada the proof has to be that the action of the combine results to the detriment of consumers or producers. It is amazing that there should be any hesitation in granting this very small and mild modification, since, when necessary, larger powers can be added to the immense scope already given by the provision in Canada. Mr J. H . CATTS -But in Canada that is provided in the Bill, and not in the Constitution true. Mr J. H . CATTS -We can put it in the Bill. in our Bill. Its absence from our Constitution is only an invitation to many inquiries which may prove barren, and also lead to a number of others in which the detriment to the public may be expressed by tlie smallest fraction, and investigation would not be worthwhile. The object of our endeavour is to impress on honourable members the wisdom of making this reasonable restriction in order to remove any idea on the part of the public of Australia that there is intended to be what might be called household espionage -an y entering a man's dwelling without warrant or authority, or other abuses of authority. I know the unqualified way in which this proposal may affect persons outside is a factor to be considered.

There is no hesitation or half measures in Canada.

The following shows the scope of the Canadian Act:Combines Act -Canada. AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOB INVESTIGATION OF GERS. Assented 4th May, 1910. "" Combine"" is defined to mean any contract, agreement, arrangement, or combination which has, or is designed to have, the effect of increasing or fixing the price or rental of any -article of trade or commerce or the cost of the storage or transportation thereof, or of restricting competition in or controlling the production, manufacture, transportation, storage, sale, or supply thereof, to the detriment of consumers, or producers of such article of trade or commerce, and includes the acquisition, leasing, or.' otherwise taking over or obtaining by any person to the end aforesaid, of any control over or interest in the business, or any portion of the: business, of any other person, and also includes, what is known as a trust, monopoly, or merger. Six or more persons (British subjects residing, in Canada) who think 1. that a combine exists; 2. that prices have been enhanced or competition restricted by reason of suck combine to the detriment of consumers or producers, may make an application to a Judge for an. order directing an investigation into such alleged combine. If on hearing the Judge is satisfied there is reasonable ground for believing a combine existswhich is injurious to trade or which has operated to the detriment of consumers or producers, and that it is in the public interest that an investigation should be held, an investigation may beordered. A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE A person reported by the Board to have beeni guilty of1. unduly limiting the facilities for transporting, producing, . manufacturing,, supplying, storing, or dealing in any article which may be a subject of trade and commerce; 2. restraining or injuring trade and commerce in relation to any such article 3. unduly preventing, limiting, or lessening: the manufacture or production of any such article; 4. unreasonably enhancing the price thereof :5. unduly preventing or lessening competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation, storage, or supply of any such articleand who thereafter continues so to offend, is guilty of an indictable offence, and liable toa penalty not exceeding 1,000 dollars and costsfor each day after the expirntion of ten davs, or such further extension of time as in the opinion of the Board may be necessary, front the date of the publication of the report of the Board in the Canada Gazette during 'which, Its Parliament has introduced such person so continues to offend. in the same way in Australia. vernment have done nothing. ber for Darling Downs interjects, thisLabour Government has done nothing under its own Act.

374,Mr Deakin,"Becaus e of the apstrict bounds, and their continued supervision by qualified and independent men acting on behalf of the Commonwealth. -The Leader of the Opposition has very properly pointed out that the Liberal party has consistently expressed their willingness by all the legislative means in their power to deal with injurious trusts and combines, and are willing to accept an alteration of the Constitution, which will give effect to that principle. So far as combines are in restraint of trade, this party has always been willing to vote for any alteration of the Constitution necessary to enable them to be effectively dealt with. The idea of attacking trusts and combines is no new thing with the Liberal party, a Bill being introduced in the first Parliament to control them. I refer to a measure presented by the Right Hon. C. C. Kingston, and read a first time on 18th April, 1902. That was a measure covering the first Australian Tariff, and it contained the following clause(1) Whenever the Governor General has reaston was, as he stated, taken from theson to believe that with regard to any. goods Canadian there exists any trust combination association or McKenzie King, the Canadian Minister for agreement of any kind among importers or Labour, the Canadian Act has been of inanufactuiers of, or dealers in such goods to some effect. unduly enhance their price or in any other way to unduly promote the advantage of the imwhich he delivered in the Canadian House porters manufacturers or dealers at the exof Commons on 12th April, 1910pense of the consumers the Governor General may by commission empower any Justice of the High Court or any Judge of the Supreme Court of a State to inquire in a summary way and report to the Governor General whether sucb trust combination association or agreement exists. association exists among manufacturers, which is (2) The Justice or Judge may compel the attendance of witnesses and examine them upon oath and require the production of books and papers and shall have such other powers as are conferred upon him by the Governor General for the purpose of such inquiry. .(3) If the Justice or Judge reports that such trust combination association or agreement exists the report shall be laid before both Houses of the Parliament and the Governor General may upon an address from both Houses of the Parliament by proclamation direct that the goods shall be admitted free of duty or at such reduced rate of duty as will give to the public the benefit of reasonable competition in the goods. The clause was withdrawn, because it was thought that the Bill being a taxing Bill, it might be held that the introduction into it of the provision that I have read might be considered a violation of the Constitution, which says that taxing Bills shall deal with taxation only. In withdrawing it-, Mr Kingston saidAs a matter of policy, perhaps, the course of public business will best be facilitated if we withdraw the clause from the B ill , and deal with it subsequently. I trust that honourable members who agree with the policy contained in the clause will be equally desirous of facilitating its passage when it"" is introduced on a subsequent occasion. The first Deakin Government went out of office, but when the second Deakin Government came into power, it introduced a fuller proposal. I refer to the Australian Industries Preservation Act of 1906. five years. tion, it saw. that it was administered, and, when necessary, commenced prosecutions. party has done nothing at all in this matter., authorized an inquiry. ment has always been in favour of legislation to control trusts and combines, andi took steps for their prosecution in 1907,. as soon as the law was passed. Thelaw. According to Mr This is part of a speechIn 1897, just a year after the present Goverument came into office, new legislation was enacted! in the Tariff resolutions. That legislation is to the effect that whenever the Governor in Council, has reason to believe that a trust, combine, or unduly enhancing prices, he may appoint a Judge to conduct investigations into the business of the alleged combine; and if it be found that a combine does exist, and is benefiting by the existence of the Customs Tariff at the expense of tbepublic, that the Tariff may, either in part or im whole, be modified so as to offer to the consumers that redress to which they are entitled. He mentions a combine whose affairs they, investigated, and with which they dealt ire accordance with the lawThat complaint was brought to the attention of the Government by a resolution {rom the Canadian Press Association of 18th Hay, 1900. Thecoinplaint was considered by the Minister of Finance, and an Order in Council was passed on. lice Taschereau as a Commissioner to -ascertain whether such a dangerous association or combinedid exist. The Commissioner presented his report on 27th November, 1901, and found that a. combine existed which was illegal "" both by theexpress enactment of the Customs Tariff, whicli/ forbids the act complained of, and authorizesdirect Government action, if it is committed, and by section 220 of the Criminal Code, to say nothing of common law on the matter.""

383,"22nd April, Appointing The Honourable Mr Jus","before His Excellency in Council, an Order in Council was passed in February of the following year reducing the duty on news printing paper from 25 per cent, to 15 per cent., which reduction has remained up to the present time. As a. result of this investigation, rendered possible through the legislation of 1897, the consumers of Canada have profited to the extent of a 10 per cent, reduction in the duty on paper ever since, and it is difficult to say how many cases this successful operation of the Act against such SL powerful combination as the Canada paper -manufacturers may not have prevented in like combinations among other manufacturers, or attempts to reap an unfair advantage at the expense of the public in the case of those already m existence. This Parliament has the constitutional right to pass such legislation as that. If in any State, or part of a State, a trust or combine is taking advantage of the Tariff, it is open to us, on the determination of the facts, to reduce its protection, if we think fit, and so bring it to book. That was the proposition of Mr Kingston, whose Protectionist principles no man ever questioned. It was the suggestion of the most ardent advocate of Protection that -ever stood in this House. the honourable member would deal with trusts? they can be dealt with successfully, and in Canada has been applied to one of the largest combines in the country. As to labour conditions, the majority report of our Tariff Commission, which was signed by the honourable members for Bendigo and Capricornia, Senator McGregor, and Mr the evils resulting from trustsFrank Clarke, made this recommendationI f the majority of manufacturers of mining machinery and appliances made in Australia .similar to those upon which additional duties are hereby levied do not after the expiration -of one year of the passing of this Act pay .their workmen engaged in making such machines and appliances a fair and reasonable rate of wages, the Governor General may, in pursuance of a joint address by the Senate and the House of Representatives affirming that such fair and seasonable wages are not being paid, suspend the -collection of such additional duty upon any imochine or appliance for such time as may be -deemed advisable. If persons are found to be taking undue advantage of the Tariff to increase prices, the position can be met by the reduction of duties. All in Australia are keenly alive to the evils of trusts, though this country appears to be relatively free from them; at any rate, we have no evidence of the existence of many trusts or combines of an injurious nature. Government for not prosecuting them? says that the industrial unrest is due to the existence of trusts and combines here, and I say that if that is the view of the Government, they should prosecute those trusts and combines; but my opinion is that those who administer public affairs,and who ought to be able to supply us with information on the subject, have submitted ' no evidence of the existence of injurious trusts and combines. until the evil has been created. We should be prepared in advance. able member that prevention is better than cure. That was why we introduced our anti-trust legislation. The honourable member, on one memorable occasion, pointed out that from a Labour point of view there was a great deal to be said in favour of combines, because they were organizing industry, and thus getting everything ready for its nationalization. He regarded them as a step in Socialistic evolution. Although a trust may do good in securing economy and efficiencv, and facilitating supplies, it may, on the whole, be an evil, and we on this side therefore desire legislation to prevent such from doing harm. In this connection, I cannot do better than give a summary, given by by Professor Jenks, of America, whose book is not in our Library, dealing with Enormous as these benefits to society may be from this better organization of capital under the new regime, no less pronounced arc the evils. (1) Investors of capital are often grievously wronged through concealment of facts and deception practised by promoters and directors at the time an industry is organized, and later through misrepresentation of the condition of business and methods in which a business is carried on. (2) A second class of persons injured is that of the stock-holders. Directors not infrequently manage the business in their own interests, regardless of those of the stock-holders. At times it is really made less profitable, or is so managed as apparently to be less profitable, in order to depress the stock on the market and to enable the directors through gambling speculations to reap large profits. (3) Persons, not members of a corporation, may be injured as consumers by high prices, which can be kept high, provided the combination can secure monopolistic power. The temptation to keep prices above former competitive rates is, of course, greatly increased when the corporation has issued large amounts of watered stock.

I shall not refer at standard of living has steadily advanced, demanding a much higher than was the case a few years o The advance numerically in population and increase in the degree of national education material culture have been the most marked influence in raising prices. These influences have than all other causes combined. We are also informed that the United Honourable States Consul-General in Germany reRapidly-accumulated fortunes and increasing causes of the higher cost of living, not as respects commodities, but as respects total f e r capita expenditures. The table is for the increase in prices. I wish now to refer honourable members to another cause mentioned in the report of the The primary cause of the world-wide advance of prices since 1897 has been the increase of thegold supply, which has reduced the purchasing power of money and brought about a corresponding increase of values measured in money in all the leading commercial States, and at least in the United States has served as the basis for a vast extension of credit. That is only one of many causes given in the report, but since its operation is world-wide I think it desirable to specially mention it. It is plain from the enumeration of the causes of the increase in prices how delicate a problem the regulation of prices will be. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I desire'to see effectual action Review, satisfactorily disposed of that taken to deal with all trusts and combines, but that I cannot see my way to support a series of amendments of the Constitution, the sole object of which is not the effective control or regulation of trusts and combines, but the nationalization of the whole means of production, distribution, and exchange. we are likely to hear more of this proposed amendment of the Constitution than of any other during the forthcoming campaign, I think it desirable to emphasize one or two points in relation to it. We are entitled in the first place to have some information as to the intentions of the Government, if the powers for which they ask be granted to them. If the Government are to prescribe the remedy, surely the people are entitled to ask what it is to be, and what will be its probable effect. We have, first of all, to ask ourselves whether all the denunciation of trusts to which we have listened can be justified. It seems to me that the Government and their supporters have sought to make trusts responsible for many evils which cannot rightly be attributed to them, or for which they cam be blamed to only a slight extent. Are trusts the growth of modern times? Have they grown up as part of the ordinary evolution that has taken place in the commercial world during the past few years? If combinations are a natural growth caused by the necessity of producing articles more cheaply-if people have combined to consolidate several small businesses so as to secure economy in production, that is not altogether something to which objection can be taken. If men have been compelled to combine because of ruinous cut-throat competition on the part of a number of small competitors, that is another reason why we should try to look the whole matter full in the face, and to make ourselves thoroughly cognisant of the facts before we take any rash action. If a combination is a bene-: ficent institution, why should we be iti. such a hurry to deal with it? The honourable member for Darling Downs has just referred to the question of high prices and their cause. To hear honourable members opposite talking of trusts, one would imagine that such organizations are solely responsible for the rise in prices. On a previous occasion I showed that Mr J. A. Hobson, writing in the Contemporary contention. He shows that trusts and similar bodies are only one of a series of causes-som e much greater-for the increase in prices that has taken place of late years, and that that increase, which is world-wide, dates back to about 1895.. Mr Hobson also indicates the conditions under which prices may be expected! to return to their normal level. I admit that there are in the world to-daymany injurious trusts and combinationsthat should be curbed. read of the conditions that prevail in. America must be convinced that there aresome injurious trusts in that countrytrusts with which we should like to deal if they were operating here. One of the matters to be desired in dealing, with trusts and combinations is publicity. If we had some means of making public the operations of trusts-if we could allow public opinion to have its due effect upon them, we' should probably keep most of such organizations within reasonablebounds. I do not pin my faith absolutely to the efficacy of publicity alone as a. means of coping with trusts. I do not attach to it so much importance as does Mr Andrew Carnegie; but I think that it would have a good effect since it would allow public opinion to exercise that healthy influence which it can alwaysbring to bear upon any individual or body of individuals who do wrong. America is probably the home of the trusts. The ravages of trusts are more apparent there than in any other country, yet one canhardly find an American writer who advocates that which honourable members opposite say is the only remedy, namely, the nationalization of such bodies.

As a representative of Tasmania, which State has suffered more than any other from present conditions in the sugar industry, I am not likely to hold a brief for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. own State have suffered much in this connection, while the State revenue has, from the same causes, been largely depleted. But I desire to be fair, and I find that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company pay their employees very well indeed. If that company had not been in existence some years ago, there would not be a sugar industry in Australia to-day. I understand that in the eighties, when there was a great slump in sugar, it was practically insolvent. Since then, it has had a good time. As the result of splendid management, pluck, and perseverance, it is to-day in a strong position. I say that it well deserves success. . It has installed in its various remodelled. fineries the most up-to-date machinery, and it supplies a good article which is more than is usually supplied by any Government which enters the industrial field. VVe have only to go to France, and try the tobacco which is sold there, in order to prove that the Sugar Commission in its report has turned down the proposal to nationalize the industry. that body, I am satisfied that its report is a crushing disappointment to honourable members opposite. All that it does is to Mr Atkinson. advise the adoption of a sliding scale, by which the price to be paid for raw sugar We have been told ' by the and sugar cane respectively will vary irr fixed proportion to the selling price of refined sugar.

It seems to me that some honourable members opposite want to control the whole of our proceedings, and to suppress anything that tells against them. Fortunately, Mr Speaker, you are here to protect us, and by your aid we are able to get in a word or two sometimes,, even though it may not be altogether palatable to the Ministerial party. This Bill purports to control trusts, combines, and monopolies through the instrumentality of the Federal Government. The Attorney-General gave as a reason why the Bill should be passed that there are several injurious combines operating in Australia. He mentioned amongst others the Shipping and Coal Combines, with which the law, strong as it is, could not interfere to any great extent. But the reason why they could not be interfered with was that the Crown was unable to prove that the combines were detrimental to the public. He also mentioned the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. As a matter of fact, our antitrust law is strong enough to deal with the company very rigidly if all that the Attorney-Genera1 said is true. First of all, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has refineries in three States. That makes its manufacturing operations Inter-State. Furthermore, it draws its supplies of sugar from two States and from abroad. In this respect it is not only Inter-State in its operations, but also foreign. It sells sugar in every State of the Commonwealth, and also abroad. Consequently, in respect of [3] 2 2 report of the Sugar Commission. I have Will the not yet had time to read it through, but I the pet scheme of the Ministerial party for I do not wish to the nationalization of the sugar industry. The suggestion has been made that, since re* might enter into competition with existing concerns with a view to keeping down the price of has this to do refined sugar, while raising the price of raw sugar. We cannot recommend the adoption of this suggestion :(1) The suggestion is probably due to an exaggeration of refining profits. The profits of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are largely due to items other than refining. (2) The suggestion is open to several of the objections already considered in relation to nationalization. (3) If the Commonwealth Refinery entered into competition with the Colonial' "" Sugar Refining Company, the Commonwealth Refinery would be severely handicapped. It would have great difficulty in obtaining regular supplies of Australian raw sugar, and in getting its refined article regularly on the market. It would be expected to pay high prices for raw sugar, and to accept low prices for refined sugar. It would, moreover, come into competition with a long-established business conducted \yith a very hijjh degree of efficiency. We have frequently had occasion to criticise the Colonial Sugar Refining Company from various points of view, but we do not hesitate to express our admiration of the economic efficiency which characterizes every branch of its business which has come undei our notice. (4) In order to prove really effective for the purposes we have now in view, the Commonwealth Refinery would have to proceed on a large scale. This would imply a duplication of refining plants in Australia quite inconsistent with a sound economy of national resources. For the foregoing considerations, as well as for others, we are of opinion that the proposal to establish a Commonwealth Refinery is impracticable. The Attorney-General has referred '.') the enormous capital of the company. He said that its shares have been repeatedly watered, and that enormous profits have been put aside.",69,Investigation

These records show that the company has a paid-up capital of ^3,000,000, which, on the 29th April, igio, was divided among 1,740 shareholders. No watering of stock has taken place. The great part of the capital has been contributed by the shareholders, and the balance transferred to capital account from reserves accumulated during the 70 years of the company's existence. I find that the profits on refining made by the company have not exceeded 6 per cent., and honourable members will agree that that is not a large profit from an industry in which so much capital is sunk. Referring to question 16844, statement "" A , "" Mr coloured Iaboui. Crawford in his report saysAfter allowing for depreciation, the net profit nial Sugar Refining Company have not inon refining was said to be 12s. 6d. per ton. Which would be about 6 per cent The result of the Millaquin Company's refining operations for 9^ years was explained by the secretary as follows :From January to June we refine raw sugar, and this is known as our refining season; from July to December we refine raw and juice mixed, and this is called the juice season. The profit above shown, ^'18,883, was made in the refining seasons. During the refinin"" periods, 80,539 tons of raws were melted, so that the profit on the raw sugar refined amounts to 4s. Sd. per ton. The Millaquin Company is a smaller company working with perhaps less up-to-date machinery and methods than those in use by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Theii product is selling at a better price than that of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and their profit amounts to only 4s. 8d. per ton. It is clear, therefore, that unless we are prepared to put down an enormous plant, and place it in charge of better brains than the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are able to command, it will be absolutely impossible for us to put sugar on the market at a lower rate than the Colonial' Sugar Refining Company have been doing. It should be borne in mind that the Millaquin Company sell the whole of their sugar to general distributors, whilst the Colonial Sugar Refining Company sell only three-fourths of their output to general distributors, ancl the other one-fourth to the jam and other manufacturers at a reduction of jQx per ton on the price charged to general distributors. more than £1 per ton.

The reasons for the "" c u t "" price of sugar supplied to manufacturers were explained in the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's general statement as followsThe primary point we have to keep in mind is that all the raw sugar produced in Australia under a protective Tariff must, after refining, be consumed in Australia, otherwise the surplus would have to be exported at a heavy loss in competition wilh sugar produced elsewhere wilh From this evidence it is clear that the Coloflicted a very serious burden upon the people of Australia. The Attorney-General instituted a comparison between the price of sugar in New Zealand and in the Commonwealth, and pointed out that there is a difference between the two prices of something like J£-J per ton. That old argument has been trotted out by Free Traders as long as I can remember, and it did not at all surprise me to hear the Attorney-General complain that we have to pay an extra price for sugar because of the protection we have afforded the manufacturers of the article by our Tariff.

That is one of the reasons why the people of New Zealand get cheaper sugar than we get in the Commonwealth. The principle reason, of course, is one whicb I hope will never be removed, and that is, we have a Protective duty of £ 6 per ton on outside sugar and sugar manufactured under the conditions described by the honourable member for Grey when he said last year The work of the missionary has been attended in those islands with better results than in many other cases, but within recent years the supar industry has been started there, with results which I propose to describe. Fijian native works for comparatively small wn^es, he would not work for as small .1 wnge as the sugar planter offers. These planters were strong enough to induce the British Government to allow them to import a certain class of people under indenture for the purpose of developing the industry in F i j i . The result has been most demoraliziiu; to the people of the islands. There have been brousrht in about 40,000 Hindoos of thc worse tvpe that it would be possible to find. They are the gatherm' un of the scum of all parts of India. Manyc them, on their own admission, were criminals before they came to F i j i . They are brought in for a term of five vears by the companv, and during that period the average wage received by the men is 11.5/d., or just under is. per daySugar manufactured under such conditions is the sort of stuff which is sent across to New Zealandwhile the average wane for the women, who also work in thc fields, is 5.93d., or just under 6d. per day. If they do not complete the task that is set them they are brought before n Court and heavily fined or imprisoned. In the year 1907 there were 1.460 cases of imprisonments and other penalties for non-completion of tasks. That is how the sugar-workers are treated in Fiji by the sugar-planters; and if the Attorney-General wishes to introduce into Australia sugar manufactured under such conditions, and then calls himself a white Australian, or even a human being, I pity him and the country that is governed by people who would do such a thing. The honourable member for Grey, in addition to his own description, quoted from a book written by ] . W. Burton, as follows:Buck on the plantations the coolies are herded together like so many penned cattle, amid the most insanitary conditions and indescribable and disgusting filth. A man must hold his nose with a firm grip as he passes through some of these lines; but. to live in them wonder that sickness and disease hold carnival, and such places are a disgrace to civilization and a stain upon commerce. .

In Australia the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has to carry on its operations under Australian conditions, and the Australian Governments have taken care to see that those conditions are suitable to Australian people. able member is now getting beyond the ordinary scope of the question before the Chair, but it is most difficult for me to follow him while honourable members are interjecting across the chamber. them to desist. was wandering a little from Australia, but it was absolutely necessary to do so in order to reply to the remarks of the Attorney-General. Australian conditions which are observed by this tremendous combine, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. of the Independent Workers' Association has written to his union as follows:I may state that in the local sugar mills the lowest wage paid is 30s. per week and found. This is the minimum for eight hours per day, and the board given at the mills will compare favourably with any hotel or boardinghouse. disbelieve it. I know, that the Queensland Parliament has passed a Sugar Workers' and Sheep Shearers' Accommodation Act, which provides for pretty decent accommodation for sugar-workers, who see that they get pretty good rations. The letter continuesThe cane-cutters in the field mostly work by contract, and are earning from ,£3 to ^5 per week. Capital has also been made out of the fact that these combinations supplied money ' for the purpose of fighting the proposals of the Governrnent at the last referendum. That has not been proved by those who make the allegation, but, if it were true, it would only show that these people are prepared to back their opinions with their cash, and I venture .to assert that the amount contributed was small compared with that contributed to support the campaign of the Labour party. I intend to oppose the proposals of the Government with all my might, as I did on the last occasion. I did it then at my own expense, and I shall do it again at my own expense this time probably. -I think we might have an adjournment now. since half-past 10 this morning, so that an adjournment is reasonable. We should not be asked to rush important measures through without proper discussion. As to the proposal that this Parliament needs more power to deal with trusts and combinations, I ask : What are the trusts and combinations with which we need to deal, I ask and why has this Labour Government not ' exercised the powers it possesses to deal with them if they exist ? Honourable members opposite cannot give a satisfactory answer to those questions. Ever since 1910 Ministers have had power to deal with trusts and combines, but they have not Let me come back to the exercised it. Now they ask for power to deal, not only with trusts and monopolies detrimental to the public and in restraint An organizer of trade, but with all trusts, combinations, and monopolies as they may choose. It has been shown that it is practically impossible to define the word "" monopoly,"" and the word "" combination '' is almost equally indefinable, because it covers such a wide range. Mention has been made of the Coal Trust or Coal Vend, or Coal Combination, bufc when the Government endeavoured to prosecute it, it failed to prove that its efforts were in restraint of trade. were. they were inimical to the interests of the community, and prominent members of the Labour party, such as the New South Wales Minister for Mines, have stated that the Coal Vend was formed to benefit the workers by enabling the colliery proprietors to pay higher rates for the hewing of coal. Reference has been made, also, to the Sugar Trust and to the Beef Trust. The existence of the latter in Australia is a mere myth. Honourable members cheer ironically, but I do not like this levity when I am discussing an important constitutional proposal. They remind me of a box of galahs. able members to cease from interjecting. matter seriously, without interruption from a lot of jabbering nincompoops. honourable members to discontinue their interruptions.

438,' Mr Speaker,"I again appeal toregard for the dignity of the House. The honourable member for North Sydney must withdraw the words that he has just uttered, and confine himself, to the question. said about honourable members opposite. As I was pointing out, the existence of the Beef Trust in Australia has been spoken of because the imagination of honourable members opposite has become inflamed. Speaking with authority, I say that there is no Beef Trust in Australia. It has been said that a branch of the American Beef Trust is commencing operations in Queensland. I certainly would object to the trust getting a footing in Australia, but, although the company which has just started in Queensland may have American interests, it has not been proved that it is in any way connected with the Beef Trust, and it seems to me that it would be impossible for any such trust to flourish here, because it could -not get the command of the railways, which would be essent.al to its success. It could not get control of the railways, because they are the property of the States-. sion to my own views on other occasions upon the question of State owned railways. I think it right that the railways should belong to the States, and since they are owned by the States, it is impossible for trusts to gain here the footing they have obtained in America. It is impossible foT them to prosecute their nefarious practices as they do in the United States of America. We have heard a lot about the Tobacco Trust, and I have asked for and obtained information in regard to it. I defy any one to say that it is acting in restraint of trade, or is inimibers cal to the interests of the public. On another occasion I brought before the House information showing that the Tobacco Trust, instead of being inimical to the interests of the people, was really supplying to the people of Australia an article that was equal, if not superior, to anything of the kind produced at the same price in any other part of the world. If we need an example of what the nationalization of the tobacco industry would mean, we have only to go to France. I have not been there, but many who have been have told me that absolutely the worse tobacco in the world is supplied by the nationalized tobacco industry of that country. I come now to the question of the great Sugar Combine. . The Government appointed a Royal Commission, to inquire .into its ramifications and operations,, but the report of that Commission shows that it. is not. as we were led to believe, one of the great commercial octopi that spread their tentacles, over the land and seek to drain the very life's blood of the people. There is no doubt that a combine exists in connection with the refining of sugar. The Colonial. Sugar Refining Company is undoubtedly a, combination, but unless it can be shown to be acting in restraint of trade, or to be otherwise inimical to the interests of the people, this Parliament is not entitled to ask for power to deal with it. Why' do the; Government wish to deal with it ? They wish to take these matters into their own hands. The Attorney-General has said that they want power. ""Give us power,"" he says, and it is power that they want. It is not well, however, that too much power should be placed in the hands' of any one man. If we give this Parliament power to deal with trusts, monopolies, and combines, it will mean in a great measure placing very wide powers in the hands of one man. No matter what Government is in office, no I have given expresmatter who the Attorney-General of the day may be, such a thing would mean opening, the door to influences to which I need not refer. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is deserving of the very greatest credit for the part it has taken in assisting us to people tropical Australia. But for that company there would not be in that part of Queensland where its operations are carried on one-fourth of the population that exists there to-day. For the sake of our own safety we should give every encouragement to such companies-combina tions and trusts, if honourable memlike to call them so-as the Colonial Sugar Refining Com^ pany, which is doing so much to develop tropical. Australia, and to place people on the soil. We must have population if we are to have an efficient military force, and a company that is doing much to promote settlement and to attract population to the' tropical north, should not be stigmatized as a monster or a commercial octopus that.would crush the life's blood out of the people. I wish', now to quote from the report of the .Royal Commission on the sugar industry. No one can suggest that the members of that Commission favour the political views of the Opposition.
