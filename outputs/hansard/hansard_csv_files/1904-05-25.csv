If he is satisfied that they are under contract, they are to be treated as prohibited immigrants. If he is not so satisfied, but has reasonable grounds to suspect that false statements have been made to him in this regard, he should permit immigrant to land, and instruct him not to leave t i e mantle until advised that he may do so, and while there to report himself every second d\y ot Customs Office. In meantime all possible inquiries should be made by officer to ascertain whether his suspicion is well-founded.

The matter is receiving the attention uf the Government, but up to the present it has not been possible to arrive at any decision. 2. The effect of the correspondence is to show that the transfer of the existing Meteorological Departments to the Commonwealth would .lot be easy, as in many States their work is closely allied with that of the Astronomical Departments.

Debate resumed from 24th May (vide That the letter from the Secretary of State for the Colonies regarding the use of the title "" honourable "" by the members of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia be printed. If it is desired to ascertain the present this debate, I do not propose, if I can help it, to be side-tracked into any side issues, as were some honourable members last night. One honourable member, if I remember rightly, proceeded to indict our side beter of External Affairs, by accepting office, was not true to lus hustings pledges on the fiscal question. That seems to be an extension of the argument which, at first, was used by the Minister as against the party to which I have the honour to belong. The charge he then made has been hurled back at the Minister, and now it is hurled back again against us, for having dared to advance it against the Minister. That sort of tu quo que argument could go on for ever; and I , therefore, do not propose to address myself to it. But I do propose to examine the question whether the party at present in power is deserving of the confidence of the House, because that is the true issue. The party on the Treasury benches have long regarded themselves as "" the white-headed boy "" of politics, and the party that opposes them look on them as the bad boy of politics, who ought not on any account to be allowed to' grow "" whiteheaded "" in office. With your permission, sir, I shall examine both these contentions. In the first place, the party in power tell us that they do not want office, and yet we find them seeking office on the pretext of an amendment on which they now say they set no store. entry into public life for a "" white-headed boy.""

22,Mr Kelly,"It is terrible; it is a badon substituted "" included "" for "" excluded,"" so that now the Bill provides that all vants are included within its operation. The Labour Party having won their places on the Treasury benches, now propose to speciously differentiate between the clerical and other employees in the public service. I say "" speciously"" because the Prime Minister, in his address on Wednesday last, was careful to say that a blank had been created in the Bill by the passing of the amendment moved by the Minister of Trade and Customs. a reason, but simply made a statement of fact. that it was simply a statement of fact, but I do not think that is so. No one knows' better than the Prime Minister that no blank has been created, but that the Bill is more ample now than it was before. ber say that the leaving out of two or three words makes the Bill more ample ? The honourable member is barking up the wrong tree. Mr 'KELLY -The word "" included "" has not yet been substituted, but it was proposed to substitute it at some other time. We find this party, who are so jealous of their individual liberty outside questions of their party programme, voting as solidly on behalf of this amendment as they are now solid against carrying it out. So much for their freedom from the caucus. Prime Minister knows the state in which the Minister of Trade and Customs left this Bill, and he now proposes something quite different. What was the use of the Labour Party, before the fall of the late Government, going to that Government and saying, "" Do not regard this as a vital issue; it is really of no moment ?"" They knew that the late Prime Minister was a gentleman who always placed his convictions far higher than continuance in office. Minister the same thing six or seven months before. that the late Prime Minister was such a politician as I have described. Now they take a different view of the question, and arc honourable member refer? willing to sink the principle on which they ousted the late Government. member try us ! State and Commonwealth serlieve in this principle, why do they now forsake it? They did not believe in it, why did they press it? There can be only one of two answers to this proposition. Either they sank their convictions to oust the Government in order to secure office, or they are sinking their convictions in order to stay there. Then the Labour Party say that they do not want office, although we find them going in for a system of lobby intriguing in order to stay where they are. We find them going about buttonholing : ""m on this side whom they imagine to be disaffected, and showing these men official labour league letters, promising, on behalf of their confreres outside member been buttonholed? are very careful about whom they buttonhole, and I may now ask why I have not been approached. But the Labour Party buttonholed the men to whom I have referred, and showed them labour league letters, promising that they would not be opposed at the next election if they agreed to help the Government in the present crisis. The Labour Party say that they stand for the whole people. How can they bind the whole people three years ahead ? The Labour Party say that they do not want office; but if so, why should they prostitute all the principles of clean Government in a shameless effort to stay there? I think I have said enough to show my But 'he conviction that there is no evidence to support the Labour Party's contention that they are ""the white-headed boy"" of politics. I should how like to examine the other contention. The Federal Labour Party is a growth out of the Labour Parties existent all over Australia before Federation, and still existent. This party is governed and is subject to the will of the same conclaves which held those separate parties in the hollow of their hand. Now, what the ultimate policy of the Labour Party is can only be disclosed by the future, because none of us can gauge it at present. We only know that they are apt to be swayed by the programmes laid down by the various sections of the Labour Party throughout Australia.' of men who govern the various labour parties",15,Ministerial Statement Paper

These organizations will eventually mould the sentiments which will guide the Ministry, when it is strong enough to carry on, without considering the views of a far larger Opposition. In view of these circumstances, I do not think that it is sufficient to approacli the consideration of the policy of the Government by simply looking at the programme which has been placed before us. In order to arrive at a just conclusion as to the intentions of the Government, it is necessary to examine the policies of the different labour organizations, of whom the members of the Government and their supporters are merely the delegates. That, however, would be a task so enormous that I do not propose to enter upon it this afternoon. Several honourable members of the Labour Party have told us how that party is constituted. For instance, the honourable member for Hindmarsh yesterday took credit for. his party, Inasmuch that within its ranks were to be found squatters, doctors, and lawyers. All honour to the party which contains within its ranks representatives of these classes of the community. Honourable members on this side, however, take no credit to themselves because of the social standing of those who are to be found amongst them. We gauge a man according to his capacity or ability, and do not care whether he is a squatter, or doctor, or anything else. appeared to put forward his statement ° badge of distinction upon his party. honourable member's party of a falsehood, he turns 'round upon us. We have been charged with being exclusive, and"" when we show that we are not, the honourable member at once says that we are seeking to confer a distinction upon our party. some extent, the nature of the constitution of the Labour Party, I desire to quote the statement made by Senator Dawson in the course of an interview which he recently granted to a representative of the Sunday Times. Senator Dawson statedAny man who subscribes to our platform is a f u l l member of the party, and any one who does not is an outsider, and there never was a period in the labour movement when it was otherwise. When we consider how many hundreds of thousands of men there are outside the ranks of the Labour Party, that statement should in itself be sufficient to indicate the exclusiveness of the organization. I do not propose to press the matter further than to quote these remarks of the honourable senator. I propose to examine the programme of the Government, of which the first item is the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill , with a view to showing that it is brought forward in its present form in the interests not of all classes of the community, but of a section. We should not forget that the Labour Party is largely made up of officials of the militant labour unions, which the Conciliation and Arbitration Bil l is intended to assist. We must not lose sight of this fact, which I desire to press home. The moment the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill comes into operation, a union, if it has certain rules, may come along and register itself in the Commonwealth Court, and amongst the first to take advantage of the provisions of the B ill will be those militant unions which honourable members opposite have such a large share in administering. members on the Opposition side of the House accept the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill? Bill, but of the personal element introduced into it by the Labour Party. I am differentiating between the militant unions and the genuine trades' unions. If we are to have a Conciliation and Arbitration B ill , The honourable member we must have a workable measure, and we want the first union to come along and yesterday as if he intended it to confer a register. But we do not want the militant unions to take this course, and afterwards, by making use of other provisions of the B ill, to insure that they shall be the only unions registered, and that all men must subscribe to them-to their political and fighting funds. The Labour Party have left the Bill in such a condition that a union can come along and register, and As indicating also, to afterwards, by taking advantage of the clause relating to the preference to be given to unionists, compel all men-practicall y at the peril of their livelihood to join the unions, to subscribe to their funds for the support of our friends on the other side of the House! Such unions would then be in a position to compel men, who have not joined militant unions in the past, because they have preferred to retain their individual political liberty, to join them, and thus enhance the power of the leaders of the unions-ou r honourable friends opposite.

44,Mr Kelly,"Thre e sites have beenHe stated that he has had an interview with Mr Anderson, the manager of the Orient Company, who told him-as he had already 1 informed the honourable and learned member for Ballarat-that the increased subsidy demanded by the mail companies is not due to the provision for the employment of white labour upon the ships, which has been inserted in the contract. Doubtless that is so, because, as we all know, the Norddeutscber-Lloyd, which employs white labour only' throughout its ships, has a much smaller wage-sheet than have the other companies. The real question is not one of expense, but of the vessels being able to run punctually to time. admitted, in reply to an interjection, that Mr Anderson had declared that if the companies observed the other conditions which it is attempted to impose they would insist upon the insertion in the contract of some provision which would enable them to escape penalties for delay. The Prime Minister has said that he regards that as a minor matter. I disagree with him. should be a first essential. This matter affords another illustration of the fact that "" the white-headed boy"" can be specious -when it suits him. I now propose to say a few words concerning the Government policy with regard to torpedo-boat destroyers. defence, the Prime Minister affirmed that these destroyers would, if desired, act as the eyes of the British Fleet stationed in Australian waters. I do not propose to accept that statement without reserve. If these vessels are intended to act as eyes for the fleet, surely both should be placed under the same control. Of what use are a man's eyes to him when he is attacked, if his arms are tied, or vice versa. We must have a central control in these matters. Dual control has never proved efficient in any naval or military enterprise. Having regard to that fact, I have come to the conclusion that the Prime Minister's proposal springs simply from a desire to euphemistically introduce the Australian Navy project a project as futile as it would be inefficient. Honourable members are aware that Australia will not be subject to invasion until Great Britain has lost command of tlie seas. When such a contingency arises-and I hope it never will-an enemy could send to our coast four or eight torpedo boat destroyers for every one that we possessed. Our vessels would represent only so much scrap iron, Mr Kelly. because they would be caught and smashed in detail. I think that the Prime Minister has been unduly impressed by the great speed which these vessels possess. But is he not aware that they attain that speed only in calm water, only under conditions, in fact, which seldom obtain around the coast of Australia. I understand that the tendency now-a-days is to construct a larger and slower type of this vessel than was formerly in vogue, in order to overcome the difficulty to which I have directed attention. I desire to impress upon the House my conviction that an Australian Navy would be' of no service whatever to the people for deThe Prime Minister fence purposes. A navy which would be adequate to defend our coast must be in a position to seek out and blockade the coast of the enemy. That is admitted amongst naval experts to be a cardinal principle in naval warfare. No better example of the soundness of that principle can be cited than that which has been afforded by recent events in the Far East, where the Japanese sought out and blockaded the Russians at In my judgment, punctuality their own base, denying to them any opportunity to contest the control of the seas. If we wish to defend our shores we must blockade the coast of our enemy. For Australia to essay a task of that character would involve the equipment and maintenance of an enormous navy, which would In his dissertation upon naval be capable of going, perhaps, to the other end of the world. Such an undertaking it would be manifestly absurd for usto attempt. Consequently the only means open to us of protecting Australia from invasion oversea is to contribute-and to contribute largely-to the Imperial Navy. When I say that is the only means we have of protecting ourselves, of course I except the fact that it is necessary to-. maintain a strong citizen force to repel invaders after they have once gained a footing. I repeat that the only way in which our coast can be adequately protected isby Australia making a large contributionto the Imperial Navy. member believe in having a good harbour defence ? a good harbour defence is a protection against sudden raid, and from any organized blockade. I should like to ask the Prime Ministeri f he grudges the contribution that we have already made to the Imperial Navy under the terms of the Naval Agreement. If-he does he should'",18,Honourable Member Do The The Government Have Gone Very Far Afield

46,Mr Kelly,"I certainly do, becauseboldly say so, and not fool the electors of Australia into the belief that his scheme under which we should have a torpedo destroyer or two dotted round the coast of Australia, would render us any the less insecure from foreign invasion. I do not wish to detain the House at any length, but I should like to briefly traverse the Government proposals in regard to the tobacco monopoly and bank confiscation. In the first place the Prime Minister has adduced no evidence to show that the present tobacco monopoly is abusing its powers. Pie does not tell us that the trust has raised the price of tobacco. As the result of the imposition of the Commonwealth duty there may have been, of course, a natural increase in some places; but he does not contend that the price of tobacco has been raised by the trust, or that the quality has been reduced. He simply says that the tobacco trust is a paying concern, and that the Government might as well secure the profits obtainable from carrying on such an undertaking. I would also remind honourable members that the Prime Minister does not say that the Government propose to lower the price of tobacco, and make it possible for the people to obtain their smoke at half the present cost. He merely proposes that the Government shall secure the profits to be obtained from such an undertaking. His intention is that the Government should confiscate the operations of a trust, which has not been proved guilty of any wrong doing, and establish in its place a monopoly which would be subject to all the temptations to which a Government concern is always open when it is necessary to raise as much money as possible to meet the exigencies of the Government. Any one who has lived in France for any length of time will realize that the Government tobacco of the bank reserves. monopoly there has not been to the advantage of the people. The quality of French tobacco is simply execrable; it is unsmokeable. Do not honourable members see the danger which might accrue from having a Treasurer in power who was badly in need of money, but dared not ask Parliament for it, and who would in this extremity press the managers of the Government tobacco monopoly to obtain as much profit as possible from the people. Cannot the Prime Minister see that an insidious means of taxation would thus be adopted under which the people would be unable to learn the true extent of the taxation imposed upon them. than a land tax?. tent of their liability under a land tax, but that would not be the case in connection with a Government tobacco monopoly. They would only learn to what extent they are being taxed by marking the depreciation in the quality of the tobacco. assuming that the Government would control the management. ably controls the management of State undertakings. If they did not do so, what difference would there be between a Government and a private monopoly? It appears to me that this is a scheme on the part of "" the white-headed boy '' to raise money for the purposes of government-mone y which the people, if they knew the true position, would not allow to be raised in that way. The Government assert that they are opposed to the floating of loans for the Commonwealth-that they favour the keeping of our expenditure within the limits of our ordinary revenue, and that they are opposed for the present to new taxation. But they believe in this form of taxation, under which the people would find it impossible to determine the extent of the impost levied upon them. I should like to refer briefly to the Government banking proposals. The contemplated bank confiscation has a very curious aspect. The Prime Minister owes his success very largely to the declaration which he has made again and again that he is opposed to borrowing. That has been one of his strongest cries. He cannot, therefore, borrow; but under his banking proposals the Government would be able to confiscate perhaps ,£5,000,000 Mr O'MALLEY -£8,000,000 . as low as possible. I think that the proposal is to take 40 per cent., and then two-thirds of 40 per cent., which, roughly speaking, would be four-fifteenths. Mr O'MALLEY We should have the handling of £8,000,000. ment propose to spend £5,000,000, but they would have the handling of £8,000,000. That is the crux of the question.

I had no hesitation in assisting the Labour Party to oust the late Government. But I am perfectly free to admit that the Labour Party had no desire at that time to turn the Government out. The Labour Party, unfortunately for themselves, fell into a trap.

74,Mr Spence,"The honourable member ismeinber opposite must be supporting a myth. The fact remains that the Government have declared their intention to bring in socialistic measures, -which, as they have given us to understand, comprise the nationalization of various branches of industry, and, ultimately, I suppose, the nationalization of all branches of industry and of capital, property, and everything else. If we are to pay any regard to the resolutions passed at the May Day demonstrations, which have been endorsed by the present Prime Minister as the basis of the proposals of the Labour Party, we must assume that all capitalists are enemies of the country, and are not to be countenanced under any circumstances. Personally, I do not take any exception to capitalists. fact, I would rather see them encouraged to engage in all sorts of enterprises, and to expend their capital in developing the natural resources of the country under perfectly free conditions. I should not be in favour of granting special privileges to any particular individuals, but would make all start from the same level. At the same time, there' should be no interference with the investment of capital in legitimate enterprises. Where our friends, who term themselves Socialists, are wrong, in my view, is in attributing the existing social conditions, which admittedly are not by any means what it is desirable they should be, to the evil influences exerted by capitalists. think that in that regard they have made an initial mistake, upon which they have proceeded to build up their policy. kind ? utterances of honourable members opposite.

Yet, I was attacked by the Minister of External Affairs and. by the honourable member for Gwydir in a most unfair manner, because it.was alleged that I had sunk my principles.

AlthoughI cannot get all I want from those honourable members with whom I am at present associated, it is morally certain, that I should have no possible chance of getting anything from those who are on the Government benches. That is one of the reasons I am in opposition at the present time. I find myself in association temporarily with those who are opposed to me on the fiscal question, but I did not seek the alliance. Those who hold views opposite to mine came over to my side of the House, and, therefore, if honourable members opposite have any quarrel, it must be with my fiscal opponents, and not wi-h-me. I still occupy the seat which I have filled since I I have been in this Parliament. of seats. ing out that I am still in opposition. I have not changed my views.

93,Mr Johnson,"The only pledgesof the coalition proposed, extended only to the life of the present Parliament. fiscal issue was to be suspended merely for that period. We are not responsible for the present position of affairs. Our efforts to re-open the Tariff have been rendered impotent by the votes of the electors of the Commonwealth. They have made it impossible for us to successfully attack that question during the currency of this Parliament. We are thus compelled-whethe r we like it or not-to allow that matter to rest, except so far as it may be raised by individual members upon any particular motion in which the Tariff may be involved.. When such occasions arise, the private members of the party to which I belong are at perfect liberty to vote as they please. Although the Minister of External Affairs careful lv quoted one of my letters, he studiously abstained from reading subsequent communications, which made my position absolutely clear. It is quite possible that he may not have seen these, but, in order that he may be unable to urge that excuse in the future, I propose to read one or two extract? from them. A couple of days after the publication of my previous letter, in replying to the editorial footnote which was quoted by the Minister, I said, amongst other thingsI admit that a combination of circumstances has led to a situation in the arena of Federal politics wholly unexpected, and undreamt of during the recent election campaign. I admit that a tripartite parliamentary system is not conducive to sound principles of government, -because it enables even a small independent .minority to control by coercion the policy of an itnstable Ministry. I admit that the maintenance of abolition of the intolerable tripartite system, nnd that this can only be accomplished by a coalition of some kind between two of the three existing parties against the third. WhilstI recognised that, I certainly did not view the prospects of such a coalition with unqualified delight. The expression of delight at the promise of a coalition,the basis of which was then unknown, applied chiefly to the report of an interview upon the subject with Sir William McMillan, who, in reply to an inquiry by a press interviewer, said, "" All that can be said is that we are all. delighted."" I saw no reason for joy, but rather for profound regret, that the adverse vote of the Commonwealth had rendered some alliance necessary. That has been the position which I .have consistently adopted, and it was the position which I occupied when I spoke on the AdThe dress-in-Reply. But my attitude in this connection is made still clearer by a further letter from me, in reply to another by Mr Hammond. It was published in the Sydney Morning Herald, and reads thus: It is true that a minority must not be permitted to occupy the Treasury benches, irrespective of party. It is an outrage upon the Constitution, upon representative government, upon the democratic principle of majority rule, and any honourable means of putting an end' to minority rule by a temporary alliance, not involving as a basic. condition the surrender of vital principles, will be hailed by the majority of people, I venture to believe, with satisfaction. But there is danger that hysterical clamour may encourage an alliance which will ultimately lead to disaster, or .it any rate to a perpetuation of"" evils which it will take a generation to remedy. Unfortunately, the grand free-trade victory of this State was rendered abortive by the preponderance of labourites and protectionists returned in the other Statesa fact which renders it impossible for the party to successfully attack the Tariff in the present Parliament. I think that letter renders my position absolutely clear. I do not see how, by any possible distortion of facts, the attitude which I have taken up can be said to involve any sacrifice of principle. During the course of his speech yesterday, the Minister of External Affairs remarked, "" Times change, and we change with them."" The truth of that observation is exemplified by the change which has taken place in the Ministerial policy as compared with that which the Labour Party vigorously advocated when they had not responsibility linked with control, but exercised control without responsibility. We find that with the exception of a mutilated Conciliation and Arbitration Bill all representative government demands the those great measures which they deemed so imperatively necessary when they were occupying the cross benches are now relegated to the background. Instead of proposing to pass legislation which they were so eager to force the late Government to enact, they have put forward a perfectly harmless, inoffensive programme, which one is forced to conclude must have been obtained as the result of some one eavesdropping at the door of the leader of the Opposition's room. Mr O'MALLEY -Al l our proposals have been on our platform for the last ten vears. must have been well concealed.

Mr O'MALLEY -We do not object to honourable members opposite supporting such a programme. support it with greater effect when coming from a Ministry of their own. The Government programme for this session is such a milk and water one, as compared with the strong measures which they held to be imperatively necessary when they occupied the cross benches, that no one could take exception to it. Tf the programme which the Labour Party put forward before they went into office was considered to be necessary at that time, should it not be equally imperative now ? If it were necessary to place certain proposals in the very forefront of their programme then, should it not be even more urgently necessary to do so now that the party are in office? A contemplation of these facts shows how true are the words of the Minister of External Affairs that "" Times change, and we change with them."" The honourable and learned gentleman intended that the remark should apply, not to the present Government, but to honourable members of the Opposition, and I think I have shown, with sufficient clearness, that its truth is more fully exemplified by the attitude of the present Ministry than by the position taken up. by the Opposition. Another exemplification of its truth is also to be found. "" Times change, and we change with them,"" should be the motto at the head of every labour manifesto, because the Labour Party's programmes have, from first to last, shown how great has been the change which their opinions have undergone. The party have changed from a desire, in the first instance, for freedom to a wish to give effect to principles which are the worse form of toryism. By a gradual process of evolution they have lost the grand ideals which they originally professed, and have come down to the level of men of semi-barbarous times. They now seek to bring into operation legislation very similar to that against which their forefathers fought for generations. I do not say that they have designedly made this choice. been due to ignorance of true economic laws. They have ""lost sight of the grand ideals of freedom that lie at the root of a nation's prosperity and progress. And what is true of the nation is true of the individual. A nation is after all only a collection of individuals. "" Freedom"" should be the watchword of every community claiming to have any true regard for democratic principles, for restriction makes for all that is bad in what we know as toryism. In this connection I shall quote another remark made by the Minister of External Affairs when dealing with the fact that even so great a Tory as the late Sir John McIntyre had actually advocated something in the direction of Socialism. That Sir John McIntyre should have done anything of the kind appeared to the honourable and learned gentleman to be little short of marvellous; but there is nothing marvellous about it. Protection and toryism have always been inseparable, and Socialism, which is the twin sister of protection, falls naturally into line as a measure of toryism. All socialistic principles, so far as they have been elucidated, within my knowledge, tend towards what is known in the old country as Toryism. Germany belong to the Free-trade Party. cause their principles are more in a line with what is known as the Single Tax, than Socialism as understood here; but there are Tories in the Free-trade Party as well as in other bodies. said that protection and Socialism were synonymous. that both are based upon the restriction of individual rights. Restriction is the underlying basis of both principles, and in that respect they certainly have an affinity. Democracy, on the other hand, makes not for restriction, but for increased freedom. ber burn the statute-book? . liament could be devoted to the work of destroying many of the laws which have been passed a distinct gain would accrue to the community. an Anarchist. .training and my natural desire is that no Their action has injury should be Bone to any individual.",26,Honourable Member Do The The Government Have Gone Very Far Afield

I referred a few minutes ago to the remark made by the Minister of External Affairs, that "" Times change, and we change with them."" I demonstrated the fact that it applies with peculiar force to the members of the present Government. I wish now to show that these words apply with even greater force to the whole labour movement, from its. inception to the present time. I have to thank the honourable member opposite for reminding me of this. I was on two occasions made the subject of a violent attack by the honourable member for Gwydir on this point, and on my previous connection with the Labour Party. Of all men with whom I am personally acquainted, he is the last who should speak of the sacrifice of principle, or. throw stones at another. I would remind him of the advice which he gave me when speaking during the debate on the Address-in-Reply on Mr Chamberlain's preferential trade proposals, that "" those who live in glass houses should not throw stones."" -He did not recognise that the house in whicb I am living is a stone house, whi's he lives in the glass house.

But as a number of free-traders thought that protection was coming, they hastened to change their coats acto induce them to observe the cordingly, and among the first to do this was I do not think, however, that the honourable member for Gwydir. I lost sight of him for some years, and I then found him to be a member pf the Labour Party, and a strong Socialist, though previously he had been inclined to single-tax principles, which, are the antithesis of Socialism. Then he ran as a protectionist labour candidate for the electorate of Canterbury, in opposition to Messrs. Bavister and Daniehy, the selected candidates of the party. He is scarcely the man who should speak about fidelity to principle, and prate of consisnot the honourable tency. The only thing in which he has been consistent is his inconsistency. MrO ' MALLEY But he is regenerated now. more correctly describe his position. He has done nothing but degenerate, politically, ever since I first met him, and that statement is abundantly proved by the fact that he now sits behind this Ministry. After the Canterbury election I lost sight of him again, and then he turned up in the electorate in which I live, and is at present a constituent of mine. He was elected an alderman of the municipality of Marrickville, which is in the Lang electorate, and the electors there had ample opportunities to become acquainted with him and with his opinions. As an alderman he rendered good service to the municipality, and one would think that, having served with distinction in that honourable post, the electors of the State electorate of Marrickville would have been ready to choose him as their representative in the State Parliament.

Following upon that, I find that, although the party had not succeeded in securing the adoption of even the first plank of their platform, they gradually dropped the subject, until, in 1898, they sought for only a progressive land tax. In later platforms, all reference to the subject was deleted. At the time. I have spoken of, the labour programme was an absolutely free-trade platform.

Moreover, the honourable member for Lang does not pretend to be addressing himself to the subject under discussion, but has avowed that his object is to clear himself from certain imputations.

It seemed to me necessary to. read certain quotations in order to make clear my position and that of the Ministry, and to show that changes which have occurred in the policy of the Labour Party make it impossible for me to follow the Government.

Therefore, believing that constitutional government can be maintained only by a Ministry which has a clear majority of supporters behind it, we are endeavouring to clear the atmosphere, and to establish a plain line of demarcation between Government supporters and those who are in opposition. Even at the present time, the Ministry know perfectly well that there is arrayed against them a combination, perhaps not absolutely agreed, but a combination of Oppositionists thrown into association with each other because of their disbelief in the principles embodied in the general labour platform. It is for those who do not believe in minority rule, to endeavour to bring about a condition of affairs under which we can establish a Government, whether it be a Labour, a Protectionist, or a Free-trade Ministry, that will be able to control its own business and command a fair majority. It is with this end in view that I have taken my present stand with regard to the proposed coalition. I do not desire a coalition, but circumstances have forced us into some kind of united action for the purpose of relieving the country from the chaotic state of affairs into which refrained from retaliating it is now being driven.

I credit Todd with consistency, and I am speaking now of general principles, not of special cases-genera l principles in the nature of deductions from the whole of the precedents upon which he relies. He contends that the Ministry are constitutionally responsibleNot merely for the preparation and conduct of legislative measures through both Houses of Parliament, and for the control of legislation undertaken by private members, but also for the oversight and direction of the entire mass of public business which is submitted to Parliament. Nothing should be left to the will and caprice of si fluctuating majority in the Legislature. Let me ask what would be the effect of the control of this Ministryi f honourable members opposed to them chose to bring in private measures which Ministers considered inimical to the interests of the country. possible. why it should be impossible for any member opposed to the Ministry-and the Ministerial supporters number only one-third of the whole House-to bring in a measure which the Labour Party would consider inimical to the interests of the country.

"" that is another story."" I hope that the honourable member will allow his mind to take more relevant courses. He is asking me, when I am in the middle of my speech, about something which will be dealt with at a much later stage. Todd says, furtherIn order to enable Ministers to carry on the Government in harmony and agreement with Parliament, without their being subjected to the degradation of becoming the mere tools of a democratic Assembly, it is necessary that they should be sustained by an adequate majority in both Houses, and especially in the House of Commons. If it is a degradation to be at the mere mercy of a democratic Assembly,, is not the present Ministry in that position ? members of the Labour Party seem to think that the only matters to which they have to give attention are the few Bills' which they propose to introduce this session. They lose sight of the fact that we have a very active body of members here, who may embody in private legislation ideas of which the Ministry do not approve. . I should like to know how the Ministry can, with dignity, or even with common self-respect, maintain their position as the governing committee of this House, if measures of which they disapprove are brought in by members sitting in opposition to them. shall be given a proof that we are in the minority. the admission of the honourable member's leader, that they are in a minority on the main body of their programme. Whilst that side of the House takes the socialistic view of things, most honourable members take what I call the individualistic view. duced by a private member, the Ministry would be impotent to secure either its modification or rejection, although it might be opposed to their policy.

It is, of course, a committee of the House-thaj t is the whole principle underlying our constitutional governmentbut a committee having the control of the Honse. The honourable member will recollect, apropos of his remark, an instance which I gave in this Chamber a short time ago. When the late Sir Henry Parkes found that a Committee of the New South Wales Parliament would not agree to the Chairman sitting again to reconsider a certain question, he handed in his commission to the Governor, and resigned, because he had not control of the House. The Ministry should be, not an irresponsible committee, but an inof industrial disputes."" The third was ""Olddependent committee, capable of controlling a majority of honourable members. I have been asked what I should have done under the circumstances. That is one of those vague and broad conundrums which a speaker is not called upon to answer; but jf the Prime Minister, when called upon to form an Administration, recognised that he could not command a majority in this House, it was his duty to decline the offer of the Governor General, and to leave it to honourable members to readjust themselves until majority rule was possible. I wish now to ask an important question. What is the ""Labour"" policy? I shall justify myself in entertaining a doubt about it. I desire to ask whether that policy is one .which is put forward in the interests of the whole country. by honourable members of the Opposition. honourable member will be patient. WhatI wanted to know was whether the Labour Ministry were following the policy which they have advocated in Australia for many years past? That is what I want to ask the honourable member, who is a very quiet follower of the present Government. Of course, the object of this Government is obviously to get well into the saddle. I can quite sympathize with that aspiration. Their object is to get well into the saddle; and it must have been noticeable to everybody that the labour programme, which has been before the country for fifteen years -althoug h certainly not in its present form that the measures which it comprehended accordance with their, supposed importance. Now, however, we have a doable policya ""first session"" policy and a ""second session"" policy-and it is very easy to see that the whole order and arrangement of the items of the labour programme has been altered in order to keep within this session those measures which are. supposed to be approved by the majority of honourable members on this side of the House, and to shift out of their order, into the next session, those items which are now regarded as constituting rhe initial steps in a great nationalizing policy. If honourable members who are not acquainted with the original labour programme, will refer to it they will see that the first item was ""the maintenance of a White Australia."" The second was ""compulsory arbitration for the settlement age pensions,"" and the fourth ""The nationalization of monopolies."" That was the programme which has been recognised by the Labour Party for many years past. I wish honourable members to particularly notice the third and' fourth items. Honourable members who have read the Address which was published by the Labour Party of Australia in the press a short time ago, will have noticed that the nationalization of the tobacco industry was linked with oidage pensions as the means whereby the money was to be obtained for the purpose of paying the pensions. Now, what is the result? We already have a White Australia, and the next item was compulsory arbitration. According to the original labour programme, old-age pensions and the nationalization of the tobacco industry should be taken next in order. Do they come next now ?

The papers contain the following remarks:The Minister directs that a special officer be instructed to visit vessels likely to contain Austrian and Italian immigrants. That is impartiality ! That is the outcome of the two meetings at Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie, one a gathering of ratepayers, and the other a meeting under the auspices of the Labour Party, who have agitated in a manner which is not only unreasonable, but unbrotherlv and inhuman, against the people of two European nations, because evidently they are competing with Australian workmen.

If he is satisfied that they are under contract they are to be treated as prohibited immigrants. There is no objection to that. If he is not so satisfied, but has reasonable ground to suspect that false statements have been -made to him in this regard, he should permit the immigrant to land, and instruct him not to leave Fremantle until advised that he may do -so. Here is an illustration of the arbitrary power that is to be placed in. the hands of a special official Avith regard to immigrants of two nationalities Avhich are named. The officer is not only to ask .a question, and abide by the ansAver, but if he has reasonable ground for suspecting that the ansAvers given to him are not true, he can actually detain the immigrants in a community of free men until instructions are received from the GoA'ernmeht.

That is the policy of Socialists, as expounded by Mr Tom Mann, who is admittedly the political organizer of the Trades Hall in Victoria. only a travestv upon the man's utterance. read somewhat similar statements from other documents presently. M.L.A., in speaking at the picnic of the Mort's Dock employees, which was held in February last, delivered himself as follows :"" Labour members did not go into the House as a third party; they went there to represent a section of the people, who hitherto had no representation, and to voice, and, if possible, give effect to, certain definite views on public policy. I now come to the most important document of all. Mr Bromley, the leader of the Labour Party in the Victorian Parliament, is a man whom I have known for fifteen or sixteen years, and with whom I am upon the most friendly terms, although our politics are as widely separated as are the poles. I wish to assure honourable members'that there is nothing flippant about Mr Bromley. He has the most serious and funereal cast of countenance that I have ever met. Both his voice and manner bespeak the most extreme earnestness. In an interview with a representative of the Age, which was published a few days ago, Mr Bromley, upon being questioned as to the attitude of the Labour Party towards Socialism, saidIt all depends upon the definition you give to Socialism. There are so many people nowadays who condemn everything which the Labour Party advocate, as socialistic, that it is hard to find just where liberalism ends and Socialism begins. I suppose we live in one of the most socialistic countries in the world, but you cannot get a large section of Australian's to believe it. Toput the position of the State Labour Party briefly, I should say that we are collectivists asopposed to individualists. We believe in State co-operation, or State control of such services as can be run by the community for its own' profit and advantage. We have already the railways, the schools, the postal and telegraphic services, in the hands of the State, and these hi-ve proved so successful that the Labour ParU' is anxious to see an extension of the system. Such things as gas and water supply, electric lighting,, tramways, and so on, should certainly be' nationalized or municipalized, because from this aspect there need be no distinction. Of course, as a party we are strongly in favour of a State bank and a State life and fire insurance office, and the establishment of the Crown as the only landholder. Personally I do not consider myself aa extremist in Socialistic principles. I believe firmly in the nationalization of monopolies, for example;, but I would never think of advocating the instant and comprehensive taking over of all industries by the State. It is all a matter of evolution. Perhapsf if t y years hence the people will be wiser than we are now, and better able to realize the benefits of State control in everything. But at the present day we must go slowly. I should start with the nationalization of all industries which affect the health and well-being of the community-provided , of course, that such industries had developed into monopolies. But even then it would not do for the State to start on the Mr Storey, co-operative basis, unless the proposal was a practical one. We should have to proceed on a business footing. But some risks might very well be undertaken, and we might profit by the example of other countries which have tried experiments and succeeded with them. Such examples might easily be extended and improved upon. For instance, one of the first things I would do would be to nationalize the coastal and Inter-State shipping. Ideally, all shipping should be run by the State, but I am afraid we cannot yet hope to take the oversea division in hand."" No doubt that will be very comforting to the P. and O. and the Orient Companies. Mr Bromley, who declares that he is a moderate Socialist, continuesBut the coastal trade is on a different footing, and I think that the States should assume control of it. We have our State railways on shore; why not our State steamers on the sea? The private shipping companies would have to be bought out, or, if they refused to negotiate, squeezed out of competition-. I ask honourable members to note that the State is to take up what shipping it can, and is to run it at the expense of the tax-",50,Ioavs

In regard to the land question, I believe there are some who consider that all the alienated area in Victoria should be resumed by the Crown without any compensation being awarded to the owners. That statement, I presume, applies to the extreme Socialists. bers observe what the moderate Socialists proposeAs a practical politician I must unreservedly condemn that suggestion. I am most decidedly in favour of the State becoming ultimately the landlord. But to me it is obvious that reasonable compensation should be paid lo those whose land has been taken away from them. Therefore I recognise that the process of getting back the lands which have been sold outright by the Crown will be a slow one. The way to effect the change would, in my opinion, be to impose a graduated land tax without any exemptions whatever, beginning with a small impost for the small holder, and increasing progressively as the acreages increased. The proceeds from that tax I would apply to the compulsory repurchase of the large holdings, and the cutting of them up for closer settlement. The moderate Socialist who is utterly opposed to anything in the form of confiscation, is quite prepared to purchase land at a reasonable price, having first extracted the necessary money from the land owners by means of a progressive land tax. will be comforting to honourable members to produced in such . profusion. That is what know that he also saysI do not think, however, that either as individuals or as a party you would find the State Labour Party in favour of the more advanced ideas urged by Socialists on the Continent of Europe.

There is a rule of advothough it is a little more elaborated. This cacy in my profession that one good fact in publication statesSocialism is a theory of a system of human society based on the common ownership of the evidence from your own side. Bearing that means of production and the carrying on of the rule in mind, I propose to quote an extract work of production by all for the benefit of all. In other words, Socialism means that the land, the railways, the shipping, the mines, the fac. tories, and all such things as are necessary for the production of the necessaries and comforts of life should be public property, just as our public roads, our public parks, aiid our public libraries are -public property to-day, so that all these things should be used by the whole of the people to produce the goods that the whole of the people require. Let honourable memFurtherBy the discoveries of science, the inventions of genius, the application of industry, man has acquired such power over nature that he can now produce wealth of all kinds as plentifully as water. There is no sound reason why poverty and want should exist anywhere on this earth. It is a beautiful millennial thought-on e of those Utopian pictures which writers of'fiction portray for the amusement of the people. It is ai -sort of More's Utopia, Butler's Erewhon, or Lytton's Coming Race, in which there is to be no more trouble or anxiety of any kind. Mr O'MALLEY -Hear, hear. hear these marks of approval on the part of honourable members opposite, for they stamp them as men equally as impracticable as is the man who writes this sort of rubbish. The article proceedsIt able All that is needed is to establish a more equitmethod of distributing the wealth already Socialism proposes to do. The work of production is organized, socialized; it is necessary to socialize distribution as well. What is to be done to supplant the present system by Socialism; to substitute fraternal cooperation for the cut-throat competition of today? The first thing is to organize the workers into a class-conscious party; that is, a party recognising that as a class the workers are enslaved through the possession of the means of production another class; recognising, too, that between these two classes there is an antagonism of in which must go on until the workers become posis the sessed of political power, and use that power to .become masters of the whole material means of production.

383,. Mr Bruce Smith,"I am glad tofrom the Age newspaper, which is to-day the friend of the Ministry. I shall quote, of course, something which appeared as far back as five days ago, and that is a horse of quite another colour. It is as well that honourable members who come from other States, and who may not have read the article from which I am about to give an extract, should know what the Age news paper, which is to-day espousing the cause of the Labour Party, thought of them about a week ago. In its issue of the 19th instant it wroteThe real weakness in the leading of the Labour Party is madeclear by other signs than that of its fanning the flames of class hatred. The adoption at this hour of the day of the discredited ideals of the early European Socialists is a proof that the organized Labour minority in Australia has lacked .the ability to formulate a national policy of its own in reasonable relation to our Australian conditions. For instance, we find nationalization of monopolies as one of the planks in the fighting platform of the Political Labour Council. Everybody knows that the nationalization of monopolies is proposed only as the first step in realizing the pet Socialist project of the nationalization of all the means of produc. tion and distribution. AgainOne conspicuous evil has already resulted from the method in which the Labour minority is Coercing the majority, namely, the stirring up of class strife. As long as it can foment war with other classes, it distracts attention from the fact that it is an undemocratic minority. This is from the Age newspaper, which has since thirty or forty years espoused the cause of the Trades Hall and the working classes of Victoria. Mr O'MALLEY -It has never been the Trades Hall newspaper. of a long time before the honourable member showed his face in this State; I am familiar with the principles that it advocated thirty years ago. On the recent date named it went on to sayWe have seen the position often enough in history, where an aggressive aristocracy diverted Rational attention from trouble at home by promoting war abroad; but it is exceedingly instructive to see a Labour minority carrying out the same unpatriotic policy in another department of political activity. Mr O'MALLEY -It is well written. sample of good English, but the principles which it condemns are revolutionary. turn now from newspapers and labour leaders to a level-headed writer who has always been the friend and well-wisher of the working classes. I refer to John Stuart Mill, from whose well-known' book, Representative Government, I propose to quote the following passage in the chapter on "" Infirmities and Dangers of Class Legislation"" :One of the greatest dangers of democracy, as of all other forms of government, lies in the sinister interests of the holders of power; it is the danger of class legislation : of Government intended for (whether really effecting it or not) the immediate benefit of the dominant class to the lasting detriment of the whole. And one of the most important questions demanding consideration in determining the best constitution of a representative Government is how to provide efficacious securities against this evil. ' And then, in another chapter on True and False Democracy-Representatio n of all and of the majority only-h e wroteThe pure idea of democracy, according to its definition, is the government of the whole people by the whole people equally represented. Democracy, as commonly conceived and hitherto practised, is the government of the whole people by a mere majority exclusively represented. He was assuming that there was a majority, which is not the case in this instance. The former* is synonymous with the equality of all citizens. The latter, strongly confounded with it, is a government of privilege I have always contended that class legislation is simply the building up on democratic lines of the very evils of which it took t.he British people centuries to rid themselves. If true liberty is represented in diagram by a free swing of the pendulum, I would point out that the Labour Party are not satisfied that the pendulum should be free, but are pushing it up on the one side and creating privileges for their own class, which is nothing more nor less than democratic toryism. What are the prospects ? I am not appealing to honourable members opposite, although I face them, but to the members of my party, who, I think, should, without hesitation, move the Government from office, in the best spirit and with the best feeling, crediting them with all sincerity, but debiting them with principles which, in my opinion, would undermine the existing state of society. I now ask what are the prospects ? We have, as the Age says, not merely the nationalization of the tobacco industry in contemplation, but the nationalization of the industries of the country, with the ultimate view of changing the whole character I of the community, and making it 'a Socialist, and, practically, a communistone.

I desire to again quote from the Age newspaper, as to the labour caucus. I admit that these remarks were published five days ago, and that the attitude of that newspaper to-day may not be the same as it was on that occasion; but, at the same time, there is no reason to suppose that the writer, of the leading article from which I intend to read did not know what he was writing about. He saysThe chief mischief which the leaders of the Labour Party are at present working in Australian politics is that of completely misrepresenting labour. We have lately seen the course of Federal legislation abruptly arrested by the Labour Party, not on account of some broad aspiration r.f He was asked whether there the workers, but to give political power to the State employees, who are already by far the most comfortable wage and salary earning class in thc community. It is well known that throughout imaginary grievances of the pampered public serthe indulgence of these favoured few before every genuine labour interest. At present organized labour is riding rough-shod over unorganized. The modus operandi is very simple. The orgariized minority strongly and unitedly denounces a protest against any part of its programme as class disloyaltya charge which the majority is honorably sensitive about. Thus it comes, to pass that the Labour Party in Australi.i is just now the most arbitrarily conducted organization in the Commonwealth.

That bears out exactly the account given by an unnamed member of the Labour Party to the correspondent of the Sydney Morning Herald. I also have here an article headed "" The Labour Caucus,"" published in the Age of 25th April. It reads as follows: The methods-commendabl e or otherwise-pursued in the formation of the new Governmenl comprise in some respects a decided innovation. To the student of constitutional history and government, apart from all party'feeling or prejudice, they possess considerable interest. Mr Watson has apparently accepted the Governor General's commission as an individual unit in his party rather than as a leader who has supreme control over his followers, ancl can dictate to them his wishes. Instead of ""giving his little Senate laws,"" his little Senate gives him laws, and holds him to them by virtue of its thorough organization and its caucus. The platform of the Labour Party makesthis an essential.

"" The doctrine of the Labour Party narrows itself down to finding the right caucus. The individual is nothing, the party everything. that is absolutely incorrect. Prime Minister's statement; but the opinion I have read is entertained by a writer for one of the Australian newspapers which is most favourably disposed to the Labour Party. I should like honourable members to compare that statement of pupilage, or slavery topolicy, which is involved by the (conditions under which the Labour Party have to ""accept a programme which is made outside, and which they have no power to alter, with the state of affairs which obtains in England at present, where there are such men as Mr John Burns and Mr Bell. John Burns is one of the most heroic, able, and accomplished iabour members in the whole world. I propose to read an extract from a letter from the London correspondent of the Age, who quotes the words used by John Burns, in regard to the attempt .made to coerce him as to the action he should take in the House of Commons. The correspondent saysThere are Australian Labour representatives whose Parliamentary experience should qualify them to sympathize with vigorous complaints which Mr R. Bell and Mr John Burns are making against the jealous and suspicious attitude adopted towards them by trade union wire-pullers, because they presume to claim some degree of personal freedom. As a politician and general supporter of working class interests on the platform, and in the House of Commons, Mr BellI t is open to is a man of proved judgment. But he has committed the grave sin of refusing to sign the "" Constitution"" of the Labour Representation Committee. Apparently it is is too uncompromisingly Socialistic for him, and weighted with restrictions. He was allowed some individual discretion when he first entered Parliament, and he wishes to retain it. So, when next he appears before his constituents at Derby, he will find himself bitterly opposed and discredited by the outraged committee. The resistance to his monstrous claim that he should be allowed to think a little for himself will be carried on with all tbe righteous fur y of a family feud. "" All Labour members,"" says Mr John Burns, whose independence has been similarly criticized, "" have not yet reached the position of being the mere delegates of cliques. Any attempt to adopt that method will signally f a i l , because practically it will not secure the return of men of high character, and the type of men that would be returned would not be worth having.""

But after that the men gradually got ""tired of the equal work, equal play, and equal pay, and made tracks and, in the words of the Cafricornian, "" The men gradually drifted to what, in the dialect of the strike, which gave birth to the settlement, was called the old wages slavery. They simply could not stand everything in common. What killed the settlement was not death, nor the hardship of the climate, nor the difficulties of agriculture, hm simply Socialism. The system broke down, men could not stand it, and in the end a settlement ""which started with over ioo men, dwindled to seven."" Now, these seven have formed themselves into a limited liability company, after the manner of the purest capitalism. The settlement, as a settlement, has not failed all through ihe drought; it produced excellent crops by reason ol its irrigation plant, and largely supplied Kockhnmpton with vegetables. However, it has broken down completely as a socialistic settlement. I again challenge the socialistic party in this House to name any civilized community in which the doctrine of Socialism has been successfully practised. I invite them to point to any socialistic settlement whose numbers have not decreased, little by little, until its members have had to look for work abroad. I have no objection to voluntary Socialism, but I protest against the State handcuffing me by declaring-"" You shall not live according to the standard which has been adopted in European countries, but according to our standard."" the Labour Party are at perfect liberty to create a little community for themselves, but they have no right to force me to enter it. Its members do not ask for voluntary Socialism. They seek to obtain control of existing industries by an indirect method of confiscation, because, if they levy a progressive tax upon land, such as will return a sufficient sum to enable them to re-purchase large estates, it practically amounts to confiscation. I cannot'believe that honourable members upon this side of the House will allow the present prospect to develop into a reality for the next three months, by permitting the Government to carry out a milk-and-water policy, whilst studiously avoiding objectionable socialistic proposals and relegating them to next session. As I have already pointed out, it is a most serious thing to allow the Government to exercise Executive power during the period in which Parliament will be in recess. The examples that show that laws' may be tyrannically administered by one man, whilst they may Mr Bruce Smith. be administered by another without inflict? ing injury upon the community. Therefore, I hold that we should not entrust For a time it Executive power to men who entertain views which are bound to be destructive of the interests of Australia. If we permit them to remain in oflice, by neglecting to consolidate ourselves into a formidable Opposition phalanx, we shall be guilty of a grave dereliction of duty. I only hope that wise counsels will prevail, and that every honourable member who does not belong to the Socialist party will readily join with the Opposition in putting an end to this reign of a party with an impracticable policy. propose to deal seriatim with the various assertions made by the honourable and learned member for Parkes in the lengthy speech which he has just delivered. I must state at the outset, however, that he won my sympathy when he spoke of the death of his little girl in a convent, and of the request made to him to sign a declaration as to the circumstances connected with that incident. I may safely say that he signed that document because of an honest belief that he was attesting the truth. That is a fair way of looking at the matter, and we on this side of the House can say that we have just as honestly and as conscientiously signed what we believe to be a platform calculated to uplift humanity. The tirade I say that of abuse which has been showered upon the Labour Party would, if it were justified by the doctrines we profess, cause us to blush. But that is not the case. What do honourable members opposite propose to do? They propose to enter into a coalition with the view of ousting from office a party whose honesty has never been impugned. This seems to be a strange way of carrying on the political affairs of the Commonwealth. The honourable and learned member for Parkes did Mr Bromley an injustice, unintentionally, no doubt, when by innuendo he suggested a proposal for interference with the family. Let me tell' him whjat is really proposed. We hope to secure for the children of the poor as good an education as the honourable and learned member, with his ample means, can give his own children. I should like to see every little girl sent to a convent or some equally good school. I have quoted,' the children of the poor well educated?

But I shall endeavour, although I have had only a few minutes in which to prepare my notes, to answer some of the statements made by him. Surely our ambition to educate the children of the poor is justifiable, and should be that of every good man. Can any one imagine. for a moment that the Great Being of 2,000 years ago, with His twelve disciples, had thirteen persons amongst them.

But that is very different from the present position of democratic Socialism. We are endeavouring to improve the lot of the people, and will do so. for Parkes, judging by what has fallen from his own lips, is a very wide reader, and he asserts that we have not read nearly as largely as he has done.

The honourable and learned member for Ballarat will not be able to lead half of those who are said to belong to his party. He seems to soar in the clouds. He does not keep his mind on the earth. When Prime Minister, he confessed, at the Lord Mayor of Melbourne's quarterly luncheon, that, when he consented to represent an important constituency, although he knew that he would continue in politics only a year, he did not take his constituents into hi s confidence : on the subject. Neither did he take them into his confidence in regard to the betrayal of the protectionist cause.

The right honourable member for East Sydney used an expression about feeding the tiger with milk, which recalled to me the lines of a well known Limerick, which run like thisThere was a young lady of Riga Who went for a ride on a tiger; They returned from their ride With the lady inside, And a smile on the face of the tiger. I do not think that the graceful shape of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat could encompass the bulky rotundity of the right honourable membei for East Sydney; but the latter might be able to engross the slighter and more delicately built frame of the late Prime Minister. If : he has not done so physically, he has done so mentally. The bigger brains of the hero from Sydney have demolished the hero from Ballarat, who, if he had had any. backbone, might have become almost a dictator in Australia. He has, however, betrayed the cause of protection. Notwithstanding that he was many years in power in Victoria, no great measure for the benefit of humanity was passed by him.

Honourable members may think that it is only the members of the Labour Party who desire a White Ocean. When Made in Germany was written by Mr should be so in the same terms with regard to Williams, it was shown that the P. and O. Company were receiving over ,£400,000 a year in subsidies from England and her Colonies, and that they took German goods, transhipped them at London, and carried them to Australia for 25 and 50 per cent, less than they charged for conveying English goods from England to Australia. Of course that infamy ceased upon the publication of the facts. The company, however, continue to give the poor unfortunate Jascars whom they employ a space about twice the size of an ordinary coffin to sleep in, For years the Orient Company carried white crews, just as the German and French companies, do j but ultimately the competition of the P. and O. Company compelled them to employ lascars. It has been contended, on behalf of the lascar, that he is not cheaper than the white man, but more biddable; that"" the Englishman is drunken, and gives trouble. The same thing has been said about the employment of Kanakas in Queensland. To show that this practice has been spoken of by other than labour members in terms as strong as we should employ, I draw the attention of honourable members to the following report of a debate in the House of Commons on the proposal of a vote to complete the sum of ,£772:°* 5 *oi the expenses of the Post Office Packet Service, published in the London Times of 12th May, 1900Mr T.

Lord Selborne ought not to be at the same time a director of the P. and O. Co. and a member of the Government, which was shielding that company while they were breaking the law. Mr Havelock Wilson, M.P. (Middlesborough), did not object to lascars being employed, but they wages, accommodation, and food as -British seamen. There were 40,000 lascars in the British mercantile marine, and the number was increasing, while that of the British was diminishing. The wages and maintenance of two lascars did not equal the cost of one British seaman. While 120 cubic feet of space was recommended by Ihe British Royal Commission of 1891, for each seaman, lascars were allowed only thirty-six feet (barely the dimensions of a decent-sized coffin). The P. and O. Co. employed 5,000 lascars. Those were the opinions of liberal members. I shall now quote the opinions of some of the Conservative members of the HouseSir Howard Vincent (Conservative), a prominent Imperialist, said that formerly lascars were employed only in the engine-room, but now they were employed on deck, the proportion in one case being sixty-one lascars; only twenty-nine or less than half were employed in the engineroom. Australian Governments (notably Queensland) had taken a serious view of the matter, and had refused to give contracts to vessels carrying lascars. He did not wish to say anything as to the employment of those in the engine-room, but their employment on deck had proved in several instances a great danger in times of emergency and shipwreck, and these lascars were exceedingly liable to panic. Honourable members must have read of cases of that kind.

It was a grievous mistake for fhe Government to shut their eyes to the fact that our mercantile 'marine was fast decaying-(hear , hear)-that apprentices were few-(hear , hear)-and that 40,000 or 50,000 foreigners had displaced Britain's own sailors. (Hear, hear.) Foreigners and lascars would not fight England's naval battles, and landsmen could not man her fleet, for they were not trained seamen. He would not do anything to weaken his own Government, would not vote against his Government, but he would not vote for them, as he held they had neglected their duty in neglecting to make the employment of British These were the words of an Admiral who wishes to uphold British supremacy on the seas. He justly asks how we can expect foreigners and lascars to fight England's battles. His words constitute a formidable indictment against the .way in which the affairs of the shipping companies are at present conducted. They might very well have come from the lips of a labour representative. This, however, was not the worse of the scathing criticism which was directed to the system of employing lascars.

Does the honourable member think that the honourable member for Swan, who has no follower from his own State in either House, would be elected as Prime Minister of Australia? I do not think so.

The sixth item in the Government programme has reference to financial measures. Strange to say, a similar proposal finds a place in the policy of the coalition party. The Ministry propose that the consideration of the Iron Bonus Bill shall be deferred for the present, and that the Navigation Bill shall not be proceeded with, pending an investigation by a Royal Commission. The parties opposite adopt a similar attitude towards those measures. The Tariff is to be left undisturbed for two years, and the introduction of the Inter-State Commission Bill is to be postponed pending further inquirv. adopted eleven planks out of fourteen which are contained in the Ministerial policy. What is the cause of all the present trouble ? Why should honourable members not arrive at an agreement to elect Ministers to carry out this policy ? I can honestly sav that there has been no heart-burning or jealousy amongst members of the Labour Party because some Ministers have been chosen from among them. little. We intend to fight for the planks of -our platform, and if we are dispossessed the Ministry which will adopt those planks can count upon our loyal support. Mr O'MALLE Y (Darwin) -During the course of this debate we have heard a great many speeches which resembled the thunder from Sinai. Indeed, I thought that the waters of Niagara Falls had been let loose until I recollected tliat I was still in Australia. I have never yet read or heard of such a combination of intellectual giants pitching into the humble democrats of the Labour Party. From the utterances of some honourable members one would imagine that we had committed highway robbery. I must confess that I entertain a great respect for the right honourable member for East Sydney. I regard him as a star of the first magnitude. intended to be a luminary and a. blessing to the world, but he .has gone astray. He ought always to be at the zenith, and not on the margin of the horizon, as his brilliancy will betray him in matters he may himself strive to hide. that whatever he may do the people will climb the highest mountains,, and descend into the admire such a political luminary. Therefore, I am sorry that he went astray about two years ago. He was misled by false prophets. At that time the newspapers predicted the absolute annihilation of the Labour Party. But that party is founded upon justice. It comes from ""the Creator; from the manger of Bethlehem; from the twelve apostles. It comes to bestow a benediction upon the universe, and to l if t humanity out of the mire. Let no one imagine that because I am politically opposed to the right honourable member for East Sydney that I do not respect him. I look upon him as the Daniel Webster of the Southern Hemisphere. I also entertain the greatest admiration for the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, but I have always recognised that if these two great forces are brought together the lesser must go Thus the coalition party have down. The right honourable member for East Sydney is one of the five greatest platform speakers in the world. MrO ' MALLEY In America. I entertain .a great opinion of the honourable and learned member for Parkes. He is a brilliant man. I always enjoy listening to his speeches, although I do not agree with them. That, liowever, merely proves Come what may, we care, that he does not agree with me. To-night I wish to enter my protest against the waste of time that has been incurred in this debate. The discussion has convinced me that the British system of parliamentary government is not sufficiently modern. The Labour Party have proved that the intellectual domain of the world is open to the many, and not to the few. The present Government have demonstrated that men are not born to fill Ministerial office-that there are hundreds and thousands of men in Australia who are quite capable of stepping on to the Treasury benches. I believe there is no member of the House who is not aualified to satisfactorily discharge the duties of a Minister The present session of Parliament opened on 2nd March, but what has been accomplished? I recognise that we must go to America' for a new I believe he was system of government * tem is not a socialistic one. ' Mr O'MALLEY --It is one of the most wonderful socialistic systems upon earth. In the course of his address, the honourable I feel sure and learned member for Parkes emphasized the advantage of a business experience. I claim to have had a thorough business traindarkest caverns, to ing. So also had my friend, the honourable member for Melbourne, who rose to be an accountant in a bank.

534,Mr Bruce Smith,"The American sysconducted some big business transactions. It -is a great pity that ;in discussing questions of stupendous magnitude, some honourable members are always ready to reflect upon members of tbe Labour Party on account of their lack of business experience. It has been said during the course of this debate that the members of the Labour Party are not free agents. I hold that they are absolutely free. Who is freer than I am ? We merely sign a pledge that, if we are not nominated at the next election we will stand down and assist the selected candidate. Next month two great conventions will bo held in the United States for the purpose of choosing candidates for the Presidency. When rhe delegates attend those Conventions they will sign a pledge agreeing to be bound by the determination arrived at. Is it not ridiculous for my honourable friends -wh o are absolutely sworn to the free trade fallacy-to talk of honourable members breaking a pledge Why, in Australia. I have found that we require plans and specifications to discover ihe whereabouts of some of these political brethren, simply because they are bound by no pledge. I have no desire to be offensive, because I have the greatest admiration for the Christians opposite. The word "" Chiistian,"" by the wav, is one which is very much misunderstood. I claim that every man who acts justly upon this earth is a Christian. An Honorable MEMBER -The honourable member acts justly according to his lights. Mr O'MALLEY -That is the position. Candidates for a seat in Parliament as members of the Labour Party sign a pledge that if they are not selected they will support the men who are chosen. I remember on one occasion attending a Convention in the United States, at which two publicans were present. They did not sign the pledge, and when we nominated two men for Congress-on e who was a teetotaller, and' one who was not-the y decided to work for the man who was not a teetotaller, and to fight against the man who was. pledge ? Mr O'MALLEY -He was not in it. We should have men bound to their principles. enter this House bound to support principles which must tend to uplift humanity. But how are we going to carry out this work? For some days we have been fighting over the present situation. We have been discussing it, and fooling about, and wasting time to siich an extent that we are drawing our. pay under false pretences. I almost feel ashamed to draw my allowance. propose to increase the present allowance? Mr O'MALLEY I am ashamed, in the first place, to draw my allowance, because of its small proportions; but I am also ashamed to draw it because I feel that I am not at present earning it. That is due to the action of honourable members opposite. promised, that we should have an increase of .£200 per annum. Mr O'MALLEY I cannot do anything' unless I receive support. If the honourable member will support the proposal, I will give him my assistance, and will vote to throw the Labour Ministry out of office if they decline to increase the present allowance to honourable members.. I wish to make a candid statement in regard to this question. Let us seek to devise a system under which it will be possible for us to deal in a proper way with the business of Parliament. I propose that we run the House on the butty-gang system, or that we have three shifts. We have first of all. the Opposition, then we have the brother who, with his party, occupied the Treasury benches a little while ago, and we have also the Ministerial Labour Party. The life of the present Parliament has still two and .a half years to run. Let us, therefore, divide it' into three shifts of ten months each. There is no difference in our policies, and, that being so, what are we fighting about? We all admit that every honourable member is an honest man. We recognise that every honourable member is capable, and intellectually fitted to hold a seat in this House, and, that being so, I should not have the slightest objection to the carrying on the work of the' Parliament by means of three shifts. Let the present Ministry reign Tor ten months, let them be followed in turn by the right honourable member for East Sydney and his. party, and then let the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and his followers take the third shift. We should in this way be able to assist each Members of the Labour Party other in giving effect to a policy on which we are all agreed. Mr O'MALLEY I should be prepared to put the honourable and learned member into office after the others had had a show. If we do not agree to some system'",68,Ioavs

An appeal may be made from Festus to Caesar, but we shall appeal from Caesar to the people who make the Caesars. Let us, if it is thought desirable, have an elective Ministry. It would be open for the House to elect a Ministry by secret ballot. We should, at all events, enter upon the work before us in a business like way, anrl not seek to throw out a Ministry because of every little Tom, Dick and Harry foolishness, as we do at the present time. honourable members have had much to say of individual freedom. What is individual freedom? When I lived amongst the Yaki Indians in Mexico, the great Sagimore ordered a man to be killed when it did not suit him that he should live. If a young buck disagreed with another, he was taken out and shot. Is that what honourable members opposite want? Let me tell the honourable and learned member for Parkes, and the honourable and learned member fpr Wannon, that I once heard of an old buck belonging to the Wabunsee Indians, in Western America,who thought Jhat he could stop one of the locomotives travelling through his country from the East. was ignorant of the power of steam. He told his fellow -Indians that he would stov that locomotive, but when he went out and butted his head against it, he was knocked into a thousand pieces. The engine went on-and so will the Labour Party. are going ahead. against ihe party will be knocked into a thousand pieces, and perhaps buried without either flowers or parson. There never was a party better prepared than we are to bury its enemies. to feel their pulses, a preacher to read the burial service over them, and an undertaker to plant them. We have even a lawyer to draw up their wills. I have the greatest respect for the individual opinions of honourable members opposite, and I need hardly assure them that there is no feeling of bitterness rankling in my bosom. In view ot what some honourable members have said in regard to the banking proposals of the Government, I would remind them that, in 1893, when every inten-State bank having its headquarters in Australia crossed the Jordan, not one bank in Canada suspended payment. Some honourable members may say that the Bank of New South Wales, which did not close its doors, has its head-quarters in Australia. That is not the"" case. Its headquarters are in London. MrO ' MALLEY I will give way to the honourable and learned member, and say that every other Inter-State bank whose head-quarters were in Australia crossed the Jordan in that year. the Royal Bank, and one or two others that did not close their doors? Mr O'MALLEY -The Royal and the City Banks are not Inter-State institutions. Every one of the Inter-State banks of the Some class I have named crossed the Jordan and went down like McGinty's cart. asia .did not do so. Mr O'MALLEY -That is an English institution. If it had not been for the action of the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria, .who came to their rescue, every one of them would have suspended payment. During the same year hundreds of telegrams appeared from time to time in the American press, telling of banks that had gone to the wall. But how many broke in Canada? I would ask the honourable and learned member for Werriwa He to name one Canadian bank which closed its doors in 1893. fiscation of £8,000,000 of the banks' reserves strengthen their position?

Slave-masters down South declared that if we destroyed that great fabric which came down from the We have a doctor ages we should destrov the Republic. They considered that slavery was a Heaven-blest institution. But the Government propose a banking system which has been a success in one of the most Conservative countries in the world. Had the honourable member for Wentworth lived, as I have done, in the Arctic regions of Canada, he would know that one of the most Conservative Governments in the world holds office there. Sir John McDonald, who, with the exception of the intervals in which McKenzie held office, was Prime Minister practically from 1867 until his death, was a Conservative Scotchman, and we have Scotchmen on the Treasury benches in this House.
