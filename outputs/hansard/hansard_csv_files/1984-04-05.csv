Again, this motion, that if we can establish with all the States motion before the House today would greatly a uniform system of exchanging that data, the assist in that. disposal of vehicles will be made much more difficult. It is interesting that the RACV mentions As has been noted, this issue requires a Premin the article that Footscray was the worse hit area iers Conference, I believe, to give impetus to it on in Victoria and that last year 540 vehicles were a national basis.

We will also be liaising very closely with pleasing that the motor vehicle theft rate last year motoring organisations and insurance companies did not rise to perhaps the same extent it has in and, as the honourable member for Lilley and past years, and I think that is a compliment to the Chairman of the Road Safety Committee has efforts of the Victoria police to reduce the extent noted, in this context the Government sees a of car theft and to catch those who have indulged broad range of policies which could be part of a in it. package to reduce motor vehicle theft. Obviously, The seconder of this motion said that many of we need that national register of stolen vehicles. our cars had been badly designed in the past and We need more co-operation between police and that that was a positive incentive to theft.
