Crime: Money Laundering (Question No. 2210) upon notice, on 12 August 2003: Have the Australian Federal Police and/or AUSTRAC estimated the amount of money that is laundered in Australia every year; if so, what was that estimate and when was that estimate made. the honourable member’s question: The Australian Federal Police (AFP) has not estimated the amount of money laundered in Australia. The AFP notes the work of other anti-money laundering bodies which have both the capacity and expertise to undertake the extensive work necessary to develop such estimates. Factors such as whether the money is generated from crime in Australia, or sent to or from another jurisdiction, impact on the estimates. Similarly, not all money is processed through normal financial systems or necessarily sent out of the country, making estimates more difficult to determine. The most recent work to gauge the quantum of money laundered in Australia occurred in 1995, when Extent of Money Laundering In& Through Australia”. The AFP provided input to this report. The Walker Report concluded that the extent of money laundering in Australia fell between $1,000 million and $4,500 million per year. The Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC), at a symposium on money laundering held at the Reserve Bank of Australia in September 2002 provided a breakdown from the Walker Report. The Australian economy is estimated at being $380 billion per annum Costs of crime are estimated at between $11 billion and $13 billion per annum Proceeds of crime are estimated at between $6 billion and $8 billion per annum Money laundering is estimated at between $1 billion and $4.5 billion per annum. In 1998 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stated that “... the estimates of the present scale of money laundering transactions are almost beyond imagination – two to five per cent of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would probably be a consensus range.” According to the IMF, using 1996 statistics this would approximate to between USD$590 billion and USD$1.5 trillion. More recently the World Bank Group declared that at least USD$1 trillion is laundered annually. Legal Aid: Funding (Question No. 2217) fairs, upon notice, on 12 August 2003:",111,Questions On Notice

173,Mr Williams,The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to,112,Questions On Notice
174,Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister For Immigration And Multicultural And Indigenous Af,"(1) Has a decision been taken to hold a public tender for Aboriginal legal aid services in South Australia; if so, (a) when was that decision taken, (b) by whom, and (c) what were the reasons for this decision. (2) Who is responsible for conducting the tender and what is its budgeted cost. (3) What was the original timetable for the tender and how has the timetable been varied, if at all, since it was originally set. (4) What requirements must the tenderers meet and will tenderers be required to be from the Aboriginal community. (5) Will tenders be invited to provide legal services across the State or only in particular regions. (6) What are the Seven Principles for implementation of Aboriginal legal aid services reforms. (7) What does the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services contestability policy provide. (8) What are the State Direction Strategy and Funding Allocation Method in accordance with which the contestability policy must be implemented. (1) The decision to proceed to tender for Indigenous Legal Aid Service Delivery was determined on a National basis, rather than targeting any specific State or Zone. The ATSIC Board of Commissioners decided on 17 June 2003 to adopt a policy direction to tender for the provision of Indigenous Legal Aid Service Delivery across Australia. The decision built upon the ATSIC Board’s 2001 existing contestability policy and the need to look for opportunities for enhanced service delivery. the CEO of ATSIS on 1 July this year, requiring the choice of and relationship with individual service providers for all Indigenous services (not just legal aid) to be based on best practice, including: outcome-based funding and performance-based contracts for service delivery; and market testing and competitive tendering wherever appropriate. (2) ATSIS is responsible for conducting the tender. The detailed budgeted cost is yet to be determined. (3) The original proposed timetable was for tenders to be called on a State by State basis commencing during the 2003-04 financial year. This decision was made prior to the Separation of Powers coming into existence on 1 July 2003. Since that date, although the decision of the ATSIC Board of Commissioners has been taken into account, ATSIS has reviewed the proposed timetable to ensure that the tender process is conducted properly. (4) The tender specifications have not yet been finalised. It is expected that a draft of Tender specifications will be produced and circulated for comments before drawing up final specifications. The objective will be to have services provided by organisations which have a commitment to Indigenous people. (5) It is envisaged that Tenders will be invited for the provision of legal services to the State of South Australia, rather than on a regional basis. (6) The Seven Principles approved by the ATSIC Board were agreed to before the Separation of Powers came in on 1 July 2003. The Principles inform ATSIS as to the Board’s position at that time but it is up to ATSIS to determine how the reforms will be implemented and what strategies will be used. The Principles are as follows: 1. That Future Directions reforms progress wisely and surely to ensure that service delivery models best fit actual needs and circumstances and avoid the ‘one size fits all’ approach.",112,Questions On Notice
175,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:2. That the Future Directions reforms are to be based on quality information from census, survey and research and ATSIS is currently reviewing the: Funding Allocation Method (reform to determine funding on the basis of needs); and State Directions Strategy (reform on the basis of performance and efficiency). 3. That the ATSIC Legal Aid program is effective now in meeting needs of Indigenous clients within very constrained funding and requires gradual adjustment for efficiency but not major change. Any change will have to ensure that Indigenous clients are not further disadvantaged in gaining true access to the critical services for law and justice. 4. That the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (ATSILS) are best placed for effective delivery of services for Indigenous clients who place a high value on cultural awareness of the service provider as an element of program efficiency. 5. That the implementation of any changes be consistent with the ATSIC ATSILS contestability policy which provides for legal aid services being open to contest with tenders sought from as many Indigenous organisations as possible and selection made in an open and fair manner. (Refer to Answer to Question7 below) 6. That all Legal Aid Service providers must comply with the relevant State or Territory authorising legislation which enables them to practice and provide legal services. 7. That legal aid services continue to be delivered to Indigenous people by Indigenous governed organisations that have a commitment to and understanding of the communities they serve. (7) It should be noted that the answer to this question is qualified by the fact that since 1 July 2003, when the Separation of Powers came into existence, the ATSIC Board of Commissioners determines its policies while ATSIS determines how these policies will be implemented. The contestability policy provided for the performance of incumbent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (ATSILS) to be monitored and assessed against clear service specifications and output-based performance measures. At the end of an incumbency, provision of Indigenous legal aid services would be open to contest from other potential service providers. (8) The answer to this question is qualified by the introduction of the Separation of Powers from 1 July 2003. The State Direction Strategy is the principal method for advancing the ATSIC Board and Cabinet approved Indigenous Legal Aid Services reforms in each State. The aim is to ensure that The Funding Allocation Method indicates the share of ATSIC’s total legal aid budget that each State and Territory should ideally receive, based on a set of factors relevant to Indigenous peoples’ need for legal services. Budget: Government Policy Decisions (Question No. 2219) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 12 August 2003: What has been the net impact on the budget bottom line of discretionary Government policy decisions for each Federal budget since 1996. The cumulative net impact on the budget bottom line of Government policy decisions since 1996 is not separately calculated. Each budget since 1996 provides initial estimates of the cost of policy decisions at that time. However, these estimates do not include the effect of subsequent parameter and other variations that would impact on the cumulative net effect of policy decisions. In addition, because of a change made in accounting practices, data over the years 1996-97 to 2002-03 is not strictly comparable. Data included in the Budget years up to and including 1998-99 are consistent with the cash ABS GFS",113,Questions On Notice

177,Mr Hardgrave,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Accordingly, it is the primary responsibility of the Australian Red Cross Society to uphold these principles. I am also aware of comments by the ARCBS in the Canberra Times of 11 September to the effect that the prospective blood donors in question would be contacting the ARCBS to “work through the issues and identify which members of the group would be eligible to donate”. I welcome this undertaking.",116,Questions On Notice
