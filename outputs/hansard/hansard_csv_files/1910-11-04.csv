As to the expediency of a measure of this kind, we have to remember that Australia is a protective country, and that all our industries must be encouraged either through the Customs House or by means of bounties. The Minister of Trade and Customs has made out a very good case for the bounty on kerosene; and we should do all possible to build up any industry capable of successful development within the Commonwealth. It is desirable that the nation should be self-supporting as far as possible, because in time of war or of external trouble that is one of the greatest securities we can have. That end can be attained, as I pointed out, in two wayseither by a protective duty or by a bounty. The Minister referred to the increase in the price of kerosene since the present Tariff came into operation; and I regret that, with that increase, there has been a deterioration in the quality, as all who depend entirely on kerosene for lighting purposes must have noticed. Some time ago a representative of the Orient Steam Navigation Company told me it was quite possible to convert the engines of the vessels for the use of fuel oil, but that the company declined to trust themselves to the mercy of the American Oil Trust. In Acts -Military Forces -Revised constructing our battleships we are providing for the use of fuel o i l ; and there is no doubt that we are in the same difficulty as that which confronts the shipping company. We all can see the disastrous results that might follow any adverse action on the part of the Oil Trust; and there is, therefore, a national",18,Brunswick And Central Telephone Exchanges
53,Mr Frazer Laid Upon The Table The,,19,Tudor
54,Mr Sinclair (Moreton) [N.o],"I tas well as an industrial aspect of the question. has to compete with the cheap labour and cheap products from other parts of the world. The argument as to cheap labour may not, perhaps, apply to the oil industry so much as to others, which I should be out of order in mentioning at the present juncture; but the fact remains that we should take care that our workmen enjoy the best possible conditions. One argument against the bounty has not yet been raised, and it is one that could be used even if the oil company were proved to be in a bad condition financially. The export of shale from Australia is a very profitable business. It appears that shale can be taken out of the present properties worth £ 2 per ton, and though this, of course, is a phase of the business that will not help the oil industry in Australia, it certainly affords an outlet for oil companies if they should find that, as at present, the manufacture of oil is unprofitable. However, I remove from my mind any consideration for the oil corporations, and regard this as purely an Australian question of whether we shall build up. an oil industry for the Australian people. The Minister, though he made out a very good case for a bounty on kerosene, utterly failed to show any necessity for a bounty on paraffin wax. I am opposed to granting bounties and protection to the same industry. There is a protective duty of £ 9 per ton, or 33^ per cent., on paraffin wax, and if an industry cannot succeed with that advantage, any amount of spoon-feeding by means of a bounty will not establish it. The Minister told us of a tanner who complained that he had to pay 4^d. per pound for paraffin wax; and, apparently it did not. suggest itself to the honon the part of the general population, but orable gentleman that the wax, being used for "" loading "" purposes, was sold by the tanner at, perhaps, is. 2d. or even is. iod. per pound. I have very little sympathy with men who use adulterants. orable member is quite fair. amount of grease is necessary in the manufacture of leather, and the wax is used for that purpose, and not for the purpose of ""loading."" ter that paraffin wax is manufacture of some leathers. I can assure the honourable member that it is not This industry is unprotected, and used as an adulterant. the matter, but it suggests itself to me that the wax is used as an adulterant. I am not accusing the Minister of endeavouring to assist people in adulterating their goods; but, in any case, a person who uses paraffin wax can afford to pay a little more for it than at present. The dairying industry, in which I take a great deal of interest, uses a good deal of paraffin wax, not as an adulterant, but purely for waxing the boxes; and no return is received for it by the producer. I am quite sure that those engaged in the dairying industry are prepared to pay a fair price for the wax; and if die present Customs duty is not sufficient let it be increased. After all, paraffin wax is only a sort of by-product; and we were given to understand by the honourable member for Cook, though I do not know whether his figures are correct, that 5 per cent, of the crude oil represents wax. Last year it appears that the value of the paraffin wax imported was £41,000, and the duty paid about £10,000; so that there is a fair margin of protection. When we reach the Committee stage, I shall move to remove paraffin wax from the operation of the bounty. I have previously mentioned that there are indications in Australia of crude oil in the bowels of the earth; and I suggest that if ""the amount now proposed to be spent in encouraging the paraffin wax industry-or , indeed, a much larger amount -were devoted to prospecting for oil wells, it would be more to the interests of the country. We have to consider the users more than the producers of oils. The users extend throughout Australia, and die demand is increasing day by day, not only on the part of those who run locomotives and machinery, in the development of which fuel oil is going to play a very important part in the near future. It is a great advantage for any manufacturer to have fuel oil to resort to; and I urge tiie Minister to act on the suggestion made in A certain regard to prospecting. In Queensland, some time ago, a bore was put down at Dalby to test the locality for o i l ; but after a certain distance had been traversed, the gas caught fire, and the company or remind the Minissyndicate was practically ruined.

58,Mr Sinclair,"I shall not disputeI think I have made it quite clear that I shall support the bounty on kerosene, but not on paraffin wax. -This Bill has been introduced rather in a hurry; and I am sorry we had no notice such a proposal was to be made. While I agree with the bounty, it appears to me not to go far enough. Under an Act that was proposed in 1907, a bounty is given on "" combed wool or tops exported "" ; and it seems to me highly desirable that there should be a slight amendment in that measure. I do not know whether an amendment could be made by means of this Bill, or whether it will require separate legislation. I distinctly stated that the intention of the Government was to give a bounty of ,£50,000 on kerosene and shale oil, spread over five years, and the only alteration is that the period is now made three years. that that announcement escaped me. The Act to which I have referred has done a great deal of good in establishing the tops industry, at all events in New South Walesj but, although I had charge of the measure when it was proposed, I cannot say why the word "" exported "" was inserted. The result, however, is that, although a large quantity is being manufactured under the bounty, not 1 lb. can be sold in New South Wales. Vicars and other woollen manufacturers in Sydney cannot buy their tops from Hughes, the man who has started this industry. He is exporting the whole of his product to Japan. I heard that last year he sent away an immense quantity, amounting to ^30,000 or ,£40,000 worth, in, I think, one shipment. When I asked him why he did so, he said that he could not afford to sell the tops in the State, because if he did he would get no bounty on them. The result is that other manufacturers have to make their own tops, which I do not think are as good as those made by Hughes. gible for the bounty. make only a little for themselves. make their tops for themselves here. do, that does not get over the difficulty to which I have drawn attention. Hughes has imported splendid machinery, and invested a large sum in producing the best tops I have ever seen, even superior to the Bradford tops that I have seen brought to Australia. under the attention ot the House by Mr J. C. Watson. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -It was he who brought it under my notice when I was preparing the Tariff, and it was on account of information supplied by him at the time that I proposed the payment of a bounty on wool tops. It seems to me ridiculous that the bounty should be paid for exported tops only; and I cannot conceive why it was done. There seems to be no reason why we should not manufacture in Australia all the tops required for Australian mills. I should be very glad if the Minister could see his way clear to introduce a short measure of one clause to get rid of the word ""exported"" from the existing Bounties Act. It is an anomaly that has crept in in some way, and is doing serious harm. Its removal would be a simple matter, and do a great deal of good. be unanimous in passing a Bill to remove it. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I think so, too, because it is such an absurdity. bounty available been secured? Sir' WILLIAM LYNE I believe so, At any rate, the export of tops to Japan last year by Mr Hughes was very heavy. I am very glad the Minister has brought in a Bill to give bounties on paraffin wax and Australian shale oil. He was at the Commonwealth Oil Corporation's works when I was there, and although he made no promise at the time, I have no doubt that what he saw and heard in that neighbourhood impressed him considerably. A number of people object to the imposition of a duty, because they think it would raise the price. That may be so, but I do not think it would. The only other thing the Minister can do is to propose a bounty. The only fault I have to find with his proposition is that it extends only to 30th June, 1913. Still, what he proposes will help our industry, and a very great industry it is. We have not only the Commonwealth Oil Corporation's shale works in the mountains of New South Wales, but there is shale in Tasmania, and, I think, in almost every State. We require a solid bounty to develop these deposits and insure that those who undertake the work shall be able to compete with the Standard Oil Company,",20,Tudor

VVe could only hold it because it. was not properly marked, but I put the company lo the trouble and expense of properly marking everything before it was landed. I think I am safe in saying that nearly a million pounds has been spent by the Commonwealth Oil Corporation alone in tlieir shale works, and I suppose what they have spent comes to more than has been spent in all the other places put together. I do not want to see the undertaking fail. A failure of that sort would do great injury to Australia, and discourage the establishment of other works hereafter. public in England who invest their money want a proper return for it, and I think this Bill will enable them in some degree to get a return by assisting the company to develop their works properly. I would again urge the Minister to bring in a measure to remove the export provision relating to wool tops iu the existing Act, and give the industry a fillip in New South Wales and Australia generally. tically two-thirds of the employees of the Commonwealth Oil Corporation are in my electorate. several not quite accurate statements were made regarding them, and also regarding Messrs.

Many of the items that fhe honourable member mixed up were really not relevant to the question. For instance, the honourable member gave the production of coke at 20,000 tons per year, but that coke should never be reckoned at all in connection with the production of shale. The Commonwealth Oil Corporation has a coal mine as well as a shale mine, and the production of coke from shale is quite a different matter from the production of coke from coal. The residue, after everything has been extracted from the shale, is a coke, but it is a pecuThe liar kind of coke, and I do not think the amount produced runs to more than about 200 tons per year. The coke produced .'rom shale is, however, very valuable. About six months ago it was on the market, and brought about £ 1 4 a ton. It is very rich in carbon, and is used mostly for the manufacture of carbons for electric lighting purposes. I think it carries go per cent, of carbon. It is, therefore, a very different article from the coke produced from coal. The 20,000 tons of coke to which the honourable member for Cook referred is produced from the coal During last night's discussion mine, and is bought for the most part by the Cobar Company and by I-Ioskins Limited for smelting purposes. It has, therefore, nothing to do with the shale question at all. I can pardon the honourable member's ignorance, because whoever was responsible for the article from which he quoted had the coke question so mixed up with the oil and shale business that a stranger, not knowing the industry, would naturally fall into the mistake. So far as I am concerned, the interests of the company are secondary to the interests of ihe employees in the industry. When the honourable member for Cook spoke about not having the facts regarding the amount of Nearly all the branches capital invested, I thought it would not be amiss to place before the House a statement showing the amount of money that ihe company had invested up to 28th August, The figures were supplied to me by a prominent official in the company, and can, I think, be verified on reference to the proper quarter in New South Wales.

The former idea of the Government, as outlined by the Minister when the deputation waited on him in August last, was to give a bounty of £10,000 extending over a period of five years. If the company earned the whole of the bounty under that proposal it would get an amount equal only to about .75 per cent, on its capital outlay. I do not think that its and once since, and have been informed present position justifies the proposal of the that the ruling rates of wages have been honourable member for Cook for the nationalization of the industry. If there were a great deal in it, no doubt the New South Wales Government would have been there before us. The land of the company is held under special lease from the State. The figures whicli I have given show that the bounty will not be of much concern to the Commonwealth Oil Corporation; but there are other companies which it may assist, and from the national point of view the oil industry should be encouraged. At Murrurundi, in die Robertson electorate, there is a company which will probably be soon in as good a position to earn the bounty as is the Commonwealth Oil Corporation. The honourable member for Cook stated that the Commonwealth Oil Corporation had been paying good wages. Its relations with its employees have not always been as satisfactory as they are now. For nine months the men connected with the Newnes portion of the work were on strike, during which time they averaged only 2s. iod. per man per week. It was then seen that it would be better for the employers and employees to have a conference, and a voluntary Wages Board was constituted, which, after sitting for twelve or fourteen weeks, drew up an award, which was registered in the New South Wales Industrial Disputes Court, and has since worked fairly well for both parties. The shale miners in the Wolgan Valley number about 150, and the coal miners there about 80. The former averaged, for a period of three months, ending some time in August last,' iSs. 4d. a day, which is not an excessive wage if account be taken of the fact that the men are out of touch with civilization, and working on a seam varying in height from 1 ft. 10 in. to 4 feet. The coal miners average about 12s. gd. a day, and the mechanics about ns. 6d. a day. Mr Cann. The award covers also the employment of those connected with the coke ovens and £340,416; other branches of the work. It was for a term of two years, and has about twelve months to run, being terminable by either side on three months' notice. I am glad that the Government has inserted in the Bill the provision that the bounty shall be paid only if the conditions of labour are satisfactory. At Hartley, about 40 miles from Newnes, some 100 men aie employed in connection with the refineries. I have been through that portion of my electorate twice, once during the electoral campaign satisfactory. At Airlie and Torbane, in the Macquarie electorate, the men are working under an award arranged by a member of this House and a member of another place, and it, too, is satisfactory. I admire the action of Mr Carmichael, the miners' representative, who, after fighting the company determinedly for nine months to get fair conditions for the men, came here to make representations to the Government with a view to assisting the company to get a bounty. His action showed that he is able to see both sides of the picture. It is not the desire of the men that the company should be killed by the competition of the Standard Oil Trust, or of the oil imported from Borneo. The Government cannot afford to allow the oil industry to be killed. From a defence point of view it is almost as important as the iron industry. Therefore, Parliament should be prepared to make some sacrifices on its behalf. If £50,000 will establish it, I shall be well pleased. three years are up we shall have an application for the continuation of the bounty. be necessary, but that if application is made the matter will be considered on its merits. I wish it to be understood that the bounty will not go wholly to the company working in my electorate. There are extensive shale deposits in other electorates, and I hope that bounty will soon be earned by working them.

84,Dr. Carty Salmon,"Such a findpeople of that country. The honourable member for Franklin has said that in the matter of cheapness of production and effectiveness in use, no comparison can be made between oil obtained from wells and that obtained from shale. I quite agree with him, but we are being asked at present to deal with something tangible-to deal with something which we know exists, not merely in one part of Australia, but in different parts of it. We are not asked to agree to the payment of a bounty in respect of a commodity which is produced by only one State. Deposits of oil-bearing shale have been found in several of the States, and have been worked up to a certain point, which has been determined by outside competition. Competition from abroad is so keen that it has been found imfossible for those who have invested their capital and labour in the enterprise to hold their own against it, for it is that of men who are determined to put the local industry out of the market by undercutting. In the circumstances, the bounty system can be adopted with advantage, and neither a Free Trader nor a Protectionist need offer any excuse for supporting it. I am pleased to observe that in clause 6 the Ministry have provided for the observance of industrial conditions on the part of those who secure the bounty which should accompany every grant of Government assistance to an industry. I would remind the House that such conditions are by no means new. They were introduced in the Bounties Act of 1907, which was brought in by the Deakin Administration, in which it was provided thatEvery grower or producer who claims bounty under this Act shall specify the rates of wages paid in respect of the labour employed by him, other than the labour of members of bis family, in growing or producing the goods, and the Minister, if be is of opinion that the rates so paid are below the standard rates paid in the place or district in which the goods are grown or produced, may withhold the whole OT any part of the bounty payable. The Government in this case have elaborated that provision, and have brought it into harmony with the new conditions, for which they are responsible. principle, however, in each case is the same, and it is one which I have always contended should be observed in connection with every grant of assistance by the Commonwealth to an industry or body of men. Save for the one drawback to which I have referred-the smallness of the amounts payable every year-this Bill is one that Dr. Carty Salmon. ought readily to be adopted, and I can only express the hope that its success will be so immediate and so pronounced that the Government will be encouraged to offer still greater inducements to other investors to open up new areas with a view to participating in the encouragement thus offered by the Commonwealth. It will be 'futile for us to pass a measure of this character and to expect it to enable the local industry tc compete on anything like equal terms with other businesses of the same description which have already been established, unless we can bring them up to something like the same level. In addition to asking our own people to compete against those abroad who are employing all sorts of labour, and working under conditions which, happily, do not obtain in Australia, we are calling on the local industry to observe other conditions which are far more expensive than those prevailing in other parts of the world. In those circumstances we are entitled to give them that which, after all, is only their just due. We are entitled to give them such monetary assistance as will place them on something like an equal competitive basis with their trade antagonists, and that can be done only by enlarging the nnancial scope of the measure. I hope that the success of this short and somewhat timid step taken by the Government will be such as will encourage them to offer a very much larger sum for distribution amongst those who will provide in Australia what is really the life-blood of modern industry. I wish to place briefly on record the reasons why I intend to support this measure. In the first place, I shall do so because I am a strong Protectionist, and believe that we ought to encourage our own industries'. I look upon this as one of the most important industries in the Commonwealth that we should assist, and for the 'reasons that have been advanced by other speakers I shall feel justified in voting for the Bill. There are only two courses open to us. We have either to place a duty on kerosene oil, or to assist the industry by means of a The bounty. When we recollect that we are producing only one-sixtieth of the kerosene consumed in Australia, we must recognise that it would be wrong to place a duty on that commodity, for it would mean that the people would be called upon to pay for it more than they ought reasonably to be asked to pay. By means of the bounty system, however, we can encourage the in-",24,Tudor
85,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [11.56],"dustry, until, perhaps, a time will arrive when the supply of locally-produced oil will be such as would justify us in imposing a duty calculated to prevent monopolies in other parts of the world, such as the Standard Oil Company, from competing with and crippling our own enterprise. VVe all know that that particular monopoly stops at nought in order to achieve its object, and unless in the future we are prepared to protect our industry, we shall find it unable to compete with that Trust. Whilst the Standard Oil Company has a monopoly of a market it can charge high prices for its oil, but while competing with a local industry it is prepared to place its oils on the market at a very low price. In these circumstances, therefore, it will be necessary for this Parliament later on to go even furtiier than it now proposes. As to the proposed bounty on paraffin wax locally produced, I do not feel justified in supporting such a proposition, in view of the statement made this morning by the honourable member for Moreton that we have already imposed a duty of 33 per cent, on that article. If that statement be correct, then the better course for us to pursue would be to divert the money now proposed to be paid by way of bounty on the production of paraffin wax to the bounty on kerosene oil. It is hardly right, in my opinion, that there bonus. The net loss would be only should be both a duty and a bounty; and I think that if the suggestion I have made were acted upon, it would assist the kerosene industry to a very much larger extent with the small amount of money available. s member speaking of kerosene or crude oil ? refined oil. We can quite see how it happens that so much has been said about one particular company; it is because this company has spent a very large amount of capital in New South Wales, while no other has developed to any extent. We are told, however, that, in the near future, in Tasmania and elsewhere, shale deposits will be developed, so that this measure does not apply entirely to the one company. should be sorry if it were the intention that order to justify the vote I intend to this money should all go to the one corporagive. tion, because this is a question which should be approached from an Australian point of view, with the idea of developing the industry throughout the Commonwealth. If the money voted should prove to be insufficient I should be one to support an increase ; and my hope is that many may participate in the bounty. Much criticism was expended on the action of the honourable member for Cook in producing a balance sheet last night, but, although I may not agree with the honourable member's methods, I desire to give him credit for taking the trouble to sift his information, and lay it before honourable members. Whether we agree with the honourable member or not, we ought to recognise that he is endeavouring to fulfil his duty as a representative. However, although he set out to prove, apparently, that this company was in a flourishing position, the state of affairs he disclosed as he went on was quite the reverse, and convinced me, even more strongly than before, of the necessity for a bounty. The honourable member showed, according to his balance-sheet, that this company has expended £205,600, while the income has been £92,012, disclosing a loss of _£i 1.3,588 He told us that the company expected to double their income within the vear, which would then mean a loss of £21,576, and he asked whether we were justified in granting a bonus to an industry in such a position that, even with the whole of the bounty, it would not be able to make ends meet. The honourable member, however, only convinced me, even on his figures -thoug h they were not authentic-that this industry has a chance even with the small £21,576, but the honourable member forgot that £10,000 is to be divided during the remainder of tlie year, which would reduce the loss to £11,000 odd, and that in the following year the bonus would amount to the' honourable ,£20,000, provided, of course, no other companies came into existence. If a company can double its turnover, the expenses of production are considerably reduced, and it may be thus converted into a paying concern; and if that result can be attained, it will be of considerable benefit to Australia from, every point of view. If we produce the whole of the oil that we consume, it means employment for thousands. We realize the necessity for population; and in what better way can we encourage it than by establishing flourishing industries ?

88,Mr Groom (Darling Downs) [12.5],"According to a special report, issued in Jul)', Then it must be remembered that we have 1907, of a Conference of the State agricultural experts and containing other information, it was found that the cost of manufacture, owing mainly to the higher wage rate, had militated against the industry in Australia, and that there were certain temporary difficulties to be met with at the outset. For instance, the increased cost of manufacture, including initial difficulties, the lower selling price until the commodity is favourably known, and extra trade expenses diminishing yearly, represents a temporary disadvantage of 4d. per lb., but the permanent disadvantages will be only i^d. per lb. As against this disadvantage, however, there is an advantage of 2§d. per lb., owing to the saving of cost in scouring, drying, and packing in one operation; the increased value of the produce due to the same cause; saving in freight, commission, middleman's profit; and the continental comber's profit. It was further pointed out that Australian tops can be produced very much cheaper than the tops could be imported, and that the cost of making worsted yarn was considerably less than the cost of importing yarn of the same quality. The report further stated that if markets were found in Japan and the East the advantages to which I have already referred would be altered in favour of the local manufacturer. That is exactly what is now being founda favorable market in the East. I mention these facts so that honourable members may know where to acquire the information available on the question. I have always advocated bounties when I felt there could be established industries natural to this continent; and I am heartily in favour of the principle. This industry is absolutely vital to most of the producing industries of Australia; more and more oil is coming into use in all directions. However, the question has been sufficiently argued, and I have no desire to delay the measure. No doubt improvements could be effected, the Bill not being so generous or so well framed as we could desire; but, inasmuch as it is an instalment of a principle in which I concur, I shall support the second reading. 1 regard this oil industry from a purely member for Hunter, it appears that, if the Australian stand-point. a self-contained nation as far as possible; pany, it will just be about able to pay its and, having the raw material, we should way, and that is not a very hopeful proendeavour to produce all the finished prospect; indeed, it is rather a doleful outducts we require for our own consumption. look for those other companies whicb are lo compete with the largest and most powerful combine in the world, and that it is necessary for the Government to stand behind the industry in order to see that it gets a fair deal. I am, therefore, prepared to assist the industry to any extent, with a view to enabling those engaged in it to compete with the American trust. The honourable member for Hunter says he is not prepared to support a bonus on paraffin wax, because there is at present a protective duty; but, in my opinion, both bounty and duty are necessary. The American trust is using this continent as a dumping ground for paraffin wax, notwithstanding the duty of 33 per cent. This wax 1 is a by-product of the oil industry; and if they can kill the trade in this commodity they can kill the whole industry. duty ! crease the duty, but that is not the question now before us. Our ultimate aim and object, as soon as we produce sufficient oil for our own requirements, should be drastic steps to exclude American oil. There is a large amount of paraffin wax produced here; and it is only right to give a bonus. I may point out that the particular company so much referred to has all its engines and rolling-stock made locally, and employs all the Australian labour possible, and under the circumstances I am quite prepared to vote for the measure. I am strongly in favour of a bounty in preference to a duty on oil, but my ideas on the subject have been considerably shaken by some of the speeches made in favour of the measure. I infinitely prefer a bounty to a heavy duty,but there seems to be an idea that as soon as the industry overtakes the local consumption there must be a high duty. The policy has hitherto been to impose high duties in order to encourage and assist industries, so that they may be able to compete with outside manufacturers. I have seen for some time that our choice lies between a bounty on oil and a duty; and, as I say, I prefer the bounty.

It seems that we have very little information as to the position of the companies concerned, or as to the necessity for the bounty. strongly opposed to a duty on oil. It would be absolutely a class duty, falling almost wholly on the people of the country districts, and on the very poor in the cities. As the bounty is the less of two .evils, I suppose it is better to let the Bill go, but I think the prospects of the bounty are more doleful and less hopeful than in the case of any other bounty ever granted by the Federal Parliament. manian mines ? mines were started, and would continue to work whether tlie bounty was granted or no; but they, like all other companies, would do tlieir best to get their "" cut "" at the bounty. I hope that if the paraffin wax industry is to receive a share of the bounty, the question of a 33 per cent, duty will, be reconsidered. I should like to see the bounty, if given at all, given wholly on the oil production, because the paraffin wax industry ought to stand on its own merits, with a protection of one-third. I support the measure, and commend the Minister of Trade and Customs for introducing it. I cannot follow the pessimistic strain of the honourable member for Franklin. No doubt his Free Trade proclivities led him in that direction. As an exceptionally strong Protectionist, I believe in giving bounties where we can do so to help industries along, and where a high Protective duty will help them still further, I am prepared to impose it as well. The honourable member for Laanecoorie seemed ' a little doubtful this morning about the Protectionist professions of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and also, I presume, of other members sitting on this side. I believe I am safe in saying that, whatever their fiscal faith may have been prior to the last elections, all the members on this side of the House have been returned as new Protectionists. I was delighted to hear the honourable member say that he endorsed every word of clause 6, which provides that the bounty shall be granted only to those who pay proper rates of wages and provide reasonable conditions of labour. clause is the essence of the new Protection [202] idea, and in granting any assistance, A great deal more consideration whether through the Customs or by means of bounties, I take it that we must insist upon the payment of proper rates of wages and the provision of proper conditions of work. It is no doubt true, as the honorI am, however, very able member said, that oil is playing a very important part in the development of our country industries. The honourable member said that, as the producers would be called upon to pay increased wages for their labour in the future, it would be absolutely necessary for them to go in for labour-saving machinery and appliances. I have already stated in this House that the inventor and the worker of this country have helped as much as the man upon the land to develop our rural industries. Wherever they can do so, the farmers and producers are employing labour-saving machinery and appliances. Suction gas, and other things, are coming to the rescue of the man on the land, and already a great deal of money has been saved to him. He is doing very well, and I think he can afford to pay reasonable wages to those who work for him. The honourable member for Moreton seems to object to the proposed bounty on paraffin wax, because the dairying industry uses the article considerably. When the wood of which the butter boxes are made is likely to give the butter an odour, the practice is to line them with paraffin wax, which is an odourless material, and helps to preserve the butter in its transit to the markets of the world. I do not think the granting of a bounty on the production of paraffin wax in Australia will be in any way inimical to the dairying industry. be. help the industry, but the honourable member seemed to be somewhat opposed to it.

I heartily endorse the sentiment of the honourable "" member for Balaclava, the honourable member for Moreton, and others, that it would be well worth the while of the Government to spend considerable sums in an endeavour to strike an oil well, or develop our oil resources.

One reason why I support the measure lies in the fact that we have to import 20,000,000 gallons of kerosene per annum from a quarter which we do not love too much. We talk of the gteat Standard Oil Combine, but that practically means one man in America, who, almost by a stroke of his pen, can fix the price of kerosene for the world. He is, I believe, making £7,500,000 every year for himself out of oil alone. It is very wrong that this or any other country should be practically subject to the dictation of one individual so far as the price of the country districts not only is kerosene its oil is concerned, oil being a commodity so much used in the houses of the poorer classes of the community. Even £500,000 would not be too much for this Parliament to vote in order to discover oil wells in Australia, and make this a self-contained country in respect of that useful product. bounty can do, let me mention the action of the Victorian Government in giving a bounty for the production of butter. gave such a wonderful fillip to the industry that this is to-day the greatest butter-producing Stale in the Commonwealth.

T Whether that was so or not, it undoubtedly had the effect I have indicated, and I am glad to know that the other States are developing their butter industry also, although I admit that some of them are doing it without bounties. Another reason why I support the Bill is that in developing industries of this kind we are giving play to the intelligence and investigation of our chemists. heaps of riches to-day from the discoveries made by her chemists in the matter of by-products from various industries. Mount Lyell Company in Tasmania is producing numbers of by-products, and I can also instance the by-products from the chlorination works in various States, giving employment to thousands of people, and enriching the country. If we give our chemists full play in the oil and shale industries we shall be able to develop along the lines followed in Germany and other countries. This measure, therefore, meets with my heartiest support. Another consideration that compels my support is that both emoloyers and employees have come Mr Fenton. forward, and made out an exceptionally good case. Where we find that happy combination of employer and employ^ presenting a good case to the House, either for protective duties or for bounties, I shall lend a listening ear to their representations, and will at all times give my hearty support to any measure that will lead to the development of our great resources. As a supporter of the scheme of bounties introduced by the previous Deakin Government, I give my hearty adhesion to this measure. I believe the product dealt with warrants encouragement in this way. In widely used as an illuminant, but throughout the agricultural areas oil of different kinds, but particularly kerosene, is being more and more widely employed for power purposes. The farmers, as the honourable member for Maribyrnong said, are constantly supplying themselves with new As an illustration of what a labour-saving machinery, and the fuel used is mostly kerosene. I heartily endorse the proposal to grant a bounty, but I think It the amount provided is not sufficient. The Minister of Trade and Customs showed that we are importing about 20,000,000 gallons of kerosene per annum. The value of the imports in 1.906 was £439,000, and rose in 1909 to £630,000, showing a steady increase, due, I presume, to the increased use of kerosene owing to our great commercial progress. Eveni f the whole of the bounty proposed is mopped up by the local companies in the production of kerosene, we shall then only decrease our importations by about onetwentieth. The amount is therefore altogether too small. Even in the second year, if the whole of the bounty is earned, we Germany is drawing shall be able to reduce our importations only by one-tenth. ber mean that the total amount offered is too small? portations amount to £630,000 worth per annum. One company in New Soutli Wales has already invested capital to the extent of £1,000,000. To grant a bounty of £10,000 for one year, and twice the amount for the two succeeding years, does not seem to me sufficient encouragement to an industry which, if reasonably treated, would reach substantial proportions.",28,Tudor
