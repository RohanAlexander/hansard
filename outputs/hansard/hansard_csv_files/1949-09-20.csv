Doubtless he is aware of the many important effects which the decision to devalue the currency will have, notably cn the prices of petroland tobacco which Australia imports from the United -States of America and which carry , a high rate of excise. As the prices of those goods will inevitably increase unless action is taken by the Government, will the right honourable gentleman consider redwing the duties on them-if the Cabinet has not already decided to do so-^in order that prices charged to the public may remain unchanged? dollar imports will have to be examined, Tuesday, SO September, 1949.",7,Setup

5,Mr Chifley,"The whole aspect offirst of all by the inter-departmental coma middle course involving some appreciamittee on dollar imports, which is considering the matter now, then by a Cabinet sub-committee, and finally by Cabinet itself. I am unable to give the honourable member any indication, or to offer any hope, of action being along the lines that he has indicated. All that I can say to him now is that the whole matter of dollar imports is being examined, including the issue of import licences and the collection of customs and excise dnities. I do not know whether that examination can be completed within the next week or so. As soon as I am in a position to make a statement concerning the matter, I shall do so. However, I do not want the honourable member to indulge undue hopes that all dollar imports which might be affected by the devaluation of the currency will be the subject of governmental action to prevent increases of price, or that the Government will pay subsidies to obviate such increases. As I have said, all aspects of the matter will be thoroughly examined. I repeat that the position has not yet been discussed by Cabinet. Later: Minister and Treasurer) -by leave-As honourable members are aware, the United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps, announced in a broadcast made in London on Sunday night, that is at 6.15 on Monday morning Canberra time, that the United Kingdom Government had decided to devalue the £1 sterling in terms of the United States dollar. .The new rate fixed by the United Kingdom Government is 2.80 dollars to the £1 sterling. I was informed by Mr Attlee at the week-end of the United Kingdom Government's decision. It was then necessary to reach an immediate decision concerning the rate of exchange to he fixed for the Australian £1 in the light of the new sterling-dollar rate. Australia clearly could not maintain the former rates of exchange with hoth the £1 sterling and the dollar. The choices open were to maintain the existing relationship with the dollar and to appreciate against sterling, to maintain the existing relationship with sterling and to depreciate against the dollar, or to adopt tion against sterling together with some depreciation against the dollar. After careful consideration of all the circumstances, it was decided to maintain the existing relationship between the £1 Austaken tralian and the £1 sterling, that is, the rate of £125 Australian to £100 sterling. This, of course, involved the consequential decision that the £1 Australian should be devalued in terms of the United States dollar iby the same proportion as the £1 sterling, producing a new rate of 2.24 dollars to the £1 Australian. The International Monetary Fund was con-, suited and expressed agreement. In order that there should be no period of uncertainty as to the action Australia would take in this important matter, I announced this decision in a broadcast at 6.45 on Monday morning. I also arranged for the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to make a statement for the guidance of hanks and the public generally. For the information of honourable members, I ' am circulating a transcript of the Chancellor's broadcast, and also the texts of my own statement and that made by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. The decision of the Government means that there will be no change in the exchange basis of our trading relationships with the United Kingdom, our most important export market. The proceeds in Australian currency received by exporters to the United Kingdom will not be reduced as a result of the exchange movements which have taken place. Neither will these movements reduce the price in Australia of goods imported from the United Kingdom. The Government had in mind the difficulties which would have been created for both export industries and industries producing for the local market if the existing exchange relationship with sterling had ibeen altered. To have retained the former par value with the dollar would have meant that the Australian £1 would have been appreciated against sterling, and possibly against the currencies of a number of other countries in which we have important markets. This would have been to the disadvantage of exporters, and it would also have created the possibility that Australian industries would he under-sold in their home market. If a mid-way course had",10,Currency Exchange Rate
6,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Primebeen taken, the same possibilities would have been present, even though to a lesser degree. At the same time the Government recognized that to devalue our currency against the dollar to the same extent as sterling would tend in some respects to increase local costs. At the new rate of 2.24 dollars to the Australian £1 the Australian currency cost of all imported goods which have to be paid for in United States dollars will be increased. Because of the need to economize in dollar expenditure, imports from the United States have had to be severely restricted and the American an increase of the Australian currency goods we are now importing have to conform to a high standard of essentiality. to £15 9s. lOd. a fine ounce. This price These goods, will now cost more in terms of our own currency, and this higher cost must ultimately be reflected, at least in part, in higher prices for some of the goods we produce. It is, of course, possible that the prices of American goods may fall. However, although the goods we import from the United States are important to our economy they do not represent a high proportion of our total imports. The United Kingdom itself supplies us with roughly one-half of our total sarily brings other changes in its train import requirements, and, as many other countries both inside and outside the sterling areaare likely to keep in step with sterling, there will be no immediate increase of costs over by far the greater part of our import trade. The increased cost of dollar imports will call for some adjustment of import licences for dollar goods which are normally expressed in terms of Australian currency. This matter is being urgently examined and an announcement will be made as soon as possible by my colleague the Minister for Trade and Customs. On the other hand, the new rate should provide some stimulus to our export sales in the United States. Wool is the most important item in our devaluation in itself does not provide any export trade with the United States and automatic solution of the dollar difficulties the cheapening of wool in terms of the of the United Kingdom and the rest of the United States dollar may be expected to sterling area. What it does is provide produce some increase of American conan opportunity and incentive for sterling sumption and some increase of the activity area exports to the dollar area. Its of American buyers at our wool auctions. effectiveness will depend on how all of us The change in the exchange rate does, of in the sterling countries respond to the course, mean that, at current auction opportunities offered by the new situation. prices, a greater volume of wool will have I am confident that, provided we conto be shipped to the United States to earn tinue to act together in peace as we did Mr Ohifley. the same amount of dollars. Heavier buying by American mills could, however, increase our total dollar earnings from wool. Other Australian exports to the United States may also be stimulated. Australian producers and merchants will be making their best contribution towards meeting our dollar difficulties if they take advantage of the improvement in their competitive position resulting from the depreciation against the dollar and sell as much as possible in dollar markets. The new dollar rate also has produced price of gold from £10 15s. 3d. a fine ounce increase will improve the position of gold producers and to the extent that the additional incentive provided by the higher local price calls forth increased production of gold, some contribution will also be made to our dollar earnings. The alteration of the exchange rate with the dollar does not, of course, affect the dollar price of gold which remains at 35 dollars a fine ounce. The movement of a major international currency like sterling necesthroughout the world. The Government did not, of course, have any advance information about the steps to be taken by countries other than the United Kingdom. SinceI made my broadcast announcement, official advice has been received that South Africa, New Zealand, India, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Egypt have also decided to maintain the former relationship of their currencies with sterling and to depreciate in terms of United States dollars to the same extent as sterling. A number of other changes have been reported in the news services, but official confirmation has not yet been received. In conclusion, I emphasize that ia war, the British Commonwealth of Nations will not only retain, but also increase, its prestige in world leadership for the security and welfare of its peoples.

He has asked me a series of questions about Theodoras Van Hoof, and it is probable that he has read my explanation of the reasons why that man has remained in Pentridge prison, in Melbourne, since December, 1948. Van Hoof was a stowaway, and he was arrested after a considerable period. He was charged with being a prohibited immigrant, hut the case was dismissed on a technicality, because the interpreter, who gave him a dictation test in Rumanian, did not himself know that language.

I refer to such industries as the timber industry, which produce commodities that are urgently needed for house construction. been and is still the intention of the Government to spread new Australian labour over all essential industries. It has worked out that the iron and steel industry has been the quickest in providing accommodation, in co-operating and in making vacancies. That is why so many new Australians have been and are still being absorbed into the industry. We have paid attention to other groups of industries associated with housing in order to help both State and Commonwealth housing projects. Yesterday, 60 new arrivals started work in timber mills in Sydney and its suburbs. About 100 men started to-day in eighteen brick, tile and pottery works adjacent to Sydney.

""WHEAT. ter for Commerce and Agriculture whether the home-consumption price of Australian wheat is 6s. 8d. a bushel as at port of export? Is the sea freight of wheat from the mainland to Tasmania made a charge against the wheat-growers ? If it is, does the additional charge comply with the conditions under which the home-consumption price of wheat is fixed? tion price of wheat, which is the guaranteed price and the price that is fixed by the .State commissioners in each State of Australia, is now 6s. 8d. a bushel. Under the terms of the stabilization plan, the price that is fixed is the guaranteed price f.o.b. at export ports in each of the six Australian States. Technically, and possibly physically, a port in Tasmania is an export port for the purposes of the plan. In those circumstances, the price at which the Australian Wheat Board should sell wheat in Tasmania is 6s. 8d. a bushel, and tentative instructions to that effect have been issued to the board by the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. One feature of the stabilization plan was that each of the six Australian State parliaments should pass legislation complementary to the Commonwealth legislation. Under the provisions of the Tasmanian legislation, the Tasmanian Government has fixed the price of wheat in that State at 6s. 8d. a bushel. Therefore, an obligation is imposed upon the Australian Wheat Board to ensure that wheat shall be available for sale in Tasmania at.6s. 8d. a bushel. T point out to the honourable member for Wimmera that Tasmanian wheat-growers who deliver wheat to the Australian Wheat Board are entitled to share in the higher prices that are obtained for export wheat notwithstanding that, except in a very few instances and in respect of very small quantities they do not export wheat. The Australian Government considers that, in view of the benefits that the Commonwealth wheat stabilization plan confers upon Australian wheat growers generally, it is justified in requiring them to pay the freight charges on wheat that is transported from Williamstown to Tasmania. When the charges are spread over the whole of the Australian wheat crop, the sum involved is less than a farthing a bushel. Surely that is a small price for the wheat-growers to pay to obtain the advantages of a system under which every State in Australia fixes the home-consumption price of wheat within the State and the Australian Government guarantees the payment of a price, based upon costs of production, in respect of the portion of the crop that is consumed in",16,Electoral General Election Political Broadcasts Dat E Of Poll

As soon as the information is available it will be furnished to the honourable member. the Minister representing the Minister for Health. Isi t true, as was stated in a recent issue of the Sydney Bim, that Dr. Reilly, who was recently appointed to succeed Dr. Webster as Government Medical Officer at Tennant Creek, has resigned his position on the ground that he is unable to adjust himself to the policy of the Department of Health in the Northern Territory? What are Dr. Reilly's objections to the department's policy? Are they the same as those of Dr. Webster, who was suddenly discharged after he had criticized the Government's medical policy? How many other medical officers have resigned or have been removed or transferred from the service of the department in the Northern Territory in the last three years? Dr. Reilly resigned his position as medical officer in the Department of Health. It is also true that his relations with the department were perfectly harmonious. The correspondence which has passed between Dr. Reilly and the department shows that their relations were amicable. There is nothing in it to suggest that DT. Reilly resigned because of bad feeling between the department and himself. I understand that he was appointed to his position temporarily and on the understanding that if he so desired he would be given the appointment of Chief Medical Officer in the Northern Territory. Dr. Reilly finally decided that he would prefer to go hack to private practice. Anticipating such a question as this, the Department of Health last week informed me that the correspondence on the suhject of Dr. Reilly's resignation shows that no bad feelings existed between him and the department. The honourable member has asked for information about the number of doctors who have resigned or have been discharged or, as he suggests, have been "" rail-roaded"" in some other way from the Health Department in the Northern Territory during the last three years. I shall endeavour to obtain the information for him. senting the Minister for Shipping and Fuel say whether the Government is aware that when Morinda is withdrawn from the service to Norfolk Island, that island will be deprived of shipping to Australia?

The article was published on Thursday, the 8th September, and it statesMr Chifley, as Treasurer, has produced a Lower Cost of Living Budget. He has resisted the tendency, tempting for political leaders, of making spectacular eleventh-hour concessions in an election year. This Bridget is an instrument of economic and social policy. The instrument is obviously to be used in .this case to under-pin social service programmes; to guarantee continued f u l l employment; to promote the policy of planning Australia's economic development. As this policy is one that has clearly come to stay-no t only in Australia, and not oniy as Labour policy-.the Budget is a sound one. Some may make the criticism that the Treasurer is budgeting for deficit. The answer has already been given; he is budgeting for a social sprvice policy. Deficits, if the rise in national income is maintained by increased production, become surpluses, and revenue excess must mean more tax reduction. The moral is: Increased production within .the working week w ill result in greater social security. That is, if budgeting of this kind continues. Details. When we examine the details it becomes clear why this an L.C.L. Budget. It reduces forms of taxation which inflate prices. Thusi t helps the individual to avoid higher living costs in some degree. It attacks the prices of commodities directly by, for example, freeing 400 items from primage; this again helps the individual, particularly that important representative of consumers, the housewife. Further, it indicates to the public that the real power to deal with the cost of living is in the hands of the Federal Government. It is an incentive Budget, because it encourages really enterprising business to be more enterprising. It does this by niaking concessions for ruinous to our economy, promised only investing new capital on new equipment. And this in turn ultimately favours the consumer: enterprising and prosperous industry always does. Concept of freedom. This Budget embodies the conception of setting the people free. It is an instrument which frees people from fear of social insecurity and from the menace of unemployment. A t the same time it extends freedom to industrial enterprise by liberating it from the restrictions of out-of-date and outmoded machinery. That is realist, and it is economically sound. It is sound because it gets down to bedrock and provides positive recipes for lower living costs. In short, it is a good Budget. It is good for the best of possible reasons; that is to say, for a truly national It must contribute stability and prosperity of all classes in Australia. Mr Fuller. costs give consumers greater buying power; business incentives provide them w i th more to buy. That is the opposite of an economic vicious circle. It helps to integrate all sections of the commumty into a cohesive social whole. It is a good Budget; an L.C.L. Budget. It is a great pity that more such articles are not published in the newspapers of Australia. The sound policy of the Labour Government has put the people of Australia on top of the world, and the future can he brighter still. Consider Australia to-day. There are jobs for all; there is money in everyone's pocket; there is freedom from fear of unemployment, sickness and age; there is hope for and faith in the future, and, despite the warcaused shortages, which are still with us, no one in his right mind would deny that businessmen, workers, farmers and housewives and all those who make up the great majority of the community are better off than ever before. Australia, in fact, is the envy of the world. Thus Labour has proved itself to the people. It is due, more than to any other single cause, to the policies begun by the late John Curtin and carriedon by his successor as Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Chifley), that Australia's position is so sound to-day. There is a story to remember. Let me touch on a few of the more important highlights of the Chifley Government's great achievements. Eirst, I wish briefly to touch on taxation. During the last general election campaign, the Prime Minister, knowing that overhasty and over-drastic tax cuts would be that he would ""make additional tax reductions as circumstances permit"". That promise has been faithfully kept without disturbance of the economy of this country. .Since the war this Government has made successive tax reductions which have amounted to £140,000,000 a year. This sound and honest policy will be pursued in the future as circumstances permit. Let us compare that procedure with the policy that our opponents preached prior to the last general election in 1946. Whilst on the one hand the leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Eadden) reason. offered to reduce taxes by a certain greatly to the future amount if the Australian Country party It serves all interests. Lower living : was' elected, on tlie otlier hand the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) promised even greater tax reductions if the Liberals -were, elected.. However the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) dealt honestly with the people, and they believed in him.. No government in the world haa done more for its ex-service men and women by way of 'repatriation than has this Government. Nowhere has more adequate provision been made for the sick and disabled and nowhere else in the world has a rehabilitation scheme comparable with our reconstruction training scheme been introduced. In no other eountry has the ire-establishment of ex-service men and women in industry been so smoothly accomplished as in Australia, assisted in. no small measure^ by our preference legislation and other helpful enactments. By our policy of full employment, and the establishment of the National Welfare Fund, from which social services costing about £100,000,000 annually are provided, Labour has brought social security into the realm of practical realization. Pensions and .benefits have been increased, in some instances to double and treble the amounts previously paid, whilst national health measures providing incalculable benefits for the community have been introduced. The Government is justly proud of its record with relation to the provision of social services. Indeed it is a record of which every Australian can be proud. Considerable prosperity is now enjoyed by those engaged in primary production. Although the Government does not claim credit for the high prices at present being obtained for our primary products overseas, it does claim credit for the passage of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act 1949, the organization of orderly marketing, and the subsidy systems. For the. first time, in our history primary producers are enjoying real security. I am convinced that never again will they entrust their destiny to the. Liberal and Australian Country parties, because the tories have failed them so miserably in the past. The election of a Liberal-Country party government would be. suicidal for the primary producers, and I am convinced that they 112] Budget. 1949 -50, 353 are: not: prepared, to commit political suicide. I shall review briefly the great advancement that has been made in this country in connection with our secondary industries since the Australian Labour party was elected to office. I could speak at great, length of improvements that have been effected in the electorate of HumethatI have the honour to represent, in this House. At least seventeen new industries have been established in that electorate since this Government came to office. In my home town of Tumut there is a box factory, a broom factory and the ladies' underwear factory of Dyomee Manufacturing Proprietary Limited: Those three factories alone provide employment for 111 people. In addition a number of timber mills are now operating in the Tumut district. These did not exist prior to this Government being elected to office. This expansion and development in my electorate is typical of the expansion that has taken place throughout Australia. To-day there are 10,000 more factories in this country than before the war, and the annual monthly total of persons inemployment has risen from 542,000 to 800,000. As honourable members know, unemployment figures have reached an all time low. Furthermore, thousands of jobs yet remain to be filled. However, in the dark and desperate days when this country was governed by parties now in opposition, thousands of people were forced to live on the dole. Only recently I had occasion to look at the relief scale that was issued in the 'thirties, when a man with a wife and seven children was paid only 22s. a week. In those days Australians were denied their birth right: to work and' live comfortably. No less than 750,000 bread-winners were out of work and, in many instances, homeless. Many farmers were in the grip of the financial octopus and unable to dispose of their produce. Thousands were literally starving, and many business men were forced into the bankruptcy courts. AlthoughI was in business at that time. I managed to escape that fate. AH of these things happened under the anti-Labour governments that controlled the destiny of this country for 21 out of the 23 years immediately prior to this Government assuming office during the dark days of war. The opponents of Labour have attempted to ridicule the submission that the soundness of Australia's economy and the general security of all sections of the and 1941 the number of wheat farms of community are due to Labour's administration. that this Government has had anything to do with bringing this state of affairs about sounds very unconvincing and hollow to people who remember the tragic years of financial and economic conscription under anti-Labour governments between ten and fifteen years ago. The criticism of honourable -members opposite of our economic stability is extraordinary also in view of the eulogies of Australian business men returning from abroad. Furthermore, overseas capital from both empire and non-empire countries, including the TJnited States of America, totalling approximately £140,000,000 has been invested in Australia since 1945, and farmers, of whom there are approximately 250,000 in this country, have paid off overdrafts amounting to almost £100,000,000 and are now owners of their properties in their own right. Prior to the war they were merely token owners, who were afraid of being sold up at any time. Although, prior to the war, home dwellers and business people were in chains both financially and economically, they are now free. In 1931, no fewer than 4,666 bankruptcies were registered in Australia. Scullin Government was in power. Government was in office, it was never in power. In 1939, there were 1,889 bankruptcies, and last year there were 331. That is an indication of our present economic security. Winston Churchill once said, ""What is physically possible should be financially possible"". That is Labour's financial attitude now, and it always will be. Thousands of farmers, home-dwellers and .business people who in pre-war years were financial conscripts and mortgagees who were paying high interests to financiers, enjoy freedom to-day. In 1935, a royal commission, the wheat and wool growers of Australia owed £288,000,000, on which they were paying £14,000,000 a year interest. Between 1930 and 1935, 20,000 farmers walked off their farms. Between 1933 over 20 acres in Australia decreased by Their refusal to recognize 6,625. Between 1935 and 1940 the number of employees in the dairying industry decreased by 18,000. Hundreds of farmers were forced to ask their bankers for permission to buy fertilizers, bags, spare parts, hay or chaff, or sheep or cattle. I know of many farmers who were afraid to be seen at a football match or a concert for fear of their banker finding out! Even in 1939-40 there were 290,000 in the workless army of the lost. Starved of purchasing power, people had to stand by while wheat, cattle, potatoes, fruit and coffee were being destroyed, burnt or dumped in the sea, while thousands on the earth died of starvation. What an awful picture of conditions under toryism! Factories, brickyards, timber mills and other businesses were closed down. Economic conscription was the tragic experience of wage and salary earners. TJnder anti-Labour governments, freedom was a mockery, yet to-day the supporters of the anti-Labour parties have the effrontery to talk of "" the good old days"" and of Labour taking away their freedom. The people of this country now enjoy a greater freedom than do the people of any other country. I say to honourable gentlemen opposite who preach that kind of "" tripe "" was when the that if they are not satisfied they should get out of this country. The truth is that thousands of people are enjoying economic freedom to-day for the first time in their lives. To deny that our organized marketing, guaranteed prices, contracts for the sale of our products overseas, reduction of interest rates, credit availability, fairer distribution of wealth, prices control, &c., have not helped materially to stabilize our economy is like a man who has recovered from a dread disease of long standing, denying that his doctor has had anything at all to do with his recovery.

I shall now touch briefly upon the assistance that has been given to the Mother Country by Australia. Apart from the ties of kinship, which are acknowledged by all of us, the Chifley Government has realized that the interests of Australia are bound up with the postwar recovery of Great Britain. The Government has given Great Britain all the assistance possible, including gifts of oountry successfully through the war and money that now amount to £45,000,000, after consulting the British Government regarding the forms of assistance that would prove to be most useful and timely. We have also made contributions to TJnrra and post-Unrra, including the International Children's Belief Fund which have amounted to £30,000,000. Further proof of the great prosperity of this country under Labour is provided by the magnitude of savings bank deposits, which are always a good indication of the degree of prosperity that is being enjoyed by the people. In 193S1939 saving bank deposits totalled £244,000,000. According to the latest figures that are available, the figure is now £714,219,000. As a result, we see homes going up in every country town and city of Australia. During the three pre-war years only 30 homes were built in the town of Tumut. Those were years when many men were unemployed. Bricks and mortar were plentiful, but people lacked the purchasing power to buy even a door knob, let alone to build a home. They could not even pay house rent. During the past two and a half years, however, 75 homes have been built in Tuumt. That is the answer to the members of the anti-Labour forces who sit in this Parliament. This Government is also bringing to Australia the people that we want. Our most urgent need is man-power. The remarkable success of the efforts of the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) in bringing migrants to Australia has been freely acknowledged by the political opponents of the Labour party and by the anti-Labour press. No fewer than 110,000 migrants are expected to arrive this year. enterprise shall not be killed and If this Government is returned to office, a depression can be avoided. I have no hesitation in saying that the poisonous propaganda that has been pumped out by the anti-Labour parties from one end of Australia to the other will have no effect upon the Australian people. Labour came into power in the dark days of the war, when our opponents were removed from office not by the votes of Labour men but by the votes of men who placed the interests of their country before politics and gave Labour the right to govern. Labour steered this young through the difficult days of the transitional period that followed. To-day there is greater prosperity in Australia than ever there has been before. The fight is over. The efforts of the anti-Labour parties, with all the wealth that they have at their disposal, will be of no avail. In the electorate of Hume there are three gentlemen who are paid £75 a week by the bankers to go round whispering among the people. The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN ( Mr Burke) -Order! The honourable gentleman's time is exhausted. honourable member for fiume ( Mr Puller) seemed to be whistling to keep up his courage when he spoke about the result of the next general election being a foregone conclusion.

The Minister for Health (Senator McKenna) also has attempted to justify the socialist pledge by stating that the Government intended to socialize only activities or concerns that, while they were conducted privately, were socially undesirable and were exploiters of the people. Who is to define what is socially undesirable ? the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) or the Parliament.

I always have the pleasure of following the honourable member for Hume in debates and I remember, on the last four occasions, his love and affection for the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies). I should like to draw his attention to what the Minister for Information has said about that right honourable gentleman. I refer to a very good article that appeared in the magazine section of the Melbourne Herald of the 13th August last. The article reads in partThere were many different kinds of public speakers, Mr Calwell said-Public life abounded with men of diverse talents who used different styles with which to appeal to their audiences. Mr Menzies is undoubtedly the finest active we have done. We have allocated political speaker in Australia, he said. Ee is always pleasant to listen to.

The article continuesPass Menzies and there are no really great figures in the Opposition. There is a testimonial from the Minister for Information to the Leader of the Opposition. The Minister might be accused of being biased on occasions, but I consider that in that instance he made a very fair criticism and expressed an opinion that is shared by all honourable members. Eor the honourable member for Hume to rise in his place and make the ridiculous statements that he did about the Leader of the Opposition ancl his lack of ability Leader of the Opposition did not have ability. honourable member to say so. I advise him to have a word with the Minister for Information, who will put him right. There has been much talk about the depression years. The honourable member for Hume brought that matter up again. We should get one thing straight. In the depression years a socialist Labour government happened to be in power. It could not be blamed for being the entire cause of the depression, but the people felt sary. The Lyons Government was elected to office and made such progress in coping with the depression that it was returned with increased majorities at subsequent elections. However, all this talk about blaming any one government or section of the people for the depression is quite unfounded. I turn now to the budget. Eirst, I desire to speak on a matter that I consider to he of national importance. I refer to the poor state of Australia's defences. What is the Government doing about the preparation of the country's defences? What is its defence policy? The Government's five-year defence plan has failed. Oabinet has allocated hundreds of millions of pounds for defence and then has said, "" Look at what £295,000,000 for defence."" The Government has budgeted for an expenditure of £60,000,000 on defence this year. In 1939, the last year prior to the outbreak of World War II . , the Lyons Government spent £35,000,000 on defence out of a total budget of just over £100,000,000, or about one-sixth of the current budget. The value of the £1 has dropped now to slightly more than half of its value in 1939. The defence expenditure in 1939 was a bona fide expenditure on our defence forces. At that time civilian staffs employed in connection with defence were of reasonable proportions and the cost of maintenance was insignificant compared with present levels. But whereas pre-war expenditure on defence was legitimately used for defence measures, to-day a huge amount is being spent on defence without any real value being obtained in return. I did not say that the That is the position now despite the fact that the world to-day faces the same trouble as it faced during the Munich crisis of 1938. It may be very comforting to imagine that war may not break out for another five or ten years. Some experts may think so, but in these uncertain and troublous times we have to be ready to meet an emergency to-morrow if necessary. The present situation in Europe is",27,Citiplet

79,Mr Howse,"I understood theextremely explosive. Before tie last war Nazi Germany confronted the world with the same set of circumstances as those with which Russia confronts it to-day. Stalin is Hitler's heir. He is the apostle of power politics. There is a distressing similarity in the attitude of Russia towards Yugoslavia and the German attitude to Czechoslovakia in the spring of 1938. It is the habit of European political circumstances to be repeated, and that is a fact that the Australian Government should keep well in mind. What is happening in Europe at the moment? What is the latest critical situation there ? Russia is very anxious to secure a naval base in Yugoslavia to enable the Russian fleet to be based in the Mediterranean. At the moment the straits of the Dardanelles are open to warships only in peace-time. If Russia had a naval base in Yugoslavia it would be able to move its Baltic fleet to the Mediterranean, base it on Yugoslavia and so threaten the lifeline between Europe and Australia. In the Ear East we are no longer an isolated country. Only a few days ago the press announced that Britain's latest jet plane would be able to leave Australia at 10 o'clock one morning and arrive in London at 10 o'clock the same morning. That sounds paradoxical, but it is another way of saying that the plane would fly at the speed at which the earth revolves. So distances by air have been reduced to nothing. We are surrounded by countries in which communism is now playing a more vital part than ever before. In the last two wars Australia was able to take plenty of time, or, at least, did take plenty of time, after the declaration of war, to train defence force, but each of the services its armed forces. There was no immediate threat to our country. But even during the last war, men were sent into action without adequate training because we employed the same training and mobilization methods as we used in World WarI . During the last war we trained our service personnel on the principles applying in 1939. We shall have no warning of the next war. The full fury of it will be upon us without any declaration of war by the enemy, because the atomic bomb has opened up a new and more terrifying kind of warfare. What .are our defence responsibilities not only as a Pacific power, but also as a nation which seeks to play its part among the nations of the world? First, our defence forces must be sufficient to defend our long coast line. We cannot expect Great Britain, or other alliedcountries, to support us directly because they will he busily occupied in their own spheres. We must be able to shoulder our full share of Empire defence. Clearly, Australia is not at present meeting its defence responsibilities even in the Pacific. The Government claims that we do not require a large defence force and it is acting on the idea that this country should primarily become the arsenal of the Empire. That involves the provision of factories, shipyards and stores to meet defence requirements. We are told that our second defence role will be to co-operate with Great Britain in developing atomic and guided weapons. How can we embark upon the rapid expansion of our industries without adequate supplies of coal? Indeed, we have not even the prospects of obtaining sufficient supplies of coal to meet our peace-time needs, let alone our needs in war-time. We are told that the substitute for coal is to be hydro-electric power to be generated under the Snowy Mountains scheme. But that scheme will be further delayed because of our inability during the present dollar crisis to obtain machinery from the United States of America. Therefore, the completion of that scheme must be a long way off. Australia cannot hope to become the arsenal of the Empire unless we have adequate trained defence forces to guard our own shores. Admittedly, our population is too small to provide a large must be compact and well equipped. At present, the Navy possesses only a handful of ships, whilst the army is far below strength, the regular army being 4,000 short of its modest target of enlistments and the militia forces 19,000 short. The Royal Australian Air Force has practically ceased to exist, because it possesses only two fighter squadrons, two bomber squadrons and three transport squadrons on an operational basis. Our defence reserves are a mere gesture. The Government claims that it has made the fighting forces attractive to recruits. It has glamorized the uniforms and raised the £100,000,000 let alone £700,000,000 which pay of members of the forces. However, the Prime Minister boasts can be found the fact remains that each arm of the to meet the recession he advertises so forces is lacking in. numbers and it is widely.

The budget discloses that the the end of the recent war our invariable disastrous agreement to sell wheat to experience has been that collections of tax New Zealand has cost the taxpayers, each year have exceeded collections in any including the wheat-growers, £7,500,000 previous year. That fact explodes the during the last five years. The Prime myth that the Treasurer is reducing Minister had been at pains to produce taxes.

Collections under Despite the the increase which the Treasurer himself sets out in the budget. We have heard a great deal of talk about television. Let us clear our minds on this subject. The Government proposes to establish a Government monopoly of television. This new development is of great importance and pays a vital part in modern warfare, whilst it has been developed to a great degree for commercial purposes in Great Britain and the TJnited States of America. Apparently, the fact has not penetrated the mind of this Socialist Government that the oost of conducting a television service even on a limited scale will be much greater than that of providing sound broadcasting. No doubt, in this matter the Prime Minister has been egged on by the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) who desires to make television a government monopoly. Therefore, the Government has decided to bear the whole of the cost of establishing this extremely expensive service without having any prospect of a reasonable financial return from licensing fees or any other source for at least two or three years. Consider the staggering losses incurred on the Postal Department's according to budget figures. These services will have to be increased four or five fold when the Prime Minister and his colleagues present themselves for the admiration of the Australian public on the television screen. The only possible reason for a government monopoly of television is that members of the Government themselves wish to monopolize the television screen. Television, under a government monopoly, will become a new deficit earner. Private industry is willing to share the cost of establishing television in this country. It should be permitted to do so on terms that will provide a reasonable return. The entry of private enterprise into the television field would be of great benefit to the public because the commercial stations would carry out experimental work at their own expense, and would give a very good service to the public. I should like to say a few words now about the effect of the sterling devaluation on primary producers. Here is something that requires an answer from the Government. The drastic devaluation of sterling area currencies shows the seriousness of Great Britain's financial position, but Australia is entitled to know-and I hope that the Prime Minister will provide this information-ho w the devaluation will affect the primary producer. Some primary producers may expect higher local prices for their products. In fact, the price of wool has already shown a slight upward move, hut poultry-farmers, dried fruit-growers and, to some degree, wheat-farmers, have to accept pegged prices for their products. On the other hand, they if ace sharply rising prices for many of the things that they require to maintain their properties in production. Those requirements are well known. They include wire netting, which has to he imported because of the inability of local manufacturers to meet local requirements, petrol, motor cars, certain types of farm machinery, particularly heavy tractors, and pest exterminators. The prices of all those commodities will be increased, thus inevitably forcing up production costs. Any increased return that the wheat-farmer may enjoy as the result of devaluation will be more than offset by the inevitable entertainment services heavily increased cost of the materials that he requires from the dollar area. It is the responsibility of the Government to provide some form of compensation for those increased costs, particularly where they have to be carried by the primary producer. I ask the Government for a clear statement of its intentions in this connection. Government administration costs are still increasing. The Treasurer estimates that this year the cost to the Australian taxpayer of the expanded administration will be approximately £28,000,000. Stated in plain terms, that is the current cost of bureaucracy. Only two years ago, the figure was slightly in excess of £15,000,000, so that administration costs have nearly doubled since 1945-46. Administration expenditure during the current year will be approximately six times the pre-war figure, and that, I consider, is one of the severest indictments of the Chifley Government's whole budget. The Government is showing a continued incapacity to bring ordinary principles of business management into departmental administration. The present cost of. living cannot readily be determined in relation to tbe pre-war level, but I suggest, as an approximate estimate, that the increased cost of living since 1939 is 60 per cent. On some items, of course, it is much greater, and on others it is less. In justifying this rise, the Government claims that the biggest increase has taken place in the price of clothing which is more than 100 per cent, dearer than it was in the June quarter of 1939. However, in the same period, the cost of government administration has increased by more than 600 per cent., so the Government has little cause for pride on that score. I come now to Australian trade with the United Kingdom. Much has been said by honourable memibers opposite about Australia's assistance to Great Britain. We are told continuously that Australia is pouring foodstuffs 'into the United Kingdom in ever-increasing quantities; but I remind the committee that Australia's prosperity in recent years is attriThese figures reveal two disturbing butable not to the Government but to the remarkably high prices received for our export commodities, mainly wool and wheat. The substantial payments that Australia is receiving to-day for its exports are due, with a few exceptions, to greatly increased prices and not to an increased volume of goods. The United Kingdom not only pays high prices for the few commodities that we are able to export, but also is the main market for our primary products. Britain has con1 tracted to take the entire Australian exportable surplus of many products including meat, dairy products, and eggs. It is,, also, I understand, the largest importer of Australian wool. Increased quantities of Australian, wheat have been going to the Homeland. However, a comparison with 1939 figures shows, that, considering the overall picture, Australia has failed miserably in its drive to provide the United Kingdom with essential foodstuffs. tedly, the value of our exports to the United Kingdom has increased but that, as I have said, is due to the high prices. Eor instance, the average value of Australia's exports to Great Britain in 1938 was £6,000,000 sterling a month. The average for the first nine months of 1948-49. was £12,800,000 sterling, an ifr. Bowse. increase of. 113 per oent. But. let us look at the other side of the picture.. Figures relating to the imports of food by the United Kingdom show conclusively that whilst the volume of goods received from other countries had increased, the quantity received from Australia has decreased alarmingly. I shall mention just a few figures to illustrate that point. In 1938 Australia sent 1,550,000 tons of wheat, to the United Kingdom. In 1948, the quantity was only 772,000 tons, a drop of 778,000 tons in this one item alone. Butter exports tell the same dismal story. They declined from 90,000 tons in 1938 to 73,000 tons in 1948, a drop of. 17,000 tons. Exports of meat fell from 198,000 tons in 1938 to 133,000 tons in 1948, a reduction of 65,000 tons. Therefore, all this proud boasting about .helping, the Motherland is somuch eyewash, particularly when we remember that both New Zealand and Argentina have actually increased their exports to Great Britain over the pre-war figures. trends. The first is that as the prices of wool and wheat fall, we shall be less able, out of export income, to maintain a high rate of consumer imports, or to pay for the essential import requirements of our expanding secondary indus^ tries. The second is that because,, for a long period under Labour administration, Australian industry has operated far below maximum capacity, pent-up demand in Australia has had to he satisr fied, at high cost, with imported goods that would normally have been available primary from domestic sources. In other words, the man on the land has to import a great many of his requirements at a very high price because they are not manufactured in Australia. Let us consider what has happened, in respect of wire netting, which isa commodity urgently required by the Australian farmers.. Because of the inadequacy of Australian supplies; wire netting has to. be imported at Admitapproximately four times the. cost of the Australian product. Under the Labour administration Australia is not producing the requirements of its people and consequently they must be imported at high cost. Consequently, the percentage of our national income which is expended on imports is increasing steeply. In 1938^39 we expended 14.3 per cent, of our national side to follow an Opposition speaker. I income on imported goods, but by do not know whether this means that 1948-49 the figure had jumped to 22.6 per honourable members opposite have very cent.

I should not mind speaking again if honourable members opposite would give me the opportunity to do so. honourable member contributed to the debate, nobody would have known that he had taken part in it. This is the last opportunity that members of this Parliament will have to consider the ninth budget presented by the Treasurer. Over the years we have become accustomed to the presentation of budgets, each containing record receipts and expenditure. Although with the presentation of each succeeding budget the Treasurer has pretended to grant relief from taxation, the figures published by the Commonwealth Statistician reveal that the collection of taxes from the people has steadily increased. To-day, taxation per capita exceeds £70 compared with £40 in pre-war years. ""We are confronted with the paradoxical situation that although, according to the Treasurer, generous reductions of taxation have been made, taxes are, according to the Commonwealth Statistician, higher than they have ever been before. Apparently, the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) is not only ""the great illusionist,"" but he is also an expert contortionist. I shall address myself now to a number of acts of omission and commission of the Government that will be in issue during the forthcoming election campaign. The first is banking. What is the Government going to do about its banking legislation ? Although the reasons for the Privy Council's decision in the banking case have not yet been given, it is significant that since that decision was announced the Prime Minister has not made a single statement regarding his intentions. For those who hoped that the Prime Minister would drop the subject, the absence of any statement by the right honourable gentleman is ominous. Those of us who know his attitude in these matters know that he is not only dogmatic but also fanatical in his views on certain things; and nationalization, or socialization, of banking is one of those have, of course, been soft pedalling the party's intentions concerning banking, and any reference to the matter is unpopular with them. However, the MinisI have already spoken in ter for External Territories ( Mr Ward), who is probably one of the most injudicious members of the Labour party, and, for that reason, perhaps one of the frankest members of that party, told#us that the Government has not dropped its banking policy, hut that, on the contrary, it will endeavour to implement that policy by whatever means it can find. To those of us who know something of the Government attitude and of the Prime Minister's technique in these matters, the Minister's statement means that the present Government will find some way, short of referring the matter to the people, to implement its policy. We recollect very well the circumstances surrounding the introduction of the banking legislation, which, following a decision given by the High Court in litigation between the Melbourne City Council and the Commonwealth, seemed at the time to indicate the Prime Minister's pique, The High Court had held that the 1945 banking legislation did not confer absolutely unlimited powers upon the Government in banking matters. The Prime Minister then made his decision. Instead of bringing the matter before the Parliament, or before Cabinet, the record of events indicates that the right honorahle gentleman himself decided to nationalize the trading banks, and that the only individuals whom he took into his oonfidence were two or three senior members of the Cabinet. As I have said, he did not even consult the members of his political party. The Labour caucus was not convened until some considerable time later, and then it had to trail behind the decision which the Prime Minister had taken on its account. Those of us who have studied the technique of the Prime Minister know very well that he is only lying low until after the election, and that if Labour is returned to office he will renew his attack on the trading banks regardless of the reasons given by the Privy Council in their deferred judgment. If Labour is",33,Chaibman Actions Of The Government In Many Other

87,Mr Anthony,"Eo r all that thereturned to office it will have not only a majority in this chamber but also the control of the Senate, and it will find some means to break the trading banks. In breaking the trading banks, it will destroy the right of every citizen of this country to conduct his own affairs in his own way. Through the banking legislation that it has introduced the Government has already gone a long way to restrict the activities of the trading banks. It has frozen their surplus funds, of which it now controls between £200,000,000 and £300,000,000, and on that amount it pays interest at only approximately $ per cent. It has also restricted the business which the trading banks may accept, and it has limited their expansion. So far, however, it has not succeeded in depriving a depositor with a trading bank of the privacy which the trading banks at present afford to their depositors. However, if the Government wins the forthcoming election, the opportunity for any Australian to embark in business will be restricted because, once the trading banks have been eliminated, an applicant for credit will have only one right of appeal against the refusal of the monopoly bank to extend credit to him. Furthermore, there will be unrestricted licence for the Government's gestapo to pry into the private business of every citizen. That, of course, is the he-all and end-all of all socialists. They aim to make the citizen, the ordinary private person, completely subordinate to the State. ""We have seen what has happened in those countries where that policy has been implemented. In the totalitarian countries the liberty of the individual has been completely submerged in the overall domination of the State. We know also that the aim of the present Government is exactly the same as that of all other governments with a socialist objective. The next issue on which the Government will be arraigned is its attitude towards the general Communist menace. What has it done to check the spread of communism ? What does it propose to do? How far has it been successful'in combating the Communist menace? The Minister for Post-war Eeconstruction ( Mr Dedman) has been, at least in the opinion of the members of the Opposition, the greatest patron of the Communists in Australia. As a member of the Government, and more particularly in his capacity as the Minister who administers the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization, he has exercised his patronage to appoint to prominent positions in that body notorious Communists, including one who was virtually convicted of treason. The individual to whom I refer occupied a position of considerable importance in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization. Some time ago the Minister told us that there had ""been a clean-up of Communists in the Public Service. In fact we remember that a short time ago legislation was passed which requires individuals who join certain sections of the Public Service to take an oath of allegiance. We have also been told that a security service has been established for the purpose of "" screening "" applicants for the Public ServiceI think ""screening"" was the term that the Minister employed. This security organization is also intended to safeguard the public interest by preventing the admission of Communists to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization. Some people may have believed that, but, strangely, it required the press of London to tell the Minister what was happening in one of the sections that he administers. I shall remind him of the circumstances. During the recent coal strike, the Communists organized a demonstration outside Australia Housei n London. They were an energetic little group as they paraded in front of the official administrative section of Australia House. Some of them carried sandwich boards and others waved banners, but all of them loudly raised their voices in protest at the harsh treatment which, they contended, had been meted out to the Communist leaders of the Australian coal-miners who had been imprisoned for contempt of court. When pressmen began to investigate the identity of the Communists, they discovered that one of the prominent demonstrators was a person who had been granted a scholarship by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization, and, as far as I know, was an employee of that body. He was a Mr Kaiser, who, according to his own admission and also to the statement which the Minister made to this House> had been entrusted with secret research work on radar .before he was sent to England to continue his studies. When thehistory of Mr Kaiser was revealed, it was obvious that he must have been a Communist for a long time. member that? ister that Mr Kaiser was a Communist? Did the Commonwealth Investigation Service obtain that information for him? The fact is that the Minister had to wait until Kaiser publicly revealed himself in his. true colours, and, when that occurred, the Government was forced to take action. After certain questions had been asked in this House and elsewhere about him, the Government dismissed him. But when I state that Mr Kaiser must have been a Communist for a long time, the Minister interjects, "".Who told the honourable member that ? "". The security service should tell the Government who are the dangerous people in high placesin the Commonwealth. I remind the Minister that a gentleman who was spoken of as the "" un-eleeted Cabinet Minister of the Chifley Government"", occupied a comfortable room oppositethe now. door of the room of the Minister for External Territories. ( Mr Ward) on the eighth floor of. the Commonwealth Bank building in. Sydney. I refer, of course, to Mr Jock"" Garden. For many years, he. had been a close confidant and associate of a number of members of the Chifley Government.. Mr Garden said that he was a Communist in 1920. As a matter of fact,, it was admitted that he had founded the Communist party in this eountry. However, Mr Garden stated that because the Communists objectedto his religious views-the evidence at the trial did not seem to indicate that he. had infiltrating the Labour party. Many of many religious views-h e had to leave the Communist party in 1923. In 1931 Mr Jock"" Garden, who was then a great power in the Labour movement, sponsored the resolution which implanted the socialization plank in the Labour party's political platform in place of the portance to the people. olds objective, the cultivation of: an Australian sentiment. Mr Garden moved the motion that required every Labour candidate for election to. the Parliament to take the pledgewhich .bound him to advocate and support at all times the socialization of industry, production, distribution and exchange. In 1934, Mr Jock"" Garden, who no longer belonged to the Communist party was elected to this Parliament as the Labour member for Cook. A few years later, he was defeated, and, during World War IL , he was established by the Minister for External Territories on the eighth floor of the Commonwealth Bank building in Sydney and was; given a most responsible position. But when the' New Guinea timber case broke, and the Commonwealth police visited Mr Garden's office, they found a card which showed that he had been a member of the Communist party as late as 1946. If the Minister again interjects, "" Who told the honourable member that ? "",. I shall reply that the disclosures were made by Detec^ tive-Inspector Wilks, an officer of the Commonwealth Investigation Service, when he was giving evidence on oath in one of the hearings associated with the timber case. That' is an indication of the efficacy of the security which the Minister offers to the people; but he will be vociferous this evening. Shortly after 8 o'clock, he will be able to find all the words thateluded him when it was his turn to speak about twenty minutes ago. However, the Minister will not be able to convince any one that "" Jock"" Garden was not a Oommunist from 1920 to 1946, and that Garden's declaration that, he had renounced communism was not completely spurious. He will not be able to convince the people that the Communists are not them have, announced that they have left the Communist party,, but if we could make a lightning, search of their wallets or of their safe, deposit boxes, we should probably find their party tickets for 1948.

"" slush "" fund. sion were to inquire into the finances of the LabouT party and into the source of its funds for fighting the forthcoming election, evidence would be found of the existence of the biggest "" slush"" fund that this country has every known. While I am referring to this subject, I should like to deal with a matter which, I consider,, is a serious breach of propriety on the part of the Prime Minister and the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt). They have issued newspaper advertisements inviting all and sundry to contribute to the funds of the Australian Labour party and to send their contributions to ""the Eight Honourable J. B. Chifley or the Eight Honourable H . V. Evatt"". Honourable members opposite eannot see anything wrong with that. But dothey suggest that the loyal wage-earners who contribute to the Labour party through their union dues are sending their two "" bobs "", five ""bobs"", or £1 notes to the Prime Minister and the Minister for External Affairs? Politics has been kept fairly straight in Australia, and I do not suggest that there is anything corrupt about the Prime Minister or his deputy. However, I say that any business organization which made a contribution of £1,000 to the Labour party by cheque through the Prime Minister or the Minister ior External Affairs, as the advertisements request, would finditself in an advantageous position if it later approached the Government to ask for some kind of concession or favour. That must be so, whatever the Prime Minister may say. If the management of a brewery, an ironworks, a glass factory, or a business organization seeking remission of customs duties orsome other business concession, makes a large donation to the funds of the Labour party by cheque sent to the Prime Minister, the right honourable gentleman will pass the money on, but he will also remember where it came from. He would be more than human if the organization approached him and applied pressure to-secure a favour and he failed advertisements represent pressure tactics. They imply,. "" If you do not contribute; your name will be noted amongst the absentees. If you do contribute, then vve may be able to do something that is quite within the law or we may amend the law to help you"". I say that that is completely improper. is speaking for Ampol. honourable members opposite speakingfor if we are speaking for Australian Motorists Petrol Company Limited? Ampol at least is an Australian company. Those who say that we are speaking for Ampol imply that they are speaking for foreign oil companies. The method of calling for contributions to Labour party funds that I have mentioned leaves the door open forcompanies to bring pressure to bear upon the Government because of favours bestowed upon it. Another fault that will be laid at the door of the Government is its failure to increase; or even maintain,, the. production of goods and materials in Australia. We have been told that there has been a stupendous expansion of our national income. It has risen from about £800,000,000 annually, prior to the war, to £1,800,000,000. Unfortunately, very little of that increase has resulted from increased production. It has been almost entirely an increase of value only. The Government stands charged with failure to maintain supplies of food to Britain, in relation to which [ will present facts and figures later in my speech, and with letting down the people of Australia by failing to encourage production of goods that they require for the maintenance of their industries and for the building of homes. Sitting suspended from 5.56 to. 8 p.m. tactics of the Government in trying to prevent me from speaking after dinner, at 8 o'clock to-night, I shall have to discard my notes on the generalities of the budget and address myself to only a few points.

So, for nothing in this world, and, on the other when the Prime Minister lectures us about hand, they seek to intimidate in such a manner his love for Great Britain, we trace history as when they said to the banks, "" If you do a little farther back than the advent of not go quietly, we will do this or that"". The Government has departed entirely from long-established parliamentary procedure in almost every department of its activities, from the appointment of an undistinguished Labour Premier as the successor in the highest office in the land of a very distinguished predecessor, to the heavy hand which it imposes by its majority on the Opposition in this Parliament when the Opposition tries to bring facts to light. The ejectment of so many Opposition members from the Parliament on numerous occasions by the vote and weight of the Government's majorityand they could be ejected only by its majority-is evidence of the way in which it treats the Opposition. Minister, in recent speeches, has told us of his love and admiration for Great Britain. It is a new-found love, and it seems to have been inspired only since the socialist Government assumed office in the Mother Country. No one has shown greater contempt for British parliamentary procedure than has the Prime Minister. The censure motion moved last week is evidence of that, if evidence is required. British parliaments, when a censure motion has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition, to give such a motion precedence over all other business, including questions; but the Prime Minister, as an indication of his contempt for both the Opposition and British parliamentary tradition, simply went on with the ordinary question time. I remind the Prime Minister, who a few days ago lectured honourable members on this side of the committee on his love of Great Britain, of how quickly the Labour party in the Australian Parliament went out of its way to show its lack of love for Great Britain when the war broke out. When the Menzies Government raised and sent an expeditionary force to the Middle East, or endeavoured to do so, the then Leader of the Opposition, the late Mr Curtin, submitted a motion designed to prevent the departure of the force. Had the force Mr Anthony. the Attlee-Cripps Government. This Government has flirted with the Communist party until almost the eve of the general election. It appointed the Communist, Healy. as a member of the Stevedoring Industry Commission, with substantial government pay. It arranged overseas trips for Mr Ernie"" Thornton so that he might attend Communist meetings at Moscow, Belgrade and other Communist centres. vernment facilitated his trips and arranged his passport. It is in the records 1 of the House also that it paid him a The Prime certain amount of money while he was abroad. The amount of £300, 1 think, is set down in answer to a question. It flirted with almost every leading Communist until the public, aroused at last, would tolerate such conduct no longer. Then, suddenly we find a change of front on the eve of the general election. Tiw. coal strike, if evidence should he 1 needed, shows what happened. The Government had the one opportunity of its It is customary, in career to free the public from the Communist-controlled miners' federation in that, had it taken permanent control of open-cut mining from the miners' federation, we should have been independent of the federation in the event of another coal strike; but, having put troops into the open-cut mines and temporarily got over the unpleasant situation, it has now handed work in the open-cut mines hack to the Communist-dominated miners' fed 1 eration which can have the whole community under thrall at any time it likes. The one opportunity the Government had to free the community from snch enslavement occurred then. The Communists are supposed to have lost the coal strike. 1 Its great victory must be compared with the Battle of Blenheim, for the hudget that it has presented to the Parliament, which is before me at the moment, provides a sum of not less than £8,000,000 to the State governments to enable them to meet the expenditure",37,Chaibman Actions Of The Government In Many Other

126,Mr Thompson,"The people of AusLabour party went to t i e people twelve or eighteen months afterwards, it was returned with a tremendous majority. During the three years that elapsed before the next general election, the members of the anti-Labour parties made every effort to discredit the Labour party, just as they are doing to-day. At the next election the anti-Labour parties won a few seats that the Labour party had previously held, but we were still returned with a substantial majority. The honourable member for Calare said the honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller) was whistling to keep his courage up. Honourable members opposite want to do more than whistle to keep their courage up. Two or three weeks ago a farmer in a substantial way of business, said to me, "" I have voted for the Lahour party at the last two elections and I can see no reason why I should not vote for it this time. The Labour party has done nothing to make me change my vote. The farmers are in the best position they have ever been in and the workers are more prosperous than ever before."" Let any one'who would deny the truth of that statement go to any farmer and tell him that he is poorer today than he was ten years ago. I was speaking recently on the subject of petrol to a farmer whom I met at the Hotel Kurrajong in Canberra. He said to me, "" I have a motor car and two sons. I asked the rationing authorities to let me have three rations of petrol, one for myself and one for each of my two sons. They refused because they did not have the sense to see that it was a good thing to do. figures show the amount paid in taxes So now I shall buy another motor car and obtain another petrol ration."" Could a farmer have talked so airily about buying an extra motor car previous to the advent to office of the Lahour Government? Yet honourable members opposite say that the people are not as well off now as they were before. This morning's issue of the Canberra Times contained an advertisement inserted by the Liberal party's candidate at the next general election for .the Canberra seat in this Parliament. The advertisement stated that housewives were worse off under Labour administration than ever before. That statement is an insult to womanhood and to the workers. Evidently the candidate has never been in the homes of real workers. If he had visited the homes that I have visited and had seen the difference between what they are now and what they were ten years ago, he would realize that it is ridiculous to talk about the workers being worse off than in the past. To take only one instance, shops in all the capital cities' are selling large numbers of pressure cookers, which cost between £5 and £6 each. The people who are buying those pressure cookers at that price and who have been buying them for the last twelve months, did not have a hope ten years ago of paying £5 or £6 for such an article. Yet the Opposition says that the people are not so well off now as they were years ago. Honourable members opposite also say that the taxation imposed by the present Government has had the effect of reducing the net income of the people so much that they are no better off on high wages now than they were on lower wages in the past. I have taken the trouble to obtain some figures regarding taxation and its incidence at the present time compared with ten years ago. The people are paying less in taxes to-day than they were paying ten years ago. When I say "" the people "" I refer to those who do not earn more than £500 a yearthat is to say, the majority of the population. The ngui'es which I have taken out refer to South Australia only, as it would take too long to present similar figures for all States. The by various grades of earners in South Australia in 1938-39, the highest rate paid during the war years, and the rate now paid. The figures show that the general incidence of taxation is now lighter than it was prior to the war. The pre-war rates that I shall quote were imposed by a Liberal-Country party government in South Australia. I can say that if the Opposition parties are elected to office at the next general election there will be an adjustment of tax rates and the present rates on the lower incomes will certainly be increased to enable a reduction of the taxation on the higher income groups.

While on all the cases quoted the reducr tion is. very great on WarTaxes. Something has been said about the price of suits,, but honorahle members opposite Mr Thompson. should not speak too loudly on that subject.

Generally, anti-Labour governments when they require increased revenue get it out of the man at the bottom rather than out of the man at the top of the income scale. I now propose to show how the present Government has returned the bulk of taxes to the great mass of the people. In passing I must say that I have no doubt that the real issue that will confront the '1949-50. people at the forthcoming general election will be whether they are to retain social £ «. d. £ >. d. £ «. tf. security. 1 2 0 3 9 0 Nil 10 8 0 36 13 0 4 18 0* 14 6 0 53 13 0 9 17 0* ber means socialism. 18 14 0 71 11 0 14 7 0* used as a means whereby people who canafford to pay a fair share of their wealth to provide a reasonablestandard of living for persons at the bottom of the income scale it is good; and the high dignitary whom the honorable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) mentioned would, I believe, agree with that point of view..

However, I am well aware of the circumstances in which an anti-Labour government, introduced child endowment.

Labour government introduce child endowment? Honourable members opposite know as well as I do that their argument that the present method of fixing the basic wage was at the back of the introduction of child endowment. I have often asked why a man. with a wife and. six children should receive a wage calculated to be sufficient to maintain a family of only three children whilst, at the same time, a single man should receive the same wage-. I shall explain why an anti-Labour government introduced child endowment. The basic wage was calculated to be sufficient to meet the needs of a man with a wife and three children. At that time an application was before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for an increase of the wage, and the Commonr wealth Statistician's figures showed that it was only sufficient to meet the needs of a man, his wife and one child. A way had to be evolved to provide additional income for a man with a wife and three children without increasing thebasic wage, and the introduction of child endowment achieved that purpose. The anti-Labour government of the day provided endowment at. the -rate of 5s. a week for each child of the family excluding the first. ber knows that what he has said is not correct. workers, who compose, the great, bulk of the people, are very much afraid that any attempt by an anti-Labour government to provide endowment for the.first child will be used as a means to reduce the basic wage and their standard of living generally. Certainly, the total collectionsof income tax to-day are much, higher than they were previously, but the needsof the people which are met from the Government's revenue are also much greater than they were previously. for joyrides round, thes world for a lot of itssupporters: Parliament fornearly twenty years and I have invariably found that regardless of the political colour of a government, the Opposition of the day has chided it about providWhy did that antiing joyrides for its supporters. I have no doubt that if the present Opposition parties were now in office some of my colleagues would chide them with providing joyrides for their supporters. However, that attitude does not cut any ice with me. The cost of age and invalid pensions increased from £29,417,000 in 1946-47 to £36,562,000in 1947-48, and to £41,693,000 in 1948-49, whilst it is estimated that £45,500,000 will be paid under that, heading during the current financial year. Obviously, in order to meet this increased expenditure the Government must collect increased revenue. The fly in the ointment so far as the Opposition is concerned is that the money is to come from wealthy people. Should it come from the man at the bottom or the man at the top of the income scale? There can be only one answer to that question. Payments in respect of child endowment increased from £19,000,000 in 1947-48 to £24,000,000 in 1948-49, whilst it is estimated that £31,000,000will be expended under that heading during the current financial year. Honourable members opposite complain that the total collections of taxes Ls increasing.. They say that if they are returned tooffice they will reduce taxes and> at the. same time, provide endowment for the first child of the family. They cannot have it both ways. This Government is also providing hospital benefits which anti-Labour governments failed to do. Those benefits, in the main, are not being paid to persons in lower income groups because^ ordinarily,, those classes of persons enter the public wards o£ -hospitals and,, therefore,, are not liable for payment for their treatment in hospital. Whereas payments in respect of hospital benents amounted to 1 £4,478,000 m 194-7-48, it is estimated that £6,000,000; will be paid under that heading during the current, financial year. The facts which I have just cited: show clearly that this Government, is a people's government because it is; utilizing the. money which, it. collects in taxes in the way in which such revenue should, be' used.",44,Counting Otheb Rebates

134,Mr Thompsoni Have Been In,"After all, taxation is merely a means of re-distributing tbe wealth of the community. The Government's policy is that persons who possess more than they require for their basic needs shall pay according to their ability into a fund which will be used to give to the needy sections of the community a higher standard of living. One of the best indications of the prosperity of a people is the amount which stands to their credit in deposits in the savings banks. The Oommonwealth Pocket Compendium, issued by the Commonwealth Statistician-obviously thority that cannot be questioned-shows that at the 30th June, 1939, savings bank deposits £245,000,000. By the 30th June, 1947, that figure had risen to £660,000,000. The ensuing year added a further £21,000,000, 1 making a total of £681,000,000 at the 30th June, 1948. The figure for 1948-49 is not yet available. That is a clear indication of the prosperity of the Australian people. I have no doubt that honourable members opposite will argue that the value of money has fallen considerably. One frequently hears the statement that the purchasing power of money to-day is not half of what it was a few years ago, but that does not detract from my argument. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), who was the first speaker in the debate on the budget after the Prime Minister( Mr who are contributing to superannuation Chifley) had delivered his speech, spoke of the need for exact figures. He claimed that all that the budget meant to the people of this country was an increase of the income tax exemption for life assurance and superannuation payments from £100 to £150, and that this concession had been granted mainly 1 in the interests of members of Parliament who are contributing for retiring allowance. The honourable member asked whether the Australian worker would benefit from this concession. When I said that he would not do so, the honourable member thought that he had scored. Obviously, the ordinary working man cannot possibly afford to pay anything like £100 a year for life assurance or superannuation. The honourable member's remarks were a slur on honourable members on this side of the chamber, but I remind him Mr Thompson. that most honourable members oppositewill derive far more benefit from the in creased exemption than will Governmentmembers and supporters. able member make that out? is my parliamentary allowance of £1,500a year, of which £150 is an allowablededuction for expenses. On a taxable income of £1,350, my tax last year was less than 5s. in the £1, so that the increase of £50 in the concession for life assurance and superannuation will not mean an auvery much to me, particularly as my tax contribution this year will be at the rate of less than 5s. in the £1. The concession in this country totalled in this year's budget may save me a "" tenner "", but if I had an income like some honourable members opposite I might save £25, £30 or perhaps £40. We hear a lot from honourable members opposite about the misfortune of men who have to pay 17s. 6d. in the £1 in tax, including the social services contribution of ls. 6d. in the £1. Clearly this new concession will mean much more to taxpayers in that category, than it will to average incomeearners. In deciding upon this concession, the Government did not have in mind the advantages that would accrue to members of Parliament. There are hundreds of thousands of salaried workers throughout the Commonwealth schemes under which they will retire on half salary. I recall that years ago professors at the University of Adelaide, earning £1,000 a year, were paying £150 a year for life assurance policies which ensured to them roughly half their salary upon retirement. That is the type of man who will appreciate this concession. Honourable members opposite talk often about the depreciating value of money. I remind them that not only salaries, but also retiring allowances purchase less to-day than they did a few years ago. The remarks of the honourable member for Warringah about the reason for the new taxation concession were in line with statements that had already heen published in Adelaide and Sydney newspapers. Incidentally, members of Parliament are paying £156 a year and not £150 a year as the honourable member",45,Counting Otheb Rebates

For the honourable inember to insinuate to the people of this country that I would demean myself as he has suggested for a paltry £10 a year is reprehensible. If that is the only criticism that honourable members opposite can offer of the Treasurer's budget proposals, those proposals must be sound indeed. I take great pleasure in commending the budget. ""We on this side of the chamber believe that in prosperous times a government should pay its way, out of revenue, just as any man in full employment and in receipt of full wages, should pay his way out of his current income.

Should that happen under this Government's administration of the affairs of the country, funds would be available for public works and unemployment could be reduced. The hudget is excellent, and I am satisfied that the people of Australia will endorse it readily when the election is held early in December. I do' not propose to attempt to reply to the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Thompson). I have had occasion previously to refer to that honourable member. To-night he has excelled himself in a series of misstatements. He has deliberately evaded points made in debate by members on this side of the chamber. He has sought to convince the people of this country that the Labour party is responsible for the high price of Australian exports overseas, and for all the advantages that Australian primary producers enjoy because of bountiful crops and assured markets. I want to show another side of the picture. I do not want to dwell on what the honourable member for Hindmarsh has said. I believe that the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) is the person He saidAustralia has been aided in these years by seasons, and export prices have been high because of the strong post-war demand for our TheI suppose that if Treasurer continuedThe national income has increased and that has been widely shared.

141,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [8.59].,"reading of that statement would evoke the approval of honorahle memhers opposite. For that reason I propose to deal with it. Export prices in June of this year were nearly 300 per cent, higher than they were in 1939. The national income for 1948-49 was 125 per cent, greater than it was in 1938-39. Expenditure on imports rose during the ten-year period hy 225.6 per cent., and between July, 1939, and April, 1949, employment rose by 41.6 per cent. In his concluding remarks in delivering his budget speech, the Treasurer saidIndeed, Australia is. in many ways much farther ahead than ten years ago. In manufacturing, our capacity has increased at least tion is the most important objective in 50 per cent. Against that statement, however, Professor Copland who, as honourable members know, -was the economic advisor of this Government, and whom the Government still regards as a reliable authority, has shown that we are now producing at only 70 per cent, of our capacity. On the basis of the assessments made by the Treasurer and by Professor Copland a simple arithmetical calculation shows that production is now only 5 per cent, above what it was in pre-war years. The Treasurer continuedThroughout the economy as a whole there are increased by more than 100 per cent., but 40 per cent, more people at work than there were then Prom this statement it is obvious that the production position in Australia is far from being as rosy as the Treasurer painted it in his budget speech. Notwithstanding that there are 40 per cent, more people at work than were employed ten years ago, production has increased by only 5 per cent, above the pre-war level. The Prime Minister has frequently told us that full employment is the keynote of the Government's policy. He has also told lis that, having achieved full employment, his Government has helped Australia to attain the millenium. Full employment on the basis of an increase of production of only 5 per cent, is of no use to this country. 'Only if full employment and full production are achieved iside by side can benefit accrue to Australia. If we hear ! employ men and women for employment's sake and achieve no added productive .results, the national economy must suffer. Let us consider the losses of working days that have been suffered by industry during the last ten years, -of which the Labour Government has been in office for seven years. During the ten years ended the 31st December, 1948, the total number of working days lost throughout Australia was in excess of 12,00:0,000. In the coal-mining and quarrying .group, the loss was more than 4,500,000 days. In the manufacturing group the number of days lost was almost 5,000,000. In the land and sea transport group the total number of days lost exceeded 2,000,000. Let us consider the position of our manufacturing industries. Increased producAustralia to-day, but the Government is ignoring it. After the war Australia was Ipft with an extraordinarily great manufacturing potential. We had remarkable opportunities. We -had trained men, skilled technicians, and an immense amount of plant. Markets were waiting for OUT products and overseas countries were demanding all that we could produce. What is the position now, after four years of peace? In the light of the Treasurer's figures relating to the national income we are "" sitting pretty "", but only on what might be termed paper prosperity. The national income has the increase in the production of goods and services has not been commensurate with the increase in the national income. The increase in the national income has been brought about in the main by rises in prices. Because the supply of tractors, wire netting, farm implements and the like is not sufficient to meet the requirements of our primary producers, tens of thousands of acres of fertile land are going out of production.

The production of coal underground, or even, to repair the present ones. which is the true barometer of coal production, will be the lowest since 1936. Honourable members know that coal is must have the complete economic picture vital to industry, and that unless industry before us in proper perspective. We can obtain coal it cannot generate the must remember that although we are power to produce the basic materials boasting of full employment, our steel necessary and that, in. consequence, proindustry is not producing to more than 1 industrial areas to the primary producers. Rail transport is the principal means of When we speak of full employment we 64.7 per cent, of its potential capacity. The underlying reasons for that situation are, I believe, first, the chronic shorton the motion for the tabling of the age of coal, which was accentuated , of 1 course, during the last tragic coal strike; and, secondly, the challenge of the socialistic ideology to free enterprise. I believe that what the doctrinaire socialists fail to realize is that the goods and servioes which the community enjoys are the direct outcome of the activities of the thousands of business undertakings, and that those undertakings are directed by men whose job is to anticipate and to supply the needs of the consumer. Does any honourable member seriously contend that such services can be adequately provided by the State? The State has fallen down even in the supply of basic materials. I believe that socialization is a.challenge to free enterprise. Let us look at the socialist plan. That plan is not peculiar to Australia; it is Empire-wide. ""We read a lot in the press these days of Sir Stafford Cripps, who is the spokesman of the great British socialist party. In 1936 he was reported as having said at Hull, EnglandI t is fundamental to socialism that we should liquidate tlie British Empire as soon as vve can. Honourable members might have felt, as I did at the time, that his statement was nothing more than a play on words. Could any person who had a love of the Empire and of the British Commonwealth and who occupied a responsible position, advocate that the British Empire should he liquidated merely because it was standing in the way of socialistic development? As I have said, I believed at the time that his statement was a mere play on words. What did we find later? In 1948, when he was questioned in the House of Commons concerning that utterance, he did not deny having made it. On the contrary, he said, in effect: ""Certainly; what we have done in the case of India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon "". Therefore, Sir Stafford Cripps, the archpriest of socialism, whom our Prime Minister slavishly follows throughout the whole gamut of his socialistic gambling, has sworn to liquidate the British Empire, and is proud of the fact that his Government is apparently succeeding in Mr Harrison. doing so. I do not want to anticipate too much any debate that may take placepaper which dealt with the relations of the Republic of India and the great British Oommonwealth, but for the life of me I cannot understand how it is possible for a republican state to remain within the Empire, taking all the benefits of that organization, whileat the same time accepting none of the obligations of membership. However, as I have just remarked, this plan for the liquidation of the Empire is not peculiar to Australia, but is general throughout the Empire. We know of the trends in Great Britain, in New Zealand and in our own country, as evidenced by the nationality bill that was passed by the Parliament some time ago. We also know that every member and supporter of the Government is obliged to implement the plank of the Labour party's platform which provides for socialization of the means of production, distributionand exchange, and all the steps which that entails. On an occasion such as this, when we are discussing the budget, it behoves us to search closely for the real policy of the Government, because that policy is cloaked in a mass of facts and figures which we must examine carefully to understand why the present Government is unworthy of being returned to the treasury bench. I know that the Prime Minister has said repeatedly that the Constitution does not confer power on the Government to socialize anything, hut the fact remains that he has attempted to do so. As the result of the decision of the Privy Council he will not be able to nationalize the trading banks by direct methods, but we have only to examine the banking legislation of 1945 to realize that, by a process of slow strangulation over a period of years, he can achieve that is exactly the same objective. We must not forget that. During this debate, the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward) has made it perfectly clear that the Labour party has not abandoned its idea of nationalizing banking. He said that if the people returned the Labour Government to office, it would concentrate upon that objective. In the same way, the Labour Government will endeavour to -socialize or nationalize other sections of free enterprise. I shall briefly examine the Canberra set-up, because it is most interesting. We know the kind of action that the Government has taken to nationalize air services. By various devices, the Government is gradually -squeezing out private enterprise as a competitor in air transport. Already the Government has nationalized the shipping industry and broadcasting services, and has instituted an insurance monopoly. All those factors are a part of the pattern that is being woven into the tapestry by the arch-priests of socialism, the Chancellor of the British Exchequer, Sir -Stafford Cripps, and his henchman, the Prime Minister of Australia. I go a little farther. At one time, the Labour party had no such objective as socialization. In 1921, the trade union congress adopted the "" red"" pledge. I recall the comment of Mr E. G. Theodore -on that occasion, and nobody can say that he was not a Labour man. Mr body. The unions are not yet allTheodore said, "" Y o u have changed the objectives of Labour. You might just as well change its name"". On the drafting committee that adopted the "" red "" pledge, the notorious "" Jock"" Garden sat cheek by jowl with the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr( Mr Dedman) in appointing Communists Scullin), and another former Labour Prime Minister, the late Mr John Curtin. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway), who has stated that communism is Christ-like, was the chairman of that drafting committee, and he said at that timeThis is the culmination of the teachings of Marx. I feel that the -workers of Australia have at last adopted the slogan of K a r l Marx, "" Workers of the .world, unite "". A t last one of the dreams of my life has become an accomplished fact. In October, 1947, in reply to a question that I had asked, the Minister for Labour and National Service said that he could show that the aims of the Communist movement were based on the teachings of Christ. After he had adjusted his halo, he retired to his seat on the treasury bench. Since the adoption of the "" red "" pledge in 1921, the Labour party has been closely identified with communism. Communists to key positions. Does the honourable member say that that is not true? retary of the Waterside Workers Federation, Mr Healy, was appointed to the Stevedoring Industry Commission by the Chifley Government. by members of the Waterside Workers Federation. the honourable member claim that Roach was not appointed to the Stevedoring Industry Commission by the Chifley Government ? the members of his union. ment could make those appointments to the Stevedoring Industry Commission. The Waterside Workers Federation could not appoint its representatives to that powerful, although they may have issued a direction to the Government to make those appointments. I could understand that perfectly well. Of course, we have a classic example in the action of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction to the staff of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the predecessor of the Commonwealth Scientific and In dustrial Research Organization. and Pomeroy. true. The Minister was responsible for approving the appointment to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of a Mr Kaiser, who participated in a Communist demonstration in front of Australia House as a protest against the imprisonment of the Communist leaders of the Australian coalminers in the recent coal strike. Mr Kaiser, who has since been dismissed from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, is a Communist.

Mr Chifley and Dr. Evatt were directors of the Labour campaign committee and associated with them were Mr Chandler, State organizing secretary of the Communist party, Mr Jeffrey, of the Sydney branch of that party, and Mr Wright, a member of the central committee. I emphasize that those Communists were associated with Mr Chifley and Dr. Evatt. I do not want the people to be misled about Mr Chifley's pre-election windowdressing. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Lazzarini) -Order! I ask the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Minister attended a conference of trade Harrison) to refer to the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General by their proper designations and not as Mr Chifley and Dr. Evatt. people will not be misled by the Prime Minister's pre-election window-dressing. The action that he has taken against individual members of the Communist .party will not mislead any one. He has not taken action against the Communist party as a whole for what he described as "" sinister and treasonable acts "" during the coal strike. When the right honourable gentleman is in a particularly difficult position in this House he refers to philosophy "". Minister was confronted with the problem of the coal strike, he referred to the stoppage as "" a sinister move on the part of tliese men to disrupt Australian industry "". The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, who has appointed Communists to various positions in the Commonwealth service, is reported in Hansard, volume 181, page 44, as having saidThe Communist party is a political organizatotalitarian state, and, of course, the tion carrying on its activities in a perfectly legal way. I wonder whether the Minister still subscribes to that view. I , personally, have no doubt that he does. I wonder, too, whether he will withdraw, after the election, the diatribes that the Prime Minister and he directed against the Communists during the recent coal strike. I am inclined to think that he will, because the quotation that I read a few moments ago is a true expression of the opinions of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction about the Communists. I make no further reference to the Communists. After all, they are not in power. The socialists are in power at the present time in Australia, but we shall deal with the Communists when we are returned to office. Meanwhile, the issue before the people at the forthcoming elections is socialism. First, I shall consider the view of the worker, because that is most important. In 1948, the Prime unions at the Sydney Trades Hall. The delegate of the Rubber Workers TJnion asked the right honourable gentleman what would happen when full production had been achieved under the Government's full employment policy. I ask the Parliament and the people to note the Prime Minister's reply, which was as follows:No guarantee can be given to anybody that they can stay put in a particular industry. It is realized that there w ill have to be transfers of workers and in many cases transfers of whole communities to other forms of work. I am quite certain that everybody w ill not be able to stay at home. I am not going to fool any one in that regard. communism as a "" political That statement has been emphasized by the comment of the then federal president of the Australian Labour party, Mr McAlpine, who said on the 16th January lastI t is necessary to have man-power control in the interests of the working people especially. There will be transfers of workers, regimentation, and conscription of labour. Is that what it means ? Honourable members opposite have something to explain away there. Regimentation and the conscription of labour are weapons of the socialist state is a totalitarian state. As honourable members know, the necessary machinery already exists. The Government still retains the Commonwealth Employment Service. It was established as the National Service Bureau during the war, when it employed 111 officers; now it has a staff of 2,171. That would be all right if those employees were",51,Government Members Heat

158,Mr Harrison,"When the Primeengaged in finding employment for the workless, but the Prime Minister has told us that jobs are available for 114,000 men, if that number eould be found. Therefore, the staffs of the Commonwealth Employment Service are not busy finding work for the unemployed. They belong to the machinery that has been established by the Government for use when men have to be transferred in bodies to various forms of work. That machinery is a part of the plan for the conscription of workers, under which men will be taken away from their homes. What will happen if members of the trade unions refuse to be regimented and say, "" We will not be directed to take jobs at the ' back o' SBourke' under the 'Government's plan "" ? Do honourable members think that the Prime Minister will allow the trade unions to upset the socialist plan for the oonscription of labour? Do they think that he will allow the unions to refuse to obey a government direction for transfer of employment or that he will compel them to move in a body at the direction of the employment agency that the Government has established? We know what the Prime Minister did about unionists on the coal-fields. When he considered that it was necessary for him to take action in the recent crisis, he threw troops into service on the coal-fields. He disregarded the Labour party's platform, which specifically provides against the use of troops in industrial disputes. He refused to use members of the Australian Workers Union or to give them an opportunity to destroy communism on the coalfields. He was prepared to tear up his -party's platform. I warn the workers of Australia that the Prime Minister has declared that they will be conscripted when the stage of full production is .reached. They will be directed to other forms of employment. They must not expect to remain in their own homes at night. armed force, if necessary, to direct them into new avenues of employment. It will be of no use for them to object as trade unionists, because they will be part and parcel of the .socialist state, mere cyphers who will have to do as they are told. I give another warning of what will happen in the socialist state. Small business men are likely to be affected equally with the trade unionists. It is well known that small business is anathema to the socialist planners. We know what has happened under the system of zoning of industries and businesses in our cities. The zoning of milk and bread deliveries is being continued. If people get bread .that is not fit to eat or milk that has a half-inch layer of dust, it is of no use foT them to complain. They can complain to a deputy director on any day between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., but they are not likely to obtain redress. The discomfort of the people is a very low price to pay for planning, in the view of the socialist organizers. They realize that the absorption of small businesses represents an awkward problem. Therefore, by using all means at their disposal, they try to prevent small businesses from expanding. Evidence of this policy is to be found in the numerous restrictions that are imposed upon small business undertakings. Specific taxation is directed against small businesses. Probably we shall find that, as in New Zealand, the socialist planners in Australia will insist upon government approval for the establishment of any small industry or business undertaking. New Zealand is further advanced in socialism than is Australia. In that country, a man cannot readily engage in an enterprise on his own account as was possible in the olden days, when freedom was of paramount importance. He must obtain the consent of the Government, which acts upon the recommendations of a panel composed of representatives of the industry or business in which he wishes to engage. The socialists seek to curtail the development of small industries because small undertakings are difficult to socialize. Their object is to drive business and industry into a few large monopolies so that, when a suitable opportunity occurs, they can more easily bring their The Prime Minister will use socialistic plans to fruition. I give these warnings because I believe that freedom such as I enjoyed in my younger days is the right of every citizen. I believe that every family man has the right to determine what trade, profession, or other form of livelihood his children shall adopt. Every person who believes in freedom must hold the same view. In the ultimate .form of the socialist state, the freedoms that we have known, and under which Australia was developed, will no longer exist. The budget stresses the facts of full employment and the increased national income, but it disregards all the factors that I have mentioned. It pays little heed to the fact that production has scarcely increased since before the war, although employment has increased by 40 or 50 per cent., and it passes oveir the rapidly accelerating spiral of money values, which are out of all proportion to the real values of commodities. Yet the. Government preens itself, and declares that it has done a good job! The truth is that we are being drawn rapidly into a spiral of innation and, until production is increased to a level commensurate with the state of full employment, our national economy will remain unbalanced. Repatriation) [9.39] -Honorabl e members have been privileged to hear a remarkable speech by the honourable member for ""Wentworth ( Mr Harrison). The honourable gentleman said at the outset that he would not reply to statements that had been made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Thompson) who spoke previously, but would reply to the statements that had been made by the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) because the right honourable gentleman had been responsible for the production of the budget. Eor less than ten minutes of the 40 minutes during which the honourable member spoke, he referred to the budget and the sins of omission and commission of the Treasurer. Then he set forth on a tirade of abuse of the Government, the Labour party and it affiliations, adopting the usual line accustomed. It envisages a sterile socialist of scare tactics I propose to have a little form of society in which every man w ill be to say about that soon, but, at the outset, I say that I believe that the budget that has been produced in this record year of the Treasurer is excellent. It has been described by some as a ""lower cost-ofliving budget"", and that description is true. Now that we have reached the stage at which budgeting can be re-cast, it proposes to give back to the people, directly and indirectly, that which makes for a lower cost of living. There is nothing spectacular in it, but it is sound and well reasoned, and it makes no promises. I agree with this statement of the Treasurer, in concluding his budget speechThe past ten years have proved the resilient strength of our country. When faced w i th danger, we put for t h a military and industrial effort far greater than was formerly thought possible and since the war we have been able despite many difficulties arising from that conflict, to recover lost ground 'and advance along the road of progress again. Indeed, Australia is in many ways much further ahead than ten years ago. In manufacturing, our capacity has increased at least 50 per cent. Throughout the economy as a whole there are 40 per cent, more people at work than there were then. From a social standpoint we have greatly extended the range and value of services available and experience has shown not merely that we can afford these services but that they have a positive worth in keeping up demand for goods and hence employment and investment. These examples of constructive achievement in a time disordered by war and the effects of war point to what can be done under normal conditions. Knowing our resources, we should not be afraid to set our goals high. I believe for example that our population can be doubled within a few decades. I believe also that our present problems of fuel and power can be solved, so opening up immense industrial possibilities. Housing, again, dillicult though it has been in recent years, w ill be steadily overcome if we keep up our efforts. T h a t is w h a t the T r e as u r er said. The n the honourable member for W a r r in g a h ( Mr Spender), w h o was deputed by the O p p o s it i o n to be it s mouthpiece o n the budget, s a i d We are asked to debate what I confidently hope w ill be the present Treasurer's last budget. It is likely to be a memorable budget because, upon the eve of an election, it dismally fails to present any solution of the various problems, external and internal, that w ill confront this country within the next three years. In fact, it follows the pattern of a l l other budgets presented by the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley), a pattern to which we have become encouraged to sit still at his job instead of engaging in any real effort to increase production and build up a new and vigorous nation, and w ill be led to believe that we can live from hand to mouth and from day to day. The honourable gentleman was, of course, at one time Treasurer of Australia for a few months and therefore has some insight into the Treasury and how it works. He should know, or be able readily to appreciate, what has been done by the Government during the reign of the present Treasurer. He should know the credits that we have developed abroad.",52,Government Members Heat

He should know that that sum represents £90 19s. a head of population compared with £35 3s. 8d. on the 31st August, 1939. He should also know something of what has been said by people outside Australia about Australia's stability. He should know that in London, as recently as A p r i l this year, the following statement was made:The Australian Government is earning a high reputation in London by its ability to foresee inflation dangers and its handling of post-war problems. This tribute is made by the "" Financial Times"", commenting on the embarrassment to Australia by the inflow of money from abroad. He should also know that the investments in this country from overseas in the last eight years amounting to at least £144,000,000 are greater by many millions of pounds than the sum ever invested in the country in any similar period of years. He should know that hundreds of new industries have been established in Australia since the war. know that what I have said are facts and that he misrepresented the position when he talked ashe did about the budget. He should also know that another loan w ill f a l l due for redemption in London on the 1st October, that the amount of that loan is £6,500,000 and that it w ill be redeemed. the stability of Australia. A report in the Sydney Morning Herald only a few days ago statedRepatriation is intended of the entire Victorian 3i per cent. £stg.6,055,000 loan maturing in London on October 1. The Prime Minister, Mr Chifley, announced in Canberra last night that the Loan Council had decided not to make a conversion offer to existing holders. Funds for redemption of the loan, he said, would be provided by the'Commonwealth Bank and the National Debt Sinking Fund. London loans amounting to £stg.9,500,000 were paid off and repatriated to Australia on July 1. In the current financial year, therefore, the amount of £stg.l5,555,000 will have been repatriated, when the impending operation is included. The speech of the honourable member for ""Wentworth was of the type that he He should know usually delivers. He never endeavours to be critical of a budget or to make constructive speeches in this chamber. As honourable members know, he normally confines his speeches to references to such subjects as communism, socialism and regimentation of the people by this Government. He endeavours to imply by half truths that there is a sinister motive behind the actions of the Governinent. Of course he knows, as well as do other honourable members, that this Government is seeking to secure greater prosperity and contentment for the people of this eountry. The honourable member referred at length to regimentation and compared it with the freedom that he enjoyed as a lad growing into manhood. He suggested that that kind of freedom should be preserved for the people of Australia. I remind the honourable member that to-day, four years after the cessation of hostilities in World War IL , there is a state of f u l l employment in this country. Everybody who is willin g and able to work has a job. But let us consider what was the position four years after the termination of World WarI . The honourable member stressed that He should care should be exercised with relation to ex-service men and women. On the 4th A p r i l , 1922, this statement appeared' in the Brisbane Courier with relation to an appeal for fundsFor many of our returned soldiers there is no work. They have tasted something that can be more bitter than war-unemployment . WhatA l l of those facts indicate makeshifts the brave fellows have resorted to in order to make ends meet God knowsselling soap and tape and little haberdasheries at our doors. The unemployment section of the Returned Soldiers and Sailors' Imperial League of Australia on the 19th A p r i l of that year listed 900 unemployed in Brisbane, 300 of whom were entirely without means of livelihood other than government rations. That was the kind of freedom that was enjoyed then. There were no labour exchanges such as we have to-day, no nnemployment bureaux to wbicb men could apply for work, and no organization to which they could apply for unemployment benents. Of course the honourable member says that he wants to see freedom in this country. tries to woo the electors, but I wonder if the people of this country are aware of the type of freedom that he means. About six weeks ago the Liberal party conducted a rally at Burnie, in Tasmania. Subsequently the following report appeared in the local newspaper:Three hundred business girls were entertained to lunch, political talks and a mannequin that debates are at times concluded hy the parade by the women's conimittee of the Liberal party in the Burnie Town Hall yesterday. With the aid of donations, it waa possible to pro.vide the girls with a luncheon for ls. The organizer ( Mrs. A.

The girls were provided with lunch on payment of ls. each, and then treated to a mannequin parade. politics, such, as we hear from the honourable member for ""Wentworth, was whispered in their ears. Perhaps there was some sinister reference to members of the Australian Labour party being socialists. The socialist tiger existed even in the days of Alfred Deakin. Perhaps it was suggested that the Australian. Labour party had some sinister intention with relation to the Oommonwealth Bank; that it favoured socialism in the worse form;, that the pennies would be taken out of people's pockets, and that f 1 notes would not he worth 5s. each.

Recently a booklet, Is This To-morrow, was distributed in Launceston. It is a publication consisting of 45 pages, and measuring about 11 inches by 7£ inches. On the frontispiece the hammer and sickle is superimposed on a map of Australia above the caption, Australia under Communism! On page 23 of this publication there is depicted what purports to be a picture of this chamber.. In that picture are a number of characters holding rifles with fixed bayonets, with the caption, That is the way that, he The Opposition is Effectively Suppressed.. This is a matter about which the honorable member for Wentworth should be able to enlighten us because of his activities with the New Guard. The suggestionis that the Opposition does not enjoy the rights and privileges to which it has always claimed to be entitled. Of course, having been a member of the Parliament for a number of years,. I know application of the gag. All governments use that expedient in order to complete their business. On one occasion. I recollect that a measure appropriating £60,000,000 was passed in a few minutes by an anti-Labour, government. That was achieved by the application of the gag. I point out that the gag has always been associated with the affairs of Doubtless something about government. In that respect the opinions of honourable members opposite are probably not different from those that were held by the Opposition during the seven years that I occupied a seat on the opposite side of the chamber. In view of distribution of scurrilous literature of this type, it is reasonable to ask what is the policy of honourable members opposite. Is it merely the same old policy of keeping the Labour Government out? Apparently the Opposition has no common policy.

I have another document which, having been produced by the trading banks, has a much more attractive appearance than has the pamphlet to which I have just referred. The front page reads as follows:Banking and Credit. A simple explanation of important facta you should know. On page 41, the following passage appears:The depression in Australia was mainly the result of the crisis overseas, the early effects of which reached Australia in the latter part of 1929. Critics assert that the banks immediately curtailed loans, thus making the depression more severe. The actual facts, however, reveal that when the depression first hit Australia, the banks helped their customers, and therefore the general community, by increasing advances from £257,000,000 in the March quarter of 1929 to £280,000,000 in the March quarter of 1930. This point is clearly shown by the following table:It is useless for the trading banks to assert that they did not call in overdrafts, because they did do so. The thumbscrew that they applied to persons 1 who were in financial difficulties during the depression years was responsible for many suicides and bankruptcies. At the end of the document appears the following note:Published by the Bank Employees' Committee. Authorized by W. H. J. Colville, 16 Barrack-street, Sydney. Thousands of pounds are being expended, not to publish a statement of the policy of the Opposition, but to spread statements that it is hoped will create a feeling of suspicion and distrust of the Labour Government in the minds of"" a sufficient number of people to lead to the defeat of the Government. Let me go back to 1928. The Labour party has always produced a statement of its policy at election time and told the people of what it hopes to achieve. In 1928, the Eight Honourable J. H . Scullin, who was then leader of the Labour party, saidNo more important question demands the attention of the National Parliament than the health of the community. Divided action by L13] State Governments will not suffice. Disease, man's deadly enemy, must be met by uniting the forces of the Commonwealth and the States. The heavy mortality, the suffering, aud the great economical loss can be considerably minimized. Cancer and tuberculosis take a heavy toll. More alarming still is the huge loss of infant life. Infantile mortality last year accounted for 7,283 children under one year of age. Large sums are annually spent in bringing immigrants to Australia while half the infants who die could be saved under a thorough system of medical attention. In 1928 Mr Scullin promised to do something to improve the health of the community, and we can now see the progress that has been made in that field by him and the men with whom he has been associated. The honourable member for ""Wentworth referred to the production of coal in Australia. In the depression years nobody cared two hoots whether the miners worked for two or three days a week only so long as the output of the coal mines was. 9,000,000 tons a year. The coal owners did not want more than 9,000,000 tons a year to be produced, and if production was maintained at that rate for a few years some mines were closed because the coal that had been produced could not be sold. Now we acquire 13,000,000 tons of coal a year to meet the greatly increased demand for coal to which our industrial expansion and greater prosperity have given rise. We want more miners and we want them to work every working day of the week. The honourable member for Wentworth indulged in a vague criticism of somebody somewhere because we have not sufficient coal to meet the need of our industries. This Government has endeavoured to increase coal production by mechanizing the coal mines, granting the miners better conditions and appointing an independent tribunal to deal with the miners' problem. That work will continue. I am sure that when the time comes for this Government to give an account of its stewardship, the people will endorse the policy that it has followed and intends to follow in the future. The Labour party will not make specious promises to the people. The Treasurer has certainly not done so in this budget. promises to do what can be done.",56,Liberal Party S Lunch For Girls
162,Mr Scully,"The Treasurer onlyia nothing in the budget that can be referred to as an election bribe. I think tliat the budget is a good one. I believe tiiat it is a lower cost-of-living budget and that the people will accept it as such. I belit ve that the people will have sufficient confidence in us to return to power the progressive Government which has done so much for them over the years. Progress reported.
