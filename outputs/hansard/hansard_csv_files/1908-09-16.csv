After consideration, I came to the conclusion that Mr Drummond should not be -dealt with in a manner different from the others charged with him, but much more lightly punished, and that he should not bo invited to resign.

The Committee having re-entered the chamber, presented the proposed Addres-?in-Reply, which was read by the CLERK, Â«is followsMAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCYWe, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. move That the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency's Speech, as read by the Clerk, be agreed to 6y the House. Parliament has to-day been opened by a new Governor General. We have said au revoir to the late Governor General, Lord Northcote, and to his excellent lady. Their sojourn amongst us has led to a great deal of good, and has endeared them to the people of Australia very greatly. We have the warmest sentiments towards Lord Northcote on account of his excellent and tactful administration, and the close interest that he always took in Australian .affairs, and towards Lady Northcote for the true patriotism she displayed at all times in regard fo everything connected with Australia. In fact, from the moment that they landed upon our shores until they regretfully departed, everything to them was Australian, and their one object seemed to be to advance in. every' way the best interests of the Commonwealth. We part with them with regret, and we feel certain that, in whatever part of the Old World they may happen to be, Australia will always have in them very strong champions. The present Governor General, Lord Dudley, comes to us with great recommendations, which, I believe, are thoroughly deserved. We had the honour of being represented by him at the Tercentenary celebrations recently held in Canada. He conveyed our greetings to the people of that Dominion, who are our kith and kin, and has told us to-day personally, although it has been previously announced officially, that he brings to the people of Australia, through this Parliament, the hearty reciprocal greetings of the Canadian people. His Excellency was also pleased to make a reference, which will be very gratifying to Australians, to the admirable manner in which the duty, which on this occasion was a pleasure, of welcoming the American Fleet was carried out, and to the magnificent reception given to our cousins from across the seas. The memory of that visit thrills the heart. The occasion will be written in history in the years to come. The lessons that it has taught are numerous. One is that, as was so often said when we were fraternizing with our relatives, the ties of blood are very strong. The Fleet came to us in peace, although war-clad. They conveyed to us a lesson which I am sure will later on be taken to heart by us. The House will agree with me that the thanks of Australia (Riverina). [3.18] I are due to the Prime Minister for the brilliant inspiration that months and months ago prompted him to offer the invitation from the Australian people to their cousins in America. I am, satisfied that all classes and all parties feel grateful to the Prime Minister for initiating that visit, and also for the part he took in conveying to our kith and kin, when here, our hearty feelings towards them. When the project was first mooted, the press could not agree about it , and even amongst individuals it .was thought impossible for a great nation like America to accept an invitation for its Fleet to visit a country like Australia, which was comparatively a new settlement. I shall never forget how, when the Prime Minister was addressing a vast audience in the Centennial 'Hall, in Sydney, trying to teach Australians as a whole their duty",16,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

72,Mr Chanter,"in defending this great heritage of ours, a telegram was handed up to him as he stood upon the platform. face beamed, and he read the message to the assembled audience. it made the building reverberate with cheer after cheer, for it showed that the Americans thought so much of Australia that their great Fleet would pay us a visit. From that moment there was no doubt about the heartiness and loyalty of the welcome that would be extended to them when they did arrive. entry into the harbour of Sydney, and afterwards into the port of Melbourne; how we fraternized with them and they with us; how, as the days rolled on, the feelings of one to the other grew deeper and deeper-al l these things are now matters of history. Above all, their visit taught the world that there was a place' called Australia. Although it should have been to the interests, and was the duty, of the English press to hold up Australia as a place where l if e and liberty were always secure, it is regrettable that Australians who have visited the Old Country should have had from time to time occasion to complain that while in the English press they could read plenty about our brethren in Canada, they could find nothing about Australia. Australia in the' press there at all, it was, unfortunately, to our detriment-som e little catch phrase that had been uttered in party conflict in Australia, and was seized upon by the English press to be given to the people of Great Britain. Thus the people in other parts of the world have been unable to form a true idea of the kind of place that Australia is. going on. recognition of this country by a great nation to the Commonwealth. like America, and the reports of the movements of its Fleet in the press of the world, will teach people abroad that Australia is a good place fo live in. The visit of the Fleet has done a great deal for us, and we are thankful to the American people for having sent it Not only are we bound by ties of kinship to them, but we have also the same aims, ambitions, and aspirations, and seek the same goal. The magnificent Fleet which America has made from its own products, by its own energies, merely for defensive purposes, has taught us that we have delayed too long in making similar preparations, and that it is time to commence to put ourselves on the defensive. as large as that of America. when the population of the United States was no greater than our population is now.

I feel certain that I have every member with me in what I have said in regard to the visit of the American warships. I trust, hope, and believe, that the new Governor General will be as tactful, as resourceful, as patribtic, and as successf u l as his brilliant predecessors. The speech .delivered by His Excellency this afternoon is not lengthy, but contains multum in parvo. If members will put party If there was anything about feeling on one side, and deal patriotically with national interests, this Parliament may establish a new era of prosperity for Australia. The Government promise to deal, first, with the Capital Site question^ I do not know why this matter is to be brought forward so early, though I understand that it is thought desirable to settle a vexed question as soon as possible. I shall not now go into all the pros and cons of the subject. Every means have been taken to obtain a proper choice. The Government of New South Wales, in the first instance, appointed a Commissioner to report on the No doubt; but the best sites available, and these were offered Members of this Parliament have also from time to time visited the selected sites, and after exhaustive debates, the Parliament has chosen one of them. AB ill is now to be introduced for ratifying what has been done, and its discussion will give opportunity for the moving of an amendment. I hope that when it is disposed of all parties will abide by the decision come to, and be ready to uphold the right of this Parliament to choose that site which it considers best in the' interests of Australia.

80,Mr Chanter,"If the Governmentplease every one; it may not please me, as. the last did not; but when Parliament has come to a deliberate decision, the matter should end there. The next item on the programme is national defence, upon which I shall not speak at length, as there will be to what is termed the neiv protection other opportunities to discuss it. The hearts policy. of the people have been stirred in regard to this matter, and a referendum would show that they are of opinion that it now devolves upon this Parliament to lay down proper lines of defence for land and sea. I recognise the financial problems involved. But if one consideration more than another induced the States to federate, it was the feeling that it would be impossible for six disunited States to act together, and that, if clanger came, it would be necessary to meet i't with a strong force, under a single strong administration. We have the means for defence, but they need regulating by the formulation of a proper system. We cannot afford to dally longer with this quesstance, the High Court has declared that tion. The States must recognise that if the one-fourth of the Customs revenue now allotted to Commonwealth expenditure is insufficient to provide for defence, we must take as much more as may be necessary to protect our great heritage. I hope, therefore, that, before the session closes, a scheme will be adopted under which we shall go on increasing our defensive strength, so that in the not far distant future we may be able to say to the Mother Country, upon which we have relied too long, "" We are in a position to help you by' defending ourselves."" with which Parliament will be called upon to deal is the acquisition of the Northern Territory, which is connected with defence considerations. It is well known that one of the States has found it impossible to properly control the destinies of this portion of Australia, and that it thinks that the territory can be better administered under the Australian Parliament than under a State Parliament. Certain offers have been made which will be detailed to the House. We know that the territory possesses a large area of fertile land, upon which, perhaps, millions could be successfully settled. If this came about, it would greatly assist in the defence of Australia. The territoryhas at times been described as a barren waste ; but those who have taken the trouble to read what has been written about it by' those who have traversed it, or who have talked with others who have been there, must recognise its value, and Mr Chanter. assent to its acquisition by the Commonwealth as soon as possible. In dealing with this question I hope that party ties will be forgotten, and only the best interests of Australia studied. I come now The Constitution, which was' framed by some of our best men, and accepted by the people, is left for interpretation to the High Court of Australia. It often happens, however, that after projects of legislation have been debated ad nauseam, and a Parliament thinks that it has clearly expressed its views, the Court called upon to interpret an Act declares that it bears a meaning contrary to that intended. Such decisions, however, afford no excuse for railing at the Courts, whose Judges are bound to interpret the laws according to their oaths and consciences. But the .people who accepted the Constitution have the right to alter it. In this in this 'Parliament does not possess certain powers which I think it is the desire of the people that we should have. It is the wish of the people that the protection of industries should benefit, not only manufacturers, but also those who assist them in the production of wealth. Therefore, it is our duty to ask them if they are satisfied to allow the Constitution to remain as interpreted by the High Court. I think that their answer will be clear. They will say that they desire to enlarge its provisions in order to give us the power The next matter which the High Court says we do not now possess, and I congratulate the Government on having determined to deal with the matter. Its consideration may provoke a certain amount of controversy; but I think that, in the end, the prosperity of our people will be benefited. One of the greatest problems with which we shall have to deal is that of the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth' and the States. I do not wish _ to say anything which might cause irritation to the authorities of the States. We have had a reference to the necessity for measures relating to the improvement of our defence system, to the acquisition of the Northern Territory, and^ to the construction of railway lines, across this great continent, so that all the States may be connected. The States Legislatures must recognise that it is impossible for us to carry out these undertakings in the absence of the necessary funds, and that the one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue now allotted to us under the Constitution is absolutely insufficient to enable us to make provision for all that is required at our hands. The financial difficulty is a pressing one. Why should the States feel aggrieved when we propose that our present proportion of Customs and Excise revenue shall be increased? We are seeking to advance the interests of those whom the States Legislatures represent, and if the Federal Parliament can spend money wisely for the benefit of the whole of the people of Australia, surely the States should"" not complain. that the Commonwealth Government have made the States one of the most liberal offers that could be conceived. member refer to the Treasurer's offer? that it was not at once acceptedStates must meet this question of finance face to face, just as we have to meet it. We must obtain money by some means or other, because Australia demands that we shall deal with all the great undertakings to which I have alluded. honestly if possible. time. If the States deny us our rights in this respect, then, in order that Ave may faithfull y discharge our duties, we must take other action, but we do not desire to be compelled to do so. I hope that the negotiations now proceeding between the Commonwealth and the States will have a satisfactory issue, and that they will do away with the friction which has occurred, and which is unpatriotic and antagonistic to the well-being of the.people as a whole. managed up to the present time to build their railways ? right honourable member and I are not at one on this phase of the question. Hitherto the States have constructed railways out of loan moneys; but I have always been opposed to borrowing, believing that we should live within our revenue, and that, for developmental purposes at all events, we should not have recourse to loan moneys. There is no doubt that proposals will be made to raise loans for big undertakings, but I repeat that I have always been opposed to borrowing, and think that I always will be. Like the right honourable member for Swan, I want to see these great lines of railways constructed, but I think that if we put more people on the land, and so increase our production, our revenue will expand, and we shall find it unnecessary to have recourse to a policy of borrowing in order to build them. In this respect we owe a duty, not only to ourselves, but to posterity. We have no right to continue to saddle posterity with the cost of various big works. We should have the courage to say that we are prepared to do our duty, and, as far as possible, to keep within our means. I believe right to pay for some of the benefits it will receive at our hands? wish, at this stage, to trench upon that Does the honourable phase of the question. Up to the present, the States have borrowed something like Yes ; I am astounded Â£[244,000,000. Had that money been exT n e pended upon reproductive works only we should not have such an outcry against the system as we have; but we know f u l l well that a considerable proportion of that huge sum has been expended on nonproductive works. Some of the States have been more lavish than have others We must obtain it in the expenditure of loan moneys, and it was their action that caused the National Honestly all the Parliament, very wisely I think, at the outset of its career to say that it was determined to live within its means, and not to borrow. towns are deriving the benefit, whilst the country is getting nothing. would not say that if he visited my electorate. ber for Maranoa is raising another question. I recognise quite as f u l l y as he does the necessity of developing the country, and know that there are many means by I am afraid that the which its progress and prosperity may be promoted. We need to settle the country, but we ought not to put people on the land unless we can hold out to them some prospect of prosperity. If we continue the development of Australia by means ^of the false and vicious system of borrowing, with the result that the people will have to be heavily taxed, we shall make a grave mistake. This Parliament has laid down the lines on which the Commonwealth may be most properly developed, and I hope that we shall continue to follow them. Another matter of the utmost importance to which reference is made in the Governor General's speech, is the necessity of establishing",18,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

103,Mr Chanter,"The honourable mem-sure, that I differentiate between iron and .steel imported from within the Empire, and iron and steel imported from without-that I favour a preference to the former. I .should like to direct attention to a proposal which was mentioned in a previous ses1 sion, to establish a Commonwealth Bureau -of Agriculture. there is an absence of information, which, however, will doubtless be supplied in the forthcoming debate on the subject. some means or other, members of the States -Governments havebecome possessed of the idea that the establishment of a Commonwealth Bureau of Agriculture will have -the effect of injuring the agricultural prospostage really going to be dealt with this perity of the States, while, as a matter of fact, the reverse will be the effect.

As a matter of fact, the Federal Bureau would be an auxiliary organization, which, -by monetary and other assistance, would tend to develop to the fullest extent the agricultural resources of each State, and it is in the interests of one and all of the States that there should be such an institution as quickly as possible. pressing, I only casually allude to the intentions of the Government as disclosed in His Excellency's speech in reference to the federalizing of the law relating to public -companies, bankruptcy, marine insurance, and bills of exchange, and also in regard Electoral Law, the Public Service Act, .and Penny Postage. are, no doubt, very necessary' reforms; but, there is a difference of opinion as to whether or not it is wise and politic to establish it now. My opinion, which I have expressed before, is that, whatever we may -do in regard to penny postage, we should, at least, have uniform postage throughout the Commonwealth. At present there are -differences in this connection; and it is most desirable that there should be one uniform stamp to carry letters to all parts of Australia. For instance, penny postage is found in Victoria, and, I think, in some of the other States; but beyond these we find that letters require a stamp of twice the value. This is a most irritating condition In this regard, again, of affairs, which causes a lot of friction, especially on the borders of States.

Eveni f what the honourable member for Angas says is true, should we, therefore, deprive settlers of telephones? Certain facilities were afforded to country residents by the States Governments prior to Federation, and a rumour has got abroad that these facilities are to be curtailed on the ground that their provision does not pay. I was, therefore, glad to hear to-day, in answer to a question by me, that there is no such intention on the part of the Government; and I am sure we all recognise that it would be absolutely impossible to serve the country people as they ought to be served if the postal strictly from the pounds, shillings, and pence point of view. taken. I should be very sorry to I condemn. This expenditure ought to be regarded as developmental, with a view to placing people on the land. As a matter of fact, about the only blessing or pleasure which people havein remote districts is the receipt of the mails once or twice a week; and it would be manifestly unjust to reduce the services in any way, even if otherwise a loss should be entailed. I thank honourable members for I am perfectly certhe cordial manner in which they have received my remarks. I trust that what I have said may have some influence, and that, during the present session, we shall rise above the interests of parties, and be all for Australia-that we shall strive, not merely to displace one Government for another, but to pass the best legislation as quickly as possible, and doing our duty without fear or favour, earn for Australia [4.9] I join heartily with the honourable member for Riverina in his appreciation of the work done by the late Governor General.

We know that in the Easti the action of America has been most carefully watched, and those of us who take any interest at all in international questions must feel that it will at least have a very far-reaching effect upon the future of Australia and the Southern Pacific. The proposal of the Government with regard to the New Protection, will, I think, meet with the hearty approval and support of all sections of the House. The leader of the Opposition in Sydney recently assured the Commonwealth that he would give his support to the Government in their efforts to have the new protection principle finally placed within the scope of our Constitution. a speech or an interview which was reported in the press quite recently. I , as a protectionist, desire to assure the House that I would not be the protectionist I am-woul d not be in favour of the duties that I recently supportedwere I not assured that the Government intended to secure some share of the benefits to those who work in our factories in the various industries which we have been protecting. Until the Commonwealth can give adequate protection by means of wages and labour conditions to those who are engaged in protected industries, I , for one, maintain that our protection, if not altogether futile, falls far short of what we desire, and of what those who are engaged in those industries undoubtedly deserve. The spectacle of manufacturers shifting from one State to another in order to escape wages boards, or the effects of other/industrial laws which have been enacted by the States, should not be allowed to continue. We have seen, and can see to-day, I regret to state, manufacturers who are moving their sphere of operations from the places where they have been engaged for years, in order! to go to another part of Australia where the laws are not so stringent, where the wages are lower, and where the Statutes do not provide for proper conditions for their workmen. We can have no true Federation so long as this unfair competition has to be met by/' those who do provide for their workmen a proper degree of that protection which they themselves enjoy. I regard the Capital Site question as being finally settled, but as a Federalist, I desire to remove every cause of irritation. I admit that there is a certain amount of irritation caused by the selection of the place which has already been fixed upon as the Capital Site, and by the fear of a certain number of peoplewho are entitled, of course, to consideration-that they will not get all the benefits which it was intended should accrue to the State of New South Wales when the question was dealt with in the framing of the Constitution. Their number is, perhaps, very small as compared with the population of Australia, but a great deal of political capital has been made out of the question, and it has been placed upon a plane much lower than it should occupy. The selection of the future home of this Parliament, and of the Government of Australia, should be a question altogether above party, and should: be dealt D i d he say that? with as one of the most important that can engage the attention either of the people or of Parliament. In those circumstances, I am prepared to give every opportunity to those who desire to alter the decision of Parliament, and allow them a further chance to substitute some other site-mor e favorable from their point of view. But I do hope that when the question is thus dealt with-and I understand that the Government intend to make it one of the first measures, if not the first measure of the session-w e shall have a cessation of hostilities and an honourable agreement amongst ourselves that it shall be regarded as finally settled so far as Parliament is concerned. The question of defence is one in which I personally have taken some interest. I have been connected with the defence forces of Victoria for something like fifteen years, and during the whole time. I have been in Parliament I have given special attention to the subject. I am delighted to find that the Government are determined that there shall be removed from Australia once and for ever the stigma which it undoubtedly bears ai present, of having an inadequate system of defence. I need not draw the attention of honourable members to the necessity of dealing with the question. I believe that they, as well as the people of Australia, have at last become fully seized of its vast importance, and are determined that it shall be dealt with speedily. Any one looking at the vacant spaces in this continent must at once be struck with the need of some action on the part of Parliament and people to protect the Commonwealth by dealing with them. There has been a marked alteration in public opinion during the last few years. I can remember that in the Victorian Parliament, only a year or",23,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

129,Dr. Carty Salmon,"Yes, in eithertwo before Federation was inaugurated, the cadets were alluded to as toy soldiers, the cadet system being decried from various parts of the House, and belittled on every possible occasion. But the display at the review on the occasion of the visit of the Duke of York, I believe, altered all that. We had from that very day a marked change in public opinion, which has grown and developed to such an extent that there is now in Australia no more popular part of the Defence Forces than are the cadets. We all recognise that these lads, by giving up their time to drill, by placing themselves under discipline, and going through various physical exercises, are making themselves very much better citizens of Australia than they otherwise would be. tion, we are laying the foundations, at the very root of our defence system, of a body of men who, if the need unhappily should arise, will be found the most effective defenders that we shall have upon the whole continent. With regard to the naval side of defence, those of us who were in the first Parliament will remember that Parliament decided that the defence vote should be reduced by a .very large sum. It was reduced by, I think, ^133,000. It was intended that the reduction should be made mainly by dispensing with the trappings and trimmings of the service, but we found that it was the naval side of the service that suffered when the cutting down took place. There was very little objection taken to that at the time, but here again a development in public opinion has taken place, and today we find the attention of people and Parliament directed more especially to the questo keep this country white is inviting attack,tion of naval defence. In our early years we decided to almost completely abolish the volunteer system. As a volunteer, I deprecated that very strongly. I felt that a very grave mistake was made at the time, but it was done, 'and we now have a system which is nearly altogether a militia one. Concurrently with that, however, a very much greater encouragement was given to our rifle clubs, and this to a certain extent compensated for what I believe was a mistaken policy in the direction I have indicated. Commonwealth 'services, there cannot be two opinions. If we were in danger of invasion, it would be seen at once that we are not in a position to properly and effectively defend our country. Some of us may feel that those dangers have been overestimated, but one needs only to go to some of the countries of the East, or read about Dr. Carty Salmon. them, or talk to those who have been there, to be struck with the almost immediate possibilities of some trouble from that quarter. Japan, flushed with success in her recent war with a white race, is, as we know, now looking further afield, and Australia undoubtedly affords her one of the most ready means of getting rid of her surplus population.

In order that we may fit ourselves to take our own part it is necessary that we should pursue the steps which I believe the Government intend to propose. I ask honourable members to look at China. not going to invite an attack from China; but I cannot close my eyes or my mouth to the happenings in that country. China is now playing a part such as she has never played before. roused by those in authority to take a greater interest in their government than they have ever taken, and the result has been the most effective trade boycott known in the history of the world. That boycott could not have been brought about without organization and the successful appeal to national sentiment. I have it on the authority of one who has seen it that in China to-day large bodies of men are being drilled with almost feverish activity. -Those men are being prepared for some work; is it the work of defence or of offence? We are justified in viewing these happenings as a reason for preparing purselves to play our part when the inevitable trouble happens. is to effectively occupy its territory. I should like now to say a word or two in regard to naval defence. A new factor is entering into the navies of the world. Until recently it has been considered necessary to man warships with those who have had maritime experience; our men-o'-warsmen have been drawn mostly from the seaports of the countries which they have been called upon to defend. But a remark made by Admiral Sperry at Albany a day or two since is pregnant with meaning. those manning his fleet were not drawn from the seaports of the United States. We know that they have come from all parts. But we must also recognise that the skilled men of the fleet are not sailors in the ordinary acceptation of the term; they are, first ot all, gunners, and, next, men accustomed to machinery. It is on the control of guns and the use of machinery that the value of the men-o'-warsmen must in the future [2]2 depend. The Commonwealth should, therefore, at the earliest opportunity, take steps to perfect its defenders in gunnery. It is well to encourage rifle shooting, but we must pay most attention to our first line of de r fence, and must, therefore, give every encouragement to the production of excellence in big gun practice. We are doing a great deal to foster rifle shooting, and I hope that the Minister of Defence will find means to deal still more liberally with our rifle clubs. ItI am is a regrettable fact that Great Britain is not keeping her Navy up to the two-power standard. Other nations-tw o in particular -ar e rapidly approaching her in the building of large warships, and, in one case, at Her people are being any rate, have gone still further. When Great Britain commenced to build Dreadnoughts, she found that Germany and France were prepared to spend immense sums in emulating and beating her. While she was building an 18,000-ton vessel, they were building vessels of 22,000 tons. The record of the Indomitable is one for us to be proud of, seeing that, notwithstanding her immense bulk and enormous displacement, she can beat the fleetest ocean greyhound now afloat. We must take great pride in the fact that our naval architects and builders have been able to produce such a vessel. We are also told that there is in the possession of the British Government a gun which can project a shell from London to Paris. We have that on the word of a very high military authorityI read the statement in an article recently written by an officer who had had an opportunity to examine the gun. If this gun will accomplish what is claimed for it, war in the old sense is at an end. Some of U5 have been accustomed to look upon the conquest of the air as sure to bring about the abolition of warfare, but arms having such an enormous effective range as I have mentioned will make it impossible for countries to indulge in the old forms of war, and instead of appeals to arms, the warfare of the future will be international industrial struggles. The old He said that idea was diat the establishment of an Australian Navy would bring about the separation of this country from the Old Land, but that is not now held by thinking people. There was, in the conservative mind, the impression that the desire for an Australian Navy was only the expression of the desire to cut the painter. But public opinion has changed, and to-day this project is viewed by die public men of Australia with much",25,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

141,Dr. Carty Salmon,"Undoubtedly.more favour than it was in the past. We cannot accuse the public men of Great Britain of wishing to encourage the people of Australia to separate from the Empire, and yet, day after day, cablegrams appear in the press advising us to form a Navy of our own. huge fleet of ocean-going battleships; it would be built for defence rather than offence, and designed to protect the territory of the Commonwealth. shall always remain part of the British Empire. We can be sure that the great ocean trade routes will be kept open by the British Navy, and we can best assist the Mother Country in doing that by looking after our own coastal defence, thus relieving her of the enormous expense at present entailed by the maintenance of a Squadron in these waters. What we need are floating batteries, vessels constructed not so much for speed, or to steam long distances, as for effective gunnery, and power to withstand attack. They should be armoured, and should possess very heavy guns, being thus able to resist the heaviest ordnance, and to place the strongest barrier between our territory and those who would assail it . Then we must secure a Naval Commandant who will thoroughly understand the work which he will be requi'red to perform. from ? Britain the greatest naval power in the world. who would be glad to come to Australia our naval defence upon a satisfactory footing. We must depend upon the vast and wide experience of those who have made that subject a special study, and would be prepared to do their best to secure us from attack. The Government propose, I understand, to provide for the compulsory miliIjary training of citizens during certain periods. I at first viewed compulsion in this matter with great disfavour. As I have said, I was a volunteer, and so was every male member of my family. We did our best to fit ourselves to defend our country, and we felt that others should do the same. Unfortunately, experience shows that our citizens are so careless regarding their responsibility in this direction that, even when service is paid for, it is with the greatest difficulty that they are prevailed upon to undertake this duty. We have the right to assume that this House is composed of the most public-spirited men in Australia. Its members have devoted their best years to the highest exercise of citizenship. But proportionately how small is the number of those who have qualified for the defence of their country ! The percentage of trained men being so small in this assembly, how An Australian Navy would not be a much smaller must it be outside! I have thus been forced by the irresistible logic of facts to join the ranks of those who advocate some form of compulsory military I trust that we training, although at its inception the idea was repugnant to me. It must be admitted to be the duty of every able-bodied citizen to prepare himself for the defence of his country. We are a democratic people, and do not wish to buy from others immunity from attack. We do not desire to hire mercenaries for our protection who mavj as mercenaries have done in other times and in other countries, ultimately become our masters. Guided by the teachings of history, we must see that it is the duty of our able bodied citizens to protect this country, and as they are not in sufficient numbers fitting themselves to do so, the State must compel them. There should be no substituted service. Every man who is physically able to fight in defence of his country should be compelled to go into camp for so many days in the year. member allow no exemptions? only imbeciles, and those physically unfit. If some honourable members had their way_, we There are British officers should have in time of war only an undisciplined mob to protect Australia. Buti f we for the purpose of placing are to take notice of portents, the time <will come when we shall need a well-trained properly disciplined force for our protection. To this end the cadet system requires development. In this we must have the loyal co-operation and assistance of the Governments of the States, which control the educational systems of the Commonwealth. The rifle corps should be fostered, and the militia and volunteer regiments preserved. I am glad to find from the press that it is not intended to dispense with the militia, but that it is to be used, as it should be, to form the nucleus of our new force. The leaders should be efficient and energetic. No one feels more keenly than I do regarding the desirableness of employing Australian men as well as Australian material for Australian needs; but I must say in this connection that I regret what took place at the review at Flemington the other day. It is by their work that our officers must be judged. I was one of those",26,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

As the rethey did remarkably good work. The result of a great deal of persuasion and pressure he agreed to try the experiment of appointing an Australian officer as D.A.A.G. Two officers were specially singled out for the position. The idea was that one of it-hem, Colonel-no w Major-General-Hoad should occupy, it for five years, and that he should be succeeded by Colonel Umphelby. Colonel Hoad took the position, but shortly afterwards the Commonwealth was established, and other arrangements were made. when I saw the higgledy-piggledy manner in which some of our troops were marched along the straight past the saluting point at P lemington the other day, ' I could not help wishing, for the first, and, I hope, the last time, that we had here one of those smart up-to-date energetic young officers whom we used to obtain from the Old Country. The review showed mismanagement, inefficiency, and incapacity. The responsible officer, by keeping a number of men huddled together before the saluting point, with their eyes turned to the right, for minutes at a time, showed that he was incapable either of organizing or of handling a body of men. mand? fault was not the officer in supreme command, but the Deputy Assistant AdjutantGeneral, who, by the way, received from the press all the credit for what was described as a masterly effort. Any one who is at all familiar with the handling of troops will admit, however, that it was a wretched, miserable muddlePrime Minister, and the Minister of Defence, have written to the officers concerned who, when he returned to Australia, was congratulating them upon the success of the review.

I do not wish to labour this point, for this is not the proper time to doso, but I will say that the senior and junior cadets set their seniors an example by the manner in which they went up to and got past the saluting point in order to make way for them. Reference has been made to-day, by way of a question to the MinisI must confess that ter, to the absence of the,Inspector-General from Australia during a time when the whole of the Defence system of the Commonwealth will be in the melting pot. I cannot understand why the Minister should have seen fit to send away from the country, when this question is to be discussed in Parliament, our senior military officer, who has been specially trained in Australia;, and has a full!, appreciation of Australian sentiment. If ever there can be a time when a responsible officer should be at the elbow of the Minister, it is whilst this question is being dealt with. to whom we must look, and who should be ready to come to the assistance of the Minister and Parliament in dealing with this most important question. I wish at this juncture to express the hope that more consideration will be given to those who have specially qualified themselves for service in Australia. Australian officers have been exchanged with British officers, and in the press to-day we read of a smart young. Australian officer, full of energy and enthusiasm, who was sent to England by the Government to qualify himself, and thought to know too much for his seniors, with the result that it was said that there was no work for him to do here. He has now accepted a staff appointment in the British Army and has sailed away. That state of affairs should not exist. We cannot afford to incur the expense of training men for service in Australia merely to put them out of harness directly they qualify themselves. A number of young men who have passed certain examinations the various States are sent home to obtain a military training. We leave them there,",27,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

201,Mr Deakin (Ballarat,"Minister of the obligations which I am sure we all feel towards them. Under these circumstances, I ask the House to adopt the brief address which I will read. The reason for submitting it at once is not only that this is the first occasion on which we have had an opportunity of expressing ourselves, but also because the address-whic h adopted by the Senate this afternoonwhen agreed to by this House, can be transmitted to-night-if the President of the Senate and Mr Speaker will be good enough' to cause it to be telegraphed-to Thursday Island, where, to-morrow morning, it will reach Lord and Lady Northcote at the last outpost of Australia. I move That the following address to Lord Northcote, the late Governor General, be agreed to by this House :To LORD NORTHCOTE We, the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, desire to express to Your Lordship our grateful recognition of the judgment and ability, zeal, and courtesy, with which as Governor General of Australia you devoted yourself unremittingly to the duties and opportunities of your exalted office. In your intimate association with both Houses of Parliament your relations have been at all times cordial, constitutional, and considerate of their great responsibilities. You have brought to bear in the exercise of your duties an exceptional knowledge of the vast territory and scattered population of the Commonwealth, in gaining which no considerations of personal convenience have been permitted to enter. The unsparing kindness and generosity on the part of Her Excellency and yourself in promoting all movements for charity or culture, the encouragement of local aptitudes, and the development of a patriotic spirit, are universally acknowledged. We desire to add a further assurance to those already so freely and widely bestowed of the high value and permanent influence of your and Lady Northcote's many activities, and of the abiding affection, esteem) and gratitude of the people of Australia. The few words in which our farewell is expressed are, of course inadequate to convey a tithe of that we would desire to have expressed on such an occasion. As I have been privileged already on two occasions to express on my own behalf and that of my colleagues our feelings Lord and Lady Northcote, I shall not trespass upon the House noon ; although if it were opportune to do so, I could say much more without repeating fore. From personal knowledge of them, 1 Mr Deakin. I know that they were not only content to do, but anxious to do a very great dealamong us without receiving any publicrecognition whatever. With what Lord and Lady Northcote have done, officially, the public are generally acquainted, but thealmost innumerable instances in which they have personally exceeded the official dutieshas been ' unanimously of their position, by acts of kindness, of forethought, or of assistance to those in. want or suffering, are more than we car* count. We also know that it was their desire to leave Australia as quietly and with as little display as possible. That could not be permitted. Fortunately for us the people took it out of our hands, and out of their hands, too. The consequence has been that in every State in which they have recently appeared there has been an outbreak of affection and regard such as I think has never been witTHE RIGHT Honorable HENRY STAFFORD, nessed in Australia-a t all events, I am : sure that it has not been witnessed upon such a universal scale. There is a great deal that has not yet been said of them which need not be phrased because it isknown to all. We speak to-night for our constituents-for the whole community as well as for the whole Parliament-whe n we transmit this address. Lord and Lady Northcote have been personally known to, and have personally known, every member of both Houses of this Parliament-ever y member who now holds a seat in it , and every one who has Held a seat in it during their sojourn amongst us. They have known, as well, all those who were associated with them in the discharge of their many duties. We are, therefore, peculiarly competent to speak from our own acquaintance with their Excellencies as well as from our general knowledge of what they have achieved in this country. I have great pleasure in moving the adoption of art address which in no way attempts to recite all their claims on our affectionate regard. to first obtain the concurrence of the House to the submission of the motion without notice. Is it the pleasure of honourable members that the Prime Minister have leave to. submit the motion, without notice? towards Honorable MEMBERS -Hear, hear. this after[5.18] -It is not necessary to add to the words already uttered by ""the Prime Minister in order toexpress our entire concuranything that I have said berence in the happily-chosen address which has been proposed by him.

I should just like to say that Lord and Lady Northcote are persons who know -exactly how to appraise appreciation of their services. They are vice-regal representatives with whom we could talk freely. Speaking of the Governor General himself, I do not think that I have ever met a shrewder man or one who exhibited less ostentation in tbe discharge of bis high and important duties. He has had a long experience of every constitutional position under the British Crown, .and he has acquitted himself so well that those who may hereafter fill the distinguished office of Governor General of the Commonwealth will need to be upon their We expected, of finally pass from our shores, but also to the but also to the Empire. to me, and, as I thought it was avery Question resolved in the affirmative. a copy of theaddress by telegraph, to Lord"" House adjourned at 5.34 p.m.",33,Address To Lord Northcote
