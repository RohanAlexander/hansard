How-, ever, that is a matter of which the House or I can have no knowledge until it has been inquired into. The Minister has a perfect right to present a petition which is respectfully worded and contains a prayer; but I think it was proper for him to warn the House in regard to certain facts relating to it. I see no reason why the motion, that the petition be received should not be put, for the House to agree to or reject, as honourable members may think fit. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE ) proposedThat the petition be received.

44,Mr Bowden Presented A Petition From,"NEW a personal explanation. Acting Prime Minister charged me with having made some statements which were absolute!)' incorrect concerning something which he had said about the Premier of New South Wales. I understood the Acting Prime Minister to say that Mr Carruthers had increased the expenditure of New South Wales to the extent of £2,000,00 0 while he had been Premier. When, later on, I attempted to prove that that was not the case, by quoting the actual figures, the Acting Prime Minister indignantly denied that he had made any such statement; and his denial, of course, was accompanied by the cheers of honourable members opposite. So indignant were his denials that I thought at one time he was likely to take a fit. I was inclined to believe that perhaps, after all, I might have been mistaken, but I determined, before saying one word upon the matter, to wait patiently until I had an opportunity to see the Hansard report. In the Hansard proofs supplied to me to-day, I find that it is reported that, during the course of my speech last night, the Acting Prime Minister interjectedDid the honourable member say I had increased with a statement to the effect that the exthe expenditure of New South Wales by penditure of New South Wales had in.^a,ooo,ooo ? The report proceeds as followsMinister has endeavoured to saddle upon Mr think that if the honourable member will Carruthers the responsibility for an increased expenditure of ^2,000,000 on the part of New read the report of the speech made by me South Wales.

Those are the honourable member's words. Sir wrong. I have not seen the Hansard proof. orable member had better not talk, of what he knows very little about. The report continuesmember is mistaken. creased the expenditure, and the Commonwealth has supplied him with the money. Last night the the Hansard report of the short speech which I delivered, I think, by way of explanation, and in which I quoted the correct figures regarding the expenditure of New South Wales. W i ll it be believed that, five minutes before making the indignant denials to which I have referred, the Acting Prime Minister had made use of the expressions'I have quoted? I said in the explanation that I madeAmongst other statements made by him was one that Mr Carruthers, during his term of office as Premier of New South Wales, had sent up the expenditure of that State by ^2,000,000 per annum. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I quoted them, too. distinct statement made five minutes before the honourable member's indignant denial. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [3.32] -B y way of personal explanation, I desire to say that I have not yet seen the copy of Hansard to which the honourable member has referred. I do not know what were the exact words that T used, but if I made the interjection quoted by the honourable member, I followed it up creased by over £2,000,00 0 since the establishment of Federation.

We have his assurance that the petition is genuine. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I said that it came to me from a leading solicitor of Wagga, and that attached to it are some names which I know not to be genuine. ber has no reason to believe that the petition itself is other than genuine. He has told us that he"" saw several persons sign it.

A t any rate, he has told us that there are signatures attached to it which are genuine, and I maintain that if one signature is genuine, the petition must be regarded as genuine, although there may be a number of other signatures which are not genuine, signed, perhaps, by some wag possessing a peculiar sense of humour. I maintain that a petition to which one genuine signature is attached should be received as a genuine petition. From what the Acting Prime Minister said, there seems to be no doubt in his own mind as to the genuineness of this petition, although he takes exception to the manner in which signatures were obtained to it. Under the circumstances there is no need for further action by the House. It seems to me that the honourable member for Lang misses the point of the objection to this petition, which is that a right which British communities have long enjoyed has, in this instance, been apparently abused, and if notice is not taken of the matter, it The point which I wish will tend to bring the practice of petitioning Parliament into still greater disrepute than it is in at the present time. horsoiable member suggest that this is the first occasion on which this sort of thing has happened? adopted to obtain signatures to petitions are so loose and open to abuse of every kind that petitions have practically ceased to be of any value, so f ar as influencing Parliament in regard to matters of policy is concerned, and, on being received, are practically thrown into the waste-paper basket, no one talcI did not say that. ing any notice of their contents. Of course, attention is paid to the petitions of private individuals praying for the redress of grievances; but it would be preposterous to expect members of Parliament to depart from fiscal principles to which they were pledged, merely because of the presentation of a petition signed by Brown, Jones, and Robinson, praying the House to adopt a certain policy. The petitioning of ParliaI did not say that. ment has come to be an absolute farce, except when individual grievances are concerned. In my opinion, honourable members should not consider -themselves bound to present petitions merely because they have been forwarded to them from their electorates, and I think that the Acting Prime Minister should not have presented this petition, seeing that he knew it to be improperly signed. If any one sent me a petition from my electorate, in connection with which I could easily discover some fraud, I should regard it as an act of discourtesy, and should return it, with the intimation that I would not present a petition which was not in proper form. fectly proper course to take. ing a number of signatures falsely applied, either in joke or in earnest, were sent to me, I should regard the sending of it as an act of discourtesy. Those who get up petitions should insure, as far as possible, that abuses do not occur. As to the motion before the Chair, I have no objection to an inquiry. Personally, I do not think that it will achieve very much but if it brings home to the public the fact that Parliament is not inclined to allow petitioning to become a farce, it will do a certain amount of good.",22,Chapman Edenmay Be Ther E Appear Signatures Which Have

The result was that in six cases out of ten I found that the signatures were absolute forgeries, while, in the case of the other signatures, I found that the electors had had. placed before them two petitions with directly opposite objects. If the elector proved not to be a true party man, be was asked to sign the second petition; and the facts disclosed a grave state of affairs.

Sir, On Friday last, the 13th instant, there appeared in the Argus a short article on the New Hebrides, which from its wording might be thought to have emanated from the Foreign Missions Committee of our Church, or from some one in authority in our Church. We have been requested by the Foreign Missions Committee, which met to-day, to write and state that the Committee knows nothing of it-doe s not endorse it, and is at a loss to think who could have inspired it, as it is contrary to the facts of the case.

164,Mr Mahon,"I desire to make a briefwith the totals in the tabulated statement appearing in Hansard. I understand from the Chief Parliamentary Reporter that alterations will be made in the second edition and the permanent volume, with the object of making my totals correspond with the totals given in the tabulated statement; but I find it necessary to make this explanation in case it may appear to any person reading the temporary issue of the record that I was so careless as to quote incorrect figures. I .should like to also add that, according to the Melbourne Age of to-day, the Premier of Western Australia has ventured to cast some ridicule on the figures which I gave as showing the gain to Western Australia since the Federal Tariff came into operation. His remarks were apparently evoked by the fact that a meeting of protectionists at Perth recently used my figures to discount the inventions of the State Actuary concerning the Tariff. The honourable gentleman said that the chairman of the public meeting repeated "" Mr Mahon's absurd statement that the State had gained £ 2 , 2 4 0 , 0 0 0 on account of Federation."" went on to saySurely Mr Million relumed to the State own money made up Custom House and the own people. I wish to say that I never desired any such inference to be drawn from my remarks. The essence of my contention was, of course, not that this sum was a gift from the Commonwealth to the Federation, but that it represented the Federal to the State out of the State's own contribution to the Customs and Excise. I referred to the return as a "" gain "" simply because the Actuary of Western Australia, on whom the Premier of that State is now relying, and who is placing exaggerated and fanciful Estimates before the people, referred to the fact that the Treasury deficiency which he anticipated from Federation would be a loss to the State. in the sense of there' being a deficiency. I referred to the amount received as a gain to the Treasury. Australia, therefore,. is simply ridicule on the State official when he attempts to challenge my figures. I desire to add, in reference to the tabulated statement to which I first referred, that I am of course very pleased to have up-to-date Mr Mahcn. figures. Further, f t is only just to say that no person connected with either Hansard or the Treasury can be held to be in any way blameable for the discrepancy between the figures. FIRE AT MURWILLUMBAH.

Sir William Lyne (further consulting the Seeing that there has been no loss list) said his intention was that the duty should be the same as it was before.

WhatI said was that I did not think that was intended, and that I would ask the Minister of Trade and Customs to look into the matter, in order to see whether or not there was some error. is what the newspaper report refers to, though the reporter has apparently not caught the point. Acting Prime Minister a question relating to magazines. may mention that last week, in Adelaide, and pointed out to me that there were two pressing difficulties. t he giving of orders for the delivery of Christmas issues of magazines, and the -other to the fact that if the merchants chose to take these imports without advertisements the staff in Adelaide would not be able to deliver the first clear of advertisements before the second mail deSivery would come round.

MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) [4.42VIncluded in these Estimates is an item £ 1 , 5 6 5 for a post-office at Cloncurry, to which some exception has been taken byone or two honourable members. Cloncurry is in my electorate, and, although objection was taken to the item last night on the ground that the town is only a small one, I would point out that it is the centre of a very large district, and the chief distributing point for mail services to distant places. If other honourable members who are advocating the erection of postal buildings in their electorates can make out as good a case as we can do for this item, they will deserve success. curry post-office from postal matter alone last year was £ 9 8 0 , whilst the revenue from telegrams and telephones amounted to £ 1 , 0 8 3 , "" d the commission on money a orders to £ 9 9 , making a total of £ 2 . 1 6 2 .

Few honourable members have the slightest conception of the importance and the extent of this vast mineral belt of country. other minerals, and promises to be one of the greatest mining fields in Australia. Apart from the fact that an enormous sum is being expended on the mines in the neighbourhood of the town itself, we have to remember that a railway to Cloncurry will be completed within two or three months, and that it will then be the distributing centre for mining districts within a radius of from 150 to 200 miles. A t the present from Cloncurry to Winton, Richmond, Boulia, Mount Elliott, and other places. I understand that It is a large distributing centre. My complaint is that the Government have not made any effort to erect a permanent building To enable the there. The buildings which have been constructed from time to time have practically been eaten away by white ants. In localities where stone is available surely the post-offices should be constructed of that material. If we take into consideration the cost incurred in hauling the timber necessary for the construction of a post office a distance of 500 miles by rail, and the cost of conveying it a considerable distance by boat, we must come to the conclusion that the expenditure involved in erecting a stone building would be very little more than that of erecting a wooden structure, whilst it would form a better asset to the Commonwealth. I may mention in this connection that even cedar The revenue of the Clonbuildings have been erected in that portion of Queensland, because it is generally supposed that that class of timber is not attacked by white ants. native tenders for the construction of the post-offices there?

There is athe general financial policy of the Government, but I feel that there is no particular interest in the debate at the present moment, and consequently I do not propose to weary the Committee any further. In conclusion, I wish to assure the Treasurer that I am not at all satisfied with the general statements which have emanated from the Government in connection with the financial position of the Commonwealth. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [4.58]. I should have been much indebted to the honourable member for Kennedy for affording me the opportunity of correcting any mistake which I had made in my speech if there had been one. But I find, upon reference to Hansard-and the correctness of its report is certainly not due to any alteration of the proof upon my part -that instead of having referred to 30,000 acres of cane I am reported to have said' The labour question was a serious issue last year, and it is going to be still more serious this year. I know of a district in which there is a central mill . where 30,000 tons of cane stood over. The Attorney-General interjectedIn what district? To which I repliedIn the Mosraan district. Later on the Attorney-General again interjectedThe output of sugar is not decreasing; it is increasing. In reply, I saidThat may be so in the south, but it is not so in the north, unless as the result of good seasons. The fact that 30,000 tons of cane were left standing is the strongest proof honourable members can have of the condition of the industry. It will be seen, therefore, that I referred to "" tons "" and not to "" acres."" north of Queensland have increased their crashing power this year very materially. Colonel FOXTON I am dealing now with a statement which I made upon a previous occasion. WhatI then said-and what I am reported to have said in Hansard-is correct so far as my information goes. It may be that there were other causes for this cane not having been cut, but upon that point the information supplied to the honourable member for Kennedy is entirely different from that which has been supplied to me. The fact remains that this quantity of cane did stand over. My object now is to show that the remarks of the honourable member as to the statement which he alleged I was reported to have made, are entirely wide of the mark. I am reported in Hansard to have said exactly what I intended to say. I am very glad to hear the voice of the honourable member for Kennedy, because as _ Chairman he is to a certain extent muzzled; but, unfortunately, on this, occasion he does not seem to have taken advantage of his opportunity with the best results, so far as the first item is concerned. As regards the second, he said that the party which desires to have cheap coloured labour for the North was the party behind me at the elections, and that it found the funds in connection with my return to this Parliament. I do not know what authority he had for that statement, and I should like him to name any person or body of persons in any way contributing funds which were used to bring about my return. I am under the painful impression that I paid all the expenses of my election. If he is aware of a secret fund which was employed to assist in securing my return, I shall be glad if he will inform me of the particulars concerning it. ber say that he paid for all the literature circulated in and around Brisbane on behalf of his political party, some of which contained untrue statements?

Colonel FOXTON -Yes; but not many of them. Colonel FOXTON I am informedI was not in the House at the time-that the Acting Prime Minister has stated that I said that the planters of Queensland are not in favour of the continuance of the bounty for white-grown sugar. sion the honourable member left upon other honourable members. Colonel FOXTON -Perhaps in the same way as the impression was left upon the honourable member that I said acres instead of tons. person who thinks that the honourable member said that. said that the granting of bounties was an infringement of State rights. Colonel FOXTON -That is atotally different statement. entered my head, and I did not intend to convey, that the people of Queensland, or those connected with the sugar industry, favour the abolition of the bounty. I remember to have said that some of those interested are of opinion that if both bounty and Excise were abolished, thus again enabling cane-growers to employ coloured labour without penalty, it would be a good thing, while others are opposed to such a course, but that, in any event, it would be impossible by their abolition to place the Queensland sugar-grower on exactly the same financial footing as he occupied before the deportation of Kanakas commenced, seeing that 4,000 or 5,000 of his skilled field labourers have been sent out of the country. Referring to the interjection of the honourable member for Herbert, my remarks in regard to the bounty being an infringement of State rights may have misled the Acting Prime Minister and the honourable member for South Sydney. I stated that considerable dissatisfaction exists throughout Australia in regard to Federation,, and, in reply, to an interjection, I said that some of the legislation of the Commonwealth Parlia'ment has been subversive of the rights of [12 r]2 The district of the States. I was asked to give an instance in which the legislation of this Parliament had infringed upon the rights of the States, and, in reply, I mentioned several Acts, including the Sugar Bounties and Excise Acts, the passing of which; in the opinion of lawyers, and in my opinion, went beyond the rights given to us under the Constitution. I did not refer to the passing of the Sugar Bounties Act as a grievance of any person in Queensland. I merely mentioned the Act as a bald legal instance, in the view of constitutional authorities-the question has never been determined by the Courts-in which the Commonwealth Parliament, perhaps unwittingly, but certainly not without warning, overstepped the strict bounds of the Constitution. I am glad to have had the opportunity afforded to me by the speech of the honourable member for Kennedy to put myself right in this matter. It would be absurd to say that am not the only Queenslanders, or those connected with the sugar industry in Queensland, desire the abolition of the bountv. I was astounded at the statement attributed to the honourable member for Brisbane, especially in view of the circumI t certainly never stances in which it was supposed to have been made. I was not present when he made it, but I read a report of the debate. He seems to have been indulging in vague talk, which is unfortunately too common with some honourable members, about the dissatisfaction, or-to use his own word-exasperatio n prevalent amongst the public in regard to the conduct of Federal affairs. Honourable members thereupon asked him to give an instance in justification of the statement that such exasperation existed. He seemed rather taken aback by the request. Colonel FOXTON -Not at all. ber was indulging in one of those wild flights which are foo commonly made by honourable members who, because they are opposed to some of the measures of the Commonwealth Parliament, wi'sh to excite the feeling of the people outside against Federation as an institution.

He was entitled to Tetire on a pension of two-thirds of his salary and six months' leave on f u l l pay, as he has subscribed to the superannuation fund since its inception. He was not allowed to retire, and the Acting Deputy Fostmaster-General told him that his services could not possibly be dispensed with during the consideration of the tenders for carrying the mailsthat were to be dealt with in September. He worked from 9 a.m. until 10 p.m., Saturdays, I believe it was furSundays, and holidays. The statements that have been prepared will show that on the night of the 17th October he was found in an unconscious state in his room at his office. He was taken to the Sydney Hospital, where he died the next day from paralysis of the brain, undoubtedly brought about by overwork of the brain. Iiismedical adviser repeatedly told him to give upthe great mental strain he was subjected to, and if he did not his brain would certainly give way. I understand the What more inhuman treatment could beWith regard to the meted out to any man than that which wasmeted out to this officer who was practically refused leave of absence, despite? the warning of his medical officer ? put to the Postmaster-General to-day related not to his retirement, but to leave of absence for him. While the Department did not say to the late Mr Clarke, "" Werefuse you leave of absence,"" it did say, I am told that the "" Y o u cannot go while' the Inland Mail-, tenders are being considered."" between an officer retiring from the service and obtaining leave of absence. that. WhatI say is that the late Mr Clarke was refused leave of absence with aI review to retirement. I hold in my hand the evidence of one who ought to know. would have treated an officer of Mr Clarke's talent and application in the manner in which he was treated, by the Commonwealth authorities. Unfortunately there are other men in a position similar to that which he occupied, and it is because I wish to prevent them from being sacrificed on the altar of duty by the sweating which exists that I am taking this action. Mr Clarke had contributed to the New South Wales superannuation fund from its commencement,, I and payment for some hundreds or thousands of hours of overtime was due"" to him. His widow asks for consideration in respect to his contributions to the superannuation fund, and in respect to the leave of absence which should have been granted to him to enable him to recover his health. She has been left with five children, and only one able to help her. Yet the Government has so little recognition of its duty in this matter that it has treated it as of nourgency.

Then, in Victoria, it is proposed to provide a laboratory, to cost , £ 1 , 0 0 0 ; and I should like to know what is the purpose of this building, and why it should be situated in Victoria""? required to carry out analyses connected with the Customs House. There are similar laboratories in the other States. a Customs House at Fremantle £ 7 , 5 0 0 is proposed, £:r,oo o being a re-vote, and £ 6 , 5 0 0 coming under the head of new services. If I remember rightly, a'large sum was placed on the Estimates for this purpose last year, and also, I believe, the year before. Sir. WILLIAM LYNE the Customs House has not yet commenced; we have only obtained the site. what, has been the cost of the site, and also what is the estimated cost of the building, because, in the absence of information, the amount seems excessive. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [6.20] I shall give the honourable member the information he requires. Early in 1905 the State Collector, Western Australia, reported that it was impossible to -continue working in the Fremantle Customs House, owing to its dilapidated and insanitary condition, and the matter was brought under' the notice of the Department of Home Affairs, with a view to early, action being taken. In April of the same year, the honourable member for North Sydney, then Minister of Home Affairs, suggested that the present post-office-whic h is exactly opposite the Customs Housewould, if renovated and improved, answer the purpose for a few years. The Collector reported against the suggestion, and pointed out that the transfer of the Customs staff to the present post-office would involve considerable time in making necessary alterations to the building. On the 8th of May, 1906, the question of the erection of the proposed new Customs House was brought up at a meeting of the Fremantle Chamber of Commerce, and it was contended that the State Government should offer to give a central site to the Federal Government, or sell such a site at cost price, to be used for the erection of the building. Fremantle is the chief port of the State, and will remain so, and the old post-office building was most unsuitable for the purposes of a Customs House. Land, 180 feet to Phillimore-street and n o feet to Cliff-street, the site of the old railway station), has been secured, to be treated as a transferred property A building, containing the usual long room and public accommodation, in addition to the accessory rooms for the staff, will be erected. Caretaker's quarters will also be erected on the portion of the site not occupied by the main building. I may say that I visited the old building myself, and found it so dilapidated and insanitary that I would not undertake to go through it. When I was on my way to and from EnglandI also visited the new site, and found it to be the best available. included in the Estimates? be paid for as transferred property. The arrangement I made when I was Minister of Trade and Customs was that this land should be taken over at cost price, and treated as a transferred property. As to the new launch for Sydney, it is necessary, because the shipping work is increasing, and requires prompt and unremitting attention to avoid complaints of delay. The present small launch is not suitable for the work, being slow and not satisfactory; but it will be utilized for emergency work. Sir WILLIAM LYNE No . As to the Customs House at BrokenH ill , the present premises are leased from the municipality at a rental of £ 1 7 5 per annum. It is considered to be more economical anrj convenient to erect a Commonwealth building, .and a site in a Postal Department reserve is under consideration. In reference to the laboratory, I have to say that, owing to the Commerce Act and an extension of the' provisions of the Customs Act in regard to compound medicines, & c , the analytical work has greatly increased, both in the Victorian^ branch and'v, the Central staff. The work is at present done by the State Government Analyst; but our requirements, are so large, and are increasing so rapidly, that the work is frequently congested.

Hamlet in Sydney is done there, but it is desirable in some cases to .have the several analyses necessary made by the same person, or otherwise the results vary a little. The Courts have several times asked that analyses should be similar and accurate. I should like some information in reference to the proposed expenditure on a trawler. Last year we voted ,£8,000 for this purpose, and it was supposed that that would cover the whole cost; but now the proposed expenditure has reached £ 1 2 , 0 0 0, and there ought to be some explanation. It has been stated, I do not know with what truth, that the design of the trawler provided a large amount of cabin accommodation, but no room for fish. I have never seen ai reply to that statement. reply. of reply to the effect that the space for cabin accommodation was the most necessary space on a trawler; but that explanation does not appear to me to be quite satisfactory. It would appear as though sufficient information is not obtained as .to the cost before items of this character are placed before honourable members. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume, Treasurer) [7.45] -Prio r to the adjournment for dinner I was asked for some information in reference to the item relating to a trawler and equipment. supplied to me isThe pioneering work in connection with deepsen, fisheries is an important duty devolving upon the Commonwealth. three-mile limit must be explored, so as to determine(1) What fishes may-be of value; (2) -In what manner they may be caught. Trawling is most frequently thought of in connection with such fisheries, and under certain conditions it is the most effective method. But there are other methods, such as great line fishing, which may be successfully applied in any depth down to several hundred fathoms, an'? also over rocky bottoms, where the best fish are frequently found. In addition, there is surface fishing with d r if t nets-the method b\ which the herring is captured in mid-ocean near Europe. It appears that Australia is the only civilized country where the authorities have done nothing to establish such an industry. The example set by Canada could be followed with benefit to the Commonwealth, as also might the work done by Cape Colony. The business as 2 of the foregoing would be carried on b j I may say that when I was Minister of Trade and CustomsI initiated the proposal to procure a trawler by communicating with Mr Nansen, Consul for Norway, in London, -who went to a great deal of trouble in sending out to us what were described as plans for the very best class of trawler that could be designed. Those plans arrived, if I remember rightly, just after the Prime Minister and I left for England. When in LondonI saw Mr Nansen on several occasions, and he confirmed what had alreadv been stated as to the value of the plans with which we had been supplier!, declaring that they were for the very best class of investigating trawler. This will be a .scientific vessel. When the pfans were examined, it was found by our officials that some alterations signed for a vessel to be used in a cold I saw some kind climate, where very little provision is made for ventilation and lighting, and in regard to those two requirements alterations were necessary. I saw in one of the newspapers a statement that the plans provided for fittings of an unnecessarily elaborate character. I took the trouble to inspect them, and found that the cabin accommodation was only that which was necessary for the crew, for one or two scientific men who would be required to conduct investigations, and for a pilot, who would have to be taken on whenever the vessel was entering or leaving certain harbors. The statement that the accommodation was too The information elaborate was, I found, incorrect.

More than three months have elapsed since he conferred with the experts in Sydney. Government are in earnest upon this matter, they ought to get to work within a reasonable period. Otherwise let them Boldlv declare that they do not wish to establish this industry. The position at the present time is most unsatisfactory. the Government, before accepting any tender for the construction of the trawler, will see that the working conditions -to be observed by the contractor are such as prevail in the best shops in Australia. I am given to understand that the lowest tender for the contract was that of a firm in Tasmania. I hope that the Governmentwill insist that the men employed upon the construction of the vessel shall enjoy absolutely the same conditions as those which have to be observed by the most»reputable firms on the mainland. Speaking generally, trade unionism is far stronger upon the mainland than it is in Tasmania, and, as the bulk of the work in connection with the construction of the trawler would be I have no objection done by boiler-makers, ship-wrights, and engineers, the Government should be caref u l to see that the best conditions-so far We all know as employees are concerned-ar e observed.

A cheap system of telephone communication would save, not only a good deal of running about, but considerable expense. The Orange range is a case in point. [9.31] I am much obliged to the Minister for the information which he courteously gave in detail, in reply to the questions I asked previously. He has answered a great many questions which have been raised during the past few months; and it would seem that the money is pretty well distributed.

I paid a visit last Saturday pointed out to me that the place where the Childers ought to moor was so shallow that she could not take a berth. It is clear that some dredging is necessary there, and I should like to know whether that is the place referred to in the Estimates? Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [9.35] -The explanation supplied to me is that this expenditure forms part of the scheme to enable destroyers and torpedo-boatsi to be berthed at Swan Island, and at the submarine mining and naval depots.

As pointed out on the Estimates, the total cost is £5,000, and negotiations respecting the site are now proceeding. £9.38] I should like some information in regard to the Protector, for alterations to which I observe that £475 is provided. The Protector is an old corvette, that has been in service for over twenty years; and we are constantly spending money on her. We ought to be told whether she is being used as a training ship, or is merely kept in commission in order to find billets for men. The Protector must by this time be out of date, and each year further expenditure is proposed for her repair. The question is whether it is worthwhile spending any more money on the vessel. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [9.39] -The Naval' Director reports that, apart from the Queensland gunboats and the torpedo boats in Hdbson's Bay, the Naval Forces of the Commonwealth are dependent for their sea training on the Protector. If this vessel is not available, there will be no sea training for him to consent to buy a site for a range the Naval Forces. Since the Federal reorganization of the forces, the Protector's work has been considerably increased, and -will continue to be so until new vessels are provided. To enable her to carry out the additional work, she is now undergoing -an extensive refit after twenty-two years' service. To complete this work, and fit her for service as the Commonwealth drill ship, alterations are necessary. These alterations are not called for to enable the vessel to carry out her regular duties of ^service in the South Australian gulfs, but are needed to carry out efficiently the work required of her under the Federal reorganization, namely, the training of the ""Naval Forces of the various States. should like to know whether the general items under South Australia have any reference to the Northern Territory.

[9.44] I should like to have some information as to the item of £900 under the heading "" Launceston-magazine. "" [9.45] I wish to draw the attention of the Minister of Defence to the fact that although nearly every little hamlet in Australia has a rifle range either already in existence or provided for in these Estimates, Parramatta is still without one. I take not the slightest exception to any of these items, but I wonder what a place like Parramatta has done that it seems impossible for it to secure a range. It has a population of from 10,000 to 12,000 and is the centre of a large district, in which there are several corps. The Minister is pursuing a policy in regard to rifle ranges generally for which I have the greatest admiration, but I cannot induce at Parramatta. I do not hesitate to say that it is neither more nor less than a scandal that this state of affairs should continue, and that troops and riflemen should have to go eight miles to practice. The land there may be a little costly, but I have yet to learn that an expenditure of a few pounds should stand in the way of proper provision being made for the riflemen of such a large and growing district. I wish the Minister to explain why action has not been taken, and to say whether he will take into consideration the advisableness of purchasing a site, even although the land mav be somewhat costly.

532,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"Defence) [9.48] I agree with the honourable member that there ought to be a rifle range at Parramatta, and I have given a considerable amount of time to an investigation of the facts. curing suitable sites for riflemen in populous centres is becoming more and more pronounced, as the range of our rifles is being .increased. A>. modern tifle has a range, ment was powerless in this regard. not of a few hundred yards, but of a mile or two, and as the country becomes more settled the difficulty of securing suitable ranges in many places is greatly increased. Within the last week or two I caused to be sent to the Commandant of New South Wales a special request that responsible persons in Parramatta should be interviewed with a view of ascertaining whether or not a suitable site couild be obtained. am endeavouring to remedv the grievance, because I think it is right that it should be remedied.' For the last ten or fifteen yeairs, a site near Melboi&rne has been used as a rifle range, but the time is fast approaching when we shall not be able to devote it to that purpose. referring to the E l wood range, which has been used for twenty-five years? and unless we can induce boating parties and. shipping to keep two miles out, we shall have to put a stop to rifle shooting there. We will give the riflemen suitable accommodation at Williamstown. in Harris Park, Parramatta, for a rifle range. and I repeat that the request made by the honourable member for Parramatta is a reasonable one. [9.50] -Meantim e it occurs to me that where riflemen are subjected to these disabilities, the least the Department can do is to come to their relief by enabling them to travel free of cost to distant ranges. Not only does the Minister refuse to provide riflemen at Parramatta with a local range, but when they travel seven or eight miles to obtain practice they have to pay their own fares. tion applying to other parts of Australia. The Department carries riflemen free of charge to the nearest range. position at Parramatta. I called the attention of the Minister the other day to the matter. The difficulty of seable member was that a certain sum wasset aside, and given to each corps for travelling expenses, and that when that amount had been expended the Departis not placing at the disposal of these corps a sufficient sum to allow of their obtaining adequate rifle practice. He ought to place more at their disposal. how much more is wanted. Commonwealth would ' be bankrupt, if it had to carry the few riflemen, who are I have a note of the matter, andunder these disabilities, to a range where they could secure proper practice. If there is to be any differentiation the regulation should be so elastic that riflemen who are at a distance from a range would be carried free of charge. These men are suffering disabilities, and I wish to see them provided with a range nearer home. If the Minister will see that they are meantime under no financial disability in obtaining practice, I shall be satisfied. Those whowish to fit themselves to defend their country ought not to have to dip their handsinto their pockets as these working men have to do. Defence) [9.53] I am sure that the honourable member thinks that the Treasurer and the Government generally have beenfairly generous in dealing with rifle ranges and clubs. Parramatta is concerned. general principle. As I understand the honourable member's point, it is this : In town A , or adjacent to it, there is a rifle range; but in town B riflemen have to travel a certain distance in order to obtain practice. The honourable member wishes to know whether the Department will discriminate in the direction of providing travelling facilities for those who at town' B have no local range on which to practice.

547,Mr Ewing,"I am speaking of theis another matter to which I think the Minister should give consideration. A l though he says that the Treasurer and the Defence Department are fairly generous in dealing with the rifle clubs, I hold that he ought to see that the treatment of the rifle movement generally is sufficiently generous. There is not the least doubt that 1 rifle ranges must be established close to our towns, and the longer we delay the complete settlement of this question the greater will be the cost of securing suitable sites. lutely necessary part of the defence system. the honourable member for Bendigo that he was unable to increase the corps there, because there was no provision in the Estimates for an increase. There is no doubt that many who would like to join the militia and volunteer forces have not an opportunity to do so, and consequently they have to confine their energies to rifle shoothave referred. I think I can appeal ing. And yet we find that in many cases they are handicapped by a total absence of reasonable accommodation for rifle practice. I take it that the honourable member for Parramatta desires that a rifle range shall be provided for every town that can show that it is entitled to it. But there is a much more serious question to be faced, and the delay on the part of the English authorities in dealing with it has cost the British Government thousands of pounds. I refer to the reservation of permanent sites for the training of troops generally. in mind large areas. I think that we shall be able before long to submit to Parliament a proposal for a suitable national training ground for almost_all the States. State? MrE WING a Bill providing for the resumption of land at Langwarrin and Frankston was introduced in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. Knowing that the troops in this State had been exercised on portion of the land proposed to be resumed, I brought the matter under the notice of the then Minister of Defence, who called for a report. That wise and military-learned gentleman, Brigadier-General Gordon, reported that there was not the slightest objection to the proposal, as the land was not required. What was the outcome of this? Last Easter a public-spirited citizen, Sir Rupert Clarke, had to be asked to place at the disposal of the Department completely new ground for the Easter manoeuvres. This was necessary because certain land had been excised from the Langwarrin reserve, and, on the report of the then State Commandant, not only had no protest been raised, but it had actually been approved by the Department. A man would heretofore have been dismissed for that sort of thing had there been in authority some one who knew how to sheet home the reThe rifleman has become an absosponsibility for error. After the Government had spent thousands of pounds in Quite recently the Minister informed excavating dams to provide a permanent water supply at Langwarrin, and had also cleared and fenced in the reserve, certain land was resumed, and the reserve was rendered useless as a training ground. This was due to the fact that a stupid State Commandant ventured to furnish to the Department the report to which I to the Minister of Defence to support my statement, although he was not in office -at the time to which I refer. I ask him is it not a fact that Brigadier-General Gordon reported that the land proposed to be resumed at Langwarrin was not required for defence purposes, and that the Langwarrin reserve was found unsuitable for the Easter manoeuvres? Two new sites have been submitted. I brought under the notice of the Ministei a Vast State forest near Bacchus Marsh, and mentioned the names of certain local residents who knew all about the land. Two officers were sent to the district to report. They spent only a short time there, and local men who knew that there were thousands of acres of Crown lands in the neighbourhood were not evert approached. A most suitable site for a national training ground, within easy distance by rail of Melbourne, I think so. Castlemaine, Bendigo, and Ballarat, was thus passed over. What is now suggested in this connection? The selection of Point Nepeana narrow peninsula which can only be reached by sea-ha s been recommended, because an official at head-quarters it? mandant of Victoria, Colonel Stanley, a man utterly without knowledge of infantry requirements, who was once stationed at Eagle's Nest.

[10.5] I wish to say a word or two in regard to the desirableness of making provision for carrying riflemen by rail, free of charge, to the nearest place where they can indulge in rifle practice.

In each of the States we are endeavouring to obtain an area sufficiently large to meet all requirements, and one which for all time will be suitable for the purpose to which it is to be devoted.

That point is simply a narrow neck of land which is not more than one and a half miles wide at any part. The nearest railway station-Morriington-is quite thirty-five miles distant. I trust that the Minister will look carefully into .this matter. Point Nepean is the most unsuitable site for the purpose which can be found in Victoria. not see the utility of asking honourable members to authorize expenditure upon rifle ranges when we have not sufficient officers to direct the troops shooting upon those ranges. For that reason I think that I am entitled to draw attention to the present shortage of officers. member must not take up that line of argument. must resunie my seat. cers in high positions in our Defence Force have ever exhibited incompetence they have certainly shown it in the selection of a training ground for our troops. Some reform will have to be instituted in connection) with our Defence Force. Year after year we are asked to vote large sums of money, and yet we hear the same old cry. What is the use of the Minister declaring that an area of fifteen miles square is -required in Victoria to permit of the manoeuvring of -troops? I do not suppose that the field of Aldershot, where the whole of the .British Army is manoeuvred, consists of more than 2,000 acres. fired there. is not necessary to fire big guns.

An Honorable MEMBER -We should have to leave them there. men in the field, the Japanese can put 50,000. The Minister has said that he requires a tract of country fifteen miles square to permit of the troops of one State being manoeuvred, notwithstanding that not a manoeuvre the whole British Army. In England, the field guns in and around the military depot practise at Shoeburyness, and in the northern counties they practise on the Mersey. God knows we have plenty of sea room in Australia to enable artillery firing to be carried on. We do not need to provide for land ranges. From the western parts of England the troops are taken to Dartmoor, where they can fire over miles of waste landj but the field guns and fort gums are tried at Shoeburyness. At Woolwich, the head-quarters of the artillery, where manoeuvring is going on all the year round, I do not think that there is a reserve of more than 2,000 acres. Why, then, should such a large area be needed in Victoria? The Minister's officers are hoodwinking him. We have the authority of the honourable members for Corio and Yarra for the statement that they have recommended the reservation of a narrow neck of land not easily approachable by land or sea, and without railway communiication, a preposterous site.

The proper time to discuss the qualifications, of or need for officers will be when the Defence Estimates are before the Committee. I am very loth to differ from the honourable member for Maranoa, who possesses a good deal of knowledge ini regard to military matters; but I have watched the field artillery at practice in the National Park, near Sydney, during the last two Easter encampments, and by what I have learned in doing so, as well as by what I knew previously, I am convinced that large areas of country should be reserved for artillery ranges. It should not be difficult or expensive to get suitable areas -for the purpose. As an honourable member has suggested to me, suitable land -should be obtainable in Australia at no great expense. In every State within reasonable distances of the chief centres of population, there, aire large areas of almost useless land, which it would not cost much to resume .and set apart for artillery practice. It is true enough, as the honourable member for Maranoa has said, that in England manoeuvres are conducted on comparatively small areas, and that artillery practice takes place on the sea-shore, the guns being fired out to sea. But the field artillery practice proper is conducted' on a special range, to which battery after battery of the Royal Horse Artillery and the Field Artillery is sent for a certain period each year, to practice shell firing. think. Every battery on the Home establishment is sent there for a certain part of each year. what I know. I have taken part in these manoeuvres. say that, since the Boer war, battery after battery is sent to a special ground for a certain period each year, to practice shell firing. It is not possible always to determine the effect of a shot when it is fired out to sea. done mostly on the sands at low tide. way of getting land practice. It is necessary, in order to judge of the effect of shell fire, to know where the shells fall, or where the shrapnel is projected, and for this land ranges are required. Furthermore, a large area is necessary for practising firing with live shell. The' ground set apart should be sufficiently extensive to provide a variety of ranges, so that the gunners will have to exercise their judgment in sighting guns and setting fuses. It ought to be possible to provide approximately new ranges frbm time to time, to give the officers practice in determining distances, and to get as nearly as possible service conditions. In my opinion, an area measuring at least ten miles by five is necessary to do what is needed in this respect, and to enable provision to be made for disappearing and moving targets. In New South Wales the artillery now have the permission of the National Park trustees to use part of the park; but its use i& restricted by the fact that the public go there too. Apparently there is at present no other land close to Sydney available for the purpose. Artillerymen are specialists who require a good deal of training, and it ought to be possible to obtain waste land near Sydney, and other large cities, on which they could be afforded opportunities for adequate practice. Possibly at some season of the year, such land could be used for depasturing stock, which would provide a return to set against' the outlay. Government is offering very suitable land at Liverpool for 10s. an acre. a good deal of poor land within a few miles of Sydney, and some of it could be reserved for artillery practice.

I think that there is Crown land which could be obtained without much cost, and I strongly urge that a reservation should be secured. In New South Wales for the last two or three years the Defence Department has had to rely on the goodwill of private land-owners to obtain ground on which to manoeuvre the infantry troops, and when the last Easter"" encampment was about to be held, several owners refused permission to the authorities to take the troops over their land, fearing, perhaps, that their fences might be injured, or other damage done. The Commonwealth has spent a lot of money in drilling the troops, but the annual manoeuvres which are indispensable for the training of officers in the management of men were almost blocked by the difficulty in obtaining the necessary ground. This difficulty is likely to increase as the country becomes more closely settled, and more largely cultivated. property of the State as soon as the Labour Party imposes its land tax. is exhibiting an ignorance of our proposals which is common to those on his side of the Chamber. ber for South Sydney must be a mighty superior man, seeing that he is so fond of charging others with ignorance. suming that ignorance prompted the interjection, because it would be wilful misrepresentation for any one who understood .bur proposals to say that a progressive land tax means nationalization. However, I shall not deal with that subject now. view, it would be wise for the Defence Department, with the.authority of Parliament, at the earliest possible moment to set about acquiring waste land for the training of troops. Such land may be acquired to-day comparatively cheaplv, but in a few years it will be very expensive to buy. mania may be a small place, but these items have evoked considerable discussion. I quite agree with the honourable member for South Sydney as to the necessity to secure large blocks of ground for the purpose of rifle ranges; and I am supported in my view by the experience at Sandy Bay. used as a rifle range became dangerous as the population grew, and some other site had to be purchased at a large sum. Then, for the purpose of manoeuvres, large spaces are necessary, and, in my opinion, it would be well if the volunteers devoted some attention to shooting in the country, instead of confining their attention to rifle ranges. On the rifle range a man knows the exact distance, and, arranging his sights to a nicety, can score bull's eyes. But in the bush, or in the country, where he might have to meet an enemy, such as our troops met in South Africa, he would be confused as to the distances; and some shooting practice in this connection would be of great benefit. I know that as a youth I found great advantage from firing at trees, and then ascertaining how far I was out in my judgment. So far as I can see, the Estimates in reference to Tasmania are satisfactory, and I believe that the money will be well spent. Proposed vote agreed to.

If seeing that in the country an exchange is provided for fifteen or twenty subscribers. The present system is a reversion to the old rates and conditions of fifteen years ago.. Monaro-Minister of Tirade and Customs) [10.45] -The honourable member for Parramatta and myself had this matter out on the floor of the House some two months ago. His answer, to me on that occasion was that I was "" bluffing again."" The position is that certain imaginary centres were created, some of them by the honourable member. ' The system was to imagine that there was an exchange where none existed, and to charge from that place instead of charging from the place where the wire actually stretched from. charge imaginary, too? what the honourable member for Parramatta wants to do. The honourable member contended, .that two persons with the one service, living next door to each other, are being charged two different rates. When asked Iby the honourable member for Laanecoorie how that came about, he said that it was in consequence of one man changing his residence. If the honourable member knew what he was talking about, he would know that under the present system no more persons can come in under the old flat rate, and that if a man moves even next door She must come in under the toll rate. There is a very great, difference in the. services given under the toll and flat rates. will remember the storm that was raised in this House and . in the country when we attempted to bring subscribers under the toll rate, which is the do not happen to agree with him. only business system possible, making them pay for the services they were getting. A number of these persons are still on the flat rate, and are getting a very much greater service than they pay for-in man,)' instances a service which it costs us more to give than they pay. It is only a question of a little time when everybody will be put on the one footing, and the toll sysIt is the difference in the service. In the tem established all round. The honourable member for Laanecoorie struck the nail on the head when he asked what the effect of the imaginary centres would be. The honourable member for Parramatta says, a man lived within half^a-mile of a post office the honourable member would charge him for that distance only, even if the Department had to put in seven miles of wire from the nearest exchange. He would charge him the same rate as the man who had only to get half-a-mile of wire. member is ""bluffing."" He.is trying to mislead the Committee. Mr .AUSTIN CHAPMAN -That is the honourable member's whole argument. The object of the present system is to insure that a man shall pay for the service he receives. If that is followed out to its logical conclusion everybody will be placed on the one footing, and the whole system will be made a toll system, to which the honourable member for Parramatta objects. The man not make the who gets half-a-mile of wire will pay for half-a-mile, and the man who gets five miles will pay for five miles. It will then be possible to make those gentlemen, who now cost us £ 2 0 , £ 3 0 , and £ 4 0 a year for services for which they only pay £ g a year, pay for the cost of the service we give them, even without charging any profit. That will enable a man who only wants to use his telephone two or three times a day in the small villages, which the honourable member for Parramatta sneers at, to get his telephone for is. a week, because it does not cost the Department any more. member ought to be. ashamed of himself. I did not sneer at anv small village. the honourable member's whole line of argument. I am giving facts. The honourable Honourable members member referred to villages. I do not blame him for standing up for his own district, but he has no right to abuse me and others in this Chamber because we long as the honourable member makes incorrect statements and misleads the Committee. no incorrect statement about what I am now saying.

628,Mr Austin Chapman,"There isnumber is limited to twenty or thirty. If a difference is made it ought-to be in favour of the man who has the small service. With regard to what I call imaginary centres, the-honourable member's own words were "" Charge from the nearest post office."" He points to a case in his own district. The people are within one mile of the post office, but four or five miles from an exchange. will not give them an exchange. called the honourable member for Parramatta to order, but he takes no notice. Will the honourable member cease these interjections ? possible to put exchanges everywhere except at very great expense. My contention was that until we could give men in the country districts and those living away from centres of civilization some telephone connection, we should have to go a little slower in the big centres, and let them put up with whaf they have already. How are we to maintain a telephone service if we have to put in five miles of wire for a man and give him a service on the basis of half a mile, when the interest on the cost of the wire and the cost of maintenance come to more than he will be charged with-that is, according to the honourable member's theory of ""Charge from the nearest post office ""? To suppose centres of that kind will not pay. If we adopted that practice the Department would have to bear the loss and the man who gets the smaller service would have to make up for the man who is getting something that he is not paying for. maximum number of calls for metropolitan subscribers ? Why adopt a maximum of 2,000 calls as against 750 in every other country ? Mr' AUSTINCHAPMAN vised by my officers that we could afford to give that number. This is a service that we do not want to make money out of, but it must be made to pay. The reason why we are not getting all the subscribers under the toll system is very evident. The howl that went through the country, encouraged by many honourable members on the other side, when we brought some subscribers under the toll rate, will be remembered. the present Minister of Defence, who was then capacity, and the newspapers said that we [122]2 dared not introduce the toll system. But where are the advocates of the flat rate system to-day? They keep very quiet because they know that the loll system ^is the proper one, and has come to stay. Its introduction has created such a demand for telephones that it is difficult to keep up with the demand, but when we are able to cope with the demand, &nd can give a reasonable service, then will be the time to put every man on the same footing, making him' pay for what he gets and having no imaginary centres. the stump. orable member becomes angry about this It is. not question, because as he plaintively says "" It affects my district."" If the honourable member's scheme of imaginary centres is adopted, there will be nothing to prevent a man, who lives 15 miles from Melbourne and only one from the nearest post office, from having 15 miles of wire put in and being charged as though he were within 1 mile of the exchange. It would be very nice for the man, but with such« a system how could we give people in the country districts telephones? When I spoke of imaginary centres I said as a chance shot that probably the honourable member for Parramatta introduced them in New South Wales. I produced the evidence next day, and the honourable member promptly moved the adjournment of the House, stormed, and talked about "" bluffing."" The policy of the Department at that timeI leave it to my colleague to deal with what obtains at present-wa s to put men in such a position that they would not reduce the get a service at the least possible cost, but that each should pay according to the service he received. think that the Minister of Trade and CusI was adtoms has dealt very unfairly with the issue put before the Committee by the honourable member for Parramatta. The question, as I understand it, is this: The Post and Telegraph Department, by its regulations, says to the people of any district, "" If you can get twenty-five persons to connect with the telephone system we will make an exchange for \-ou."" Deputations waited on tralia.

The point is that this extra mileage is charged, not because it is necessary, but because it suits the conmile from the Canterbury exchange pays venience of the Department not to establish new local exchanges. lations any two persons can have an exchange established at any post office. The number used to be fifteen. statements! it suits the Department to carry the telephone lines to central exchanges rather than to establish local exchanges that the mileage rates are charged. But the service supplied is no different whether a subscriber is connected with a local exchange or with a ciry exchange, which may be miles away. As the service is the same, the charge ought to be the same. tablished according to the convenience of subscribers, not. according to the convenience of the Department; and if the Department chooses to create centres rather than have local exchanges it ought not to charge for the extra mileage. honourable member for Nepean has put the question at issue very well. I will give a concrete case, the force of which will, I think, be recognised by the Postmaster General. The regulations provide that new telephone exchanges cannot be established within 3 miles of each other. The example that I shall give will be a Victorian one. Hawthorn is a populous centre, not far from Melbourne. Camberwell is also a populous suburb of this city. Canterbury, however, is not a populous suburb. There is a telephone exchange at Canterbury. Consequently, the Canterbury residents get the benefit of a cheap telephone service. The Camberwell people, who are connected with the Canterbury exchange, have to pay extra mileage. That is to say, telephone subscribers in the populous area of Camberwell have to pav more than dotelephone subscribers at Canterbury. given is that, there being another exchange at Hawthorn, it is against the regulations to establish an exchange at Camberwell, The and the Camberwell residents, consequently, have to be connected with the Canterbury exchange. cost? bury gets his telephone for £ 5 per annum. A subscriber who lives more than a _£6. If , however, he lives.it Camberwell, he has to pay £ 7 per annum. Thus the telephone subscriber in Camberwell is put to extra expense because the exchange happens to be located at a less populous centre like Canterbury. Camberwell happens to be situated between the two exchanges, Hawthorn and Canterbury, and, therefore, it is not permitted to have an exchange of its It is simply because own. The idea of the honourable member for Parramatta is to popularize the telephone. Does not the ex-Postmaster-General think that subscribers ought to pay for services rendered? honourable member think that the subscriber who lives in a place necessitating the erecExchanges should be estion of 1 miles of wire ought to pay in1 terest on the extra cost? Postmaster-General is merely defending the policy of departmental officers. What.objection is there to establishing more exchanges? Why should there not be an exchange at Camberwell, which is a populous centre, rather than at Canterbury, which is not? What reason is there for requiring a distance of 3 miles between exchanges? I quite sympathize with the hope expressed by (the ear-Postmaster-General some time ago, that people should be able to have telephones for is. a week. I see no reason why the convenience of a telephone should be confined to the well-to-do and professional classes. I believe that the day will oome when a man who desires to let his houses will have to connect them by telephone with an exchange, just as gas and water are laid on at present. Why should not a poor man or woman have all the advantages of civilization? The telephone is a convenience that should be placed at the disposal of everybody, and the more it is popularized the more productive of revenue will the system be.
