Wednesday, 7 September 2005 ----Pension Bonus Scheme Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (9.30 am)-There are 209,022 Australians now working past their retirement age, and half of them are in full-time jobs. The number of workers aged 70 and over has climbed almost 30 per cent in the last five years, with almost 70,000 people now working past their 70th birthday. The Treasurer has been urging people to stay in the work force to address the skills shortage, and he introduced the pension bonus scheme to keep older Australians in the work force. The trouble with this scheme is that, if someone claims any amount of the pension at any time, they become ineligible for the scheme. The scheme offers lump sum bonuses of between $1,100 and over $29,000 for people who stay in the work force. If someone becomes unemployed at the age of 60, they can claim Newstart. However, if someone becomes unemployed at the age of 65, they cannot claim Newstart to tide them over until they find their next job. So a 65-year-old who claims the pension for even six weeks becomes ineligible for this very valuable pension bonus scheme. I will give you the example of Mr Wormald who lives in my electorate. At 74 years of age, he still works full time as a waiter. He went onto the pension for some time after he retired in his 60s and then he returned to work, and he is now ineligible for the pension bonus scheme. Perhaps even more shocking is the case of Mrs Holland, who wants to work for as long as she is able to. She is now 67 years old, and she has found that she is ineligible to apply for the pension bonus scheme because she received the pension for a period of just six weeks. She arrived in Australia from New Zealand and was unable to find work immediately. She needed some help to tide her over. She applied for Newstart because she wanted to be in the work force-she wanted to go back to work. She was advised that she was too old to go onto Newstart and that she had to apply for the age pension. She went onto the age pension for six weeks. She then found work and left the age pension, and now she finds that she is ineligible for a benefit that could have been worth up to $29,000 to her. If the Treasurer is serious about getting older Australians to stay in the work force longer, he must address anomalies in this scheme that mean that people who claim the age pension for a period of only a matter of weeks lose their eligibility for the scheme and lose an entitlement that could be worth almost $30,000 to them if they remain in the work force for five years.

231,Mrs Hull (Riverina) (9.33 Am),"On Thursday, 18 August, I stood in the House to reciteproud of their father, and they would like to know that those who read it acknowledge the author. That is what I do here today. Also, there is a brief history of Mr Butler and an insight into the origins of the poem. Mr Butler enlisted for the Second World War from the Riverina electorate-in fact, from Wagga Wagga-so it was only fitting that I read that poem, even though I was not aware of this fact. The family are very fortunate, and so is Australia, that Duncan Butler was able to record his memories of the war. Duncan Butler was born in Horsham in 1906. His family were farmers. When he was a boy, they moved to Gilgandra in the central west of New South Wales. In 1933, he moved to Melbourne to study at theological college. In June 1940, when he decided to enlist in the army, he was a minister of the Church of Christ in Wagga Wagga. In June 1940, he enlisted in the AIF and joined the 2nd/12th Field Ambulance A Company, Sparrow Force. He trained at camps in Wagga, Cowra, Katherine and Darwin before being sent overseas. Just before Christmas 1941 he was with an advance party of Sparrow Force, which was sent by flying boat from Darwin to Koepang, the Dutch end of Timor. They set up a hospital camp in the hills of Timor, but on 23 February 1942 he was captured by the Japanese, and so began a tortuous 3½ years as a prisoner of war. It is fitting that I should recognise Mr Duncan Butler in this House today because as a prisoner of war he suffered much but he penned a famous poem, one that should be read by all ler died, at the age of 80, in 1987, but he had written several other poems, some of which have been printed in newspapers. Those poems are a tribute to the memory of the many people who were unfortunate enough to be prisoners of war. I would like to thank Morrie Butler for providing me with a copy of the poem and for providing me with a history of his father documenting the suffering of prisoners of war in those times. With respect to Mr Duncan Butler(Time expired) La Perouse Public School for the terrific efforts that teachers, kids and their extended families at La Perouse Public School put in for my visit to the school on the first day of spring last week. La Perouse Public School is a small public school located only a stone’s throw from the Captain Cook landing site at Botany Bay. It is a school which has a high proportion of Indigenous students. The challenges that students, teachers and families face as a consequence of the history of dispossession and dislocation are still great. There are kids at this school who experience the loss of family members on a more frequent basis than is the norm in our society. Yet they presented two highly creative and very well executed dance performances to me. Watching students from different backgrounds perform Aboriginal dances from North Queensland showed me reconciliation in action. Subsequently, in discussion with me as their federal member, the students at La Perouse showed a very keen interest in the work of the parliament and political issues generally. I had spoken out previously on the huge risk to the biodiversity and living culture of North Australia as a result of the ravenous spread of cane toads across the landscape. The students at La Perouse had clearly taken an interest in this particular topic, both from my web site and the parliamentary record. They asked many MAIN COMMITTEE",164,Statements By Members

233,Mr Garrett (Kingsford Smith) (9.36 Am),"I want to place on record my admirationthoughtful questions about cane toads and made some very useful suggestions as to how they might be stopped. The teaching staff, students and families made me feel very welcome and I was pleased to see first-hand the enthusiasm and dedication that all involved with La Perouse Public School displayed. In discussion at the school, I discovered that one of the residual matters on the minds of both students and teachers at La Perouse is what prospects there are for a renewed and invigorated effort at advancing reconciliation. Labor remains profoundly committed to the reconciliation task-I assured them of that-in this parliament and in the community. But it is in the classrooms of schools like La Perouse Public School that authentic reconciliation is happening every day. I salute those efforts and offer my encouragement to the school community, who showed me in my visit that, notwithstanding the hurt and suffering their families have experienced, there is hope, and it can be clearly seen at La Perouse Public School. Palm Island tee who would not feel deeply about the plight of Indigenous Australians and the disadvantage they suffer. What we see on Palm Island off Townsville is an absolute indication of the terrible disadvantage of Indigenous communities. Last year there was a riot. The Indigenous community trashed the police station. It was over an Indigenous person who, unfortunately, died in custody. There is an inquiry going on into that at the moment. The community was trying to say to the rest of Australia, ‘We need your help. We can’t go on like this.’ The state government instituted a committee of inquiry to recommend how the government might best respond to the disadvantage. That committee of inquiry reported a week or so ago in terms of ‘back to basics’. I have been going to Palm Island for 10 years. I know it intimately. another hundred years of misery. I feel terribly frustrated as the federal member that I cannot get the state government-and the islanders, indeed-to recognise the problems of the island. The state government report recommended library services for people who cannot read, a career expo each year for a community that has no work and an increase in alcohol availability for a community that already drinks itself stupid. The report overlooks the two most important and significant issues: education-getting the kids to go to school and stay at school and dealing with the truancy rates; and land ownership-integrating Palm Island into the mainstream community so that they can deliver real jobs to islanders. I am very disappointed that the report has come down this way. I plead with the state government in Queensland to relook at this because, unless we as community leaders take some strong action on these sorts of issues, Palm Island will be the same as it is now in 100 years time. Port Adelaide this parliament. However, with the current and obviously desperate Liberal leader in South Australia, Rob Kerin, I am going to make an exception. Last weekend he made a visit to my electorate of Port Adelaide, with the aid of a guide and a street directory, and, according to the Adelaide Advertiser, announced that should he become Premier the contracts for opening bridges over the Port River would be renegotiated.

237,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide) (9.41 Am),"I rarely, if ever, have a go at an individual inThat is straight-out betrayal, treachery and hypocrisy. Even worse, it is contemptuous of the Port Adelaide community. Mr Kerin must be aware that in three very public campaigns the Port Adelaide community overwhelmingly supported opening bridges. The first was in 1999, when the Liberals themselves, although too short-sighted to build tunnels-which would be the best option-committed to opening bridges. I was there in the Port Adelaide town hall with the then Liberal transport minister, Di Laidlaw, and we jointly announced in a bipartisan way that the Olsen Liberal government would commit to opening bridges. The second major public campaign culminated in the same town hall with a commitment by the Rann government to build opening bridges. That announcement was made by Kevin Foley in April 2003. The local community, business, unions and residents were overjoyed. However, then nastiness and deviousness entered the fray. Unable to accept that decision, a gang of five or six organisations used every available opportunity to white-ant the courageous and far-sighted decision of the Rann government. Those groups-Business SA, the South Australian Farmers Federation, the South Australian Freight Council, the South Australian Road Transport Association, the RAA and, indirectly, Flinders Ports-put enormous pressure on both the federal and state governments to ignore the wishes of the community and future options for Port Adelaide, the most pristine historic precinct on mainland Australia. As similar organisations had done in the past under a Liberal government, they treated Port Adelaide with contempt and self-interest. In 1961 the fixed Jervois Bridge replaced an opening bridge. This destroyed the upper reaches of the Port River, backfilled the Portland Canal and restricted forever a vision to connect the outer harbour through the Port River to the sea at Grange through a world-class housing development at West Lakes-a piece of absolute, crass stupidity. That decision was stupid, costly and contemptuous of both the Port Adelaide community and the South Australian community, and it destroyed options for the future. Now, through the stupidity of Liberal leader Rob Kerin and his state Liberal Party, they want to do it all over again. That will not happen. After the third public campaign, on 3 April this year the Rann government again committed to opening bridges. At the state election next year the Rann government will be recognised for its commitment, courage and foresight. Kerin’s Liberals, I predict, will do very badly in the north-western suburbs, hopefully costing them seats in the Legislative Council. And, if by some travesty Kerin does fall in, the Port Adelaide community will rally and stop the building of fixed bridges. Mark my words: there will be no more fixed bridges in Port Adelaide. Boothby Electorate: Adelaide Hills Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (9.44 am)-I want to inform the House about an important new step to support residents of the Adelaide Hills who have had to put up with the squealing of train wheels. The issue has been that, as trains, especially long and heavy freight carriers, wind their way through the hills, their wheels often let out a piercing sound. This gradient is one of the steepest in Australia. For members not familiar with the beautiful Adelaide Hills, in my electorate, the rail lines carve a path through residential and built-up areas. It is one thing to have the rumbling of a train passing by; it is another thing altogether to have its wheels screeching on bends in the track. A number of residents in my electorate have complained to me about the noise, particularly from freight trains. MAIN COMMITTEE This is something that I took up with the Australian Rail Track Corporation, the private body that now manages the rail lines throughout South Australia. Recently, the ARTC got back in touch with me to tell me that they were doing something about the noise. They have introduced a system on the tracks in the hills to detect and report on undue noises coming from the trains. It is a system called RailSQAD. It will record and analyse individual wheel set noises from all locomotives and wagons travelling through the hills. Starting from next month, detailed reports will be sent to the Environment Protection Agency on a monthly basis. These will outline both the noise emissions at the Heathfield detection site and the individual train operators’ performances. It will then be up to the operators to have the offending wheels and axles adjusted to quell the squealing. I am confident that this technology will help freight carriers get squeaky wheels off the tracks and provide relief for local residents. Only a couple of weeks ago I met the CEO of the Australian Rail Track Corporation, David Marchant, at Glenalta station in my electorate. We discussed the new technology with the local state MP, the Hon. Iain Evans MP, who has been a long campaigner on this issue. Operators are contributing half of the $500,000 installation cost. The ARTC will fund the remaining half, along with the ongoing running costs. This is a good news story for local residents, but we will not let it rest there. Iain and I will be keeping tabs on this issue. If we find that there continues to be excessive noise coming from freight trains, we will get back onto the ARTC. We also have the issue of whether freight trains should continue to operate in the Adelaide Hills. Late last year there was a potentially disastrous derailment of a freight train at Glenalta station. For many residents the incident highlighted the need to have these long, heavy trains diverted out through the north of Adelaide instead of winding through the hills. This is an issue that I have taken up with the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. It is clearly a much bigger issue than the simple squealing of wheels and it is one on which I will continue to represent the local interests of my constituents who live in the area. Franklin Electorate: Ralphs Bay torate who waged a wonderful campaign to save Ralphs Bay in the electorate of Franklin. I also want to congratulate Walker Corporation for its part in finally recognising the democratic rights of the Lauderdale community. The community spoke loud and clear. They spoke with a united voice and with the backing of science to support their environmental arguments about Ralphs Bay. It could not be clearer that not just Lauderdale residents but many Tasmanians could not see the logic of relocating thousands of tonnes of rocks to fill up a bay on which to build more than 400 houses. Queensland and New South Wales have already realised the folly of such developments and have banned them. Lauderdale residents and other concerned Tasmanians could see the prospect of Walker Corporation building first in Ralphs Bay and then all around the Tasmanian coastline. These residents spoke up and Walker Corporation finally listened. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that Tasmania has plenty of land on which to build houses and plenty of room for marinas in which people can moor their boats.

Iraq (Question No. 1889) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 9 August 2005: (1) Can he explain the Government’s policy on providing assistance to Iraq’s transition to democracy and on establishing and strengthening its democratic institutions. (2) Can he confirm reports that the Australian Electoral Commission has adopted a policy of not allowing its staff to volunteer for work assisting the electoral authorities in Iraq. (3) Is the AEC’s decision consistent with Australia’s stated support for the development of democratic institutions in Iraq. Mr DownerThe answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Australia supports international efforts to secure a peaceful, stable and democratic future for Iraq. Australian assistance reinforces the capacity of the Iraqi people to make their own decisions about their future. We have provided $5 million to the United Nations Development Group Iraq Trust Fund to strengthen Iraq’s democratic institutions and to support the democratic process. Australia has supported the development of democracy in Iraq by making an AEC officer available to attend the Iraq Election Monitoring Forum held in Ottawa in December 2004; by making the AEC Deputy Electoral Commissioner available to serve on the steering committee of the International Mission for the Iraqi Elections; by providing technical advice to the United Nations team which supported the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq in its conduct of the January 2005 elections; by making an AEC officer available on leave without pay to serve with the United Nations office in Amman; and by hosting two Commissioners of the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq in Australia as part of the AEC’s 2004 Federal Election Visitor Program. Successful elections were held in Iraq in January 2005 and preparations are continuing, with the assistance of the UN, for the upcoming constitutional referendum in October and the elections in December. (2) The Australian Electoral Commission has advised this is correct, and that its decision on this issue has taken into account the travel advisories relating to Iraq published by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

(4) What other costs have been or will be incurred in relation to this project. Mr John Cobb-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. The poster promotes the departmental publication Beginning a life in Australia booklets, published in English and 23 community languages. (2) The Department sent the poster to all Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) State and Territory offices, all DIMIA Overseas Posts and to Migrant Resource Centres. It will also be included in a package of information being sent to the electorate offices of all Senators and Members. In addition, eTranslate.com.au sent the poster to bilingual doctors across Australia. (3) The services provided by eTranslate.com.au were poster design, translation, printing and mail-out. (4) The only costs additional to the $12,922 paid to eTranslate are general postage costs borne by the Department. Memoranda of Understanding (Question No. 2096) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 17 August 2005: (1) Does his department maintain a register, list or other compilation of arrangements of less than treaty status (such as, but not limited to, Memoranda of Understanding) that have been entered into by the Australian Government with foreign governments.
