Of course, all women will not avail themselves of this provision. matta) [10.55],I know that the Government, in proposing this amendment, is yielding to requests made on behalf of women's organizations, but unfortunately the granting of this request has created an anomaly to which attention should be drawn. Thus, women who exercise the option to pay the additional 6d. will be placed in a position of equality witb adult males in regard to contributions, but not in regard to benefits, until they attain the age at which they are eligible to draw the old-age pension. They will not be entitled to the same benefits in regard to sickness, disablement, &c. titled to draw the old-age pension five vears earlier. is traditional in Australian pension practice. I appreciate, however, that this will be a tremendous boon to women, particularly to those who are already well up in years. A woman who is now 50 or even 55 years of age, may, by paying the extra 6d., qualify to receive at 60 an extra 5s. a week. fixed. Sir That is so. I wish, however, that we could remove all discrimination between the sexes with regard to benefits. Proposed new clause agreed to. [10.58] I m o v e That inserted:(!4A. A person who has been insured as a juvenile contributor, and who, either has not attained the age of sixteen years, or has not liecu employed since attaining the "" age of sixteen years, shall be eligible for sickness benefit for so long only as he remains entitled to medical benefit by virtue of section fortyexperience no d if f i c u l t y in accepting t h is nine of this act, but, during the period during which he is so entitled, notwithstanding anything contained in section sixty-two ot this act his right to receive sickness benefit, during nny period of incapacity for work arising from sickness, shall continue until the termination of the twenty-sixth week from the date upon which he became entitled to receive that benefit, or until he attains the age of sixteen years, whichever last happens. This clause has heen introduced in accordance with a promise which I made last night as the result of representations by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James). The purpose of the clause is to continue the payment of sickness benefit to juveniles after the expiration of 26 weeks, so as to avoid the hiatus that might otherwise occur between the cessation of sickness benefit and the commencement of disablement benefit. Juveniles will now be entitled to receive sickness benefit until they reach the age of sixteen, at which age they will he qualified to obtain disablement benefit at the rate for juveniles. thank the Treasurer ( Mr Casey). Many of the juveniles on the coal-fields would be adversely affected if the new clause were not inserted. I do not say that there would be a great number of accidents which would have results of such lasting nature as the amendment provides for, but, at the same time, eventualities must be covered, and, now, in the event of a juvenile meeting with a serious accident, which is not compensatable, this new provision will cover him up to the age of sixteen years, if need be.

The residential and nationality provisions in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act are harsh compared with those contained in the British pensions law. I gave the Treasurer a case the other day of a woman, born in Samoa, who is married to a Cornishman and who, for 35 years of her 46 years of married life, has Queensland. She is, by virtue of her nationality, debarred from receiving the invalid pension. I hope the Treasurer will make it possible for the wife or widow to secure the old-age pension when she has qualified hy age without the means test being applied. [11.8] -In my second-reading speech I dealt at some length with, the many aspects of, and alternatives to, the benefits contained in this bill. I set out in general to describe the alternatives with which the Government was faced and informed honourable members that the Government believed that it had chosen the most worthwhile alternatives to make the money available from contributions and from the Government subsidy go as far as possible in the directions where it would do the most good. It is true, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Martens), that the British act contains a provision something similar to that contained in his amendment, hut our hill and the British act are by no means the same. In some directions, relative to contributions, the British act is more liberal than it is proposed that this bill should be, but, in other directions, our hill is more liberal than the British act. Over the whole range,, as I have already shown by figures, our bill is the more liberal of the two schemes. The principle behind the amendment moved by the honourable member was definitely considered by the Government, but it was thought best to frame our benefits in the way they have been framed in this bill. The amendment would seek to give to the wife of a man in receipt of a pension under this bill, or to the widow of such a man who had been in receipt of a pension under this bill, a pension under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act without a means test. In other words, a special concession is sought to be given to widows who are in receipt of a pension under this bill or wives of -men who are in receipt of the old-age pension under this bill. That would in many cases lead to duplication of pension. Some widows would receive a double pension. pension for nobody. The proposed clause been a resident of North merely sets out that where a widow or a wife applies for a pension she shall not have to undergo a means test. scheme cannot afford this innovation which probably would be a source of considerable additional cost. Whilst having considerable sympathy with the motive of (Corio-Treasurer ) the honourable gentleman, the Government feels that it has gone to the limits in the various directions including the direction of wives and widows. I regret that the Government is unable to see its way to accept the amendment. I hope that the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) will reconsider his decision not to accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Martens), who is to be commended for bringing it down. If accepted, the amendment would enable the wives and widows of persons entitled",16,Frederick Stewart Act And Who Is Entitled To An Old Age Pension

That is not an innovation in schemes of this kind. Provision of a nature similar to that sought in the amendment is contained in section 11 of the British act. I can understand that it would cost the national insurance scheme more money, but one of the chief objections to this measure from this side of the committee is that it does not go far enough in giving concessions to insured persons and their dependants and that, particularly, it discriminates iu various ways against women. The Australian scheme in this respect should be at least as generous as the British scheme. Furthermore, we believe that in this scheme there should be no residential or nationality disqualification. the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. in this act, a pension payable to a blind perThe honourable member for Herbert cited son one case in which this disability operates. of the receipt by that person of benefit under Wc submit that the amendment is reasonthis act."". able and that the Treasurer should reconsider his attitude. If he cannot agree to the insertion of the amendment in this committee he could have it inserted in the Senate. The amendment would not cost as much as the Treasurer has estimated. Proposed new clause negatived. [1.1.14] I move That the following new clause be inserted:"" 92A.

I am indebted to the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) for drawing my attention to the need for this provision. The Government is glad to bring down this proposed new clause to cope with the situation which, as the honourable gentleman was good enough to point out, might exist in certain cases. The purpose of the proposed new clause is to do away with the hiatus in respect of an inserted:orphan or dependent child who is permanently incapacitated between the age this act shall not be taken into account in of fifteen years, when the pension normally payable to orphans or dependent children ends, and the age of sixteen years, at which age persons may qualify for the invalid pension by reason of total and permanent incapacity under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. appreciate what the Treasurer has done. I raised this question on a previous occasion because I had noticed the more liberal provision in the British act. There are many cases that will be affected by the proposed new clause. In my opinion the repatriation legislation should contain a similar provision, and I hope that when the opportunity occurs it will be inserted. Proposed new clause agreed to.. [11.16] I m o v e That the following new clause be inserted:"" 9OA. Notwithstanding anything contained under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act 1908-1937 shall not be reduced by reason In the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act blind persons are dealt with as a special class to the degree that the income limit allowed is £227 10s. a year compared with £84 10s. in the case of old-age pensioners who are not blind. The proposed new clause, which is in keeping with the (Corio -Treasurer ) special provision in the Invalid and Old age Pensions Act, makes a further concession to blind people by excluding nation of income under the Invalid -and Old age Pensions Act. There are about 2,500 blind pensioners in Australia, and about 500 of these, being in work, are likely to come under the provisions of the national insurance scheme. The concession will, of course, involve additional cost, but it is a cost which the Government is willing, and indeed glad, to bear in order to alleviate still further the disabilities of blind people.

(2.) Where the commission has certified under this section the amount of any contribution which an employer has failed to pay, and that amount or any part thereof is subsequently recovered, the amount recovered shall be credited to sueh fund as the commission determines."" This proposal is in substitution for the proposed new clause 178A previously circulated. I believe I am indebted to the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Jolly) for the proposal, and the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) also discussed the question. The proposed new clause is designed to secure that an insured person shall not suffer loss of benefits by his employer's failure to pay contributions due under the act. It is supplementary to clauses 173 and 175, which provide for the prosecution of defaulting employers, and clause 177, which allows an insured person, backed if necessary by an approved society, to prosecute his employer if loss of health benefits follows the employer's failure to pay his part of the contributions. Clause 178 gives priority of claim to an insured person, in the event of the bankruptcy of the employer, for contributions that the employer has omitted to pay. employee has to satisfy the commission that the deductions have been made from his wages, and in that event he will he protected by a certificate of the commission from loss of benefits. out proceeding against the employer? will use every possible means to recover contributions from the defaulting employer.

The proposed new clause is almost identlie following new clause be tical with an amendment I moved. I . think it is as good as we can make it, Proposed new clause agreed to. I move That the following new clause be inserted:"" 1 8 3 A ( 1 . ) This act shall not apply to any person employed by a public authority if and so long as such person is a member of a society of persons so employed in Tespect of which society upon its application for exemption the commission certifies that the benefits provided by the society together with benefits by way of superannuation or retiring allowance provided either by the public authority only or out of a contributory fund are on the whole not loss favorable than tlie benefits conferred by this act. (2.) If the commission refuses to certify under this section the commission shall state its reasons and the society shall be at liberty to renew its application for exemption. (3.) If the commission is satisfied that, by reason of a change of the rules of the society or of the terms of employment of its members, the grounds upon which the certificate was given no longer exist, it.shall cancel the certificate and this act shall thereupon apply to persons employed by the public authority notwithstanding that they are memberB of the society. (4.) In this section ""public a u t h o r it y "" means an authority under the authority of the Commonwealth or a State constituted by or under any act or State act."". This proposal deals with a situation for which the bill makes no provision. The second part of the first schedule enables the commission to exempt, in whole or in part, public employees if the commission is satisfied that the terms of the employment correspond to those provided for in the bill. The cases I want to bring under notice are -those in which the benefits are The partly subscribed for by the employee and partly by the employer. The employees form a benefit society. The employer does not require them to belong to that society, but as a matter of fact all the employees do belong to it.

66,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [11.23],"acting under powers conferred by act of Parliament, makes provision for a superannuation fund. Specifically, tbe case is that of tbe Mutual Benefit society of the employees of tbe Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board. It would be impossible for that society to be recognized as au approved society, because the employees are iu Melbourne and not in the whole State. we may consider later. An employee pays into the benefit society 9d. a week, and rhe board pays another 9d. There is also a benefit fund to which each member pays ls. a quarter, and the board another is. a quarter. Every member who is sick receives £ 1 a week from the society ancl a similar amount from the board, making :i total of £2 a week. Members receive health service not only for themselves as members of the society, but also for their wives and children if they are married, and for their widowed mothers if they are unmarried. Nasal, eye, and dental treatment is also provided. Acting under the powers conferred upon it by act of Parliament, the board has created a superannuation fund, out of which it makes liberal payments to employees. An employee who is retired at .60 years of age after ten years' service is entitled to the equivalent of two years' salary. If his service has been shorter he is entitled to proportionately less. probably a great number of similar societies in Australia, and their position ought to be considered by the commission. I am making my present proposal because I am assured that, if the bill becomes law without provision being made for the benefit society I have referred to, the Meling an amount equivalent to the contribourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board will discontinue its contributions to the society. the employees will he much worse off than they are at present. The organization they have built up provides them with, better benefits than those provided for in the bill. There is a danger that the society will collapse and that the board will content itself merely with making contributions under the act. The board is not hound as a matter of law to continue its contributions to the benefit society, or to continue its superannuation fund. I am assured by members of the board that it will not be able to continue its contributions either to the society or to the superannuation scheme if it is brought within the scope of the hill. I am pro-posing that if the society applies for an exemption the commission may examine the position and, if it certifies that the benefits provided by the society, plus the' employer, are on the whole not less f avor-able to the employee than the benefits' provided for in the bill, the commission may exempt members of the society from participation in the national scheme. Further, the commission will be able to refuse to certify and may state its grounds for refusal, and the society may apply again later. If the board makes an alteration in the direction of giving additional protection I suggest that the society, in the altered circumstances, ought to be empowered to apply again. Also, I suggest that the commission should have power to withdraw a certificate if it finds that the conditions have been so changed as to be unfavorable to the employees. The commission will have power to investigate. I submit to the committee and to the Government that it does not appear from the bill that the commission can take this action. It could exempt them if it thought that the terms of their employment gave to them benefits equivalent to those given under this scheme, but it is not"" a matter of terms of employment There are because the men are not required to join the society, although, as a matter of fact, they do join the society. The board does not say to the employees "" You must join the mutual benefit society""; it has declined to give that direction. Buti f they do join, it assists them hy contributbution. In addition, it makes a superannuation allowance in respect of In that event its employees, whether they are memhers of the society or not. I suggest that this measure does not contemplate such a position; yet it is a position which exists not merely in the tramway service hut also, to my knowledge, although I am not acquainted with the details, in the railways service and other public bodies. There is a railways benefit society. I think that the commission ought to have the power of exemption, so that it could",19,Frederick Stewart Act And Who Is Entitled To An Old Age Pension

In addition, it should have the power to revoke any certificate of exemption it had given, if it were satisfied that the benefits were no longer as good as those here prescribed. All that I propose is that the commission shall have the power to investigate and if satisfied with the result of its investigation to act upon it. scheme will be very unpopular in many quarters if it deprives those concerned of any better benefits. In my opinion, the benefits given by the society, to which I have specifically referred, are in considerable degree better than those proposed under this scheme, and the scheme of the society will collapse if the measure is passed in its present form. [""11.32] -The amendment of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) revives a very considerable discussion which took place on clause 24, in the matter of what bodies or groups of employees should or might be exempt from the operation of the act. As honourable members know, the proposal in tliis bill, which has been accepted by the passage of clause 24, is to the effect that the commission shall have the right, upon application, to exempt from the operation of the act, in whole or in part, bodies of employees whose benefits are guaranteed by a government and which are, either wholly or partially, the equivalent of the benefits to be given under this act. That is the general principle. The Government, for what it believes to be good reasons, has set its face against the exemption of other than those types. This proposal again raises the whole question as to whether or not the power of exemption should be extended beyond those employments in which the benefits are guaranteed by a government. ""We believe that the minimum number of persons in Australia should be exempt from the act; that in its operation the act should be as broad as possible. We are seeking to invest persons who come within the scope of the act-that is, all persons doing manual lahour and all other persons up to a certain income limitwith the obligation to contribute and the right to receive benefits. They carry those personal rights with them even though they may move from employment to employment or from one place to another in Australia. We believe that that is the right thing to do. Were we to accept this particular amendment, it would be but a very short step indeed to the exemption of a very large number of persons in all sorts of provident schemes in private employment throughout the There is no doubt that this Commonwealth. As I have said earlier, some of these schemes are very good, some are indifferent, and some are quite bad. By giving exemption to such persons we should, in effect, guarantee the schemes as far as the employee was concerned. The honourable gentleman himself takes account of the fact that schemes such as the one he particularly has in mind may deteriorate, in which-event the commission would be called upon, by reason of the changed circumstances, to (Corio-Treasurer ) revoke the exemption it had given. In that case the employees concerned would be obliged to come into this scheme, and laboriously establish through the respective waiting periods the right to the respective benefits prescribed. Therefore, we believe that the best course is to maintain the present position of having a very limited exemption in respect of government employees, where governments make application and the terms of employment provide roughly the equivalent of the benefits of this scheme. Were we not to exempt those classes we should be gilding the lily, by duplicating the benefits. This scheme makes provision for certain benefits. If the same benefits, or roughly their equivalent, are already provided for by other governments, we see no call to duplicate them. For these reasons, while quite respecting the honourable gentleman's viewpoint, the Government regrets that it cannot accept the amendment. -The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has not read my amendment. I have definitely limited my proposal to employees of public authorities. them in the same way as they are defined, in effect, in the schedule. be so limited?",20,Frederick Stewart Act And Who Is Entitled To An Old Age Pension

There is another point to which I omitted to refer earlier. Judging by the cases that have come to our notice up to the present, I do not believe that any provident scheme, fund, or employees' organization will experience any insuperable difficulty in adjusting itself to the national insurance scheme. approved societies. Mi-. CASEY -That would be the case even if they dlid not; hut it would be easier if they did. To the extent that this national insurance scheme treads on the toes, as it were, of these other schemes, we believe it is possible to adjust the latter in respect allowances and are awarded certain of both contributions and benefits. It may be, as the honourable gentleman suggests, that some of these schemes may offer greater benefits in certain directions, but I find it difficult to believe that for the limited contribution of 9d. any scheme could provide on the whole benefits equal to those provided under this scheme, or would be nearly so broad or generous as this scheme. tramway scheme provides sick pay of £2 a week. also provide old-age and widow's pension benefits, or a free insurance period ? The honourable gentleman will admit, I feel sure, that such benefits could not be provided for so limited a contribution. I have just been informed that the benefit society at Yallourn,, consisting of employees of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, will be eligible as an approved society. might have employees anywhere in Victoria. [11.46] I urge the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) to give further consideration to the case of the society mentioned by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn). I feel sure that the Government, in implementing this scheme, has no desire to harm any existing organization. I point out that whenever an application as between the Melbourne ancl Metropolitan Tramways Board and its employees comes under review, the industrial tribunal takes into consideration the benefits enjoyed by the employees as members of this mutual benefit society when calculating the value of their services. Recognizing that many difiiculties would be met with in the initial stage of this scheme, the Government, I am sure, intends to implement it with as little disorganization as possible «of existing benefit societies. That being so, it can becomo should consider exempting, temporarily at least, such bodies as are so sound and permanent as the mutual benefit society of the employees of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board. The board is a semi-governmental body; its employees enjoy retiring marks and badges in respect of their services. They are not temporary or casual employees. The average contribution to their benefit fund is approximately lOd. If the Government cannot exempt, this society altogether for a while, it should at least ensure that these employees are not done any injury in respect of any benefit they now enjoy, at the same time giving them the opportunity to Melbourne insure immediately under this scheme for such long-term benefits as the pension benefit. A sick pay of £2 a week is very generous indeed, and nothing like it can be given under this scheme. One reason why this society can provide such a. generous benefit and at the same time be run so cheaply, is that doctors employed by the board are always on the spot to attend to injuries caused by accident, and their services generally are available to the society. The scheme is a two-party scheme, and the immediate benefits provided are much greater than its memhers could hope to receive under this national insurance scheme. I admit that no national scheme of insurance could pro-",22,Frederick Stewart Act And Who Is Entitled To An Old Age Pension

That is a fundamental feature of such a scheme, and no government could afford to exempt all of the best risks simply because they happen to he catered for in a better way under some individual scheme. I again suggest that in the initial stages of this scheme, the Government should recognize this society in respect of the benefits it now provides in sick pay and unemployment allowance, and at the same time give its members the opportunity to insure immediately for those benefits which are provided under the national scheme but not under their own scheme. Let these particular employees continue their society until such time as it is decided completely under the national scheme, otherwise considerable injury will he done to a large number of people. I repeat that whenever industrial applications as between the board and its employees come under review, the advantages received by the employees as members of this society are used as an argument against the granting of improved working conditions, and if their society is forced otit of existence they will have no chance of receiving increases of pay in order to compensate for benefits lost. tiave to be made in respect of other organizations. stable as this society exist they are entitled Metropolitan Gas Company, which he to such treatment. of stability?

The board's scheme is backed by a government, and no personal influence or suggestion of intimidation enters into it, as it has been stated in the Arbitration Court is often the case in respect of private company schemes. missioner of Taxation stated that the Metropolitan Gas Company's scheme did not give any protection to the employees at all. the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board and its employees would be prepared to confer with a view to seeing how these employees could be brought under the national scheme without jeopardizing the benefits they now enjoy under their own scheme. [11.54] -The Government believes that it would do a real injury to a large that they should come number of employees if it left them out of this scheme. Between the passage of this measure and its actual coming into effect, a period of at least six months will elapse, and if, within that, period, such schemes as that of the mutual benefit society of the employees of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board cannot be adjusted to this national scheme, then, to use an unparliamentary expression, "" I will eat my hat."" No difficulty will be involved in adjusting a company scheme or any other scheme to this scheme. A number of these schemes, as the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) is aware, are the subject of legal contract between the employer and his employees. In the case of the mentioned, the company claimed certain deductions from income tax, but under the Income Tax Assessment Act and its regulations no company is entitled to deductions in respect of contributions to an employees' provident scheme unless such a scheme is watertight and irrevocable. In order to'comply with the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act, a very large number of these schemes have been placed ou a proper basis as between employer and employee. In the case' of these funds, I have approached t!ie State governments to pass legislation to facilitate the adjustment of these schemes to the Commonwealth's scheme, because it is not within the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to make any such provision in this bill as is provided",23,Frederick Stewart Act And Who Is Entitled To An Old Age Pension

106,Mr Casey (Corio,"Treasurer)in tlie British, act.. We believe that it will ultimately be to the advantage of all these persons to be brought within a Commonwealth scheme, because no private scheme can be so satisfactory to the workers as a national scheme. I do not know of any private provident scheme in respect of which the contribution is on other than a 50-50 basis. We have that principle embodied in this bill, but in . addition we have very considerable and increasing governmental subventions to this scheme. There can be no doubt, therefore, that with very few exceptions this national scheme must operate much more in the interests of employees than any existing private scheme, notwithstanding the fact that in one or two directions non-governmental schemes may provide greater benefits. Broadly considered, they cannot possibly be as beneficial as a national scheme. in Western Australia have no superannuation scheme, will they come under this scheme ? tially or wholly under the scheme. The bill makes provision for partial exemption, but such employees may be brought under the scheme on the health side, as well aS for pension benefit. [11.57] -In reply to the honourable members for Bourke( Mr Blackburn), and Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway), the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) said that in the interregnum between the passage of this measure and its coming into effect, an opportunity would be given to adjust schemes of the kind mentioned to this national scheme. I wish to draw attention to the Victorian Railways employees mutual benefit socicty'r, scheme. This is backed by a government department, but whether or not it has sufficient members iin approved society under this measure, I do not know. In one respect it has an advantage over the scheme of the mutual benefit society of the employees of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board in that its members are scattered throughout the State. Furthermore, various societies are run by employees themselves. These provide for payment to memhers only in respect of time off for sickness or injury. They are operated cheaply because they do not provide medical treatment for members, which is paid partly by lodges of which the particular employees are members. These societies do not pay for such services in the same way as benefit, societies, and, therefore, they do not compete with the latter societies in that respect. Since the introduction of this measure, I have been informed that these particular employees' organizations, sucli as the rolling-stock branch of the Victorian Railways Department at North Melbourne and similar bodies at. Jolimont and Newport, have large memberships. I take it that they will be able to amalgamate in Order to qualify from the point of view of strength of membership as an approved society under this measure. employees ? benefit schemes I am now referring to are not backed by the Government. However, they have heen in existence for over 20 years. Will it be possible for them to amalgamate in order to comply with the membership qualification of an approved society under this scheme, or must they go out of (Maribyrnong) existence altogether? These men are very concerned on this point. There are well-conducted railway benefit societies; but I do not suggest that they can be regarded as competitors with established friendly societies because they do not cover the same field. They do provide benefits for railway men in regular employment which the employees desire to retain. The Treasurer contends that in many instances it would be better for such employees to come under the national insurance scheme, and that it may be possible before the act becomes operative to qualify as for some of these societies to amalgamate ancl to some extent retain their identity. The tramways benefit society, to which the honourable member for Bourke referred, is a very worthy organization. Many tramway employees who live in my electorate are known to me personally, and I know that they are anxious that their present organization shall not be disturbed. In view of all the circumstances I trust that the railways' benefit",24,Frederick Stewart Act And Who Is Entitled To An Old Age Pension

[12.2] -An application for exemption of the society mentioned by the honourable ford) would have to be made by the State government, as it is a society operating within a State government service. Speaking offhand, I should say that so long as the conditions of employment of the men whom the honourable member mentioned do not guarantee them benefits wholly or partially equivalent to those provided in the bill, the State government would be guided as to whether or not they applied for whole or partial exemption, or in fact for any exemption at all. Assuming that the State government did not apply for exemption in respect of the employees referred to by the honourable member, there would be no disability placed upon them in that they could amalgamate their various societies into one approved society. I have received letters from members of such societies, some of which are very illuminating, particularly as to the amounts they have to contribute on a rate-for-age basis in order to qualify for certain benefits. One correspondent said that he was paying Ss. 6d. a week in order to qualify for a pension of 20s. a week. whom I referred contribute ls. a week. some -who pay on a rate-for-age basis are paying contributions which are appallingly high. consider the practicability of arranging for societies such as I have mentioned becoming approved societies? that undertaking. stances I ask leave to withdraw the proposed new clause. Proposed new clause-by leave-with drawn. move That the following new clause be inserted1.83A.. Notwithstanding anything in this act contained the employer's contributions in respect of any persons employed by a hospital or other charitable institution shall be provided by the Commonwealth. The object of the proposed new clause is (Corio Treasurer) to provide that the employers' contributions in respect of persons employed by a public hospital or other charitable institution shall be paid by the Commonwealth and not by the institution. In New South Wales, and also in other States, hospitals are maintained by contributions usually of 6d. or Is. a week. Various hospital schemes are in force, hut when the Government's proposals become operative most of these schemes will have to be abandoned. Employees will not continue to contribute to hospitals because some of the medical benefits for which they are at present contributing will be provided under this scheme. The hospitals will he substantial losers as they will not receive a subsidy under this scheme for the services rendered. This scheme will involve many hospitals in substantial losses by reason of the fact that they will also have to pay the employers' contributions in respect of their employees. This will make it even more difficult for many hospitals to carry on the good work they are now performing. negotiation between the States and the Commonwealth ? made in this bill. In the Pamily Endowment Act of New South Wales, passed in 1927, it was provided that in the case of public hospitals and.public benevolent or charitable institutions employers' contributions should be exempted. There is no reason why a similar provision should uot be inserted in this bill. If these institutions are not assisted in the direction suggested, it willmake it very difficult for local committees to raise sufficient funds for the maintenance of hospitals. No obstacles should be placed in the way of hospitals and ^benevolent or charitable institutions, which, under this bill, will be responsiblefor the payment of employers' contributions. I have received a number of letters from various hospital authorities in my electorate complaining of the imposition of an employer's contribution, and asking for exemption.

They feel sure that they will lose a considerable amount particularly in respect of voluntary contributions of 6d. or ls. a week. They will not receive any subsidy under this scheme, and will have difficulty in meeting their liability as employers. The BrokenH ill hospital is financed largely by contributions from the miners nnd by the mine owners; it is a form of compulsory contribution. The employees receive medical benefits through that hospital, but when this scheme is brought into operation the employees will be compelled to further contribute for medical benefits which they now receive through the hospital. Hospitals will be involved iu a considerable increase of expenditure and a large proportion of their contributions will be discontinued. The position is quite clear and I think that this is an appropriate occasion to provide that in the case of public hospitals and other charitable institutions the employer's contribution be paid by the Commonwealth.

We must admit that some hospitals will find it more difficult to raise the necessary funds to enable them to carry on. If the financial responsibility wore placed upon the Commonwealth it would create a precedent and requests for similar exemptions would be made by other authorities. Australia should fall into line with Queensland, where deficiencies in hospital finance are met by the State government paying 60 per cent, and the municipal authorities 40 per cent.

Paragraph a of PartI . covers the main groups""for which provision is to be made, that is, those employed within the Commonwealth under contract of service or apprenticeship. Paragraph b deals with the first special group to be insured, that is, those employed on board ship. Persons in this group are essentially part of Australia's industrial activity although they are, necessarily, for a great part of their time technically outside the Commonwealth. Paragraph c contains the second special group, namely, out-workers, as defined in the schedule. These people are actually employed under contract of service, and the commission is empowered, at its discretion, to include them. The intention of the Government, and, of course, of the commission which is to administer this legislation, is to endeavour to include as many classes of persons as possible under the national insurance scheme. Naturally, with the very great diversity of employments throughout Australia it is impossible to cover specifically all contingencies that may arise in the administration of the provisions of this bill. Consequently it is necessary to give certain discretionary power to the commission to deal with border-line cases. Paragraph d covers the third special group to be insured, namely, employees such as shearers, canecutters, share-farmers, and others engaged",26,Frederick Stewart Act And Who Is Entitled To An Old Age Pension

I move That tlie following words be omitted from paragraph (c) :-""excep t in so far as sucli employment is excluded by a special order by the commission "". I feel that this paragraph to the schedule presents a very serious danger. Despite the policing activities of trade unions and industrial and arbitration inspectors, employers are ""getting away"" wholesale with sweating, and only in isolated cases are convictions secured. the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr from being excluded from the scheme Curtin) that if this paragraph is allowed to go through as it stands, the system of out-work will be given a great impetus, and one of the most objectionable features of our industrial system will be perpetuated. of the proposed words the commission will not have power to exclude any of these people. That is the sole purpose of my amendment. I am not concerned with its effect on one or two people here and there; while it may impose a little hardship on a few individuals, it will prevent wholesale hardship from being inflicted on a great number of persons associated with the industrial system in the cities. If the schedule be passed in its present form, many sweating employers will be given open encouragement to carry on activities which constitute such an undesirable feature of the factory system in Australia. matta)' [2.16] -Speaking only a few days ago the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) made a prophecy. He suggested that whereas at that stage, apparently, many people in Australia, including their representatives in this chamber, were contribution-conscious, they would shortly become benefitconscious. Few of us then, thought that that prophecy would be completely fulfilled within the short space of a few hours; the proposals now being made, however, suggest that that prophecy has already been completely fulfilled.' I am glad to know that there is a desire to bring more people into the scheme, so that they may participate in its benefits. No exemptions shouljd be competitive unfairness as between groups of employers. is quite a worthy objective. I rose, however, to express my pleasure at the fact that already the prospective benefits of this measure are becoming apparent. I hope that that will be the attitude of the whole of the Australian public towards this measure in the not distant future. [2.19] -The object of the amendment is to try to prevent some 8,000 or 10,000 people, mostly women, employed in the I agree with great clothing industry of this country, because of the nature of their employment. For tlie last four or five years Judge Drake-Brockman, of the Arbitration Court, the officers of the Clothing Trades Federation-whic h by the way is By the deletion anxious to become an approved societyand the best employers in the clothing industry have pooled their efforts to stamp out the sweating evil. Their sole aim is to place all manufacturers on a fair footing of competition. It is not the best, but the worse, employer who makes the pace, with the result that, very often, the best employer is put out of business. The best employers have pooled their interests and have appealed to the court; Judge Drake-Brockman has promised his assistance in dealing with this problem. Evidence given before the court discloses that most of the 8,000 or 10,000 persons employed in tlie clothing industry are classified as out-workers. The difficulty in dealing with employers of labour of this sort is that they sell the material to out-workers to be made up into garments. They will continue to do so, and will use every device not only to beat the court, but also to be able to avoid responsibility for contributions to the National Insurance Fund in respect of outworkers in their employ. I am anxious to help the commission to safeguard the interests of the best employers and the. employees. The employer in this industry who will not stand up to the resolutions of his chamber of manufactures, and who seeks to undermine the decent employer by this means, will do anything to defeat the commission or the court, or anybody else, if it is to his advantage.",28,Frederick Stewart Act And Who Is Entitled To An Old Age Pension

149,Mr Mahoney (Denison) [2.32],"1[2.38] -Paragraph , c defines ""outworker "". includes every class of person who can conceivably be regarded as an out-worker. 1 include a person working under a special contract ? because it is wide enough to include every worker.' Indeed, the definition is so wide that it includes certain persons whom it was not intended should be covered by this legislation. The effect of the amendment would be to throw on the draftsman the responsibility of defining precisely those persons who should be regarded as out-workers, and, by inference, the classes of workers that should be excluded. The amendment would introduce into the schedule a rigidity that would make proper administration impossible. The granting of a discretionary power to the commission will avoid much trouble in the future. In my opinion, the commission must have that discretionary power because it is not possible in an act of Parliament to define every^ class of person who should be included or excluded. The definition should be made as wide as possible, with power for the commission to exclude those sections which cannot reasonably be included. Parliament would have the right to discuss the regulations providing for such exclusions. would be by order, not by regulation. enced, adjustments will be made to enable Parliament to deal with any such exclusion. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) is right in saying that the definition of "" out-worker "" covers all classes of persons, hut there is one thing that binds them together-they are persons to whom work is given for the purposes of the business of the givers. In the clothing trade, for instance, work is performed by persons who obviously are direct employees, and are, therefore, covered by this scheme. ployer may also let some of his work to contractors or sub-contractors. Should such persons do the work individually, they will be covered by paragraph d. An employer may also give work to outworkers-person s who work in their own Obviously, that definition homes, or elsewhere, outside the factory of the person who supplies them with the work. There are, therefore, three classes of workers. The amendment of the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) has been misrepresented as an attempt to bring certain persons under this legislation. That is not the desire of the honourable member or, indeed, of the Opposition. My opinion of the bill has been expressed earlier; the more I see of it, the more I dislike it, because it will not confer any substantial benefits on those who are supposed to be beneficiaries under the scheme which it sets up. The purpose of the Opposition is to protect employees who may -be brought under the scope of this measure from the unfair competition of other employees who will not come under it. A manufacturer should not be able to say, "" If I have this work done in my own factory, I shall have to pay ls. od. a week in respect of every employee. I shall, therefore, give the work to out-workers, and thereby evade making any contribution"". The Opposition is afraid that orders made by the commission may enable employers to give preference in employment to out-workers as against ordinary workers. As the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) knows, the position in exclusion the clothing trade became so acute that representatives of the employees and ol the employers conferred with a view to the practical abolition of out-work. It is almost impossible to control out-work in the clothing trade. The Opposition does not want to encourage manufacturers to give preference to out-workers over general employees. Any order that; exempts out-workers from making contributions, or that exempts employers from making contributions in respect of their employees, would encourage employers to have as much of their work as possible done by out-workers, rather than in their own factories. A special order is not a regulation. If . a' special But au emorder by the commission is made the House should have an opportunity to review it.

We do not wish to inflict injury on the out-worker. Our concern is to protect the ordinary employer from unfair competition by those who resort'to out-work.

Under paragraph j the commission will have power to exclude "" employment of such classes and in such areas as are prescribed "". regulation the position would not be quite so bad. for the Parliament to have the right to discuss these matters in connection with the regulations that will be issued. I ask ployees would automatically become the the members of the Opposition not to press the amendment, because, if carried, gave the contracts to smaller manuit would unduly restrict the commission in the exercise of its authority. As a half-way contribution to meet the point which the Treasurer has taken against the rigidity of the amendment moved by the honourable member for 'suggestion. Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini), and because of a strong desire on this side to retain excellent one, because I consider that this parliamentary authority over outworkers, I suggest that the Treasurer should agree to amend the paragraph to readEmployment in Australia as an out-worker except in so far as such employment is excluded by regulation. The commission has wide regulationmaking power under clause 188; indeed, it is given almost legislative authority. I suggest that, if anybody is to be excluded, that should be done by regulation. The Acts Interpretation Act authorizes certain procedure by members of Parliament if objection be taken to any regulation by a statutory authority, but I know of no procedure by which the (Corio-Treasurer) Parliament may challenge a special order committee will recognize of the commission. I cannot see how a special order could even get before Parliament. special orders is dealt with in clause 187. -Although I agree with what the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) has not gone quite far enough. It must he obvious to the committee that the amendment is too rigid in that it takes from the commission the right -of determination in specific instances. The commission should have authority to determine whether certain classes of employers should or should not be defined as outworkers. I have in mind such firms as David Jones, Anthony Hordern and Sons, and other large firms in Sydney and other capital cities in the Commonwealth, which manufacture in their own factories and also let out from those factories orders to a large number of small manufacturers. If those persons whodo this class of work were defined as out-workers many hundreds of emresponsibility of the larger firms which facturers.

Under this legislation, hospital services will be availed of by a larger number of persons than in the past, and in addition these institutions will lose a substantial part of their revenue which has been derived heretofore from voluntary subscriptions. The exemption for which I am asking would not impair the efficiency of the insurance scheme. It would simply mean that, if a hospital did. not cover its employees for medical benefit at least equal to that provided under this measure, its employees would come under the present scheme; but, if it gave medical aid equivalent, or superior to, that contemplated under the bill, it would be exempt from the provisions of the measure in' respect of medical benefit. I hope that the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) will see the wisdom of accepting my amendment. matta) [3.7] I hope that, in pursuance of the policy of widening rather than restricting the ambit of this scheme, the Government will adhere to the schedule as it stands. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) has suggested that medical attention and hospital attention are paifc of the emolument of hospital employees. In most cases this serviee is given as an act of grace, and is not recognized as a right. There is no certainty that this privilege will always be extended to the employees, and, if the amendment were accepted, it might well lie that some hospital employees would fall within the ambit of this legislation, as regards medical benefits, and others would not. Much has been said concerning the disability which the measure will impose on hospitals because of the extra contributions they will have to make in respect of their employees, but not a great deal has been heard regarding_ the offsetting advantage in that hospitals are among the institutions which do not suspend payment of the wages of their employees on account of illness, when they are unable to carry out their duties. The sickness and disablement benefits to be provided under this measure will save the hospitals a considerable expenditure in sick pay, and this will enable them to recoup themselves to a substantial degree for the outlay represented by their contributions as employers. I was hoping that the trend of the discussion since lunch time towards a recognition of the desirability of having an all-embracing national health insurance scheme would have been maintained. I trust that, instead of restricting the scope of the measure, the committee will rather widen it. -This amendment might easily prove to bo the thin end of a wedge for relieving the employers-in this case the hospital authorities-of the payment required for medical benefit As I have previously explained, not all nurses are permanently employed. Generally speaking, they move about a great deal. Their occupation is by no means static. A nurse may be in a hospital one day, and attending a case in a private home on the following day. We want ""to bring about a situation in which all working persons will carry about with them from employment ""to employment, and from place to place, their full obligation to pay under the scheme, and also their full rights to all benefits. The amendment, if agreed to, would disturb that situation, and, therefore, the Government cannot accept it. The hospitals will be no worse off under the scheme, because doctors, who now give free medical attention to hospital employees, will be able to set up a small panel on to which these employees can come. If any question of emolument' arises, it can be adjusted between the nurses and the hospitals. have to be financed either by public subscription or out of the consolidated revenues of the States. which tends to show that, their situation is not desperate. voluntary aid to hospitals. and I do not believe that the effect will be as the honourable member says.

We believe that it is in the interests of the nurses and other hospital attendants that they should be under the scheme, and be eligible for the widest possible benefits. admit that, having regard to the principle of the bill, there is something to be said for the argument of the Treasurer ( Mr gOA'ernments shall contribute ls. 6d. Casey) that all employees should be brought under the scheme. On the other hand, we must take into account the fact that there are a great many public hospitals in Australia engaged in providing a health service which this scheme does not cover. not provide for hospital services, and will, therefore, afford no relief to the budgets of the hospitals. patients. some extent, hut so much treatment is given, in hospitals Avithout payment that but little relief Avill be afforded. In New South Wales, there are 174 public hospitals; in Victoria, 63; in Queensland, 113; in South Australia, 47; in Western Australia, 93; and in Tasmania, 19. All of these are managed by boards, either appointed by the Crown or elected by subscribers, and all, I understand, are in financial difficulties. the. last two years there have been citations before State industrial tribunals by unions representing hospital nursing staffs, in which claims have been made for increased pay and fewer Avorking hours, particularly a better rotation of hours, and those claims have been resisted on the ground that the granting of them would impose an undue burden upon the finances of the hospitals. I remind the 'Treasurer that the budgets of the States, which improved steadily during the last four years, are noAV shoAving signs of going the other Avay. Having regard to the general prospect before Australia, there appears to he no ground for optimism regarding the financial outlook, so that the Treasurer cannot be indifferent to the effect of this scheme upon State finances. The honourable be member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) said that hospital nurses in South Australia are at present receiving health services, the equivalent of those provided in this scheme, without any cost to the hospital in which they are employed. It is regarded as part of the remuneration due to nurses, and as compensating them, to some extent; for the inequality between their conditions and those in other industries. If the Government insists that the State in respect of each hospital employee, ancl that the employees themselves shall also contribute ls. 6d., in order to provide a medical benefit Avhich they HOAV obtain free, the proposal will not be popular. Sir FREDERICK -STEWART -Only 4d. The bill does will be collected from employees for health services. the employer, making a total of Sd. Even 8d. represents more than the value of the medical benefit that Avill be provided. It should be possible to make an adjustment to assure these employees of their pension rights Avithout imposing conditions that will threaten the stability of hospital finance. If the Treasurer will not be. moved by the effect which the scheme may have on State budgets, let him at least be influenced by the fact that so many of the hospitals, although subsidized by State governments, are administered by Within philanthropically-minded citizens, who devote a great deal of their time and energy to this Avork. If the Government imposes an intolerable burden on hospital administration, it Avill be impossible for these public-minded citizens to carry on. Private citizens cannot be expected to continue interminably the almost hopeless task of trying to administer a hospital AA'hen there is no prospect even of paying Avages and giving services. I ask the Treasurer to reconsider his attitude to the amendment moved by the honorahle member for Hindmarsh.

189,Mr Harrison (Wentavorth) [3.21].,"the same time. I appreciate tbe position of tbe Treasury. I accept the principle that national insurance should cover as many employees as possible, and it is upon that principle that I agree with the Treasurer's decision to reject the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin). If , however, the Treasurer had been prepared to accept the honourable member's amendment, I should have pressed for consideration to be given to the ambulance services. In New South Wales, the ambulance service is carried on by a group of individuals on a grant of £22,000 from the State government, supplemented by tens of thousands of pounds made up of weekly payments by persons who feel that they should insure against the possibility of having at some stage of their lives to avail themselves of the service. The ambulance service not only conveys persons to hospitals, but it also renders first-aid in street accidents and the like. I imagine"" that its financial stability will suffer as the result of the introduction of this scheme. Emphasis has been laid on the fact that experience in Great Britain has shown that panel doctors send to hospital patients whom they cannot or have not time to treat. If a similar condition obtains in Australia-and obviously it calledupon to convey to hospital a greater number of persons than hitherto. The insured employees will feel, too, that their contribution to the insurance fund should entitle them to free conveyance to hospital, and will accordingly cease their contributions to the ambulance service, whose revenue will consequently he seriously reduced. Order! The honourable member will connect his remarks with the clause. has to deal with the exemption of hospitals. Linked with hospitals is the ambulance service, which also renders first-aid. Those figures relate to the State of gentleman seeking? amendment is not wide enough because it does not cover ambulance services. The Treasurer, when he is able to extend the benefits of the scheme, should give consideration to the provision of ambulance benefits for contributors. I wish now to direct the attention of the Treasurer to what I consider to be a glaring anomaly in paragraph d of Part II . of the first, schedule. The paragraph excludes from national insuranceEmployment otherwise than by way of manual lahour(i) at a rate of remuneration exceeding in value the £305 a year. The anomaly is contained in the words "" otherwise than by manual labour"". The Treasurer cannot be aware of the large numbers of manual labourers who earn considerably more than £365 a year ancl who can afford to avail themselves of medical attention at the prevailing rates. The provision that T have cited differentiates between them and other workers to the detriment of the medical profession, on whose behalf I appeal to the Treasurer to give further consideration to the matter. It is well known that, particularly in mining districts, men are engaged throughout the year at rates exceeding £365 a year, hut in substantiation I submit to the Treasurer the following table prepared by Dr. F. W. Carter, of Western Australia will-the ambulances will be On the Golden Mile -3,00 0 men receiving an average of from 20s. to 30s. per shift. Lake View and Star -1,50 0 men receiving 23s. to 30s. per shift. Wiluna -1,10 0 men receiving an average of 30s. per shift. No one on the mines receives less than £4 13s. per week.

193,Mr Harrison,"I suggest that thewhich, complaint is made could he overcome if the Treasurer could see his way clear to amend paragraph d by omitting all the words after "" employment "" in the first line and words "" a rate of "" in the second line. Theexclusion of the word "" rate"" would obviously bring within the scheme those manual labourers whose sporadic work earns for them less than £365 per annum. readily acknowledge that some men may receive remuneration at a weekly rate exceeding. £365 a year, but, owing to the intermittency of the work would not earn more than that amount in a year. amended as suggested there would be excluded from benefit that huge number of manual labourers who work constantly for more than £365 a year. A great deal of the objection of medical practitioners that they will lose money as the result of the introduction of this scheme, would be removed if a large number of persons who can afford to pay the ruling rates for medical attention were excluded from benefiting from the cut rates which will be imposed on the profession when this scheme operates. port the amendment of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin). The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) is reluctant to accept the amendment, hut it seems to me that his view, although it may be correct of hospitals in Victoria, is not correct of hospitals in some of the other States. Hospitals in Tasmania will suffer very severe hardship if the schedule be carried in its present form. Launceston hospital, which is subsidized by tbe State,, is on all fours with other subsidized hospitals. The board controlling it is a nominee body of public-spirited citizens, who receive no remuneration in return for their services. They have very great difficulty in financing the hospital, and it frequently happens that they have to appeal to the Government to make good a financial deficiency at the end of the year. It is not a very large hospital"", it has about 400 beds. The national insurance scheme -will impose on it an additional expenditure of something like £600 a year. The increased burden will have to be borne by the State, as the hospital deficit will he increased hy that amount. There may be a small offset in the amount of money received from employees covered by the scheme, but it will be negligible-.. Extra payments from those who attend the hospital will also be very small. Launeeston hospital is typical of many other subsidized hospitals throughout Australia. It is true, as the Treasurer has said, that I many nurses after receiving their training in hospitals, pass on to other work. I remind him that the nursing staff represents only a percentage of the employees of a hospital, and that ought not to be regarded as a determining If the paragraph were factor. Some_ of the nurses remain for years, hut I agree that in the main they leave after receiving their training. There are many other permanent employees, however, who remain on hospital staffs for years, and, in the ordinary course of events will be there until they reach the retiring age. Launceston hospital employees receive free medical attention and free hospital treatment when they are sick, just as if they were covered by the provisions of the bill. For the first week or two of sickness they still receive their wages or salaries. The Treasurer has suggested that they could obtain medical attention from a panel of doctors at the hospital. That idea would not work in practice. There is a permanent staff of doctors, and they are assisted by honorary doctors. Therefore the Treasurer's reply to the arguments of the honourable member for Hindmarsh and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) breaks down. I speak from knowledge of the conditions that obtain in the Launceston hospital, and I know how the national insurance scheme will affect it. I ask the Treasurer to accept the amendment. the Government that I shall support the amendment of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin). I do so on the broad ground that the Federal Government should make a gesture to the State governments regarding the class of employees referred to. It is true that the State governments provide large sums of money for the upkeep of hospitals. If we were dealing only with governments, perhaps it would be a matter for negotiation between the Commonwealth and",37,Wages Of Miners Wooncuttees Etc I N Western Australia

195,"Mr Lane (Barton) [3.39],","I notifythe States, but associated witb tbe administration of every hospital is a band of individuals who year in and year out devote much of their time, in a voluntary capacity, to its management. In order to raise funds, entertainments of all sorts are organized by citizens who value the work of the hospitals in their districts. Frequently, the field in which they are able to raise funds is very limited. This is one direction in which the Government should give assistance. Institutions such as St. Vincent's Hospice for the Dying, the Home of Peace for the Dying in Marrickville, and the Home for Incurables .in Ryde, are entirely dependent on voluntary subscriptions for their upkeep. I am concerned, not so much about their employees as about the voluntary boards which manage their affairs on behalf of the general community and the Government of the State. The commission ought to bt empowered to waive the contribution in respect of these institutions. A large percentage of those who enter them are unable to make any payment for the treatment they receive, and those responsible for the upkeep of the institutions have to rely wholely upon the voluntary subscriptions of the residents of the district, often comparatively few in number. I should like ambulances also to be brought within .the scope of the amendment. They, too, render valuable service to people who are unable to make any payment for it.

The Government ought to hold itself responsible for the payment of their contribution, or enable the State government to do so. In regard to the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison), I cannot understand why a number of miners in Western Australia should be singled out for preferential treatment. The Government is acting severely even in demanding that the members of the medical profession shall render a cheap service to every employee, other than manual workers, receiving up to £365 a year; yet thousands of manual workers in the mining industry, who are earning more than £365, will be brought into the scheme. Why should that be done? [QvAyrwm formed.'] I hope that the Treasurer will exercise his authority iu this matter and not include manual employees who are receiving over £365a year. If he can give any valid excuse for their inclusion I shall be glad to hear it. direct attention to paragraph b ( i i i ) of Part II . , which relates to employment of a permanent nature by any corporation constituted by any act or State act. 1 have received ' telegrams from a large number of bank clerks who have no desire to be brought within the scope of the act., their contention being that they have better conditions under the bank schemes than they would receive under this scheme. If they do not wish to be included, why should they be compelled to become contributors? I should like the Treasurer to state whether it will be within the power of the commission to to which I have referred. [3.49] -.Severa l honourable members have referred to the exclusion of hospital employees. I believe that I have already said sufficient to expose the mind of the Government in regard to this matter. I do not delude myself that there will not be a certain creaking of the machine as the community adjusts itself to this scheme within the next six months. But Australian people have adjusted themselves to much more difficult reforms' in the past. I cannot see how hospitals will be confronted with any real difficulty in this respect.

The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) said that the Government has repeatedly indicated its mind on the suggestion that hospitals should be exempt, but honourable members are equally entitled to indicate their mind on the subject, particularly in view of the experience which many of them have had in hospital work. I should not press for the exemption of any class if I thought that such employees might be deprived of advantages offered under the sclieme, and, therefore, I am not suggesting that hospitals should be exempt in respect of any benefit other than medical benefit. Hospitals already extend medical benefits to their employees, and I suggest that we should avoid overlapping in thisrespect when dealing with this clause.

212,Mr Anthony,"My observationestablish a precedent if it agreed to this amendment. Publichospitals are the foundation of a national health service, and, I-suggest, one of the worse mistakes made by the Government in connection with this scheme is its failure to recognize this fact. Hospitals have a very strong case for exemption, under clause 47, in respect of medical benefit, because they should not be asked to contribute in respect of a service which they already provide for their employees. The honourable member for Parramatta suggested that doctors provide this treatment in an honorary capacity; I have no doubt that they will be just as much prepared to continue to give that service without fee as they will be to continue their honorary work in puhlic wards. There is no substance, therefore, in the statement by the Treasurer that hospitals boards can put their nurses, who are insured persons, on panels. If they did so, they would he obliged to go through a ritual which, I feel sure, no hospital would bother about. If the Government cannot see its way clear to accept this amendment, it should at least include this matter among the subjects to be referred to the royal commission for investigation. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) said that this clause will not affect hospitals to a very great extent, but those who have had actual experience in the management of hospitals say that it will very seriously affect those institutions.

The Minister in his reply stated that that landing ground was provided to enable a machine to land in cases of emergency only, and under normal weather conditions had proved very suitable. further statedFinancial considerations make it difficult to ensure that all emergency landing grounds throughout the Commonwealth shall'be of the same standard as capital city and other aerodromes in regular use as stopping places. While I agree that emergency landing grounds cannot be placed in as good condition as the regular landing grounds adjacent to the capital cities, I ask the Minister to inquire further into the circumstances of the bogging of this plane, and to see whether this ground cannot be made fit for planes to arrive and depart in all weathers. Western Junction aerodrome is, of course, the recognized landing ground for Launceston, but in a country of wide open spaces, it is highly desirable that ' landing grounds capable of accommodating modern machines in all weathers should be provided at appropriate places between terminal points. It was only after I had made repeated representations to the Government concerning the necessity for an emergency landing ground at some point close to the Tasmanian coast that something was done. Under existing conditions a certain amount of trepidation must be in the mind of passengers by air either the mainland for Tasmania or Tasmania for the mainland, and they should be assured that a suitable emergency landing ground is available if diffiAlthough the landing ground at Umbrella ment after frequent requests hy myself, it OLD-AGE PENSIONS: MINERS' is not yet in a satisfactory condition, otherwise the Douglas liner Kurana, with 24 passengers on board, would not have bogged there. It is necessary that travellers between Tasmania and the mainland should be made confident of the fitness not only of the permanent landing ing grounds that planes on which they are travelling may have to use. I ask the Minister to ascertain what cost would be involved in improving the Umbrella Flats landing ground. The necessity to take prompt action in this connection is emphasized by reason of the fact that on Wednesday last the Kurana, which left the Western Junction He aerodrome for Melbourne, could not land at Essendon owing to unfavorable weather conditions and had to be flown back to Flinders Island in the Furneaux Group. It landed at Pat's River aerodrome after having been five hours in the air. nished the honourable member with a reply to his question concerning the bogging of the Kurana. gard the Minister's reply as unsatisfactory that I am now making these representations.

At the outset of my remarks I had no intention of offending or abusing the Minister. I recognize that he is very heavily worked and has many momentous matters troubling his mind; but when he offers in extenuation of his discourtesy, the explanation that his work is not yet finished, I take it as a further discourtesy, to say the least of it. and my office is still open. gentleman is the first MinisterI ever heard whine about that sort of thing. like of the honourable member before. in the Minister's gizzard. I hope the honourable gentleman will live to see a lot more like me. The matter which I proposed to [81] discuss with the Minister was in connection with the charges which the A ir Board proposed to impose on the Ballarat Aero Club for aeroplanes that will visit Ballarat in connection with its centenary air pageant. As the proposed air pageant is to be a special feature of the Ballarat centenary celebrations, I ask the Ministeri f the charges to be imposed for gentleman has shown the use of defence aeroplanes, can be reconsidered. I have no hope, however, that my request will be acceded to. does not deserve it. Some time ago I addressed a question to the Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) regarding the membership of rifle clubs. 1 may have misconstrued his reply, but I gathered from it that it was not the Government's intention to reduce the personnel of rifle clubs in Australia. On the 14th May last, however, I received from the Secretary of the National Rifle Association of Western Australia, a letter which statesThe Defence Department has issued instructions that tlie number of active members oi rifle clubs in Western Australia must ' be reduced from the present strength of 6,500 to 5,805, which was the number at the end of June, 1937. I respectfully suggest to the Minister that the value of rifle clubs in the defence organization of Australia is very great. I know that in the minds of certain military officers expenditure on rifle clubs is not considered to be as important as expenditure in other directions. AlthoughI do not agree with that view, I have no desire t.o be drawn into a discussion of the relative values of the various arms of the services. It is undeniable that in the event of an invasion of this country men trained in the use of small arms' will form a very effective nucleus of the defence scheme. The amount provided by the Defence Department for the encouragement of rifle clubs is altogether too meagre. I plead with the Minister on behalf of these rifle clubs, particularly the Rifle Club Association in Western Australia of which I am patron. A recent rough census of rifle club members shows that 75 per cent, of them are of military age; the remaining 25 per cent.",43,Division Foreign Affairs Flats Was Made Available By The Govern

The for each efficient member. In addition to spending their own money, riflemen devote a considerable portion of their own time to training. Generally, their Saturday afternoons are spent at the butts. When I was younger, I travelled every Saturday from Ringwood, Victoria, to the North Williamstown butts in order to make myself proficient as a rifleman. I am glad to say that I passed the prescribed test. A rifleman's initial expenditure can be set down at approximately £7 for the purchase of a rifle, aperture sight, etc.; in Western Australia his minimum expenditure would be about £10 per annum. Lost time and travelling expenses would add considerably to that expenditure. I trust that when the Estimates for the ensuing financial year are under consideration the modest request which I shall submit to the Minister hy letter will be acceded to.

This matter has heen mentioned on a number of occasions by honourable members on hotb sides of the House. During the depression the whole of the amounts received hy these men in respect of their ailments was taken into consideration when determining their old-age pension. Many of Later, a change was made, and the commission was instructed to take such receipts into consideration only when some additional income was received by the applicant. Generally, some small deduction from the pension followed. The time has arrived for the f u l l pension to be paid to these men, regardless of these small receipts. At present most of them receive only 14s. or 15s. a week because of these reductions. I ask that the claims of these men be given earnest consideration. Defence) [4.36]-in reply -The honormember for Bass( Mr Barnard) referred to the landing of an aeroplane at the emergency landing ground at Umbrella Plats in extremely wet weather, and the subsequent bogging of the machine. When the tations to me, I had a careful inquiry aerodrome at Umbrella Plats is not a regular landing ground, but one for use only in an emergency. The ground is situated in an area where suitable landing places are not plentiful; I understand that the surrounding district is uneven and that difficulty would be experienced in obtaining a more suitable area for a landing ground. is subjected to flooding and a considerable amount of seepage in very wet weather. The difficulty confronting the department is that only on rare occasions does the ground become as wet as it was when the emergency landing had to be made recently. The fact remains, however, that the aeroplane landed successfully, and only subsequently became bogged. The purpose of an emergency landing ground'is to avoid disaster, and whilst it is regretted that the machine subsequently became bogged, the ground served its purpose and enabled the machine to land safely. If the Commonwealth Government were to accept the responsibility of putting every emergency landing ground in first-class order, so that, irrespective of weather conditions, aeroplanes could land without difficulty and take off again, the cost would be beyond the funds at its disposal.

I cannot promise to vary the decision that has been arrived at, because it is in conformity with the policy of the Defence Department in connection with requests of this nature. If , however, the honourable member has additional facts to show that the request made by the Ballarat Aero Club is of a special nature which would justify reconsideration of the matter, he can rest assured that his request will receive the same consideration as that of any other honourable member. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Green) referred to the reduction of membership of various rifle clubs. That reduction is the result of a decision by Parliament, in connection with last year's Estimates, to make provision for 50,000 riflemen. It is difficult, because 'of resignations and enrolments, to keep the membership of rifle clubs to a particular figure. As the total number had been exceeded, the department sent a circular to all rifle clubs informing them that their membership would have to be reduced, in conformity with the decision of Parliament. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie, as an ex-Minister for Defence, will kn'ow that if the Estimates had provided for a specific number, there would not be sufficient money for the subsidising of any excess riflemen.
