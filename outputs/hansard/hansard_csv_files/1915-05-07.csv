A. file of Bills is provided for each honourable member; but I notice that, as a rule, honourable members content themselves with the Bills that are laid upon the table, and scarcely use their files. My own opinion is that it would be better to do away with these B ill files altogether, and rely upon the Bills placed on the table. Th'is would have the advantage, at any rate, of saving considerable trouble .and cost in printing. As to the reports of the Inter-State Commission, I shall see whether some arrangement can be made for their filing. Yesterday the honourable .member for Cook asked me a question concerning the reports laid on the table by the Public Works Committee, and suggested that there were certain plans and other documents that should have been attached to the reports; but even if that -be so, we here officially know nothing about them.

The investors of the United Kingdom receive every year about £200,000,000 from investments abroad of a public or a semi-public character. terfere with them. that amount would come from Germany? Has the honourable member any idea? want to be accurate. statistics some four or five months ago, and the impression of the larger figures still remains with mc. The Minister of Home Affairs knows that the largest proportion of the export trade to the continent was with Germany. As a matter of fact, before the war, Germany, I think, was one of the best consumers, if not the best consumer, of the manufactured products of the United Kingdom. Tliese figures must give us some idea of the contractual relations which existed at tlie time of the war, and which would be affected if the Imperial Government and Germany were to adopt the policy that is embodied in this B ill . rupted, I was about to point out that, apart from this rich return from investments abroad of a public or semi-public character, and 96 per cent, of which is uninterrupted by tlie war, which shows what our Fleet is able to do, the United Kingdom has large investments of a business character abroad. really colossal, but for the moment I cannot recall them. All this trade largelv depends on contracts and agencies, as well as on our system of international clearanoss. Then again, the value of imnorts of British possessions from Germany and Austria before the war was about £108,000,000. speaking, is a beneficial trade on both sides. it has been a very beneficial trade. I wealth trade with Germany, which, roughly speaking, probably reached the volume of £15,000,000, suggested last night by the Attorney-General, is one which, on the figures alone, indicates that we reap large benefits from it or did before the' war, since the volume of. our exports to is actually greater than the volume of our imports from , Germany. difference may be explained to some extent by the fact that there is a difference in the method of estimating values and Let us take another view of the that the final adjustments of this trade are balanced up in the United Kingdom. But, in the light of all these facts, we ought not to act too hurriedly or without a f u l l sense of what w ill be the Imperial AVar, of course, does not in effect of the legislation we are asked to pass. Let us look for a moment at the W h a t proportion of particular industry that is touched by this measure, and which, as the Attorney General has said, is the mineral industry. I have an idea, but I The total volume of mineral production in I examined the 1913 was £25,810,000. The whole of this, of course, is not exported. If we take silver and lead, copper, t in and zinc, we find that the value of these products is £10,734,00.0, of which t in represents £1,402,000. The export proportion of these values is not all with belligerent countries. Our mineral exports, no matter to what countries the export may be, represent but a small proportion of our total exports, or, to put it more strongly, of our total production. All these exports are not affected by contracts. I wish that I were able to put the actual figures before the House, but it has been impossible to collate and check When interthem in the time at our disposal. Broadly speaking, I think it w ill be found that those which I have given are correct. As a matter of law and fact, I think that the real evil to which the Attorney-General directed his statements is in relation only to contracts entered into before the war, and tlie operation of which by comThe figures are mon law as well as by Statute is suspended during the war. Some local parties to these contracts may have a doubtI do not say it is more than a doubt, even if it . is a doubt, of any importance-as towhether, if tliey carried on trade, or exported without regard to these contracts,, they would find themselves in a position This trade, reciprocally of difficulty, because of those contracts, at the expiration of the war.

I think I may say that, so -far as we can assist to free the hands of local contractors in cases of this character, the Opposition will be prepared to help the Attorney-General. But I think that we can show that the Bill goes far beyond that assumed necessity. It is more than a WarB ill . It goes beyond the war, because it also in terferes for all time with these huge contracts of the metal and other companies, seeing that it does not abrogate them merely for the purpose of freeing tlie minds of the contracting parties from all doubt as to their position. ways. an effect can be shown; but what I more particularly urge is the need to be cautious in not going beyond the limits of what clearly is necessary, u n t i l our minds are allayed by any facts the Attorney-General can bring forward as showing thab .necessity. Ib is not my place to go into the question of the contracts referred to by the Attorney-General, because I do not know sufficient of them, though the fact that the companies .do not seem to have directed the attention of honourable members to their position is significant. Possibly, and very properly, they have gone to the Attorney-General direct, seeing that he was the Minister who could give them aid by legislation, but, as a general rule, where grievances are very deep-seated, honourable members hear of them directly. .1 cannot say much upon the question ot -contracts, because we cannot have the opportunity of judging whether the surmises of the Attorney-General, based oh official knowledge, are correct, though -there is evidence that many of these in Xerests are somewhat afraid of the result -of this legislation; but honourable members, such as the honourable member for Balaclava, who has a'more intimate knowledge of the matter, and who has a better opportunity of acquiring it than I have, will throw light upon it during the course of the debate. Nevertheless, I may be excused from showing what, apart from the Bill before us, is the position of these -contracts. The question of enemy contracts is already part of the law relating to trading with the enemy, a contract being merely one instrumentality of trading; and the law books generally deal with enemy contracts under the heading of Enemy Trading. We have already legislated upon the s.ubject of enemy trading. Our Trading with the Enemy Acts provide that imprisonment for seven years may follow conviction on an indictment for trading with the enemy, which is a very effective deterrent to such trading. Trading with the enemy has an exceedingly wide scope. It may include acts so innocuous, as a inatter of fact, that one authority has described the legislation, owing to the penalties that may be imposed, as being to a large extent vindictive, which was never intended to be the case. I do not belieVe that there are in the law books trading with the enemy before this war broke out. In fact, I do not know that there are more than two cases. Certainly there have been very few, if any, cases of trading with the enemy of the class defined by our proclamations and Acts, because it was often found' very beneficial by both nations at war to wink at what was going on, and licences to trade with the enemy were freely granted during the Crimean War and the Napoleonic wars-. We already have proclamations supported by our Trading with the Enemy Acts which cover a very wide sphere. I do not intend to go through the matters dealt with, in those proclamations, because honourable members can see them for themselves, but I wish to refer to a proclamation published in the Gazette on the 12th September, 1914, and covering part of the field embraced by the measure before us, seeing that ib declares that it is against the proclamation "" to enter into any commercial, financial, or other contract or obligation with or for the benefit of an enemy."" As I have said, part of the .Bill before us is covered by an existing proclamation. There is also power given under the Trading witli the Enemy Acts to the Executive, by Order in Council, to prohibit trade of any other class than that dealt with in the paragraph which I have just cited, although that trading might be otherwise lawful. Therefore, very wide powers are capable of being exercised under our Trading with the Enemy Acts and proclamations. Let me now deal with the definitions clause. I refer to this matter in order to show the need for caution in drafting. In our definition of "" enemy subject"" we have defined an enemy",12,Kndeav0us Practicall Y Commanded B Y The UN I T E D

The question was: Can a company or corporation, registered in this country, but whose shareholders and directors are chiefly alien enemies resident in the enemy country, sue in these courts to enforce payment of their debts or to enforce other rights, in thc same manner as ordinary British subjects can 7 The answer, in effect, wasThis is a difficult question, nnd thc Court -were not unanimous. The majority decided that as a company or corporation has a legal -existence apart from its shareholders or corporators, if it carries on business from a registered address here and is nominally British, it is not an alien enemy. Once a corporation has been created in accordance with the requirements of British law, it is British. It was contended that to pay debts to such a cornpuny, if it consisted chiefly of alien enemy shareholders, would be to pay money for the benefit of an enemy, because the shareholders -'-ould make use of the credit thus obtained. The Court decided that this was too farfetched an argument, and as the proclamations -and Acts forbidding trade with the enemy did not recognise such a company as an enemy, it -must be considered according to common law u British company. Lord Justice Buckley dissented, being of opinion that such a company was so impressed with the alien enemy's stamp that the Court ought to look behind the abstract legal person of the oompany to see who composed it, and that the test was not, "" What is the company?"" but "" Of whom does it consist?""

Consequently, there is, as a rule, no objection to British firms trading with German or Austrian firms established in neutral or Britisb territory. ApOf course t h a t is subject to t be q u a l if i cation t b a t ib must not be a b l in d to c o m m u n i c a t i o n w it h the enemy. given by the dissentient J u d g e , What is prohibited is trade with any -firms According to a established in hostile territory. If a firm with head-quarters in hostile territory has a branch in neutral or Britisb territory, trade with tbe branch is (apart from prohibitions in special cases) permissible, as lone; as the tra.de is bona tide with the branch, and no transaction with the head office is involved. Commercial contracts entered into before war broke out with firms established in hostile territory cannot bo performed during the war, and payments under them ought not to be made to such firms during the war. Where, however, nothing remains to be done save to pay for goods already delivered or for services already rendered, tbere is no objection to making the payments. Whether contracts entered into before the war are suspended or terminated is a question of law which may depend on circumstances, and in cases of doubt British firms must consult their own legal advisers. p o in t t h a t there is a g r e at state of u n c e r t a in t y.

The general rule of English law is that all -contracts entered into during a war between British citizens and the citizens of a State. which is nt war with Great Britain are illegal und can never be enforced. 'Therefore the provisions of the B ill on that point are really unnecessary. were entered into prior to the war. part of the B ill separately, and these -.statements cover all parts of the B ill , and may be useful for referenceThe rules apply to all contracts and not only those in tbe nature of a trading venture. Contracts made in furtherance of illegal trading, even though not made directly between the citizens of two belligerent States, are illegal and void. The rules that contracts made with belligerents are illegal and void applies to contracts made by citizens of allied States. 'These rules, of course, do not apply where licences to trade have been grantedContracts entered into by the citizens of one belligerent State with citizens of another belligerent State before the outbreak of hostilities between their respective States are not made illegal by the outbreak of war, but rights arising under them, and the right of suit to enforce these rights, are suspended until the war is over. 'On that point the case of Janson v. The Driefontein Consolidated Mining Company Limited, in which the question of -contracts entered into during the war period was introduced, may be referred -to. The report statesThe remedy is indeed suspended. An olien -enemy cannot sue in the courts of either country while the war lasts, but the rights on the -contract are unaffected, and when the war is -over the remedy in the courts of either is restored. The exceptions are where the contracts -come to an enemy's aid and involve dealrings with him and contracts that, from .their character, are incapable of suspension. Such, for instance, as a partner--ship, which would involve continued -dealings. These would generally violate -the common law as well as the Statute. -I would like to give one more quotat i o n from Professor Morgan on this quest i o n of pre-war contracts, because it suggests what I have mentioned-that it is probable that there is nothing to prevent the parties to these contracts here hav-ing outside dealings or disregarding any -provisions that might prevent them, duriing the war period, from selling or exporting to companies or persons other than the parties to the contract. In other words, tlie provisions with regard to exclusive dealings will be regarded as nugatory during the war. I think, of course, we must help to remove any doubts there may be in the law, and the reason I say that I believe that these contracts are no longer binding during the war, and that no action can be taken in respect to them after the war, is tliat to impose limits on production here would be against the principle on which trading with the enemy is prevented. It would be really strengthening the enemy by weakening ourselves, and no contract that would weaken our position could be binding for the same reason that trading with the enemy is prohibited. In his book, War; its Conduct and Legal Results, Professor Morgan statesIf a contract has been made prior to the outbreak of war the hostile alien is none the less an alien and unable to sue. The remedy is therefore suspended in principal until he can do so. If a contract has been completely performed, or if a quantum meruit is due upon it, there is no difficulty about this except for a doubt as to whether the Statute of Limitations runs against the hostile creditor. But in other cases where there still remains something more complicated than payment to be done under the contract, it would be going too fnr to assert broadly that all further extension is suspended. All performance wbich involves ' intercourse with enemy territory certainly is so, and since it would usually be unfair to postpone performance indefinitely, such contracts are necessarily cancelled. But there seems to be no reason to suppose that in other cases the outbreak of war of itself interposes c an absolute release. In the great majority it does, but for a further reason. In that majority of cases, performance is not only suspended, but the contract is again cancelled. These cases include(1) those in which the continued existence of the contract is against public policy, e.g., the insurance of enemy ships; and (2) those in which performance cannot be suspended without unfairness or inconsistency with the terms of the contract express or implied (including practically all trading contracts). As a matter of fact, there are very few contracts of an executory character released, which would not be affected so f a r as covenants such as those with the Metal Company are concerned, by the actual breaking out of war. So much then for the authorities.

Equity then dictates that it be dissolved by the outbreak of war. Dealing now with the B ill itself, I think I have endeavoured to show that it goes beyond what is necessary, because, in the first, place, the common law now covers many of the matters dealt with in its clauses; and, in the second.place, because its definitions are so wide that, in many cases, it must h it Imperial trading in terests as well as our own local trading interests very severely. L e t us look, for instance, at clause 3. Herei t is declared that an enemy contract means any . contract to whicli an enemy subject is a party. It does not imply that the only contracting party on one side must be an enemy subject. It may refer to one of perhaps a dozen parties on one side who is an enemy subject, and according to this clause that would be sufficient to in validate the whole contract. That seems to be the clear effect of this particular clause. I emphasize that it does not mean -necessarily that .a contract should be between two persons, one of whom is an enemy person. It means that if a most diluted interest exists either by thc fact' that an enemy subject is n party by signature, or by having an interest in the -contract, the contract is annulled. number of German shareholders in a company, is it the intention of the House that this B ill should invalidate any contract .made by that company? Several Nol pertinent one in its relation to companies, and I am.inclined to think that the honourable member for Parkes is quite right. Clause3 of the B ill declares that an enemy contract means any contract Avhich an enemy subject is a party to, or in which an enemy subject has an interest. That, apparently, may include a company in which an enemy subject has an interest, as referred to by the honourable member for Parkes. merely necessary to be a party, or one of several parties on one side. The mere fact that a person has any interest at all, in thc opinion of tlie Attorney-Generalbecausehe has to decide a point to which I w ill refer laler on-make s the contract an enemy contract. Clause3 also provides that an enemy contract may mean "" any contract which is, or is likely to be, for the benefit of enemy subjects or of enemy trade."" It is clear, then, that the matter may require very close investigation. I w ill now deal w i th the administration of the Act. TheB ill provides, in effect, that an application may be made to the Attorney-Generalf o r a declaration that a contract is or is not an enemy contract within, the meaning of the section, and under the B ill it is for the Attorney General himself to decide.

Prosecutions under that Act have to be sanctioned by the certificate of the Attorney-General.' But here the whole matter, without appeal, rests stance, tlie Snow case.

I w ill uow refer to the sub-clauses themselves. These declare, as the common law at present provides, that contracts made during the war are void. ing tlie war are invalid and void, but the Bill declares that every enemy contract made before the commencement of the war is to be and to have been null and void as from the commencement of the war, as regards rights and obligations under it , except in relation to goods which have been already delivered, or acts whicli have been already performed. Why should we depart from the existing law and the existing practice and policy of the United Kingdom, which is far more concerned than we are? Could we not pass a provision covering such cases as it may be necessary to cover to remove doubt? Why should we declare contracts covering all the contractual relations affecting our external trade, and entered into before the war, to be actually void if in the opinion of the Attorney-General they are enemy contracts? That is going too far. Clause4 is not directed expressly against enemy contracts, although it may include them; it deals with any contract. Either party to a contract to which it applies may by notice in writing to the other party terminate the contract as regards all rights and obligations relating to any future supply or delivery under the contract. The clause declares that a contract to which ib applies is a contract for the sale and delivery of goods, the performance of which is by operation of law or by the terms of the contract suspended during or on account of the present war. declared in sub-clause 5 of clause 3 that all such contracts are void as from the commencement of tlie war. clause 4 seems to be nugatory. tain the words "" to . which the preceding section applies "" ? has anticipated me. I was going to suggest that the clause should be made auxiliary to clause 3. There may be something to be said for it , and I am not going to suggest amendments, but I think that the Bill should be drafted to deal only with contracts in regard to which people are in doubt as to whnt their position will be after the war is over. This Parliament has not power I think it should be; to pass a measure which will cover the whole field. The greater part of the field is probably within the jurisdiction of the States, and the Attorney-General has told us that he is asking the States to Contracts made durpass legislation to help us in the matter. All contracts are not of Federal concern. A doubt has been thrown on some of the provisions of our Patent Acts, which give power to suspend or abrogate contracts, as not being matters of patent law. Certain contracts are within our jurisdict i o n : contracts relating to defence or to our specific powers, and a great many contracts relating to foreign, or, subject to section 92' of the Constitution, to Inter-State trade. But in this in stance it is desired to cover a field of jurisdiction of which a great part is under the control of the States, and with which we therefore can deal only in concert with the States. I think that the Bil l should be confined to enemy contracts made before the war, the suspension of which affects production or export, that is, undulv ties the hands of contractors here who may be in doubt as to their position. The provisions of clause 2 and sub-clause 1 of clause 3 go far bevond what is necessary, and should be redrafted. An application might be made to a Judge or to a Judgei n chambers. The question arises whether we should not give to the agents of parties who are affected by the contracts the righb to appear and to put their case. It has been decided by the British Courts that when the interest of an enemy subject is affected by an action, he has a right to defend it , a right to be heard. It is open to question that we should We have already allow enemy contracts covering very wide areas to be annulled by the Court or by the Attorney-General without giving the Therefore, parties other than the applicants the right to be heard; but the effect of the definition of such contracts as enemy contracts would be their annulment.

Why have the Allies to depend on Canada and the United States for the supply of ammunition ? Because the banks of the British Empire have lent money, and organizing trusts have spent it in erecting ammunition factories in Germany. Time after time. I have told the House that Australian gold was being used to build German Dreadnoughts, but I have been laughed at.

The very question that we are discussing was raised in Novemberi n the House of Commons by a motion moved by Mr Morton for«a new clause in these termsI am quoting from Hansard, 25th November, . 1914, column 1232Determination of Contracts -Any contract which has been entered into by any British enemy may be determined or suspended by a written order by a Secretary of State or the Board of Trade, which order a Secretary of State or the Board of Trade are hereby empowered to make, so far as any act, thing, or obligation remains to be done or performed under such contract, and any contract for the supply of goods imported from any State for the time being at war with His Majesty, or for goods which are manufactured or partly manufactured in any such State, may also be determined or suspended in like manner : Provided that such determination or suspension under this section shall not determine or suspend any act or thing which has been performed or done under such contract prior to the passing of this Act. Mr Morton explained that they wanted to get r i d of the difficulty in dealing with running contracts made over a series of years, and in his speech saidAccording to my information, which is only second-hand, they have passed the necessary Proclamation or Act, the equivalent to which 1 have embodied in a clause I lower on the Paper, giving to every German subject the If we are to in option or saying whether such contract should be cancelled or postponed until after the war without prejudice to the British subject's right to recover damages for non-fulfrlnient or delay. Thus, although there is a r i g ht in GerB i g as it is, I think we many to determine the contract, there seems to be some sort'of remedy l e f t to the contracting party. That amendment, which is in terms similar to one of the provisions of this B ill , was opposed by the Attorney-Generali n the House' of Commons and withdrawn. That Minister, as reported in column 1238, saidI confess for my part I should conceive there was a rooted objection to enacting that settled I am contracts made between, two parties should, in case of the outbreak of war, be voidable at the option of one of the parties. That would be reducing the commercial law of this country to the level of the most disreputable republic in South America.

A contract to which an enemy subject is a party is null and void, but the other party may say that he is not an enemy subject. TheB ill should provide some method by whicn tliat man may be served with notice, and have an opportunity to appear before the Attorney-General, and argue his status before the Attorney-General makes a declaration. where that class of person is a British subject he is such for convenience, or for better effecting the German purpose. He takes on British nationality as a cloak. such a person. A man who takes on the British nationality as a cloak for such a purpose should be exposed; but at the same time. I thinlc that the clause should provide that such a man should not be condemned unheard. A t least his contract should not be condemned without his being heard on the point as to whether he is an enemy subject or"" not. view be set out, so far as the contract is concerned, in the terms of the contract? the terms are, namely, .that "" in consideration of the payment of so-andso I agree to sell you so-and-so."" But the B ill before us declares contracts void, not on their terms, but on the question of the nationality of the parties to them, and I claim that where a contract is to be declared void on the ground tliat a party to it is an enemy subject, thelatter should be served w it l i notice, and have the opportunity of being heard before the declaration is made. I ask the Attorney-General to keep this matter in view in the Committee stage. Let us see what are those contracts which may be avoided. One is a contract to which enemy subjects were a party. It might be a most innocent contract, for while an enemy subject is living in Australia another person may make contracts with him. There would be nothing illegal in doing that. Por instance, a landlordcould make a contract with a tenant for a house; a grocer could agreeto supply provisions to an enemy subject resident in Australia. The terms are In a very large number exceedingly wide; but, possibly, domicile would be the test of "" enemy subject."" No matter how small might be theinterest in a contract, if it is likely to benefit an enemy subject, it is to be absolutely annulled. I think theAttorney-General might look into this matter more olosely. If it turns out that there is a substantial contract between an Australian company and a German company, the suspension of which would lead to serious effects upon our industries and our production, there would be justification for what the Attorney-General is contending; but I think the clause ought In nine cases out of ten to be more closely looked into, and theB ill confined to the substantial injurieswhich are being alleged. Clause4 will undoubtedly want amending to show its relation to the preceding parts of the B ill . It seems to me, on the face of it , almost to merit the sweeping condemnation of the English Attorney-General. It states: (1) Either party to a contract to which this section applies may, by notice in writing to the other party, terminate the contract asregards all rights and obligations relating to any future supply or delivery under the contract. W ill not his point of (2) A contract to which this section appliesis any contract for the sale or delivery of goods the performance of which(a) is by operation of law or by the terms of contract suspended, or (b) is or may be by net of a party suspended, or (c) is claimed by the party against whom the notice is given to be suspended, during or on account of the present war. tracts suspended by the war If they are not suspended by the war, and to that-",25,Honorabl E Members No With The Attorney General Take For In

On the other hand, a contract for the sale of goods, e.g., milk, to be delivered in reasonable consignments, say over a period of three years at seller's option, will be void in the event of war during the period only to the extent of the consignments, the delivery of which might reasonably'be expected during the war and suspended as to the other consignments at any rate., for the time being and until it was manifest that reasonable performance of the contract could only be made during the war.

We have heard a number of speeches from the members of the legal profession in regard to this Bill, and I think the Attorney-General is to be congratulated upon the speech he made last night. As a nonlegal member of this House, I was deeply impressed with the position he put before us. I think, in fact, that all members who have had this matter under consideration more or less ever since the -outbreak of the war must have realized that some of our industries are now in a very parlous condition, owing to the fact that Germany has for a number of years been largely dealing with our products, -which we have exported to her in their raw form. I have a great deal of sympathy with what the Bill proposes to do, but I would have been better satisfied to vote for this measure in exactly the form in which the Attorney-General has brought it down, if he had been in a position to give us the definite assurance that this legislation would meet with the full approval of the Imperial authorities. The Attorney-General last night did say that he had sent the text of the measure to EnglandI imagine the actual text went quite recently-that he had had considerable correspondence with the Home authorities, and that they knew exactly what we intended to do. But what the Attorney General did not tell us was what their opinion was upon what we intended to do. I think, at a time like this, the House should be entitled to receive from the Attorney-General, without any qualification, the actual opinion which the I m perial authorities have expressed in regard to this legislation, because everybody must admit at once that the contracts wo are now dealing with do not affect us only. They^have essentially an Imperial aspect, and this legislation may be much move far-reaching in its effect than any honourable member has any idea of. The great trouble which I find in regard to the whole of this legislation is that it is general legislation intended to deal with particular cases. It would have been infinitely better if, instead of bringing down a Bil l in general terms like this, the Attorney-General had satisfied himself as to the necessity for the cancellation of the contracts which, no doubt, all honourable members have in their minds, and if he had then introduced a Bill to deal with these contracts in particular. We would then have known exactly where we are, but we are now legislating in a general way about a great many things of which we have no knowledge whatever. We do not know what classes of contract-othe r than those which are in the mind of the Attorney-General, as shown by the specific instances he gave in his speech last night-thi s particular legislation may affect. My point is this: We are dealing with very extraordinary circumstances. We are bringing in what everybody will admit ,is very _ extraordinary legislation.

197,Mr Greene (Richmond) [2.50],"-charged with being a nation absolutely devoid of all moral sense of honour. We .are now introducing general legislation to apply to all contracts, whatever their nature, existing between ourselves and -enemy subjects. ""We all recognise the seriousness of the position from the Australian stand-point. We all recognise that it would be infinitely better if we -could set the wheels of industry going once more at BrokenH ill to the same extent that they were before. We all recognise that if it were possible .to cancel these contracts, and set up a new industry in Australia to deal with the raw material from Broken Hill, it would be to the national -advantage. But, nevertheless, even with these particular contracts in mind, I think it wonld have been advisable if the Attorney-General had come down to the House with legislation dealing exclusively with them, so that we couldhave argued them on their merits, rather than that he ""should havo brought down this general legislation, which, as I say, may .apply to contracts of every description. I was very much interested, in looking into the discussion which arose in the House of Commons, and to which the honourable member for Darling Downs has already referred, to observe that a -case which is almost on all-fours with those with which we desire to deal was mentioned by Mr Hume Williams. It will be found on page 1236 of the English Hansard that this honourable gentleman saidTlio kind of case tliat is in my mind, and many matters other than those which which makes it so essential that we shall deal honourable members generally have' in with this proposition now if we can, is a case their minds in considering this kind of brought before me the other day of a very legislation. large firm in England producing goods whichrequire to be finished.

They are prepared to carry out the treatment in England, and to spend very large House might go as far as that. The sums in England upon the erection of the Attorney-General proposes to cancel conplant required. We have an almost identical condition of which have been suspended by the war. affairs in connection with the operations Is the honourable gentleman fully satisfied of the BrokenH ill Company, who have that, if that is done, all the parties to a been asking the Imperial authorities for contract which has been suspended by the permission tb raise the necessary capital war will be willing that the contract to treat in Australia the raw product should be cancelled? which they derive from their mines. Mr Williams went on to sayThereby they w ill give a great deal of employment to English people, both in the erection of the factory and the ultimate treatment of the product. Very rightly, however, they want -to be told that if they do that-that if they treat the contract as broken, and make these extensive arrangements to deal with their product themselves in future-the y w ill be doing the right thing. All I suggest to the House is that any contract for the future supply of goods to enemies that was in existence on the 4th August, or which may be entered into during the currency of the war, is hereby declared to be null and void. That is what we propose to do by this Bill. Mr Williams went on to say that he could not possibly give his adherence to the proposal made by Mr Robertson, who desired to incorporate in the Trading with the Enemy Bill practically the very legislation which the Attorney General now asks us to adopt. The honourable gentleman claims that there is some legal difference, at all events, between the proposal submitted by Mr Robertson in the House of Commons and the legislation which he is submitting here. No doubt this legislation goes a v e r y great deal further than what Mr Robertson proposed. The Attorney General proposes something more than the cancellation of all contracts which exist between Australians and enemy subjects. As I understand the matter, the word "" contract"" has in law a very wide meaning, and possibly covers a great I see that the Attorney General, of England, in discussing this subject, pointed out that the legislation bably apply, amongst other things, to a For aught I tracts existing between British subjects at all. There are, I regret to say, some British subjects who are more concerned about maintaining their trade with Germany than they are about upholding the interests of the Empire. was endeavouring to put to the honourable gentleman. Under clause 4, certain contracts will have been suspended' during the war. I do not know what these con-' tracts may be. They may include contracts, for instance, for the supply of meat during the war. may be between British subjects. One of the parties to one of these contracts may ask for the cancellation of the contract because it would be to his interest to have it cancelled, though it might, at the same time, be a most inequitable thing to do. The Attorney-General has introduced a Bill to deal with specific cases that he has in mind, and most honourable members are in accord with him up to a certain point in their desire that the wheels of our great mining industries shall continue to go round. We do not know whether. this proposal will accomplish that purpose; but I do suggest that it would be unwise to pass general legislation in this way when the object is to deal with specific cases. This might lead to the cancellation .of many contracts simply because it might suit some of the parties to such contracts to have them cancelled. Our people have entered into many contracts for the supply of all sorts of perishable products from Australia, such as meat, butter, and other things. member suggest that we should deliberately foster and keep alive those contracts the war ceases, if there is not legislation with Germany after the war? now about contracts with Germany. I thought I had made that sufficiently plain to the honourable gentleman. I am talking of contracts between British subjects, and from the highest moral stand-point there may be every reason why such contracts should be kept alive. Scores of contracts have been made between citizens of Australia and citizens of British Possessions in other parts of the world, and those contracts have been suspended owing to the war. The Attorney-General has introduced legislation which will leave it optional with one of the parties to such a contract, because it has beer* suspended by the war, to come along and claim the protection of this legislation,, and say that he will have nothing further to do with the contract. member think that the Germans w ill plead for this protection? about Germans, but about British subjects.

In the absence of any information in this regard, I should be prepared to vote against the motion for the second' reading, because, as members of this House, we are entitled to know the nature of any reply that may have been received from the British Government.

Clause4 seems to me so wide as to possibly affect a contract between Australians. It might happen that some one in Queensland had a contract with a person in Western Australia to supply and deliver goods, and, in case of a suspension in consequence of the war, a notice might be served that it was at an end. W h i l e I desire that I am quite sure that any such results are not in the mind of the Government, though, as I say, the clause seems to be wide enough to permit of them. Cannot we in some way induce the Attorney General to safeguard this clause? According to the first part of the B ill , the Attorney-General is constituted a sort of judge as to whether contracts are enemy contracts or otherwise, but there is no such safeguard in clause 4. as safe as you like when we get to it . for the Attorney-General to urge us to hurry up with the B ill , but I remind him that we have not had any time to consult authorities. gentlemen these combinations should be tightened up, and honourable members opposite do not wish to tighten them up. the B ill or urging its delay in the in terests of any particular persons, but I think we ought to have some assurance on the point.

Of course this is a B ill that can be discussed just as freely in Committee, practically, as on the second reading; but I am not anxious to occupy the time of honourable members further when we reach that stage.
