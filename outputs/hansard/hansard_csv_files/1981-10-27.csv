We can see how flexible it is when it is the fee, and the restructuring of the scale, licensees with low confronted by a very powerful interest pushing a growth earnings will pay less than under the existing schedule. particular point of view on the Government. The Government was well and truly leant on in reWhen the original Bills were before this House the lation to this legislation. As a result it decided to Opposition did not oppose them. The reasons we change this piece of legislation which is an integral gave for not opposing those proposals were that revenue-raising part of the 1981-82 Budget. we thought that the proposals were an improvement on the existing means by which fees were It is important and instructive to compare the collected from broadcasting and television flexibility which the Government has demonstations; that is, there was a greater amount of strated on this occasion with its intransigence in equity applying in the revised scales. Under the relation to the sales tax proposal. When the proposals the licence holders with the smallest Government is faced with taxes which affect revenues were going to pay less than they did books, newspapers, shoes for children, sweets for under the existing legislation and those with the children, building materials in respect of people largest revenue were going to pay more than they attempting to buy their first homes, pet foods and did under existing legislation. The Opposition safety belts and safety equipment, we find that it sticks rigidly to its prinCiple that once a measure is into a higher bracket the percentage of earnings determined to be part of the Budget then the which will be collected as fees will increase also. Government will not resile from the ambition of The point is that with the imposition of a ceiling getting that legislation through the Parliament. with respect to the largest of the licence holders Therefore, the Government has demonstrated that licence holder will be insulated from one of where its priorities really lie. It is not going to back the effects which would lead to an increase in the down in relation to the hardship which it has fee to which that licence holder would otherwise caused to kids, to families, to a variety of people be subject. Whilst the earnings of that licence throughout the community in relation to the new holder may increase, and therefore the amount of sales taxes and the increased sales taxes which the fee would increase, the percentage of his total were part of the Budget. But when it comes to revenue which that represents would not increase doing favours for powerful friends the capacity of whereas all the other licence holders, until they this Government for flexibility is unbounded. reach this ceiling, would be subject to more rapidly escalating increases in their fees. To that The second point that has to be made is that on extent this is clearly unfair. One licence holder in the calculations which we have been-able to make this case will be insulated from one of the factors these measures will involve some cost to revenue. which lead to an increase in the fee whereas all The Minister said on 21 October in his second sec_ other licence holders, some of which are competiond reading speech on this legislation that this tors with the largest licence holder, will be subject would not involve any cost to revenue this year. to the effects of both factors in the determination Our calculations suggest that there will be a small of the fee which they will be charged. Of course, cost to revenue this year. I do not want to make as the stations which are just below the level of much of it, but it appears that the cost to revenue the largest stations approach the level of revenue as a result of this change will be about $100,000 a of the larger stations and -reach the ceiling, of year. That is, probably only one licence holder, course they too will be insulated in the same way perhaps two, will not pay as much under this as is the largest earning licence holder at the change this year as they would have paid had the moment. original legislation introduced on Budget night proceeded on its course through the Parliament. The position for television stations is that at a In any case that is not the most important point, level of a bit less than $50m in gross revenue the the most important point is that there is absol7.5 per cent ceiling begins to cut in. But all those utely no question that there will be a substantial stations which are in receipt of just below that cost to revenue over the next couple of years. By amount of gross revenue, or even substantially 1983-84 the cost to revenue as a result of this below, will see the fees that they pay escalate at a superficially trivial change will be about $3m. far higher rate than the escalation which will be That is the revenue which will be forgone as a reexperienced by those stations which in future sult of this apparently small change. I will press years reach the ceiling and therefore have the rate the Minister in other ways to find out exactly of increase of their fee slowed down as a result of what the cost to revenue is for this year and to disthe imposition of the ceiling. That means that the cover whether the Minister was being absolutely smaller stations which are competing with the candid when he said on 21 October that there larger station or stations in the future will have to would not be a cost to revenue as a result of this take into account the increasing burden of those change. fees and therefore will be placed in a disadvantageous position as far as the largest licence holder The third point that has to be made about the is concerned. At present the benefit of this legischange is that it will not be felt equally throughlation will go only to the largest licence holder, out the industry. The fee that licence holders pay that being Channel 9. In the future, as the revenue is determined by two factors. One is the actual of the other licence holders increases, they will level of earnings and the second is the percentage also receive the benefit. That is why in the year which applies to each particular level of earnings. 1983-84 the cost to revenue or, to put it another As indicated in the explanatory memorandum way, the benefit to those largest licence holders from which I quoted, the fee can increase both will be in the order of $3m. with an increase in earnings-that increase may I shall mention one other thing. We note, agreebe illusory to the extent that it might just be a ably, that the Minister has said that in 1984 there money increase and not a real increase in will be a review of this question to see whether the earnings-and as the licence holder shifts from proposals in this legislation are appropriate for one bracket to another in terms of the percentage the circumstances at the time. That is a sensible which will be paid in fees. That is, with each shift provision because in view of recent history and, indeed, the predictions for the future, the revenue of the House tonight by going over some of the arof these licence holders, particularly in the teleguments that were canvassed previously, but after vision industry, is likely to increase quite rapidly. listening to the honourable member for Therefore it is important that by 1984 there Fremantle ( Mr Dawkins) tonight one would should be a review to see whether the mechanisms almost think that it was the greatest give-away in which are being legislated for here are still history.
