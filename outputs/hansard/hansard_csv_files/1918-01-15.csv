Debate resumed from l l t h January (vide page 2953), on motion by Mr. That the House protests against(a) The repudiation of the pledges oi the Prime Minister and other Ministers; (6) the political persecution of public men and other citizens and the press under the War Precautions Regulations during the recent Referendum campaign; (c) the deprivation of statutory electoral 1 rights of Australian-born citizens by regulation behind the back of Parliament ; (d) the general administration of public affairs; and wishes to inform His Excellency the Governor General that the Government does not possess the confidence of the people of Australia. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [3.3] -The sneering of the Leader of the Government at the Leader of the Labour party exhibited in the opening remarks of the Prime Minister might well come under the parliamentary rule against tedious repetition. Notwithstanding that the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) is the soul of generosity in, his references to' the Prime Minister, fhe latter rarely rises to reply to h i m without indulging in sneering and insulting remarks. ' It was characteristic of the Prime Minister that he should denounce both Democracy and the referendum because the result of the referendum was not acceptable to him, and the Democracy of tliis country does not agree with him. Let me read a passage which I think appropriate to the present occasionThere is surely some moral obliquity about a nature such as his. No act that he commits, no party that he betrays, no cause that he abandon's affects him at all. He regards himself as the selected and favoured agent of Providence. Everything that he does ne does for the very best! He does it because there is nothing else that can be done to conserve the 1918.",20,Setup

In standing by GreatB r it a in in that enterprise Australia did not act with any one section of the people, but w it h a l l classes and creeds, including the great Labour movement. Whilei t has suited the opponents of Labour to pretend that they seek to abolish party lines, for party purposes they have set out to prejudice the great Australian Labour movement by f o u l libels onits aims and objects in connection w it h the war. I repeat that Labour to-day stands where it did at the beginning of the war1. For the maintenance of the public law of nations. 2. For the honouring of publicly-made treaties. 3. For the liberty and independence of small nations. I set out Australian war aims in this way1. To help GreatB r it a in in maintaining fhe publicly-declared objects for which she entered the war to the best of our ability, consistently w it h Australia's paramount and essential needs. 2. To bring about an enduring world peace on terms of equity and justice to all mankind. Let us for a moment review what Labour has done in Australia during this war. Government we had peace, harmony, and unity in this country. efforts put for t h to assist GreatB r it a in . 150,000 men. We have .enlisted to the first Anything of material consequence that has been done in connection w i th Australia's part in the war has been done under a Labour Administration. I ask honourable members opposite to point to one thing of any consequence that has been done by them since they have taken the place of the Labour Government. They cannot do so. They are as dumb as oysters. nothing of any consequence. MrJ . H . OATTS-Australi a is not singular in that respect. been strikes in every country at war-in a w|#ge into his own Cabinet and split France, B r it a in , Italy, and America, it in twain? and in Germany as well. The only strike process into the party he was leading and of any consequence in Australia during the war was that provoked by a despotism that plotted and planned the smashing of organized labour. We had peace, harmony, concord, and unity In Australia unti l W . M . Hughes assumed control. Before he went to London, liis control in Australia was but nominal. It . was upon his return from Great Britain that the apple of discord was thrown into this country, and ever since then the -war efforts of Australia have been paralyzed. There has been some talk of German propaganda. If the Germans had desired to propagate dissension in any country they could not have done better than by employing W . M . Hughes to do it in Australia. He has done their work better than they could have done it themselves. An y German attempt from outside to in terfere in Australia would, have solidified the country, but this man has gone about creating dissension, discord,''and disruption everywhere. In order to show what had been done unti l he came back from Great Britain, let me quote a few words of a speecli which he delivered in London before the Pilgrims' Club on the 17th March, 1916. He saidAlthough we are a peace-loving people, although we have slumbered in a lotus land for many years, we have shown to the world that we have not lost the valour of our forefathers. . . . At the first rattling of the sabre turmoil died down, dissensions ceased, we were a united people. I have come here, after some eighteen months of war, as the representative of a Dominion. When there was a Labour They have all proved themselves worthy of the breeding. Australia has sent We had great out of the country, to the European or Asiatic battlefields, up to the first week in March, week in March, 268,000 men. We shall have enlisted by the beginning of June 300,000 men. A small community of under 5,000,000 people, we have been able to train, to equip from head to foot, a great army of men. It is_ a great thing, and one which we may mention with pride and satisfaction. That was the condition of tilings up to the time W . M . Hughes came back from Great Britain. Australia had enlisted They have done absolutely 300,000 men, and very little has been done since because of the dissension he bas Y o u had a few caused. He shifted the storm centre of Prussianism from Europe to Australia: What was the first thing that he did There have when he met his colleagues but to drive And he followed the same",21,Tudor
3,Mr Mcwilliams,"divided it into two antagonistic sections. He divided the great Australian Labour movement which gave h i m the opportunity to become what he is in this count r y and in the Empire to-day, and then he proceeded upon, and prosecuted, a campaign outside which, for the first time in the war, created a gulf of dissension as wide as that between heaven and hell amongst the people of Australia. Just let me refer for a few minutes to that 1916 conscription campaign. said, "" We w ill have this referendum campaign and come back afterwards as friends."" What was his attitude towards the members of his own party during that campaign ? Was there any libel, any foul abuse, any epithet, any insult that he could hurl at them that he did not assail them with from every platform ? In the pay of Germany! Germany's mouth in their ears! Germany's hand in' their palms! German gold being distributed! that the vocabulary could produce that he. did not charge against the members of his own party who happened to disagree w it l i him. He abused the censorship in the most shockingly partisan fashion. There has been no interference with the .press of Russia to outdo his manipulation of the newspapers of this country. He sought to ^pollute the ballot-box After certain Ministers had refused him authority to pass regulations which would permit of military interference at the ballot-boxes, he got a couple of other Ministers together and had those passed, upon which three of his colleagues resigned. press of the country was not to let the people know of the resignation of those Ministers; not been Acting Minister for Defence at the time, and had not threatened to order a military guard to lock up the censors if they interfered, have reached the people through the press, and tliere would have been military intimidation at the polling booths. As late as the night before the poll, in the vicinity of 5,000 urgent telegrams were sent out to the electoral officers throughout to withdraw those infamous because, this coward was' not enough to stand up to them when his trickery Mr J. H. Catts. And , worse of all, the whole of that campaign has been shown by subsequent events to be absolutely unnecessary. The division in the country, the discord, the disunion, the interference with Australia's war efforts were shown to have been the consequences of the extravagant, the unreasonable, military demands that the Prime Minister..put before the country. A f t e r the campaign we had a meeting He of the Labour party, but the bonorable gentleman did not meet the party willingly ; tliis braye man was forced to do so by a signed petition of members. Then, when he found that his leadership was challenged, as it was challenged in the National party a week ago, and that he was not able to manipulate the members of the Labour party as he has since manipulated the members of the National party, and that there was a majority against him, he was too base to remain and receive the vote of his There was no base slander colleagues. He would be leader or' nothing. He walked out of the meeting, and asked those who were prepared to support him to go with-him. He was never expelled from the Federal Parliamentary Labour party; any statements that he was so expelled are unmitigated falsehoods. It is true that he was ex^ pelled from the outside organizations. It has been said over and over again that the expulsion took place for no valid reason-that he was merely the victim of tlie dictation of the outside Labour bodies. WhenW . M . Hughes became regulations a member of the Labour party he signed a pledge to abide by the platform of that 'He sent out orders that the (party, and upon a|l details associated with thecarrying out of the platform to acoept the-decision of a majority of the and if Senator Gardiner had Parliamentary Labour party in Caulcus assembled. In carrying out the Labour programme of national defence the Labour party interpreted its attitude to the fact would not wards conscription for service overseas in a section in the Defence Act which it has placed on the statute-book of Australia. Section 49 readsMembers of the Defence Force who are members of the Military Forces shall not be reAustralia quired, unless they voluntarily agree to do so, to serve beyond the limits of the Commonregulations, wealth and those of any territory under the plucky authority of the Commonwealth. When that decision was arrived at by was exposed to the public. the Labour party, and inteorporated in legislation, it became, equally with the declared planks, part of the platform of the party. violated that decision he violated the platform of the party, and for that he suffered, like every other man who had violated the platform before him. After deserting his own party the right honourable gentleman attempted unsuccessfully to form a National Labour Federation. He set out vindictively to smash the movement that took him from the gutter and raised him to eminence. He would have carried on by himself if he could have done so, but finding that he could not, he resolved to enter into a coalition with his life-long political opponents-the men who had derided him from every platform. We well remember the resultant wrangle for jobs. Negotiations took place over a lengthy period in regard to the division of the loaves and fishes, the Ministerial portfolios, and only recently we had another illustration of the same tactics. History repeats itself with the right honourable gentleman. Almost simultaneously with the Coalition negotiations, the Labour party received a hypocritical invitation to join with the man who a few weeks before had left its ranks and attempted to set up another organization for the purpose of smashing the Australian Labour movement. In face of the base slanders uttered against Labour, that offer was meant only to be refused. The activities of the Coalition Government were no less remarkable. Then, as now, being defeated at a conscription referendum, the Prime Minister desired to escape to England. The Coalition party would not allow him to go by himself, and appointed two others to accompany and watch him. The Prime Minister sought to have the life of Parliament extended until the end of the war to enable him and other Labour pledge-breakers to hold their seats, in spite of public opinion. The proposal was to extend the life of Parliament till the end of the war and six months thereafter by an interference on the part of the British Government with the self governing rights guaranteed to us under the Constitution. Do we not remember that the difficulties of the Government were so great in connection with that proposed delegation and the attempt to extend the life of ParliaWhen W. M . Hughes ment that we had the scandal associated with the resignation of Senator Beady? The majority of members in another place carried a resolution demanding the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into what was supposed to be the bribery and corruption connected with the Beady incident, which arose out of the necessity to get a majority in another place to carry out the decisions of the Coalition Government. While the Beady incident remains without a public, inquiry, and the futile demands of the Senate for the appointment of a Royal Commission stand on the public records, and the Government show themselves afraid to face an inquiry, we can come only to the conclusion that the refusal is. prompted by the knowledge that bribery and corruption took place which could not be covered up. Then, when Senator Watson rose in his place in Parliament, and explained that the same tricks had been tried on him, that all sorts of offers had been made to him, the Prime Minister sought to break down the privileges of Parliament by dragging into the Law Courts of the country a very poor man who could not afford to defend himself there. That action has since been settled by the Prime Minister paying the whole of the costs of both sides. The circumstances associated with the resignation of one Tasmanian senator were so obnoxious to two Liberal senators from that State .that they threatened to vote against the Government in regard to the proposed delegation to the Imperial Conference, and thus forced' the Governmenb unwillingly to face the electors. It is true that by purloining from the outside recruiting organizations the name of ""Win-the-waT,"" and smashing that organization in order to get a party advantage, and because of the disruption of the Labour party, which up to that time could not be sufficiently explained to the people, and because they pledged themselves that, they would not bring in conscription, although . they had sworn before Heaven that the government of the country. could not be carried on without it, they were returned again to power. I am -compelled to confess, also, that the clumsy tactics on the part of Labour assisted tbem. A t any rate, they returned w i th a majority about the same as t h a i previously held by Labour.' W3iat has this party, w it h its. great majority, done to w in the war? Honourable members opposite have put a tax on single men as a means of introducing economic compulsion; they increased the salaries of Ministers by voting £1,65 0 into the M in isterial pool to be shared amongst members of the Government at the rate of about £20 0 each; and they passed a bogus Repatriation Act, which does not guarantee a single thing to any soldier. Beyond# those efforts they have not attempted any measures which can be said to be designed to assist in winning the war. Last year we had a brief session, and an adjournment in September, because we were given tp understand Ministersdesired a spell. said that the Government were tired of criticism and desired to get away from' it. adjournment took place in order that the Government might secretly, and behind the backs of the people, arrange another conscription campaign, and take their opponents at an unfair advantage. before the adjournment the honourable member for Flinders( Sir William Irvine) appealed to the Leader of the Government to state publicly to the House the reason for it . He said that there were matters of great national importance which must Joseph Cook) remember the date of the be dealt w it h , and he invited tbe Leader Cabinet meeting at which the conscription of the Government to take the House cancampaign was decided upon ? didly into his confidence and tell it the reason for the adjournment.

He has already played that game several times with his colleagues. The Prime Minister cannot change his skin. The honourable . member for Flinders set out on his conscription campaign on the 10th October, and it was not u n t i l the 26th October, that news of the Germanic attack on It a l y first reached this country. Clearly, therefore, that attack had nothing to do with the campaign. Senator Pearce opened his campaign in the Sydney TownH a l l on the 31st October, but the whole of his arrangements were made before the first news of the Germanic attack upon It a l y reached Australia. The Prime Minister is, with Colonel Campbell, joint secretary of the Defence Some of our friends League of New South Wales. Colonel Campbell, in a statement to the press on the 19th October-seve n days before the As a matter of fact, that first news of the Germanic attack upon Italy reached this country-se t out the league's scheme for the organization of New South Wales for the conscription campaign.

On the Sth November last, the day upon which the announcement was first made by tbe Prime Minister that there was to be a conscription campaign, there appeared in the Argus a statement made by the iumister for Home and Territories ( Mr Glynn) to the effect thatCopies of the neeessary papers have already been distributed for voting abroad and in distant parts of Australia. out without any knowledge that there was to be a referendum.

CATTS' -It is strange that, according to the honourable gentleman's own admission, the papers were at that very time distributed to distant parts in readiness for the vote. Apparently the Prime Minister had manipulated his honourable colleague so well that he really did not know he was playing his leader's game. On the following day the Chief Electoral Oflicer was reported to have said""Abroad"" means ""Eabaul, Mesopotamia, Palestine, Egypt, France, England, and at sea."" made? Mr J. H . CATTS -On 9th November, the day after that made by the Minister for Home and Territories. On the l f t t h November the Sydney Morning Herald published tlie statement by the Chief Electoral Offioer thatThe electoral officers, both, in Australia and abroad, had been informed of the impending referendum and their organization was already well in train. By Monday, 12th November, he expected they would all have been apprised of the contents of the regulations and be prepared to go straight ahead. On the Monday there appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald the following cable:Colonel Griffiths is arranging to take a ballotof the soldiers' vote during the fortnight preceding 20thDecember. It would appear, therefore, that all these arrangements had been carried out to a time-table. I am accepting the denial just made by the Ministerf o r Home and Territories that he knew what was going on; but the Chief Electoral Oflicer himself said that all the necessary papers had been despatched abroad. an election.

Look at the persecution of public men in this country wbo dared to oppose the Prime Minister. The most serious inroad made upon our liberty, since the time of the Stuarts. I have a list of some of the prosecutions, but in every case they were prosecutions of those opposed to the Government; and in no case was there a prosecution of any person, party, company, or newspaper that was supporting the Government. following are some of the persecutions I desire to place on record: 1. Charge of making false statements:. Hon. T. J. Eyan, Premier of Queensland, case dismissed. Senator Barnes, case dismissed. Seuator McDougall, case dismissed. James Mathews, M.H.R., case dismissed. J. H . Catts, M.H.R., case dismissed. Mr Cain, M.L.A., case dismissed. Ex-Senator Rae, case dismissed. Ilenry Boote, case, dismissed. A. H . S. Rocke, case dismissed. 2.

Charged with conspiracy:Premier of Queensland, Treasurer of Queensland, Secretary Labour Executive, Queensland, cases withdrawn. 5. Cases for disobeying censorship regulations :Daily Post, Hobart. Worker, Sydney. Labour Call, Melbourne. Afr. J. H. Oatts. A fair sample of the kind of statement on which these prosecutions, or, rather, political persecutions, were undertaken are given in the following: (a) J. H . Catts, M.H.R., statement that there was a sixth division. This was alleged to be a false statement. I hold in my hand a Christmas card from one of my constituents at the Eront showing on the back of it , the colours of six divisions; and I quoted letters from soldiers who had been transferred to the Sixth Division. Without any explanation from any member of the The Government, public men were hauled before the Court and charged with saying what is not true. made quite recently by the Minister for Defence. Mr J. H . CATTS I have never seen any explanation. Apparently, it was after the prosecution. I asked the Minister to produce the explanation he himself had made, and what he said was, "" There is no such division.""

An effort was made by us to prosecute them for making false statements, but from that date to this permission has been denied by the Prime Minister. Similarly, in the case of the treasurer of our campaign, who wanted to'take action for libel against a newspaper for alleging that we sought aid from German sources, the Government have blockaded our legal action under the War Precautions Regulation. That shows the partiality of the administration of justice in the hands of this would be Welsh Kaiser.

Mr J. H . CATTS dealt briefly with the persecution of public men. ber has not been allowed to do so. MrJ . H . CATTS militar y partisan political censorship of the daily press in the interests of this Government and against its opponents. Last week a statement was made by a New South Wales Ministeri n the person of Mr Fitzgerald, who complained of the way in which the military censorship affected public news. The Ministerf or Defence at once exclaimed, "" I challenge him to give an instance."" Well, the Sydney Sun, on Sunday last, supplied an instance, and here it isOn December 11, when the referendum campaign was in full swing, a cable message of 228 words lodged in London at 2.45 p.m. on December 10 and addressed to the Sun by Mr Keith Murdoch, its London representative, described how the Australians in France were training and preparing. In the course of this message the following passages occurred :"" Considerable sections have been playing football and attending the races and horse show's. Some have motored to seaside resorts, the British supplying a fleet of trans80,000 and 100,000 persons in the Commonports for the purpose. The difficulty with football Is that the New South Wales Brigade play Rugby, the Victorians play the Australian game, and composite brigades have mixed rules. Inter-brigade contests are impossible, but there is keen competition and rivalry between battalions. Some teams claim international players, and their games attract great crowds, but soldiering is never allowed to sink into the background."" Then follows this from the Sun:None will dispute that this is war news, that it is war news of peculiar concern to every Australian, that it came from London, and that it was censored. The message was delivered at this office, and after its receipt the Censor's Department directed that the sentences quoted should be expunged. They, therefore, had to be omitted from the cable story which was printed. Senator Pearce asked for only one instance. We have given it, and anybody who cares to read between the lines can see that it was not only censorship, but censorship of a particularly poisonous kind, because it was political censorship for party purposes. Pearce wishes for further instances he can have them, not singly, but in battalions. We know that Ministers went about the country telling .the electors that our soldiers in the trenches were being done to death because they were unable to obtain leave, and that conscription was necessary in order that they might be given reasonable spells from nerve-racking duty at the Front.. The Labour movement is passionately devoted to the in I have already terests of our Australian soldiers, but to allow the Government to use our soldiers is a different matter. Ministers indulged in a lying campaign from one end of this country to the othera campaign which' I come now to the would have been exposed had the facts been allowed to appear in the public press. Those facts were suppressed, not for military reasons, but for political party purposes, in order that the electors might be denied the facts necessary to enable them to base a sound judgment on the conscription issue. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE W ill the honourable member give me the date of that cable* Mr J. H . CATTS It is the l l t h December-nin e days before polling day. It is stated officially in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 21st December last that from 80,000 to 100,000 persons were disfranchised on the occasion of the recent referendum. This is the official statementI t is officially estimated that the regulation which made it illegal for persons of enemy birth or descent to vote to-day, had the effect of disfranchising, approximately, between wealth. Australian-born citizens were robbed of their statutory electoral rights by a regulation behind the back of Parliament, and by men, too, who are not, and never can be, Australians. They were not disfranchised on account of their line of descent, but because it is known that the great bulk of them are young Australians, and the young Australian of all lines of descent is opposed to conscription. It was their age, and not their line of descent, that caused them to be disfranchised? Now, let us see the attitude of this Government towards Germans. When the Australian workmen were forced on strike a littl e time ago, while the wharf labourers refused to have Germansi n their union, or to work alongside them, this Government used Germans and other foreigners for the purpose of defeating If Senator our own Australian workmen who were on strike.",29,Tudor

Further, the Brisbane Courier, the Nationalist organ in Queensland, reported that the candidate, Mr Sinclair, directly appealed for support to' the naturalized German vote, claiming that he had always fought to uphold their interests. In New South Wales the only seat with a German vote is that of Hume, represented by Mr Falkiner. announced in the Border Morning Mai l of 28th A p r i l , 1917, by advertisement, that Mr George Dankel, a German horn, and Mr Smithenbecker, whose nationality is presumably the same, would address the Germansi n the Hume electorate in the German language, imploring them to vote for Mr Falkiner. and Dankel. Mr J. H . CATTS -What is that falsehood ? The honourable member for Calare is out of order. MrJ . H .

The electorate in Queensland that returned Mr Stumma German-wa s the only one in Queensland to vote for conscription. I will give instances of the employment of Germans by this Government: 1.

In one cf his insane periods^ and when he could not get the police force of Queensland to act upon his ipsi dixit, the Prime Minister conceived the idea that he would create a police force of his own. Because this man became temporarily a lunatic, the country is to be saddled with a Commonwealth police force costing thousands of pounds per annum, so that if ever he goes.off his head again he will have a Pederal police force at his disposal, able to override the State laws, and plunge the country into civil war.

56,O Mr Mathews,"I withdraw it .The Leader of the Government read some old resolution passed by the Political Labour League of New South ""Wales regarding recruiting in an attempt to misrepresent this party, but I would remind -the House that the leader of the movement in that State is vice-president of the State recruiting body. Further, there is a Federal Labour member for each State representing our movement on the Federal Parliamentary Recruiting Committee. The right honourable gentleman spoke of our war aims, and caricatured and misrepresented some resolutions carried at a State conference. been no resolution regarding peace carried by a Federal conference of the body, and no member of the Labour party of this House is bound in the matter. What the Prime Minister caricatured was a series of peace resolutions of a State conout the country; let him give absolute ference, passed as a suggestion to the Pederal conference. I shall have an opportunity, at a later stage, to put all these resolutions on record, and shall ask that they be compared with what has been said by President Wilson, and what has been urged by the Labour bodies of America and Great Britain on the"" subject. The comparison will not be to the disadvantage of the Labour movement in Australia. This gentleman, who caricatures our attitude toward recruiting, who misrepresents our war aims, who falsifies our position in regard to peace terms, now says, "" I ask you to join us in a coalition."" Does not that offer prove thafc he knows that what he has said about the Labour party is absolutely untrue? If he believes what he has said to be true,he is a traitor to bis country in making, the offer. How can be ask men whom he has pilloried to join him if he believes what he has said about them ?

The Prime Minister then wished to scuttle back to London. So long as W. M. Hughes leads the Government, he will be an obstacle to the harmony and union of this country. If he wishes to prove his bona fides, and to restore good feeling, let him do what the Empire asks the German Kaiser to do: Let him consent to reparation, restoration and guarantees. Let! him rehabilitate the industrial organizations There has and trade unions in their full rights and privileges as enjoyed prior to the conscription referendum in-1916, of which they have been deprived; let him restore their employment to the men who have been victimized wholesale throughand ' unequivocal guarantees that conscription for service oversea has been finally and absolutely abandoned.

BeforeI deal with that which is the i m mediate purpose of the motion now before the Chair, the pledge which was given by tlie Government, and the position of the present occupants of the Treasury bench, I desire to review very briefly the history of the conscription question from the beginning to the present moment. The conclusion I have arrived at, as a result of that review, is that conscription, which is admitted by all but one of the members who support the Government--the exception being the honourable"" member for Werriwa( Mr Lynch) -^to be the only way in which the safety and the honour of tlie country can be maintained, Tias been from the beginning the subject of a series of blunders which has lef t Australia in a position in which for the present it is impracticable for her to shoulder her share of the burdens of the British Empire. An OPPOSITION MEMBER Y o u are to blame. Sir WILLIAMIBVINE be blameless; all that I claim is that I have been consistent. My review dates from the time when Mr Hughes, then leader of the Labour party, returned from England. I , with most of -my friends on this side of the House, were members of the Liberal party. But, baving regard ""to the views expressed by the Prime Minister and the attitude that he had adopted, I welcomed him back to Australia as the war leader of this country. Some of those who are now associated with him as follo wers were not entirely satisfied with the complete adherence I gave to his views and -leadership. that the one thing essential to Australia during that crisis-and there is just as great a crisis now-wa s that there should be a united and firm leadership, and I thought that in Mr Hughes that leadership was to be found. Week after week elapsed without Mr Hughes announcing what his policy was to be, but during those many weeks tliere was a continually increasing agitation amongst the Labour organizations against conscription. Public men and members of the unions were getting more and more drawn into a position of opposition to conscription-unti l finally, when the Labour Government the constitutional .course, the strong course, in fact the only course that would have succeeded, namely, introducing a B ill in Parliament for the carrying out of the policy which the Government considered necessary, and taking all the risks incidental thereto -suddenl y announced to the House and the .people that this, of all questions, was not to beshouldered by the Government, but was to be submitted to a referendum of the people, there was already a consolidated anti-conscription sentiment. Mr J. H . CATTS I do not » t h i nk the honourable member is correct in regard to the Labour organizations. The matter was introduced to them by the PrimeM in ister Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I think I am right in saying that it was the subject of Labour conferences all over Australia long before the Prime Minister returned to Australia, and it was the delay which took place after liis return which enabled the anti-conscriptionists to proceed with increasing activity, unti l practically all the actual machinery of the I may not Labour party was in operation against conscription before the Government policy was announced. Permit me to say a word or two to honourable members on the Opposition side, as well as on this side, on the subject of tlie referendum. In his speech on Friday the Prime Minister said that the direct voice of the people on all matters of public enactment had always been a plank of the party to which he has belonged. It was never the plank of any partu to which I belonged, and I am sure that honourable members opposite, howI believed then ever they may differ from me on most points of political discussion, will listen to me when I tell them that I believe that this practice of Parliament refusing to perform its representative duties when difficulties arise, and resorting to a machine which shunts those difficulties on to the people who elected Parliament, is, so far from being an instrument of Democracy, an expedient which, strikes at the very root of representative Government; and representative Government is the very foundation of Democracy. Reference was made by the Prime Minister to a man whom he regards, and I regard, as the greatest of Democrats-",39,Honourable Members Hear Hear
66,Led By Mr Hughes,"instea d of adoptingAbraham Lincoln. The Prime Minister said thafc the referendum had been, in the opinion of the Labour party, a means of carrying out Lincoln's greafc apothegm, "" Government of the people, by the people, and for the people,"" but he paraphrased saying "" by the direct vote or action of the people."" studied the actions or 'writings of that great American will beconvinced that if anybody had suggested to him that by "" government of the people by the people *' was meant Parliament shirking the responsibility of deliberation, determination, co-relation of facts, and all those alcts which constitute the purpose for whicb representative institutions are created-that government by the people meant Parliament shuffling off the responsibilities placed on its shoulders by the people, and leaving difficult questions to be determined by the people themselveshis wise eyes would have opened in wonder and amazement at such an interpretation. The referendum was not part of practical politics in his lifetime, but I think I have a right to infer from what I know of the man's mind, his history, his actions, his wisdom, his deep sympathy with the people, and the high and lofty conception he had of the duties of ""a Parliament elected by the people, that he would have said that we are charged with the high responsibility of bringing together all the information obtainable about any question, of deliberating it over and over again, weighing opposing views, and gradually, on behalf of the people, arriving at a decision which the people are not capable of making, not because they lack intelligence or knowledge, but because they are engaged in their own businesses, and have elected Parliament to decide these matters for them. I agree with the Prime Minister fchat if the result of this referendum has proved anything, it has proved that the referendum in a country like Australia, w it h a people like the Australians, and on such a subject, at all events, is not a fit instrutaken, the National party was formed, ment for Democracy. Our Constitution, indeed, provides for subject, which is vital to our country. what is called a referendum. it ? Is it anything like the referendum on pledge which has been so often referred this subject? blance to it? No. The Constitution delife of this Parliament, which was-then clares that when Parliament amend the Constitution, and does in fact introduced, either by Act of Parliament Sir William Irvine. pass an amendment of it , going through all the stages of deliberation, information, and conclusion in fashioning and perfecting its new instrument) of government, it must go still further. The Constitution says fco Parliament, ""by the people"" by "" Y o u cannot carry this particular law into effect without obtaining for it Anybody who has the assent of the people."" Honourable members will recognise that that is a veto of the people, by referendum, on an Act of Parliament carried through in accordance wifch parliamentary principles and methods, and to which the Parliament has given its united wisdom. But a referendum on such a question as conscription is not in accordance with the spirit of our Constitution. The Constitution declares that the laws pf this country are to be made by Parliament, elected by the citizens of Australia, and assumes thereby that Parliament is to take the f u l l responsibility of making those laws. The Parliament must take that responsibility in the way that it has always been accepted in every British country. It must be prepared to go before the constituencies and accept responsibilit y for its actions. . If there is any question which, it appears to me, ought not under any circumstances to have been thrown suddenly upon the decision of a people torn by conflicting emotions, affected by all kinds of passions, from the highest to the lowest-fro m the deepest emotions felt by tbose whose nearest and dearest are dying, to the low selfishness of the man who does not care who is dying as long as he is safe-it is the very question which has already been submitted twice to the people. It was first submitted and went to the vote on 28th October, 1916. We know the result of that vote. I am not going to dwell upon its effect, either inside or beyond Australia. Prom my point of view, it was deplorable. A f t e r that vote was and an election was held on 5th May, 1917. I propose to speak plainly on this But what is The National party was formed, and the Has it any family resemto was given-the pledge that during the desires to being elected, conscription would not be or by regulation, without being again referred to the people. It was also part of the pledge that tbe question would be referred to the people if the safety of Ausunderstand it , he isfcheone member of the tralia demanded it . It has been said that such a pledge was essential to the creation of a National party from the heterogeneous elements out of which it could alone be created. It was also said that without such a pledge or compromise it followed that the National party would not have been able to secure its return at the polls. I join issue w i th both of those positions. I contend that it was possible to form a National party without any such compromising pledge at all. I say, , moreover, that I believe, and am justified in the belief, that although general elections of 5th May last would probably not have returned to Parliament such a large number of National members as it did, it would assuredly have returned them with a good working majority. What was the result of that general election ? The result was that which was acclaimed as a huge victory. In fact, it created a hobbled Parliament. Everything that has happened since that time has been the result of that unfortunate and false position. A f t e r that, need I refer to the humiliating record of the voluntary system of recruiting? I think the greatest efforts were made by the Government ana by the Director of Recruiting, by means of those agencies which he had then at his command, to appeal in every possible direction to those who had nofc yet seen their duty in this matter. fact, that the result was a gradually diminishing stream of recruits. stream became practically a trickle, obviouslyclearly, and demonstrably incapable of fulfillin g the requirements of our troops afc the Front. the general promise which bad been made by Mr Fisher, and endorsed by the whole of the people of this country, that we would give our last man and our last shilling, it was obviously incapable even of supplying the reinforcements necessary to maintain those divisions already at the Front. Sir were 47,000 recruits last year. , Sir WILLIAMIRVINE honourable member for Swan( Sir John Porrest) possibly unlike myself, is in a peculiar position with regard to tbe point to which we are now coming. As far as I Government who did not give his adhesion to the statement that the Cabinet would not, and could not, continue to carry on the government of this country without conscription. That being so, he is free. But what I was about fco say was that the stream of reinforcements, or of voluntary enlistments, had become so extremely small-and week by week it was becoming smaller-that all the members of the Government except the Treasurer ( Sir John Porerst) joined in declaring to the country that the voluntary system had demonstrably and finally failed. That was true. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE It is absolutely true, and is involved in the statement made by a responsible Government that they could not carry on without conscription. In November last, within, I think, six months of this party going into office to t r y to enable Australia to take her proper part in winning fche war, to endeavour to carry out-Australia's part by the voluntary system, they had cast upon them the onus of stating to the country that they could not continue the government of the country, and would not attempt to do so, without conscription. That implies, if it does not express, a complete and final condemnation of the voluntary system as a means of securing recruits. That was my position at that. time. That was the decision to which the Government came. I am not at a ll concerned with the various views put before the House as to what We know, as a matter of led immediately to that decision. The Government met on Wednesday, the That 7th, after having been separated for some weeks; and I think I am right in assuming that, in the exercise of their own judgment, having regard to the terrible events Putting aside altogether in Europe, they saw that conscription was necessary-that the time had arrived when there must be conscription, or they could not continue to carry out the policy on which they were elected as a Government. The decision was certainly arrived at in a h u r r y ; and my main"" regret is that the members of the'Government did not take into their counsel, not necessarily JOHN FORREST -Afte r all, there myself, although I should have been willing and anxious to tender personally the The right advice I had tendered on the platform, and show reasons for it-bu t other men",40,Honourable Members Hear Hear

If the Government had given a little time to the matter they would have found tliat amongst the strongest supporters of the conscriptionist policy the antagonism to deciding it by referendum was growing, and had grown, to very great proportions. That is a point on which I regret the Government did not take time to get advice. I believe to-day, notwithstanding the vote tliat has been given, that a differattempted to follow me, but that he has ent conclusion would have been arrived at; that had the Government taken time to seek and consider the advice of the greatest supporters they had in the policy to which they had pledged themselves, they would not have again gone to the people by referendum, but would have had a general election in the ordinary constitutional way. Had they done that I believe they would have succeeded; if not, they would, at all events, have gone down with their colours nailed to the mast, and would, in a constitutional way, have thrown the whole responsibility on the other side to find the policy that would succeed in maintaining our forces abroad. There is one criticism about going to the country on such a question whicli I have heard from several persons; that is, how -would the appeal of the House of Representatives on such a stibject relieve the members of the Senate from the pledge they had given ? position !simple position. We have first to ask what the pledge was. The members of directly or indirectly, to his fellow the Senate did not give any pledge other members, a dissolution in any shape or than that the Government gave. It was form, is about as popular as a nurse who not worded in any other way, and recomes into a ward with a large jar of lated to no other time or period or subtreacle and brimstone, the latter preject-it was the same pledge, and it was dominating. I do not expect, nor have I at a pledge they gave by supporting the any time expected, such a suggestion to Government. What was that pledge? It be popular with the majority of honorwas made on a general election of memable members on either side; but that bers of this House, and was limited to the suggestion duration of the Parliament then being sible elected; therefore, the pledge of the memmon sense shows us that, having put this . bers of the Senate was necessarily so issue to the people-in the false way, as limited. on it. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I have said they were; but what was it? They were elected on the pledge, that the Government would not, during the life of the Parliament then being elected, introduce conscription by regulation or Act of Parliament. not elected by the same constituency. be so, but the pledge related merely to that period; and the interjection shows, not that the honourable member has not not succeeded in following the argument. However that may be, the pledge related only to the duration of the Parliament then being elected, and to one question. When it is said, as it will be said by some of the supporters of the National party outside, and, probably, believed by many inside the House, that a dissolution would not have resulted in the victory of our party, even with reduced numbers, I desire to point out that even the vote which has been taken, under all the disadvantageous circumstances-som e of which I shall refer to presently-wa s a vote turned by only the per cent, of the people wbo Voted-that is, if we could have got that 3^ per cent, to vote "" Yes,"" the result would have been the other way. After all, it cannot be considered an overwhelming "" No "" vote. It is a decisive "" No "" victory; and my friends opposite are entitled to the.benefit of that; but to draw from that the inference that if the Government had have lost its whole majority, is, in my opinion, not at all proved.

The majoritv which has been obtained against conscription is, as I have said, a 3£ per cent, majority. But we must also regard the matter from this point of view: that many considerations besides the mere exercise of the judgment that conscription was not necessary influenced that vote. I do not think that any of mv honourable friends ooDosite will deny that the "" No "" vote included the votes of many thousands of persons, and especially of women, who did not deliberately exercise a judgment upon the war necessity of conscription for Australia, but who simply could not, and would uot, take upon themselves the responsibility of directly voting to send somebody else's son to the Front. MrJ . H . CATTS -Did not that innot the letter, of tlie Constitution. fluence operate also in the case of the "" Yes "" vote? Sir WILLIAMIRVINE see how it could. But we know that it to it? applied to tlie "" No "" vote. No sentimentalist would vote "" Yes "" unless he The carrying of a referendum does uot f e l t impelled to do so by a strong sense carrv wifch ifc any constitutional power. of duty, but a great many people voted A "" Yes "" vote would not have vested "" No"" because sentimentalism influenced Parliament with any power which it did their judgment. It is this ""consideration not previously possess, and a ' ' No' ' vofce which accounts for a considerable portion does not take away from Parliament any of the "" No "" votes. I cannot merely to women, but also to a large number of men who acted from sentimental motives! But there is still another element which must be taken into account in connection with the ' ' No' ' vote. I have already referred to the fact that prior to the decision of the Government to put this question to a referendum, there had been for some weeks a perfectly That is tlie result of clear and strong expression of opinion amongst thousands and thousands of the In view strongest supporters of iconscription throughout Australia especially in New South Wales and Queenslandaorainst the adoption of that course. They endeavour desired that Parliament should shoulder fche responsibility which rightly belongs to it . If the Government contemplated doing such a foolish thing as submitting the question of conscription to a refer-"" endum, obviously the very worse time to do it was when their own supporters were advising fchafc it should not be done. When the Government practically said to their own supporters, "" You must adopt a Government, this course whether you like it or not,"" manifestly they could not expect to excite the strongest enthusiasm amongst them. I believe that amongst those who abstained from voting "" Yes,"" the number of which was not inconsiderable, were many persons who, perhaps, either d i d ' not strongly desire conscription, or were not violently opposed to it , bufc who strongly resented having put upon them the responsibility whicli directly attached to Parliament. Considering all the circumstances of the case, the result was, I think, amazing. But the result of a referendum has no constitutional effect whatever. The Constitution requires the Parliament of Australia, elected by the people of Australia, to make the laws of Australia. B y impii;oation dt excludes the shirking of that responsibility by. throwing it on to the shoulders of the people. The mere taking of a referendum is to act contrary to the spirit, if An Honorable MEMBER If the first referendum had been carried the parties I do not in Parliament might not have given effect It applies not responsibility that was already thrown",43,Honourable Members Hear Hear

Owing to this unfortunate step, for practical purposes all our activities have been paralyzed. I am not going to say anything about the conduct of the campaign. I admit that it was not all that I desired. There were many things in it that I did not approve. ber did not protest against the methods used by the Government. orable member knows that though I absolutely disapproved of the referendum being used to decide this question, and though I was backed up in my objection1 by many of the strongest supporters of conscription, as soon as the Government decided to submit it to a referendum, and to stand or fall by the result, I threw all my energies behind them and urged all my friends to do likewise. once the Ministry engaged in a campaign of this kind, a public protest against the means adopted by its leaders would have been an act of hostility which would have tended to weaken them. H a d I protested I to k ill conscription. not intend to discuss that question now, because there are much greater matters claiming my attention. But, as the Prime Minister has said, I did make certain representations to him in reference to the censorship. everything that has been said in this connection, but I do say that the PrimeM i nister endeavoured to conduct the campaign which he had started with all the powers in his possession, and under these circumstances those who did not desire to h u r t him were bound to help him. thinks that the end justified the means. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE Far from it . However, I am not going to discuss that aspect of the matter now.' Tbere are much weightier questions affecting y mind at the present moment. Them net result of the whole business to date is that we have gone on the wrong path from the beginning,. and we have stuck to that path, notwithstanding that we knew it was the wrong one, until we have hobbled Australia and, in my judgment, disgraced and dishonoured her before the world. no option but to wait until we can release her from her self-imposed shackles and enable her to again take her place amongst the free family of nations to which she belongs. I come now to the pledge which was given by the Prime Minister, and which forms the subject of this motion of no confidence. It w ill be within the recollection of honourable members that, as soon as that pledge was given, I stated publicly that I thought it bound not merely the members of the Government but the members of the party supporting the Government, unless they disclaimed it . I do not pretend to be the judge of any other man's conscience. I may be entirely wrong in the view I took. Every man must for m his own opinion as to his own action in that respect. All I know is that' I declared that the pledge hound me, and that I would be bound by it . take a disclaimer from any other member of the party as an act of hostility? claimer during the campaign? I do not would have been doing my best know that I would. I do not feel comHowever, I do petent to judge any other man's position in this matter. All I can say is that I stated my own position definitely; that I could not be a member of a Government which would attempt to govern without the powers of conscription. ThatI do not agree with was my position. That is my position to-day. I find that other members in this party expressly disclaimed being bound by that pledge. Many of them, without expressly disclaiming being bound by it , believe that it was not made on their behalf, and that they are not bound by it . As to the latter part of that, I took a different view; but the fact remains. The referendum having been deI do not. feated, and the pledge having been given by the Government that it would not continue to govern, without conscription, in the circumstances which bave taken place are the Government, or the members of the Government-becaus e this is a matter, not of the Government, but of the members of the Government, from the Prime Minister down-maintainin g that pledge in spirit .as well as in effect?

That is a position which every one, inside and outside the House, must see requires a justification. justification sufficient "" ?

Statements were made in the press about a speech supposed to have been made by myself at that meetinga report which has gone from one end of Australia to the other and been commented on-in which, amongst other things,, it was stated that I had acclaimed in the very highest terms of praise all the conduct of the recent campaign by the Prime Minister? One cannot contradict all these statements at such a time without giving away something. If you say you did not say something, they ask, "" Then what did you say ? "" So that the best and fairest thing, in the circumstances, is to say nothing. The honourable member for Yarra, then, was unable to form a Government. The Governor General decided, at that stage at all events, that it was undesirable, in any circumstances, to grant q. dissolution. That necessarily, therefore, threw him back on tliis party as the only source from which a stable Government could be formed. The Governor General appears to have satisfied himself on the information he obtained that there was no other source than the leader of that party, no other man who could for m a Government capable of carrying on the government of the country.' this 'juggling would take place, so there is no need to explain it . Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I should have liked to hear from the PrimeM in ister some statement to the effect that he did all he could to enable another Government, to be formed from the party which has a majority in both Houses, but whicli would not include those members who had said they could not and would not carry on without conscription. assumed that something of the kind was done. I have no right to inquire into the communications tliat passed between Mr Hughes, Mr Cook, and any other members from whom the Governor General sought information, but we had a right to assume that each member of the Goveniment satisfied himself that he individually had made every effort to see if a Government could be formed from the ranks of those not bound by the pledge. I do not feel entirely satisfied with the position. cumstances you have just narrated, do you think that members of the Government who made definite pledges to the country are absolved for having broken them ? Sir WILLIAMIRVINE T h a t pledge would be fulfille d by the new Government introducing a measure of conscription. That is one alternative. The only other alternative is to regard the Ministry as a Government of necessity, and of last resort. The first alternative may be placed on one side, because the immediate introduction of conscription is out of the question. MrJ . H . CATTS -Immediate ? Why emphasis on the immediate? pears, therefore, that the justification for the present position is the reason which apparently the Prime Minister himself relied upon, namely, that the resources of the House were exhausted. that. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE No , and I should like , an explicit statement on the point from the members of the Government. This goes beyond any question of party. The course taken by the Government has to be justified before the public, and I hope that we shall have a statement that every effort was made by all the members of the Government, before they resumed office, to see if it were not possible to for m a Government out of the same party with a majorit y in both Houses, and which would be able to carry on without raising any question of dishonouring pledges. The Government have taken office with a heavy load of responsibility, and I want to say plainly that, if they contemplate carrying .on by patching up I the old voluntary system to secure a few more recruits, or in any way minimizing the immediate duty which is cast upon the country at the present time, to obtain reinforcements, assuredly they w ill be accused, and not w i th impropriety, of not having kept f u l l fait h with the people.

Australia have a second time, by a greatly increased majority, said that conscription must not be employed in our share of the war, and that declaration should be accepted by the Government, by the honourable and,learned membei', and by every one else as final, unless they are prepared to again stir up the animosity, bitterness, and antagonism which, unfortunately, was rife during the recent campaign, and which the honourable and learned member has deprecated. We want those feelings to die down, and the sooner the better. It is the desire of every honourable member of this Parliament, without exception, that Australia should make every effort stated she can in this war; but unity of action cannot be secured Avhile conscription is still talked about. The lionorable and learned member for Flinders will render a service to the country, and greatly assist his own cause, if he stops talking about the introduction of conscription, either in the immediate future or at any other time. He snid that he had not accused us of being disloyal, and that he believed that the ma j o r it y who voted "" No *' were not disloyal. May I remind him of a speech which he made at Dandonong. and which was reported in the Art/ug of the 12th October, 1916, as follows:What we did on 28th October could never be undone. The honour of Australia once lost could never be regained. The fight was between patriotism .and .disloyalty. The man who voted "" No"" was a man who was willing to weaken the arm of the Government at this time, and he who would do that in a national peril was a traitor to his country. The Government was supported by the whole of the Opposition, while the opponents of the Government were supported by the Industrial Workers of the World. He who voted "" No"" would strike a deadly blow at the honour and safety of his country. Were there any present who were willing, on 28th October, to have their names enrolled on the ragged; sickly regiment of pro-Germans, disloyalists, and the Industrial Workers of the World? When those at the back of the hall heard the truth there were few who would enroll themselves in that regiment. The possibility It is very good, even at this belated time, to find the honourable member for FlinT h a t is a doctrine ders willing to give credit to those who voted "" No , "" or to the majority of them, by saying that they were not actuated by disloyal sentiments; and it will go a long Thc doctrine that a way towards allaying the differences, disruptions, and antagonisms rampant in the community to-day if he will induce the members of his party, the Ministry, and The people of particularly the Prime Minister, to drop their continual gibing at members of this party that they are pro-Germans, that they are disloyalists, and that they are in different to the Empire's needs. Even now, because I claim that members of this party should not be asked to offer suggestions, it is said that we are prepared, from party feelings, to let the interests of Australia and the Empire go. The less we hear of that statement the better. what your attitude amounts to. tp that. I deny that there is any reason for the recurring insinuations that honourable members on this side of the House",50,Williamirvine T H A T Is Time That Is A Suggestion W H I C H I Ven

116,Mr Finlayson,"It does not amountare indifferent to Australia's share in the war. The honourable member for Flinders claims that Ministers can only justify their acceptance of office under the present circumstances by introducing some measure of conscription or its equivalent. Are we to take it that the honourable member can see no other way of carrying on the war than by imposing conscription ? Sir WILLIAMIRVINE E v e r y other way has failed, so far as Australia is concerned. cannot be substantiated. General of Recruiting does not admit it . Some time ago the Age said that it lies in no man's mouth to say that voluntarism has failed ' in Australia^ and Senator Pearce, speaking in Sydney on 21st October, made the statement that we have no reason to be ashamed of what we have done. : What has been done has been done by our boys. said that all the suggestions that had been made as to the withdrawal of Australian divisions at the Front, or as to the failure to secure reinforcements, were absolutely untrue, because every"" Australian division had been kept at its f u l l strength. As the right honourable the Treasurer ( Sir John Forrest) reminded the honourable member for Flinders, no less than 47,000 men were enlisted last year. Of course, the figures are lower than in the previous year, but the stream of recruits, as the reservoir from which it is drawn is depleted, must necessarily decline. No other country can show such a record in regard to voluntary recruiting as Australia can show.. disparaging utterance worthy of credence, or that can be substantiated, can justify any complaint in regard to Australia's response in this war. It has been simply magnificent. Let me again object to the continual references to sending sous to the war. Unionists whose sons are at the Front object to the suggestion that they sent them. We take no credit for the fact that our sons have gone, except that it be that we are proud to be the fathers of lads who have recognised their duty. gestion of their having been sent through the operation of some form of domestic it is important that the significance of the conscription comes only from the conscriptionists. from the honourable inember. It was for that reason I interjected that we are not sending the men. member for Flinders made the remark.. When my boy was in camp, it was thrown up at me that I had not sent him. Unionists, who are so splendidly represented at the Front by their sons, who are saving and guarding the honour of Australia, did not send their boys, and T h a t argument therefore I hope that the honourable memThe Directorber will also drop that kind of talk. The honourable member will find that it is quite easy to justify what has been done through voluntary recruiting. I trust that he will remember that the young men of Australia have responded willingly and nobly. There is no need to suggest that they were sent by their parents, or that they had to be forced to go for economic reasons, or otherwise. The honourable member for Flinders made a very unfortunate remark at the beginning of his speech when he said that Australia stood self-humiliated and selfshamed. He is entitled to his opinion, but I do not think that it comes with very good grace from any one to suggest that the people of Australia were actuated by motives other than those which appeared to them sufficient to justify their voting as they did. It was a most unfair and uncalled-for remark that the Prime Minister made when he suggested that many of the people who voted "" No"" had led the Government to believe that they would vote "" Yes . "" He practically accused his supporters of perjury. The honourable member for No Flinders should be above making such a petty and unfortunate remark as to .say t h a t the people of Australia are self humiliated and self-shamed. Honour's wounds are always self-inflicted. The people of Australia are not in the least degree humiliated or shamed by the vote given on the 20th December last. People in other parts of the world do not agree with the honourable member for Flinders. The Pall Mcdl Gazette, according to a cable published in the Arrrus ou 26th December, commenting upon the result of The sugthe referendum, saidThe Pall Mall Gazette (Unionist) says that",51,Williamirvine T H A T Is Time That Is A Suggestion W H I C H I Ven

121,Mr Finlayson,"The honorableAustralian Reinforcements Referendum result should not be misinterpreted. It points out that the vote does not mean war weariness or retirement from the conflict, and that, although conscription has failed, it does not necessarily follow that the Australian divisions will be left with inadequate reinforcements. Eveni n Canada, it is cabled that while the Canadian papers expressed some astonishment at the result, they would continue to believe that Australia was whole-heartedly for the prosecution of the war. in other parts of. the world do not concur in what the honourable member for Flinders has said regarding the recent decision. So far from the people of Australia feeling humiliation ""or shame, they have a feeling of relief and pride; they glory in the fact that they alone, among the nations of the world, have dared to be free of the curse of militarism. The poll which was taken in 1916 was the greatest blow for freedom that the world has ever known; and, after another twelve months' experience and ' f u l l e r knowledge and further investigation, so far from conscription being more attractive to uhe people of Australia, it has become, like vice. . . a monster of so frightful mien, As, to be hated, needs but to be seen. While the honourable member for Flinders was speaking I was thinking how true was the remark made of him by the Prime Minister on 17th A p r i l , 1914. Speaking on the Address-in-Reply, the honourable 1 member for Bendigo( Mr Hughes) said of the honourable member for Flinders, who was thenAttorney-GeneralDemocracy asks him for a reform, and he gives it a speech. Plutocracy asks him for a law and he gives a Coercion Act. I say that if the honourable and learned gentleman goes down to his political grave, upon his gravestone there should be written this epitaph"" Por tlie people he did nothing but make speeches, but for the plutocrats he did everything that was iii his power to do."" The speech he delivered this shows that he has no definite policy other than conscription; bereft of the power of conscription, he is oolitically His only idea of carrying on the war is by compulsion, and he pitifully appeals to the Opposition to assist with as to how Australia shall continue to play her part. Australia will continue to fight in this war. There can be no difficulty in securing a continuation of the magnificent response the Australian people have already made,.and if the Government are Mr Finlayson ready to hear suggestions, let them declare their policy, and they will find that members of the Opposition are not at all unwilling to give every assistance in the prosecution of the war. The honourable member for Flinders tried to make a point of the contention that conscription ought not to have been the subject of a referendum. W it h that argument I entirely agree. From the time that the conscription proposal was These quotations show that people first brought forward my attitude has been that human life and religion are not fit and proper subjects for a referendum decision-that no majority, even though it be 99 per cent., has any right to bind an individual in regard to those most in t i mate and -sacred personal matters. in regard to liquor reform. liquor reform is not a matter of individual personal, but of social and mutual, relationship. In saying that conscription ought not to have been submitted to a referendum, the 'honourable member for Flinders is again unfortunate, because at Dandenong, on the 26th January, 1917, he said, "" He did not think it would be foolish to appeal again to the people on the conscription quest i o n , "" and Mr Holman, the Premier of New South Wales, said on 24th October, 1916, "" I see no reason why conscription, if defeated, should not be introduced again and yet again."" the time of the State elections. He is a^ nice one to talk about broken pledges! by Mr Holman and the New South Wales candidates for the State Parliament was quite explicitWe declare that the issue of conscription, having been referred to the people of Australia and decided by them in the negative, is afternoon settled. We accept unreservedly the verdict of the people, and will give no support to any endeavour t'o again raise the question. bankrupt. To-day the honourable member for Flinders says that conscription ought not to be the subject of a referendum; a year suggestions ago he did not think it would be foolish to appeal to the people again on that question. Possibly he will suggest that the qualification he makesi is that the matter should be referred to the people as a matter of Government policy, as an issue vital to the life of the Government",52,Williamirvine T H A T Is Time That Is A Suggestion W H I C H I Ven

133,Mr Finlayson,"the Leader of the. Opposition confined his speech. In regard to fche Bendigo pledge, the position is clear and explicit. Speaking at Bendigo on the 12fch November, the Prime Minister gave a lead ""to his party and to the country. He saidWe who were elected on a Win-the-war policy tell you plainly that the situation in Bussia and Italy is such that without the power to insure reinforcements we cannot give effect to the policy w.hich you approved with such enthusiasm last year. I tell you plainly that the Government must have this power. It cannot govern the country without it, and will not attempt to do so.. Thafc pledge was repeated in almost parrotlike fashion by nearly every member of the Ministry, and by a large number of their supporters. them was punctuated wifch threats as to what the Government would do if they did not get tliis power. The threat of resignation w,as fche one thing perpetually held before the people. As I have previously mentioned, the honourable member for -Flinders( Sir William Irvine) stated clearly at Bathurst on 1st December, and it was repeated by a number of the supporters of tlie Government, that the question before' the country was conscription, with the National Government, or no-conscription with a Tudor. Government. and tliat they were so understood by the country is easily gathered from tlie way the press and the people referred to them as fche campaign proceeded, and have since referred to them. make a few quotations from the Melbourne newspapers as showing how the country interpreted the Bendigo pledge. I shall quote from the Argus, the Age, and the Herald, and a reference to tlie files of newspapers published in the other States will show that the same interpretation was placed upon the pledge in every State of tlie Commonwealth. Age of 4th instant wroteThe Bendigo declaration binds honest men as firmly as an oath. Mr Hughes and his The Herald, on the 4th January, said, Ministers must surrender office, and allow referring to the Prime Ministerothers to take the responsibility. . . . A resignation on one day with the intention of immediately gaining a new lease of power campaign is to be ignored, or is to be regarded . . . would be a fraudulent design to deceive as a mere piece of irresponsible platform and betray. . . . The party could not hope rhetoric, politics in Australia will have deto maintain its repute amongst decent men. . . scended to the lowest depths it has ever The dishonour contemplated by the vicious dereached. The political morale will be immedivice to reconstruct under the same leaderately lowered; a wrong and undignified preship. . . . On 7th January, the Age wroteUnless the Government retires absolutely thrown down by the Prime Minister, it would and unconditionally it will have been guilty of supply a historical instance of cynical political an act of publie betrayal. . . . Thei callousness, and would bring upon Australia ilfr. Finlayson. British Empire is at war to defeat the odious spirit that counts national treaties "" scraps of paper,"" and in fighting against the pollution of the world by German dishonour, one of the Dominions cannot countenance a dishonourable German trick. . . . Unless he ( Mr Hughes) honours the Bendigo pledge he must fall never to rise again, and the party that followed him . . . must ultimately be swept aside in ignominy. On 9th instant, the Age wroteIn rejecting the Government's proposals the people were also rejecting the Government. . . The responsibility must pass definitely and absolutely to others. There must be a new Government, in which neither Mr Hughes nor his Ministers could have a part. He and his Ministers would brand themselves as men unworthy of trust. . . . Every speech made by Were the old Ministry to seek to come back, the Ministerial party must assist at once in removing it from office, or become brazen abettors of its offending. . . . The Age newspaper supported the Government throughout the conscription campaign, and is supporting them now, so that it is open to the same criticism thafc it directed at those who are supporting it in this House. The Melbourne Herald was just as emphatic. Ifc is interesting to note that ifc headed its criticism of the action of the The pledges were quite explicit, Governmenti n regard to. the Bendigo pledge with this quotationGod give ns men ! A time like this demands Strong minds, great hearts, true faith and ready hands; I propose to Men whom the lust of office does not kill, Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy, Men who have honour, men who will not lie, Men who can stand before a demagogue, And scorn his treacherous flatteries without winking. Tall men,sun crowned, who live above the fog, In public duty and in private thinking, For while the rabble with their thumb-worn creeds, Their large professions, and their little deeds, The Mingle in selfish strife; lo! Freedom weeps, Wrong rules the land, and waiting justice sleeps. If the pledge he gave during tlie referendum cedent will hav-e been set up. . . . If the Ministerial party were now to attempt the work of legislation in oblivion of the gage the contemptuous regard of the Empire and of tlie Allies. On the 9th January this statement appeared in the same paper"" It will not satisfy the popular sense of .honour if the Ministry merely resigns, and then, through any circumstances that may appear to have been directed to a factitious end take up the reins of government again. The Ministry gave a distinct pledge which must be unconditionally carried out. On the 10th January the Herald saidIt is said by the apologists that the pledge given by the Prime Minister during the referendum campaign has been duly honoured, bnt the arguments are weak and specious, and will not find durable acceptance. The general conviction, when the mists have cleared away, must be that' the tone of Australian politics has been"" lowered. But the Argus is, perhaps, the most in teresting of all newspapers in its comments. heads all its articles with this legendI am in the place where 1 am demanded of conscience to speak the truth, and therefore the truth I speak, impugn it whoso list. That was the statement of a great man, made under great circumstances. This is what the Argus said on the 3rd JanuaryWhile the giving of the pledge was unwise, to violate it would be immoral, and it is unbelievable that Ministers think for a moment of refusing to honour their bond. . . . No other course consistent with honesty is open than the resignation of the Hughes Ministry. On the 4th January the Argus saidIf Mr Hughes, re-elected to the position of party leader after his resignation, attempts to govern the country he will violate the pledge. . . ; time to take ""up the reins of government, is plainly an evasion of Mr Hughes' undertaking, and is a negation of Mr Watt's declaration, ""You must £;efc other men to govern you; \>o cannot."" Resignation and subsequent resumption of office are not even a keeping of the letter of the pledge, and they are an unmistakable violation of its spirit. Here we have plainly expressed, and in rather strong terms, the opinion held, not only by newspaper'editors, but, I feel bound to say, by a large portion even of the people who supported the Government during the last referendum. Government have found a way out of the difliculty by resigning and immediately taking up office again. The Argus of the 10th January found an excuse for Ministers, although this is the pape* which tells usI am in the place wliere I am demanded of conscience to speak the truth, and therefore the truth I speak, impugn it whoso list. On that date the Argus saidMr Hughes, in pursuance of his pledge, gave up the attempt to govern. He tendered the resignation of his Government, and it was accepted. He did, in truth and in fact, refuse to carry on the government of the country. . . . The Nationalist party has accepted Mr Hughes' action as a fulfilment of his undertaking to the electors. He and his Ministers refused to govern. . . . The Nationalist party has resolved to honour its pledges, implicit and explicit. The Ministry must now carry out the wish of the party by continuing to govern. No other Ministry would be acceptable to the party. brains, and now you seek his head ! we ought not to seek the Prime Minister's brains, and use them to every possible advantage. It is interesting to notice how Mr Hughes and his Ministry, as well as It is significant that the Argus the members of the party, interpret that pledge. They said.r "" We have kept our pledge and have resigned, and the Governor General has said that we are still the people to carry on the government of the country."" M » Hughes is my authority for the statement that he, after making his statement in the Caucus meeting, -after his return from Government House, was requested by 'his party to accept a commission to form a Ministry.' They regard the pledge given by the Prime Minister as having been satisfied, and all honourable conduct fulfilled, by a resignation at 10.30 a.m., and the reacceptance of office about 10.30 p.m. on the same date. During the interval, we are told, the Governor General satisfied himTo resign, and witliin a short self that Parliament had been exhausted in regard to those who were qualified to carry on the government. I hold the opinion very strongly that, the Ministry having resigned in order to keep their pledge, the Governor General had no other course open to him than to send for the Leader of the Opposition, and invite him to form a Ministry. MrJ . H CATTS -The Prime Minister would not give the Governor General any advice, but the other Ministers gave The him a l o t ! Governor General was able to get advice from suitable sources. If the Leader of the Opposition was willing to form a M in istry,and undertake the responsibility of government, it was no question for the Governor General as to how long the Leader of the Opposition could carry on.",54,Williamirvine T H A T Is Time That Is A Suggestion W H I C H I Ven

136,Mr Finlayson,"No doubt theSir had not the numbers. business of His Excellency, but the business of Parliament. has a misconception of the position, constitutional precedent followed in every country where there is responsible government. K i ng himself son) I must ask the honourable member not to criticise the action of the Governor General or involve the name of the Sovereign in debate. to do so, but merely to point out that, constitutionally, the Leader of the Opposition ' ought, without question, to have been invited'to form a Government, and, if he were willing to do so, the responsir bility of the Governor General should have ended. It was for tki§ Parliament to detevmine, probably in a very short and summary fashion, whether the Leader of the Opposition should be allowed to carry, on'; indeed, the Prime Minister said that the Government formed by the Opposition could not have existed for more than a few hours. No one could have complained, because the majority must rule. When I listened to the Prime Minister explaining how he had kept his pledge, I could not help thinking of that portion of sacred history in which we are toldWhen Pilate saw that he eould prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before th« multitude, saying, "" I am innocent of the blood of this just person; see ye to it . "" Then answered the people, and said, "" His blood be on us and on our children."" We have almost a parallel position created here by the Prime Minister, who, washing his hands, says, "" I have resigned ;I have been an honourable man,"" and the party accepts the responsibility and. the blame. Then, in K in g Lear, the Pool saysThat, sir, which serves and seeks for gain, And follows but for form, Will pack when it begins to rain, And leave the in tbe storm. History supplies most useful illustrations of men placed in somewhat similar circumstances, and who have acted as the Prime Minister has, and, fortunately, these men did not all occupy very high places in JOHN FORREST -The Opposition public life. The Prime Ministeri n The Casef o r Labour saidT h a t was not the I do not for a moment deny a man's right to change his opinion. I only deny his right to break his word, solemnly given to his fellow citizens. If he, finds, after election, that he can no longer conscientiously support those' measures to which he is pledged his course is quite clear. Let him, before such measures I am taking the are put. to the test, resign his seat and contest the electorate upon his changed opinions. If returned, he can with honour do that which he desires; but he cannot, and ought Every Governor General the not to be allowed to do this until the people to whom he pledged himself have formally and constitutionally ratified his change of front. I could have understood the right honourable gentleman taking such a-line of conduct if the Ministry had sought a I do not desire ratification of their conduct by the electors; if they had resigned their seats and gone to their constituents, and said, "" He r e is the position in which we find ourselves. Are you prepared to r a t if y our conduct?"" That would have been the act of honourable men; but not one Minister,suggested that they should, take up any such attitude. An American writer dealing with American political history says in his bookThe life of a political party . . . is maintained by a scheme of subterfuges in which the moral law cuts ho figure . . . but one law, success. In referring to a prominent American politician, he says:Honest and dishonest-crue l and tendergreat and meana party leader who scorned public opiniona man of conviction; yet the most unscrupulous politician--"" a philosopher who preached the equality of man, yet a tyrant who hated the world and despised all men. I invite honourable members to read in our Parliamentary Library a book by Lord George Hamilton, entitled Parliamentary Reminiscences and Reflections. stone, saysIf you believed in him he became a parliamentary super-man-if you suspected him or detected him in what yon believed to be tricks, then dislike rapidly hardened into repulsion and wholesale distrust. Soi t came to pass that, no statesman has, as supporters, a more devotedclientele, or as antagonists, more irreconcilable opponents. The latter group was constantly augmented by colleagues who left him on his riot too infrequent abandonment of his previous principles, and their place was taken by political recruits representing the recently enfranchised and less advanced sections of political thought.",56,Williamirvine T H A T Is Time That Is A Suggestion W H I C H I Ven

We have, for instance, the remarkable statement by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Fowler) The greatest concern is how long is Australia going to allow this calamitous mountebank Hughes to thrust ber face in the gutter. the remarkable attacks on the Prime Minister and his party by his life-long political friends in New South Wales, in the persons of MrH a l l , Mr Beeby, and Mr Holman. the view expressed by Mr Holman, who saysI have long known that Mr Hughes is a man whose pledged word is absolutely worthless, but I confess I am amazed and depressed to find that the whole of his colleagues have joined him in this exploit. I can only attribute it in certain cases to a sense of mistaken loyalty to a man who has never been loyal to anybody or anything. proving sin, all right. standard of political morality that he has set up-that being the estimation in which the Prime Minister is held by men who have been intimately associated with him all his political life-ho w can we expect the general public to do other than share that opinion ? The feeling in Australia to-day is that our standard of political morality has been so lowered by this subterfuge on the part of Ministers in retaining office that one is led to wonder whether anything influences their conduct save fche desire to maintain themselves in their positions, and to keep themselves comfortable. I notice that in the resolutions carried by the National party two things were evidently borne in mind, first, that on no account wns the Official Labour party to have a chance of forming a Government, and secondly, that there should be no dis-. solution. The first was a calamity When I asked h i m which w is to be opposed by every possible nreans, and the second embodied oue of the reasons which the Governor General submitted as actuating him in It does not his refusal to commission the Leader of the Opposition to form a Cabinet.

151,I Intend To Quote Only Mr Finlayson,"No . Now that Ido not desire for a moment to minimize thc seriousness of the position in Europe. No honorahle member can view, w i th anything approaching complacency, the situation as we find it to-day. After three aud a half years of war we have still to Confess that we have not made the progress which we feel we ought to have made with the resources at our command. I do not think that we are out of the wood yet. I believe that there is still a long road and a hard road before the Allies. While some of the statements concerning the position of the Central Powers may be exaggerated, I believe that they yet possess heavy reserves of power, and that there is a good deal of hard, solid, serious work before the Allied Eorces. But I am f a r from believing tliat the position is as serious as the Prime Minister would have us believe. In his speech at Bendigo on 12th November, the right honourable gentleman saidIf Bussia were to withdraw it would give the enemy a crushing superiority in numbers long before the power of America could make itself felt. And how would it fare with the British and French armies ? . . . In face of the latest news of the internal conditions of Russia and of the Italian debacle, who shall say that the tide of battle has not turned against the Allies? . . . Never since the war began has the position been graver? . . . You stand now in grave danger. . . . The situation . . . is black with portents of evil. That was repeated by his Ministers and members of the party, and by speakers on that side on the conscription issue, almost at every meeting. Senator Millen, at Brisbane, on 3rd December, saidUp to the present the tide of war had gone with their ' opponents. Up to the present Germany was neither' broken nor beaten. . . The Minister for the Navy( Mr Joseph Cook), on 19th November, at Chatswood, statedBut yesterday and every prospect seemed fair. To-day the barometer is set stormy. The war clouds are lower and much more threatening. The tide of battle sets against us. The Postmaster-General( Mr Webster), at Bundaberg, on l l t h December stones and dead cats? his "" s to n y "" experience. His statement wasTo-day they were standing on the brink of a volcano. . . . The war situation was never so black. . . The position in Europe to-day was blacker than a*t any other period in the war, and that was from thc stand-point of the Allies, whose position was critical and fraught with more danger than ever before. The Minister for Works and Railways( MrW a t t ) , at Sydney, on 12th December, saidThe present position was as black as it well nigh could be. The cables that came to the Australian Government were blacker still. The war position was pregnant with possibilities of irretrievable disaster to the Allied nations. It is remarkable that the New Zealand Times characterized Mr Watt's statement, "" The present position was as black as it well nigh could be,"" as an untruth, an electioneering indiscretion employed to influence votes for conscription. The New Zealand Minister for Defence went further and said, "" The Australian Government could not have received information from the Imperial authorities which would not have also been sent to the New Zealand Government, and nothing similar to what MrW a t t said had come to New Zealand."" ' I do not believe tlie Government had any authority to make these statements; neither do I believe that they were correct. I do not believe this Government is in possession of any more information than any other Government, or that they know any more than tlie public about the war situation. When Mr Holman, the Premier of New South Wales, was recently in London, he was banqueted at the House of Commons. Mr Bonar Law, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, made some very nice references to the part Australia had played in the war, and Mr Holman, in reply to tlie toast of his health, made a statement to this effect, "" I appeal to the Imperial Government to take the Dominions more into their confidence We have a right to know more of the position of affairs in Europe, but we are being kept in the dark. Australia, that has done so well, has a right to be told exactly what the position is, and what the aims of the Allies are."" The London Times reported that Mr. Hodge, the Minister for Labouri n the Imperial Government, dramatically rose and said, "" I can assure Mr Holman that he knows as much about the war as we do. I am a member of the Imperial Cabinet, but I know no more about it than Mr Holman does.""

Sir William Robertson made the following announcement, which was reported in the newspapers on the 10th DecemberThis year wo have taken from the Germans more prisoners and more men, and four times as many guns, as wo have lost to them during the whole of this war. A newspaper published in the Old Country stated on the 29th November, 1917We feel it in our bones that the end is uot far off, nnd bid our countrymen and our Allies take heart of grace. There is enough food in Germany to last out for a few months longer, but ammunition is running short; the best of the Army is already killed or maimed; money is tight; thc crews of the Fleets are restless and almost mutinous; the civilian population is becoming impatient. An early end to the war is clearly written on the wall. Yes, the end is in sight. I have a statement made by General Smuts, a member of the Imperial War Cabinet, and cabled from London on 18th September. the exact position of affairs, and his word can be taken witli absolute confidence. This is what he saidCan any one doubt the growing feelings of terror which possess Germany as she sees the nations range themselves side by side against her? Her food problem is becoming daily more and more acute, her economic future hopelessly compromised, and her name more and more detested. To-day the Allies bad won, and the Germans knew it. Germany's military victories in the East cannot outweigh lier defeat in a world sense. Here are two quotations with regard to Italy, one published in a newspaper on 8th December, containing a statement by SignorN it t i , the Italian Ministerf or Finance, tliat, "" If Italy receives sufficient artillery and ammunition victory is certain;"" and another, published on 10th December, containing a statement by I shall deal with General Diaz, Commander-in-Chief of the On the same day Italian Army, that "" The morale of the Italian troops is splendid, and they are absolutely confident of victory."" Here He is the suppressed cable, dated London, 10th December, sent out by G. L . Gilmour, the special correspondent for tlie Australian and New Zealand Press Association, who, after visiting the Front, saidThe Australian Forces to-day are scattered from the coast to the front line trenches. Two days later it was pubSince the fighting of Passchendaele, the Australians and New Zealanders have had an easier time. The men never were more fit. They have obtained a considerable amount of leave to visit England or Paris. Football has now , become an obsession. They play Rugby and Australian Rules, and Soccer, and the results of the inter-battalion contests are almost of as much consequence to the men as the latest wireless communique from the Cambrai Sector. Between football and drill the men are not long idle. The New Zealanders especially arc at home in the present weather conditions. They are happily placed in pleasant surroundings remote from tlie lighting line, and are billeted in villages. Since the referendum was taken the annual report of Sir Douglas Haig, dealing with the operations for 1917, has been published. In it he saysTherefore, without reckoning the possibilities which were opened up by the gains in Flanders, and without considering thc effects in the other theatres, there is every reason to he' satisfied with the results achieved.

Mir. BOYD -Excus e me, I did, from the beginning of the war. able member, put an interpretation upon Mr Fisher's manifesto which the Labour party did not put upon it , and do not put upon it now. Something must have happened in London to have caused Mr Hughes on his return to become a conscriptionist. I notice that the English Labour Leader, on 14th September, 1916, saidI t is quite evident that before the notorious Mr Hughes, of Australia, left this country, he and Mr Lloyd George concocted a little plot, by which Mr Lloyd George was to assist Mr known to be content to do anything he : Hughes in establishing the Prussian military system in the great democratic community of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition referred to the Prime Minister having been forced by the action taken by the honourable member for Flinders( Sir William Irvine) to propose a second referendum on conscription, and in replying to that, the right honourable gentleman saidThose who knew him would know that he had never allowed himself to be driven by any man. I can remember one or two instances which are opposed to that statement. When Mr Fisher, who was then Prime Minister, was in SouthA f r i c a , and Mr Hughes was. in charge of the Government here, a number of members on hie own side, led by the late Mr Roberts, the then member for Adelaide, proposed an amendment in the DefenceB ill . Honourable members who were here will remember that the moment the amendment, was carried against the Government Mr Hughes reported progress on the B ill . During the dinner adjournment he summoned a meeting of the Caucus and demanded to know where he was. result of that meeting he came down here after the dinner adjournment, and, like a littl e lamb, allowed the amendment to go through. But he was never driven by any man! I can remember that on another occasion he came to a Caucus meeting and tried to induce us to withdraw a certain B ill . He pleaded w i th us to withdraw it , and pointed out how bad it would be. The Caucus said, "" No, we, are going on w i th that B ill , "" and Mr. Hughes came down from the Caucus room to his chair at the table and made a splendid speech in favour of the B ill he had opposed upstairs Yet he was never driven by any man! When he came back from London, he said to the Caucus, ' ' I believe that conscription is the only and the proper policy to The n the honorpursue."" The Caucus said "" No . "" Mr. Hughes, we are told, was never driven by any man, but after some private consultations' with a few Ministers and some members of the party, he came to the Caucus next day w i th a compromise proposal for a referendum. the party meeting to the referendum. This is the man who was never driven by any one, and who was never did not want to do. To impose conscription was the one thing which, more than any other, he desired to do, but when he could not induce the Caucus to agree to conscription he submitted the compromise proposal for the referendum, which has caused all the trouble and strife throughout the country. in the Caucus room supported him came down here, and when they learned what the crowd outside were saying, went back on him. orable gentleman says about that the better. , they would not leave the room with him -afterwards did so. who are with the Prime Minister now were strongly against conscriotion at first, but agreed to the referendum, and subsequently became whole-hearted conscriptionists. Whatever may have been the inducements held out to Mr Hughes in London, and whatever truth there may As a be in ""the rumours as to the arrangement made for a quid pro quo, it is quite certain, as f a r as it is possible to judge without knowledge of the actual facts, that 'tlie Ministers who changed their minds on the conscription question also received some promises in the .shape of an extra term of office or something of that kind .

209,Dr. Maloney,"I ask the honourable member -for Darling Downs, who is, I believe, a religious man, to look into this question and see if this lying can be prevented. How could I do otherwise than hope that the power of one who would utter the vile and terrible words recorded in Munsey's Magazine for October last would be utterly destroyed 1 Speaking to bis soldiers that blood-thirsty scoundrel who sits on the Hohenzollern throne saidYou have sworn loyalty to me; this means, children of my God, that you are now my soldiers, that you have given yourselves up to mo, body and soul; there is for you but one enemy, that is my enemy. In view of the present socialistic agitation it may come to pass that I shall command you to shoot down your own relatives, your brothers, yes, your parent?-whic h God forbid-bu t even then you must follow iny commands without a murmur. How could any one, knowing how I love Australia and hate and loathe Prussianism and Prussian militarismI was taught by a rebel who l e f t Prussia in 1848, one who would not permit any Kaiser to rule if he had the power to prevent it-as k me to sign an address of welcome to such a beast? We blame the German Emperor for having torn up a scrap of paper, but he tore it up in order to get at his enemies, whereas the little Kaiser of Australia for the time being has torn up his pledge, not one given to his enemies, but one which was given not to his own countrymen, but to Australians; and every Australian has the right to demand that the pledge shall be kept. If politicians are to be known as pledge-breakers I am sorry for the future. Here let me quote from Pa.n-Britannic Imperialism, by Walter Eves WisnerThe destiny of Canada for many years was in the hands of a French Roman Catholic Prime Minister, and that of South Africa in the hands of a Dutch general, who, but recently, had fought against the' British with all the might of shot and shell. Both will go down in history as among the greatest of their day; both have upheld and administered British institutions, supremely honest in purpose and lionorable in intention; both have enhanced the glory of the country giving them power. Why, then, should an Irishman fail? Nobody has the right to condemn a man until he has received a trust and failed in it ; the Irishman has not yet been given the chance to fail or make good, and British fair play demands that every man shall have a turn. . . The trust reposed in a Dutch South African did not prevent Dutch wrong mindedness from finding expression, and from being subdued by Dutch right-mindedness, to which is added the Dutch gift to the Empire of German South and East Africa. So, too, will Irish right-mindedness prevail if given a chance. There he refers to the loyalty of the Boers. It was one of the brightest pages in English history when the. Mother Country, having the Boers helpless, gave them their freedom. In return the Boers have given England German South and German EastA f r i c a . Quoting again from the same publicationDare we, the ancestors of Britannic posterity, so ^besmirch the valour of our re-united living and our Imperial dead by handing down as a record of Empire that we were unable to be patient with each other, to trust each other, and to consent with each other to right the wrongs of Imperial chaos, whilst'yet we took our individual and our Imperial lives in our hands to right the wrongs of Belgium, ofServia, and of Montenegro? Men of that Britannic Empire which is not! You can do it in live years; you can delay it for fifty years; you can make it never. Buti t w ill come. Why cannot we get the whole-hearted support of the great Irish ratce, not only in America, but even in Australia? Of t times they have volunteered to fight in the wars of the United Kingdom, and I hope to see them fighting again for the great Allied nations of the northern seas. I hope none of them will be swayed by lies coming from those who may desire German success. But why has not tlie promise and pledge made to the Irish by the British Parliament been kept? If it had been kept it would have released 35,000 Irish constabulary and 53,000 other men, and there would have been no need of the icry for the services of the few million in Australia. I may, remembering the words of General Smuts, say: Let us hope that a civilization will rise from the carnage of blood and murder men call war that w ill destroy the power of despots, whether kings, kaisers, or czars, to make human beings become mad with the curse of the murder and rapine of war; and I hope that civilization will be willing and able to pay as much to save infan t life, to educate the young, to keep old age from want, and to eliminate poverty as it now spends upon war to destroy man at his most useful period of life. Workers die in their thousands where the aristocrats perhaps die in their tens. I am blamed because I would, ask for the lives of the Kaiser and of all the kinglets and princes of Germany who caused this war, but when Joshua invaded the Holy Land he had ten kings out to the sword. We are told that we are n o l making any suggestions. I make one suggestion here in the direction of economy. We have two sets of income tax officers, State and Pederal, -and two sets of land tax offices, State an'd Federal. Why cannot we adopt the suggestion of the Conference of Premiers which resolved on the 12th December, 1916That, in the opinion of this Conference, the Commonwealth Government and tlie Governments of the several States shall direct their leading taxation officers to meet at an early date and prepare a uniform scheme for(a) Income tax (rates excepted). (I)) Land tax (rates excepted). (c) Probate duties (rates excepted). Tliat the Conference reaffirms the desirability of uniform valuation for Commonwealth ancl State purposes being adopted as early as practicable, .and that the necessary legislative and administrative steps in that direction be taken by the States. That conference affirmed, amongst other thingsThat the system of computation of income tax, as embodied in the Commonwealth Income Tax Act, is too complicated for the ordinary taxpayer, and it is desirable that a "" simple progressive rate be adopted."" These recommendations, if adopted, would save a good deal of expense and trouble to every citizen who has to submit an income tax or land tax return. Anybody who has had experience with the readyreckoner that has been issued showing the complicated way in which the Commonwealth land and income taxes are made up, will agree with the recommendation regarding the computation of income tax, and I sincerely hope that it will be adopted. I strongly policy. commencement of the war to the present and, by a concentration of their defensive moment, we have not built as many boats, the Allies could efficiently safeships to carry away the food that is guard the journey from the eastern coast rotting and mice-infested throughout country as little Tasmania used to build ing the average voyage, could then take as in' the their intelligence? Government of having been lax in regard to shipbuildthat have to be taken, the voyage to Enging. I desire to issue a warning in regard land occupies now about eight to ten to the steamer John Murray, which was weeks. recently renovated. That vessel, tlie Loch Byan, is one of the oldest of the so that a ship could travel that route Loch liners. much younger than the Jolm Dr. Moloney. was used as a collier, and was lost between Newcastle and Wellington, with considerable sacrifice of life. By my voice and pen I warned the Government against two ships, the Rio and Volador, and both were wrecked, although, fortunately, without loss of life. I am afraid that if the John Murray encounters bad weather or heavy seas she may hot reach California. The vessel should never have lef t Hobson's Bay.. Whilei t was a training ship in charge of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Boyd), it did splendid work for the boys of Melbourne, and I am sorry it has been taken from that service. Instead of allowing our wheat to rot and be destroyed by mice, we should take steps to grist it into flour, and the offal could be used in stock raising, as suggested by Mr Hagelthorn. Two thousand lbs. of flour is the equivalent of 3,000 lbs. of wheat, and that means that two ships laden with flour would equal in foodstuffs value three ships laden with wheat. In that way we should effect an economy of 33J per cent, in our shipping. A vessel can make two and a half voyages from Sydney to San Francisco in the same time as is occupied on the voyage from Australia to Plymouth or London. ' If there were a saving of only 50 per cent., in time we could do with one ship the same work as is done by two ships travelling on the old route from Australia to London. Moreover, the journey across the Pacific is perfectly safe, but there is danger from submarines and mines as soon as a vessel passes the Cape of Good Hope or enters the Red Sea. By following the Sydney-San Francisco route, the cargoes of foodstuffs would be safe advocate a shipbuilding across the Pacific and across the United It is an infamy that, from the States, a further distance of 3,500 miles, the of America to Europe. One ship makr fifties. Have Australians lost much produce in the same time as six I accuse the present ships making the longer voyage from Meland preceding Governments bourne to London. W it h the precautions The average voyage across the formerly Atlantic occupies only seven to eight days, The Loch Lomond, a ship seven times as against one voyage from Murray, Melbourne to England by the longer route. Our shipping, if regulated in that way, would render great assistance to the Allies. In 1912 I made a suggestion that a system of patriotic finance should be instituted, commencing with the conversion of the State debts. figures were checked by keen accountants, that at least £20,000,000 could be saved in this way, and I suggested that Australia should make a g if t of that sum to the Homeland. I prophesied that the money spinners in the United Kingdom) almost the greatest financial kings of the universe,would immediately say that the stock issued by the Commonwealth would be a far greater security than the stock issued by a State. We should be carrying out the old idea of Euclid that the whole is always greater than a part. Moreover, they -would say that that money should be spent in the building of warships for the defence of the British' flag and the B r i tish race, to protect the trade routes of the Empire, and thus insure that Britain would be able to import her food requirements. people^^he can stand four-square against all the -world, but if anything should Interfere with her food supplies, Britain may go down. I proposed that scheme as one way in which we could show our loyalty and love of the Motherland. A t that time both fche Age and the Argus were warning us of Germany's ambitions. The publication of my views resulted in letters of commendation being sent to me from members of the House of Lords, the Houseof Commons, the Admiral of the Australian station, and many other distinguished persons. I have here a quotation from a statement made by Mr Bonar Law, Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, in criticism of admissions that had been made by Mr Churchill. He saidTen years ago we not only liad the command of the sea, but we had ""the command of every sea. What is the position now? We have the ooramand of no sea in the world except the North Sea at this moment. Houorable members will share the joy I feel in the knowledge that Britain's long grey coursers of the sea are protecting, not only Australia, but the whole of the liberties of the world. Just as Rome, when the heart of Italy was attacked, had tb call in her far-flung legions to protect it , so Britain has had to recall her Fleets from , not. only the eastern seas, but our seas, to do duty in the North Sea, the most terrible in the world. There to-day Britain, I am glad to say, is stronger and greater than ever she was in the possession of those terrible engines of destruction with which to protect the world's liberties. I estimated, and my In speaking in this House on 28th August, 1912, I said-au d it is as true to-day as it was then-that The seat of the British Empire is in Europe. The heart of the race is in tlie capital of the English world. If that be injured or destroyed, then aU our hopes and ideals, the greatest the. world has seen, must sink into the gloom of oblivion, and the world be the poorer, that pur civilization, with all its wider life and greater opportunities, was strangled ere it had a chance. I glory too much, in my Australia to share the view of the honourable member for Flinders( Sir William Irvine) that ifc occupies a disgraceful and pitiable position because of the people's honest and honourable vote against conscription. The honourable member, because of that vote, declares in his autocratic and oligarchical way that it is "" disgraced and disAs long as Britain can feed her honoured."" One wonders why he does not go to the home of his birth, and induce it to accept conscription. His wonderful eloquence, perhaps, might have effect there. He has been very eloquent when speaking at public meetings held in town halls to which admission could be obtained only by ticket. We could not hire a town hall, but when the honourable member aoplied for such a building it was at once placed at his disposal. If he loves the land from which he came, let him go back to it and try to persuade its people to adopt conscription. As the honourable member is present, I shall repeat the statement. I then made in his absence, that I do not know of his having ever spoken from any voluntary enlisting platform, nor do ,1 know that he has offered his services to his couno t r y , or offered this country the use of his money free of interest. We have raised by way of war loans over £100,000,000, but, so far as I know, a sum of only £1,120 has been loaned to the Commonwealth free of interest. We know that England needs food. There rabbits are selling at 5s., whereas we have here millions of rabbits, which are spoken of as "" vermin,"" and are being poisoned. Nemesis always follows the destruction of a good and healthy food. I do not know that, weight for weight, a rabbit is not as valuable as a sheep to-day if consideration be taken of the value of its the cultivation of foodstuffs. .

A most ridiculous fact in Australia is that a horse, worth about £20, cost the Government between £200 and £300; and, further, there was an "" honorary "" organizer for one of the charities at a salary of £500 a year. In addition, we have had frauds on the Government connected with phantom regiments, while widows and children have had to wait long for the money necessary for their support. honourable member for Plinders, with all his legal knowledge, found it a very difficult task to whitewash the crowd opposite; in fact, it was not a whitewash, but a zebra effect-a sort of cam'.ouflage. As to the future, why should we not have another vote of the people in order to elect ten men to carry on the war in dependently of the members of the Government, in whom I have no confidence. In my opinion, there were two honest men in the Government, who would not have broken their pledge had it not been for their loyalty to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet; but there is a greater loyalty, and that is loyalty to Australia and its people. The present Government have crept into power under the stolen name of the ""Win-the-war party,"" and fche Director of Recruiting was man enough to say that if he had the power h'e would punish them for doing so. Is there any one in Parliament, or outside, who does not desire to win the war ? If there is such a man, then I have a quarrel with him. \ The Prime Minister has said that Australia cries for bslp in the shape of conscription of human l if e ; but we do not hear anything about a vote of the people I recommended in regard to conscription of wealth, for which I think there would be even a bigger majority than in fche case of the last referendum.

220,Dr. Maloney,"T h a t in fche Ageland he would be called upon to oay State and Federal income tax, State and Federal land tax, and a super-tax. But under existing conditions, owing to the action of tlie Ministry of the day, so long as his money is invested in our war loans, he is exempted from this taxation. I hold that this condition of affairs must be altered. There is an old proverb in China that one must endeavour to save his face, just as the honourable member for Flinders has endeavoured to-day to save his face, notwithstanding that the Ministry have broken their pledge. The alteration might be effected when the war has ended by giving notice that all sums in excess of £1,000 or £5,000 invested by individuals who are not willing that their income from .our war loans should be taxed, should be returned to them on a certain date. I come now to the question of war profits. I do not think any Liberal Premier of Victoria w ill ever again issue a list such as that which I hold in my handa list comprising the names of 265 individuals, firms, or companies who pay income tax. Some of these individuals, firms, or companies have made in profits during war time more than £100,000 a year in excess of the profits made by them in peace time. One firm made in 1916 more than £100,000 in excess of the profits which it made i u 1914. These firms in 1915 made £412,888 in excess of the profits of the previous year, whilst in 1916 they made a profit of £1,521,000. I have always maintained that after allowing business men a profit, say, of 10 per cent, or their average profit for the three pre-war years, the balance should revert to the State. That would prevent the unjust raising of -the prices of foodstuffs, or the accumulation of war profits which takes place in waT time. Anybody who makes undue profits during war time is an enemy of Australia .just, as much as are our foes at the Front. I recognise that there are many persons in the community who honestly desire to encourage voluntary recruiting. circumstances what' oan be done? recently,, under one roof in the Sydney Town Hall, men were enlisted a3 strike breakers day. risk their lives. Yet the soldiers leaving our shores to fight for these Dr. Maloney. breakers receive only 5s. per day, with Is. per day deferred pay. Seeing that the remuneration of the strike breakers was fixed by the capitalists themselves at 15s. per day, surely the nav of our soldiers should be increased to that amount. How can we expect the fathers of families who are in receipt of 14s., 15s., and 16s. per day to go to the Front for 5s. per day? Pour shillings of this last-named sum is allotted to the wives who are left behind, and an additional 4^d. is paid on account of each child under sixteen years of age. What a paltry pittance. I wish to God the Governor General and the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) had to feed their children on 4£d. per day. But the common soldiers' children receive that amount. Then the families get a little assistance from the patrioticisocieties, and if they only chance to know a few of the members of those organizations things go along smoothly enough. I hope that the Democracy of Australia will some day declare that the private shall receive the same pay as the officer. Give the Commander-in-Chief £100 a year more if you like, but pay him only the same pension. What are the pensions given to our privates ? I desire to impress upon honourable members that in, the Defence Department we pay a hundred men salariesin excess of that received by the Commander-in-Chief of the Swiss Armyi n war time, although he has under him 300,000 men. We also pay fifteen men more than Count von ' Moltke received when he led the victorious Prussians, 1,500,000 strong, into France and conquered it . I have here one of these laws-for anything that will cause me to be fined or imprisoned for breaking it is a law, whether it is called a regulation or anything else-providin g that a major-general shall receive £1,200 a year. Above the major-general is a lieutenant-general who, I suppose, would receive £200 more, or about £ 2 8 per week. Above him is a general, who, I suppose, would receive about £ 3 0 per week. However, to speak In such from the book, I note that a' majorQuite general gets £ 2 4 per week and also a field allowance of 15s. per day, for seven days in a week, making £ 2 9 5s. in all. at the rate of los. per I ask, as I asked the people outside, could They were not called upon to not his wife save a good deal of money from that £24 per week? Is she not strike much better able to save than the -wife of John Brown on 5s. per day? Why should there be such a difference? Have they not each one soul and one body ? We shall never have a democratic Army unti l all ranks are clothed, fed, and paid the same, giving the commanderin-chief a little more. I hope the curse of military government will be ended with this war. All old-age pensioners, no matter what they have been in previous years, can claim only the same amount. The same applies to invalid pensioners, and women in their hour of trial, when they claim the maternity allowance for the. God-given g if t of motherhood, can receive only the same allowance. If you want to crush down the military system, let the power of the people always be dominant. WhetherI have been on this orthe other side of the House, I havo always asked if the civil power was dominant over the military power. I asked that when Mr Fisher was /in control, and I was always told' that it was. If we were not certain, we moved amendments to make it so. All those pledges have been broken, not by Mr Fisher, but by his successor. Can any honourable member quote me a single instance in Melbourne where the widow of a man who has made the supreme sacrifice of his life at the Front has been given a house free of rent 1 In one case only was an amount sufficient for the purpose given, and that was raised by the kindness of neighbours. But in Sydney, according to the Melbourne Herald of 29th July last, there were 300 widows in their own little fourroomed brick cottages, some of them at Daceyville, at the nominal charge of Is. per year as long as they lived or remained widows. W h y is that not done in ""Victoria or the other States? same article shows that in cases where there are no houses for them their rents are paid for them. There are half-adozen places in New South Wales wliere the widows of soldiers are being looked after. What has been done in Victoria? The Victorian Government dismissed 200 returned soldiers from the Bailwav Department. W ill that help recruiting? W ill that encourage all the men who meet and talk to them to go to the' Front? Some time ago I asked the Assistant In view of the present alleged unsatisfactory position of returned soldiers, will the Prime Minister arrange so that they shall receive pay until they are permanently settled on the land or provided for. in some other occupation ? The answer wasThe question as to action to be taken in the case of returned soldiers after discharge is now under the consideration of the Government, and is being dealt with in connection with the general question of repatriation which will shortly be submitted for the consideration of Parliament. That was a long time ago, but nothing has been done. Then there were promises made by big companies to reinstate men in their positions on return. I believe the Commonwealth Bank has been guilty of breaking' promises of that kind. I asked that the names of the firms who had broken their word to soldiers should be displayed at the post-offices for the people to read. I am sure that 99 out of every 100 Australians, if they read that a firm had not kept its promise to a soldier when he returned, would take their custom elsewhere. My suggestion would have been a good way to punish firms of that kind, but perhaps it was too drastic for the Prime Minister to adopt-a t any rate, he could not see his way clear to do it . Now, as to the way some men have been treated. According to a petition presented to this House, twenty-four or twenty-five men, all of whom had been to the Pront, were punished severely.. One was charged w i th joining in a meeting, and with disobedience of an order. The sentence was eighteen months' hard labour; but that is very mild compared with some of the others which follow. Another private, charged with' being absent without leave, and w i th in subordinate language to a non-commissioned officer, was sentenced to three The years' penal servitude. Another, charged w i th disobeying an order, bad language, and escaping from custody, was given five years' penal servitude. And so tlie merry list goes on-merr y as h e l l ! Another concrete example: According to an article reprinted in the Sydneyv Morning Herald of 22nd 'March, 1917, certain men were sent into the desert in Egypt with three days' supply of water to build a railway. They finished the water in a day and a half, aud when they could not get water for the balance of the three days, they ceased the work. They were court-martialled, and sentenced to terms ranging from two or five",70,Williamirvine T H A T Is Time That Is A Suggestion W H I C H I Ven

""Dr. member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) tried to prove that that was a wrong statement; but his speech, after all, was only an acknowledgment of the facts.

What about the officers who, in uniform, and against the law-and they should understand the law-attende d a meeting to destroy any chance of Colonel Crouch speaking? officer I have referred to was not an Australian, but, like the honourable member for Flinders, came from another place. Tlie only period in history that I can compare our times with is that of England under Walpole, and I would like to remind the honourable member for Flinders that the vote of the people on this referendum clearly indicates that the wisdom of the electors is greafer than that of any chance Ministry owing its position to a chance majority. The people who pay have the right to say how the money shall be spent, and I shall never be content until they have the initiative and recall, not by permission of this Parliament, but T h a t is a total misas their right under the Constitution. I shall never be content unti l they have out of every 100 electors to declare any seat vacant. When they have that privi lege we shall not have the spectacle of Ministry and membersbreaking their sacred pledges made to the people. I believe that if the honourable member for Flinders has his way we would have conscription to-morrow, and I remember how he robbed every man in tlie State Public Service of a portion of his citizenship. But I also remember how that proposal was thrown out unanimously by both Houses. mains.

We have been told that France has beenbled white, but on the other hand I learned from perhaps the best in formed American that has ever come to Australia that the TJnited States has over 1,000,000 men in England and France. In the latter country, I understand, the American recruits now total 960,000. It will be remembered that He was turned out under Reguwhen General Joffre proceeded to America What as a commission, after tbe declaration of war, he advised the United States Government to send their recruits to France at once in order that they might be trained in the theatre of war.

The other side could not even let this man alone. I have here a sworn declaration by the father of Lieutenant Jacka, dated 27th October, 1916, in whicli he statesI have read what appears to be a letter to the Argus to-day from Reg. W;.

The only Turnbull in Wedderburn is Walter Turnbull, a butcher, who is childless. I believe the letter said to have been received by Reg. W. Turnbull to be a fabrication,'made for the purpose of improperly influencing votes in favour of conscription. Mr Jacka made this solemn declaration in such a way as to render himself liable for perjury if what he stated were proved the Australian not to be true, and he subsequently addressed public meetings from the 6th December, 1917, to the 12th of that month, in support of the statement he made. This man has other brave sons at the Pront. Yet the conscriptionists could not help lying, even about those who had so distinguished themselves.

245,Mr Blakeley,"I do not careThose words were very plain. No sidestepping; no backing or filling can get away from what they mean. They did not mean going out one door and coming in another. They meant just what they were intended to mean; and I believe that when he made those pledges, the Prime Minister intended to ..keep them. In a very unhappy speech this afternoon the honourable member for Flinders( Sir William Irvine), torn between loyalty to himself and duty to his party, did not make his position clear in his attempt to excuse himself and his party, though, if any man in this Parliament should make his position clear, it is the honourable member, o Speaking at Wagga on the 28th November, he saidThe Government have made a definite and welcome assertion of' the principle of Government responsibility in an issue vital to our national honour and safety. No other course would have been possible. ment say, in effect, "" You must choose between our party with conscription and the Official Labour party without conscription."" In that pledge the Government must, not be allowed to stand alone. All members sitting behind the Government, are bound by it in honour, or they cease to be Government supporters. Hence, no Ministry can be formed on the National side of the House which will attempt to carry on government without conscription. It is clear, therefore, that, should the electors from any of the motives that may actuate them, decline the responsibility of sanctioning conscription by a direct vote, one of two things must happen-eithe r the government of this country must be handed to the Tudor party, or the National party in Parliament must take tbe f u l l responsibility of its policy, even should he has not ceased to be that which both that necessitate an appeal to the constituents in the ordinary manner provided by the Constitution. admit that the opinion of the honourable member for Flinders does not bind the party ? thought he was the only honest and honourable man in the National party. I have no desire to make a personal attack upon the honourable member for Flinders, but I desire to say something of his conduct as a public man, and the awful dissension, -bitterness, loss, and victimization that the honourable gentleman has caused during his term in public life. other men in the community of kindred natures, who stand aloof and cold from everything and everybody and go blundering on, caring nothing for the harm which may hefall those who stand in their way. ' [lib] In 1902, the honourable' member, who was then Attorney-General in the Victorian Parliament, passed a Coercion Act which brought about such a state of affairs in Victoria that the State has not yet recovered from the effects of what he did. In 1914 he was mainly responsible for the double dissolution of the Federal ParT liament over the question of preference to unionists. He had no small hand in the conscription referendum of 1916, and he had a very big hand in the referendum of 1917. Not once has he been on the right track. But within a couple of months he will be urging the National party to enforce conscription without reference to the people at all. ' Sir WILLI AM IRVINE -Does not the honourable member think it is enough to condemn my past faults without predicting my future? member has been very unfortunate in respect of every public matter he has supported, and his career shows clearly that he does not understand what the Austra-"" lian people need or desire, or what they will tolerate. Every matter of importance that has been advocated by the honourable member for Flinders has been rejected by the people. Until recently the best that people could say of the honourable member was that he was honest in his intentions, but his speech to-day, vague and indefinite as it was, made one wonder whether his friends and enemies thought him. I should like to know where the honourable member stands, and whether he intends to support the National party. No matter how much he may claim that he could not during the campaign attack the party of -which he was a member, he must accept responsibility for the introduction of government by the Prime Minister and Government Printer and the attempted incarceration of public men. I believe that a number of people voted and advocated conscription for ulterior and vile motives. It has been alleged that we have in the Labour party and supporting us all ""tbo Sinn There are many Feiners, all the Industrial' Workers of the World, all the disloyalists, all the pro-Germans, and all the enemies of Australia, Great Britain,"" the Allies, and civilization.

248,The Govern,"Mr BLAKELEY The honorableconscription including, at least, one honourable member who is not present to-night are men who desired the introduction of conscription as a means of getting cheap labour. If that is not their desire their actions at least justify that suspicion. ferendum campaign I travelled the whole of the western part of New South Wales, and I found that every station, with rare exceptions, fro m Nyngan westward,, employed. Chinamen, and every squatter who employed Chinameni n preference to white men and . returned soldiers was a conscriptionist. ing to the Labour Ministeri n New South Wales( Mr Beeby), there were over 300 returned soldiers in that State who wanted work, and Mr Beeby supplicated those patriotic employers almost on bended knees, "" For God's sake, give work to these returned soldiers."" they preferred Chinamen. tria l Workers of the World or disloyalists Worse than such men ? the Government benches an honourable member who employs Chinamen on his :8tation. in preference to returned soldiers, but the fact remains that he does not employ returned soldiers. that tlie same man offered work to members of your union, and they declined it . for him any number of men, up to 100, if he would pay white men's wages, but . he cannot get returned soldiers to work On a Chinaman's wage. 'expect white men to be content with a pound of rice and a shot crow once a week. If conscription was advocated only in order that black and brown labour might be brought into the western country, and probably into other parts of Victoria and New South Wales, it is no wonder that the people voted against that policy. you to deny that tlie honourable member to whom you refer offered work to other men. when he made the offer there were men in the town of Warren who were willing and competent to take his work provided he would pay a living wage, ber's statement w ill be challenged, so he may as well give the facts. cannot be challenged. An y man in the west of New South Wales wbo will pay proper wages can get men. When patriotic squatocracy employs' Chinamen on its stations in preference to returned During the resoldiers, is there any wonder that there is bitterness in our midst and suspicion of everything the National party advocates? Honourable members opposite must accept their responsibility for this state of affairs. In the district of Byrock, taking into account the youngest babe A t that time, accordand the oldest inhabitant, there are 140 white souls. Surrounding the district are quite a large number of stations owned by patriots and flag-flappers who visit the "" local railway station to cheer and "" Godsave"" departing recruits, and who, on the back trip , probably, take five or ten But Chinamen w i th them. A t no time can A r e Indusone .travel on that western train without seeing, it may be six, ten, or twenty There sits on Chinese, either travelling up the line or returning from a job. That is an everyday occurrence. I believe that there are I will not say he employs them as many Chinese as white souls travelling on that line. While there are 140 whites in the district of Byrock, there are 90 Chines© employed on ""patriotic"" conscriptionists' stations. In that district more Chinese than white men are employed. It would seem, therefore, that every stationI offered to get owner and every manager for the big companies is advocating conscription only that his vile ends may be achieved. These people are employing Chinese, although Y o u cannot we have no conscription, while the returned soldier is carrying his swag all over this country. While he is on his pension of 7s. 6d. or 10s. per week Chinese are preferred by the stationowner. One of the prominent and leading conscriptionists in the district of Cobar is a stock and station agent. Sycophant. like he must do what those who employ him want, or his livin g w ill go. H is advocacy of conscription is equal to that of the honourable member for Flinders, and he proudly displayed in his office And I know that window about 14th November last a card bearing the words: "" Wanted five scrubcutters, Chinamen preferred."" That sort of thing is common. I repeat that there are more Chinamen than whites employed in ring-barking and scrub-cutting on the stations of western New South Wales.",78,Maloney Th E Honourable The Right By A Petition Signed By T H I R Ty

254,Mr Blakele Y,"My statementI wish now to refer to a regulation passed under the War Precautions Act to make politicians honest and to .keep thein from telling lies. ""On 31st October last the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), speaking in the Sydney Town Hall, said that at no time up to that date had the reservoir of reinforcements run dry. That was prior to the conscription referendum being decided upon. great stampede. Shortly afterwards-o n 12th November-the Prime. Minister, speaking at Bendigo, said that there was a very grave shortage, and that it had been necessary to break up the 5th Division in order to provide reinforcements for the other four. Now, either the Prime Minister or the Minister forDefence was telling lies in regard to that matter. When Premier liyan was haled before the Court, and when the honourable member for Cook( Mr Catts) was similarly dealt with, it appeared from evidence given on oath by several responsible officers in the Defence Department, that the Prime Minister was lying. Their statements made on oath were in effect that the 5th Divison did not have to be broken up. Somebody was lying. Who was it? point to which. I take exception is that every member of the Labour party was watched, spied upon, and dogged, his meetings being attended by spies and petty Pinkertons in order that he should not tell that one lie. The only people who were capable of lying during that campaign, according to the summing up of our friends opposite, were members of the Labour party. that? Sydney Town Hall said "" One lie and you are in.' '1 very plain. The Prime Minister has refused to allow any member of the Nationalist party to be prosecuted. That is a definite and distinct statement.* A't no time have the provisions of the "" great lie' ' regulation been brought into operation against any conscriptionist. I know of at least two applications that have been made to the Prime Minister to prosecute persons on the conscription side, and to which no reply has been given. The regulation waa passed to "" gag "" the no-conscriptionists of this country. The' ' one l i e "" regulation was like t i e light. [110J--2 turned out to be, not a cracker, but only a wet squib. There is still worse to come. The people of this country have to pay the piper. If the Prime Minister or his colleagues had to pool theirsalaries to pay for this wicked and wanton waste of the people's money there might be some satisfaction in it -But what right has the Prime Minister or any member of the: National party to go in for mad and experimeniEal legislation of such a vindictivecharacter as that of the ""one l i e "" regulation framed under the War PrecautionsAct. but a regulation passed behind the back of Parliament. regulation it has just as much force as an Act of Parliament. The two men mainly concerned are, of course, the Prime Minister and the Government Printer, but members of the National party stood by, and saw public men haled before magistrates, and charged with faked charges-charge s which even conscriptionistmagistrates turned down on the ground that they Were loosely drawn, experimental, and based on Gilbert-andSullivan regulations. The trouble is that The the Australian people have to pay for the vindictiveness which sought to "" gag ""anti-conscriptionists and the Labour party, and prevent them putting their views before the public.' My own particular case arose from the fact that I wrote an article for the Worker. This article was really an extract from the appeal made by the organizer of the Fruit and Vegetable Fund in Sydney. The appeal stated that there were 1,200 wives of soldiers at' the Who has said Front on the books, and that to these women were handed parcels of fruit and vegetables, of which they were in need. The appeal further stated that there were 400 wives of soldiers at the Front who could not be placed on the books owing to the lack of cash, and that there were 4,300 children dependent on these 1,600 mothers. These are facts which -the Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Groom) ought to take into consideration, if _ he has not. already done so. In my article I simply stated the facts briefly, and Chen added a comment that the position would be accentuated a hundredfold if conscription were carried. Then the busybodies, the Pinkertons, the spies in the Darling electorate, got to work, and prevailed on some It' one to take action against me.
