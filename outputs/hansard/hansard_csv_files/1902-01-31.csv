Speaker, whether it will be in order to move an amendment, adding to the motion the following words : "" And shall thereafter, until otherwise ordered, meet on' Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays only."" I would urge that Standing Order No. 41 does not preclude the possibility of an amendment being moved. My sole desire is to have the matter discussed in an orderly way, and there is no suggestion of want of confidence, in the Government, or any desire to take the business out of their hands. might I suggest that this is a motion for a special adjournment, and that the sole question before the Chair is as to what shall be our next sitting day. Therefore, any mention of the other sitting days would be irrelevant to the motion. a ruling at once, and I desire to give it forthwith, because it is practically a repetition of the ruling I have already given. Standing Order No. 41 does not preclude the moving of an amendment. I quoted Standing Order No. 41 in connection with quite another point, but the whole practice of Parliament is entirely against permitting any such amendment as that suggested by tlie honourable member for Bland. Further, the amendment is irrelevant to the question at issue, which is whether the next sitting day shall be Tuesday. suggest to honourable members that, if it is the desire to ascertain the will of the House upon the general question of sitting days, W ill it not be there is a very easy way of doing so. If the Government discern that it is the will of the House that an opportunity should be given for discussing the question of sitting days generally, they can easily afford that opportunity next week, on an honourable member bringing forward a motion specially dealing with the matter. entirely within the discretion of the Government ; but I now desire to know the proHonorable cedure to be adopted in securing a disagreement with your ruling, because it seems to me this is a matter which ought to be discussed, and there seems no other way of enabling us to arrive at a decision. feeling of honourable members could be tested by moving that the House should sit on Tuesday next, at twelve o'clock.

33,Mr Poynton,"Experienc e in otheran opportunity of considering the advisableness of commencing our sittings ab eleven o'clock on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, instead of sitting on Mondays, I should not object to the motion. May, I find, as I expected to find, that you were quite correct in the ruling you have given, Mr Speaker, and as, in view of the standing orders, any disagreement with your ruling would be rather unfair to yourself, I do not propose to go any further in that direction. I hope, however, that the Government will consider the fact that our present sittings involve a strain upon honorthen spend a day longer in Sydney at the able members for a large number of hours on each day, and during the week as a whole, and that when we are engaged in considering the technical details of the Tariff, it is difficult to maintain for such long hours that mental tension which is necessary in tlie interests of the country. I sympathize with the desire of the Government to finish the session as soon as possible, but I would urge them to consider, not the convenience of honourable members, but the extra strain which would be placed upon them if we sat on Mondays. be no question of any implied censure upon the Government in connection with this .discussion. All that is desired is that reasonable consideration should be shown for honourable members, and that an opportunity should be afforded of discussing the whole matter. I am quite sure that honourable members are already called upon to sit longer than is good for them, and that some honourable members are not able to stand the constant. strain. If the Government would afford us an opportunity to consider the question of the hours and days of sitting at some future time, I should be satisfied to allow tbe motion to pass for the present. perhaps entitled to consider our own convenience, we should also bear in mind the position occupied by those honourable members who come from Western Australia and Queensland, and who are not able to go to and from their homes at the end of the week. Personally, I am prepared to sit on Mondays if it is considered necessary. I am in favour of morning sittings, but I recognise, that, whilst sitting here from ten o'clock in the morning until eleven o'clock at night would not put any great stress upon private members who are freB to go and come as they choose, it would impose a very heavy strain upon the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Treasurer, who have to be in the chamber during the whole time the Tariff is under discussion. I favour Monday sittings for a few weeks because I think they would enable us to get through our work all the more quickly. I am not one of those who believe that the longer we sit the less work we do. It would suit my own convenience not to sit on Mondays, because I could end of the week; but I am ready to consider the interests of those who are far away from their homes, and cannot visit them week by week. If the Government think it necessary to ask the House to sit in the mornings I am quite prepared to fall in with their wishes; but some consideration must be paid to the extra work that would be thrown .upon Ministers. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I do not wish to appear selfish in this matter, but I think that honourable members representing the very distant portions of the Commonwealth have studied the convenience of those who are more favourably situated in every possible way. It is quite true that a number of the representatives of the more remote States have removed their families to Melbourne; but that course has been rendered compulsory owing to the prolonged nature of the session. It was impossible for honourable members to allow their wives and families to be separated from them continuously for eight or nine months. to remove one's family. MrM c DONALD Some honourable members have had to take that step and to sacrifice their businesses as well. I realize the difficulty which the honourable member for the Barrier has pointed out in regard to the strain which falls upon the two Ministers in charge of the Tariff. I recognise that when the House is sitting they have to remain continuously at the table whilst other honourable members can occasionally leave the chamber for a little recreation, and I sympathize with the Ministers in the arduous position which they occupy. A t the same time, I think that some effort should be made to close the session at an early date. I am willing to do my share of the work, and, if necessary, to sit night",16,Setup

37,Mr Poynton,"It is a nice thing to haveafter night. But I realize that ifc is perhaps not a good thing for the sittings to be too protracted. I know that the strain which falls upon the New South Wales representatives in travelling to and from Sydney is very intense, and must be quite equal to that which would be imposed upon them if the House met upon an extra day in each week. I repeat that I have no desire to be selfish in this matter, but I should like to see some arrangement made by which the course of public business might be expedited. representative of Queensland, I wish to saythat it is not possible for all of us to bring our families to Melbourne. In my own case six months elapsed between the time of my departure from my home and the date of my return to it. WhilstI hold that we do not expedite business by sitting for an unreasonable period on each day, I think that we will accomplish that end by sitting upon a greater number of days. If we sat upon five days of the week for a briefer period than we have been doing, I believe that more rapid progress would be made. The idea which has been promulgated' by the New South Wales representatives seems to me rather a selfish one. Of course they are willing to meet upon Wednesday, Thursday and Friday mornings. Under such an arrangement they will be allowed an opportunity of returning to Melbourne on Tuesday morning, but they altogether lose sight of the fact that Queensland representatives are present in Melbourne the whole time. I think that every honourable member who has undertaken the responsibility of representing his constituents, should feel that he is compelled to transact the business of the country as expeditiously as possible, especially when such an important matter as the Tariff is under consideration. If we meet upon five days of tlie week for a shorter period than has been our custom, we shall secure an interval of rest which will enable us to return to our labours refreshed ; but if on the contrary we sit all night, as we have done upon several occasions, we shall come back jaded and unfitted for legislative work. I think with the honourable member for Kennedy that we ought not to be selfish .in this matter. Honourable members ought not to overlook the fact that representatives of New South Wales and South Australia require to visit their homes occasionally in order to give some attention to their businesses. They do not go home for pleasure. To undertake such a long railway journey every week is anything but a pleasure, because they have to submit to the constant oscillation of the train, which constitutes a very great strain, upon the nervous system. For honourable members representing distant States to insist that because they cannot reach their homes occasionally the representatives of New South Wales and South Australia shall be denied that privilege would be very selfish indeed. I hope that the House will sit from ten or eleven o'clock in the morning until not later than ten o'clock at night. .That will give Ministers an opportunity of attending to official work. ber seriously think that the business of a Minister's department can be transacted in one day each week ? existing practice, Ministers have a couple of days weekly in which to attend to departmental matters, and I take it that when only two of them are constantly present in the chamber, the others have an opportunity of transacting official business during the sittings of the House. Out of consideration to the New. South Wales and South Australian representatives, I hope that honourable members representing the distant States will not press for Monday sittings. shall offer no objection to the proposal to sit upon another day each week. A t the same time. I do not imagine that the adoption of such a course will contribute to the greater despatch of public business. My experience is that the greater the strain to which honourable members are subjected,, the more discussion is provoked. If the business of the House is to be properly transacted, ample time for preparation must be given to honourable members. However, I feel that the Government are entitled to have some say in the matter of prescribing the time which shall be at their disposal for the despatch of business. I urge the Prime Minister to consider whether the work of the session is likely to be expedited by the-House sitting an extra day weekly. My experience is quite to the contrary. there will be no objection to the carrying of this motion. WhilstI agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that we",17,Setup

That spirit has been shown upon both sides, and I hope it will always be exhibited. The proposal to sit on Mondays raises a question between members who live in Melbourne and those whose homes are in the other States. For honourable members residing in this city the proposition is a most convenient one, but for those whose homes are elsewhere the practice of meeting on Monday would prove most inconvenient. I hope that the Ministry will take the matter into consideration, and see whether they cannot meet the convenience of honourable members who have occasion to visit their respective States. To attend here on Mondays would be a very severe strain upon the New South Wales representatives, whilst the practice would operate still more harshly in regard to the representatives from South Australia. Personally, I should prefer to sit later when we are here, but that would be inconvenient to honourable members who reside in Melbourne. Sir great a strain. in this city it is very important that we should adjourn at eleven p.m. I used to think that we did so on account of the sweet reasonableness of the Government, but I begin to suspect that the practice arises from other considerations.

There must be some finality to the first session of the Commonwealth Parliament. I happen to differ from a great number of honourable .members regarding the personal strain entailed by discussing, over a number of days, the items of the Tariff. If there is light work to be done in Parliament, it is dealing with the items in the Tariff. Those who are conversant with a particular subject are quite able to put their views before the committee, and one man can present a case much more clearly than can three or four colleagues with inferior information. Personally, I prefer sitting a number of days to sitting late at night. As the Minister for Trade and Customs says, it is better to sit five days a week for eight hours a day than four days a week for twelve hours a to the proposition to sitfive days a week. I have been looking over the division lists since we resumed business after the New Year, and I find that generally less than two-thirds of the members of the House have voted.

To a speech which I then made. I shall no further refer than to say that I gave no indication that this additional sitting day was to be granted only up to Christmas. have sat only twice on the Monday, although that additional day was granted in November, so that the Government cannot be accused of pushing this matter too far. The Government wish to have this additional day during the discussion of the remainder of the Tariff; but, when the Tariff is finished, if it be found that for the remaining business Monday is not required, then Tuesday will be reverted to as the first sitting day of tlie week. The Government can make no fairer offer than that; but in the meantime we find the Monday necessary. The alternative presented to us by the honourable member for Macquarie would mean that, in order to finish the session, or, at least, the Tariff, we should have to sit during the mornings of the week. I venture to say that that course is not possible without a blocking of the public business of the country. this House only, and it would be impossible for affairs, which are the outcome of Parliamentary deliberation, to be carried out under such conditions. cute the mandates of Parliament, or carry resolutions into effect.

The members of the Government themselves participate in the extra labour, and it is not likely that, they would make a proposal of this kind unless prompted by the necessities of public business. I hope honourable members will look at the question in that light.

61,A M E N D M E N T (By Mr Sydney Smith),"I move That the following exemption be added :"" Steam ploughs."" In America steam ploughs are coming into general use, and greatly facilitate the econoare acting rightly in consenting to commical working of the farms. I have seen a report from a New South Wales officer who recently visited America, in which attention is drawn to the wonderful strides which agriculture has made there owing to the introduction of steam ploughs, and it is pointed out that if the farmers of the Commonwealth wish to compete with foreign producers, they must use the latest and most improved machinery. gines have already been placed upon the free list, and there is therefore no need to make steam ploughs exempt, because a plough can easily be adapted to steam traction by a local manufacturer. We have placed a duty of-15 per cent, on ploughs drawn by horses, and therefore it would be unfair to allow ploughs drawn by steam tractionto be admitted free, since both horses and steam-engines are exempt. To save time, and, as I hope that another opportunity will be given to reconsider the whole question of agricultural machinery, I withdraw the amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. posedThat the following exemptions be added:""Rakes unci ploughs, combined, and strawsonizers."" .that rakes and ploughs taken separately are both dutiable; but it is now proposed to place combined rakes and ploughs on the free list. Surely the missing link between the rake and the plough could be supplied by Australian manufacturing genius. There is a duty on rakes and ploughs, because they can be made within the Commonwealth ; but there is to be no duty on combined rakes and ploughs, because they cannot be made herecannot be connected within the Commonwealth. It seems an extraordinary position to take, but I do not mind my protectionist friends giving me as many texts as they like for future comment. care to give a vote upon a matter of which I am ignorant, and I should like to know what strawsonizers are. the Government to consider whether they bined rakes and ploughs being placed on the list of exemptions. If these machines are admitted free the local manufacturer of ploughs will have to compete at a disadvantage with the importer who brings in the combined rakes and ploughs, because a premium will be placed upon the use of the imported article. The result of passing this amendment would be to compel one to turn round and vote for all similar articles being admitted free. I trust the Government will decline to draw a distinction between articles that are intended to effect the same purpose. the objections which have been raised, and the fact that has been mentioned that combined rakes and ploughs will probably come into competition with other implements which are being made here, we shall limit our consent to the admission of strawsonizers free of duty. the proposed exemptions should be put separately. Amendment amended accordingly. combined rake and plough is a special implement which is found to be very useful in the cultivation of maize. I do not know that they are manufactured within the Commonwealth, although I see no reason why they should not be, except that they are subject to a patent. The strawsonizer is very useful, especially to fruit-growers and others who have to deal with insect pests in the more tropical parts of the Commonwealth. Anything that we can do to minimize the difficulties of our agriculturists and horticulturists in this direction should be done.

75,Mr Tudor ( Y A R R A ),"It h in k t h a t thethe committee never intended to place upon the free list. In my judgment every article which it is desired to include in the schedule of exemptions should be specified. the duplicates of articles used in the working of a ship would come under the heading of ""ships' stores,"" and that no duty would be collected upon them unless they were landed and taken out of bond. A ship's propeller could certainly be landed in bond, and would not be dutiable when it was taken out so long as it was again placed on board the same ship. The however, would not only admit free the propellers required for a particular ship, but would have the effect of placing all ship's propellers which are imported upon the free list. The argument advanced by the honourable member for Melbourne in favour of tlie amendment ship-owners compete with ship-owners who are not liable to the duties imposed by the Commonwealth. I think that is a perfeetly sound reason for asking that these articles should be included in the free list. strange to say, the proposal comes from an honourable member who has repeatedly refused to accord similar treatment to other people in other industries. in reference to the farmer, that he competes in an open market with people who are thousands of miles away 1 favour of exempting "" wire netting."" and the honourable member interjects-"" I voted for the monkey."" voted for the right honourable member. more of the elephantine' species. The honourable member develops the cunning characteristic of the monkey in his conduct in this committee, because he is always looking after his own tail. He is largely interested in shipping, and consequently expresses the most statesmanlike views with reference to his own breeches pocket. That is my answer to the monkeyish interjection of the honourable member, whose term of political existence in Melbourne will be brought to an abrupt conclusion at the first opportunity, because even the protectionists look at my honourable friend with which the honourable member for Melbourne great suspicion as one of the marvelhas put the amendment is, as he himself lous converts of recent date. But where admits, altogether too large. his ships are concerned hesticks to his free-trade principles like a man. I am perfectly in favour of the distinction which he draws, because it is a fair one. I am not prepared to deny think that consideration to the ship-owners simply because the honourable member for Melbourneis inconsistent. But I would point out that when other large classes-suc h as the farmers in the wheat market-ar e exposed to foreign competition, and an endeavour is made to put the fittings of a farm, namely, agricultural machinery, upon the free list,, the honourable member asks"" Can this amendment, machinery be made in the Commonwealth ?""' He changed his vote only yesterday upon that very question. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs assured .him that a certain agricultural implement could be made in Australia, and he immediately changed his attitude, and instead of is that the local voting in favour of placing that implement upon the free list, he turned round and voted to impose a duty upon it . Coming from a man of the admitted intelligence of the honourable member, these facts But, are really worth pointing out. In a matter concerning the class to which the honourable member belongs, namely, the ship-owners,, does he ask"" Can propellers be made in Cannot Ave say, Australia?"" ""We have some of the largest works in the southern hemisphere, which can manufacture these articles. Cannot Mort's Dock turn out a propeller ? in Sydney turn them out. the size of the establishment and of the plant at Mort's Dock, 1 am perfectly sure that that company could manufacture propellers for the steamers in which the honourable member for Melbourne is interested. Yet, although he possesses the knowledge that these great industries can manufacture them, he coolly asks protectionists to ignore industrial establishments like Mort's Dock. I shall have to vote with the honourable member, but, from the inconsistency of his position, I feel that we are killed.

He wishes that certain fittings-such as propellers, bosses, and blades-whic h are brought out in a ship, and constitute duplicate parts, shall be exempt from duty. But I would point out to the honourable member that these articles could either be kept on the ship or landed and bonded. Therefore I do not think it is necessary to make the exemption which is proposed. If we adopted the amendment the articles in question could be brought out by one ship, placed in bond, and subsequently taken out and used in a ship other than that in which they were imported. I would much prefer to see a provision inserted whereby these particular ships' fittings are to be admitted free only so long as they, form duplicate parts of, and are used in connection with, the ship in which they were imported. I wish to guard against their being landed here and used in -connection with another ship.

An Inter-State boat, which originally comes from home, may trade from twelve to twenty years on the coast, and during that time may require duplicate shafts or propellers many times over. If another shaft is wanted, the local boat is placed at a disadvantage as compared with a boat belonging to the Norddeutscher Lloyd or any other foreign line, which may bring duplicates from Bremen or America and have them fitted here. If the propeller of a foreign boat be broken she may refit here with her own duplicate propeller and pay no duty. On the other hand, a boat which has been trading here for some years cannot replace the first duplicate without paying duty. If we are to have ships' fittings free, they should be free all round, because it is desirable in this great maritime community that we should have the very best and latest of these appliances. I was rather astonished at the suggestion that there should be a difference made. The coastal, boats already suffer from distinctly unfair competition from the foreign boats, seeing that the former have to pay wages of £ 7 to £ 9 per month, as against £ 3 10s. to £ 4 paid by the latter; and the amendment proposes to still further handicap the local I am not so vessels. help noticing the spark of intelligence, in regard to fiscal matters, which the agricul(North Sydney) -I tural and mining interests could not strike from the honourable member for Melbourne, but which has been struck from him by the If these articles come outas interests of a particular shipping firm.

I suppose it is because these latter are used by people in the country, who have to struggle for their daily bread, and are not worth the consideration of the distinguished member for Melbourne. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) I should like some information from the Minister for Trade and Customs, first as to whether these articles, according to the law at present, are free or taxable ? Isi t necessary to put in any special, exemptions to secure their immunity from taxation, if they are brought out on a ship and intended to be used on that ship and not landed 1 I want the Minister for Trade and Customs to answer that question. A second question is-Can these articles be made in Australia 1 I have heard the leader of the Opposition tell the House this morning that these propeller blades and bosses can be made in Australia, and the right honourable gentleman mentioned Mort's dock as tlie place where they are made. I want the Minister for Trade and Customs to apply to these articles the same test which he has applied in other cases, because we ought to have something like sistency. We are bound to apply the same principle to these articles which we applied to mining and agricultural machinery, and we can claim from the Minister information on this branch of the question. If these articles can be made here at reasonable rates, why should there be any discrimination in their favour? deal of force in what the honourable and learned member for Bendigo has said ; but there is another A'ery important consideration in connection Avith this matter Avith Avhich the Minister ought to deal. When a ship is built in some other part of the world, and receives its fittings, there is no guarantee that there is not some latent defect in the original propeller, or that some accident may not occur. From knowledge gained in my profession, I know it is usual to furnish ships Avith a duplicate propeller as necessary for tire safety of the passengers and the progress of the ship. If an accident occurs the second propeller may have to be fitted before a A'essel reaches the Comthe duty will be payable, as the goods w ill monwealth. An peller would not be dutiable. an element Avhichi t seems to me is in the two years under charter, and has drawn nature of an exception. If all goes well, as is usually the case, the duplicate propeller is brought out here, and must either be carried on the ship, or landed and placed in bond. So far as I can gather, the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Treasurer say that such propellers are notdutiable. trading on our coasts, the propeller mightbecome dutiable, not being exported. Minister to say what he thinks on this, question. must be used in the same ship. consideration should be given to thecircumstance that this additional propeller is not a matter of choice but a. matter of absolute necessity for the safety of the passengers. It is not at every portof call that propellors can be had, and duplicates must consequently be carried. I do not extend this consideration further than the duplicate, but this point is undoubtedly of great importance, introducing uniformity and conan element which gives much reason and force to the argument of the honourable member for Melbourne. This is not thecase, of a machine, Avhich, if required, can be obtained in the Commonwealth at once, and in regard to Avhich there should be norelaxation of the general rule. The whole: facts disclose exceptional circumstances. the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, I understand to be, is whether the fittings of a ship, which are brought out in use or in duplicate, are dutiable unless landed. My answer to that is-certainl y not. I say further, that it is possible to place them in bond, and if they are intended to be drawn from bond for use elsewhere they may be considered as exported goods, and,, therefore, clear of the payment of any duty,, not being entered for home consumption. As regards a good many of the articles mentioned, they can be produced in Australia ; and one of the difficulties is that,, if these goods are draAvn from bond, not for export but for use in a ship trading here, be practically entered for consumption",25,Pairs

What strikes me is that, to a very great extent, the provision now proposed is not wanted, but that everything desired will arise from the ordinary condition of affairs. We must be careful not to insert a provision which will give the foreign ship an advantage over the Australian coaster. Under all the circumstances, it seems desirable that the amendment should be withdrawn, for the reason, amongst others', that it is unnecessary, and, secondly, that it possibly goes too far in giving a preference of the character to which I refer. the last words of the Minister as coming from a protectionist, but I ' cannot understand the position of protectionists who are fighting to haveships'fittings placed upon the free list. It is remarkable that ships fittings are very largely manufactured in New South Wales. It is a daily occurrence for propellers to be fitted with new blades' at Mort's Dock. I point to that establishment as an illustration to Victorians of what may be done to build up an industry without the imposition of protective duties. A t the present time they have almost perfected there a process for fluxing brass and iron together, which will enable more durable and lighter propellers to be produced, and this will almost revolutionize matters in that line. building is carried on in New South Wales, and particularly in my electorate, I am not going cap in hand to the committee to ask for assistance to the industry by the imposition of taxes upon the whole community. The progress of shipbuilding in New South Wales has been so great that within a short period that State is likely to become a powerful competitor with other parts of the world. clined to think there is something in the case put by the honourable member for Melbourne. If an English steamer is chartered for the Inter-State trade, and brings out a duplicate propeller, she may put it into bond, but if on the way from Adelaide to Melbourne she loses her own propeller in a storm, she must take the spare propeller out of bond, and pay duty upon it beforeshe can use it . which I asked the honourable member to. i nsert would get rid of that difficulty. vessel was being fitted out, the builderwould have to pay duty upon the propeller,, and why should we put Australian) manufacturers at a disadvantage 1 point, but, on the other hand, wedo not want to cause large vessels to go outside the Commonwealth to be docked in order tosave expense. The local ship-builder will, have to pay duty upon everything he uses,, whereas a ship can be imported from theold country properly equipped without it being necessary to pay a penny of duty upon her. There would be no difficulty undertime policy of which I am in favor; because the colonial builder would be abletoimporthis materials free, but, as the policy of my right honourable friend is to prevail, -somespecial treatment should be devised which,, while not handicapping our ship-buildingindustry, will meet the case which I haveput. Though, at the present time, only comparatively small vessels and an occasional steamer are built within the Commonwealth, the industry will, in the future,, become a very important one. is built out here is the machinery locally made ? one, and no builder could afford to pay a duty of 25 per cent, upon a vessel's But, although so much shipmachinery. the machinery be made here ? the one firm as one job. courage both the smaller industry of shipfitting and the larger industry of shipbuilding, and we have no desire to cause large vessels to go out of Australia to be docked.

It has been brought under our notice in a variety of ways, and 1 trust that we shall be able to devise some satisfactory solution of the difficulty. it would be best for the honourable member to withdraw the amendment. The fittings which have been referred to by the honourable member for Melbourne fall very naturally under two heads-thos e which can be and are made in the States, and those which cannot be made here. Why should we not treat propellers as we have treated anchors ? Propellers up to a certain weight are cast in the States, but it does not pay to with new ships, but shafts are almost incast manganese propellers beyond a certain weight, because the plant required is too expensive, and the demand too erratic and in-constant to make the industry a profitable one. In the same way, it does not pay to manufacture shafting of more than a certain -diameter. Of course, there are very few oases where a break cannot be repaired in our docks by welding or making a band, but in the case of a big vessel like a man-of-war, or the Grosser Kurfast, probably nothing oould be done until new shafting had been obtained. The idea of stimulating an industry which cannot be expected to make much progress for thenex.t50 years is absurd. Therefore, if the Government bring down -a list they should group the articles in -divisions, distinguishing those made of metal from those made of wood. Ships' fittings include a hundred things. Cabin -furniture would be included amongst ships' fittings ; stanchions are ships' fittings, and --smoke stacks and ventilator funnels are also fittings. Ventilator funnels, and perhaps -smoke stacks, are made here, and ships' compasses, which are also fittings, may be made here. These things, however, are not what -the honourable member for Melbourne has in his'mind, and the list of articles which he desires to have exempted should be brought -down and dealt with seriatim, on their merits. -why we asked to be supplied with a list. refuse to adopt a general amendment, be-cause of its vagueness, whereas if the -articles were submitted in detail the greater number of them might be exempted. If -the Government bring down a list showing which of these ships' fittings can reasonably be made within the Commonwealth, and which should be exempted, we shall have an opportunity of judging whether or not they should be admitted free. adays are a net-work of machinery-of hydraulic, electrical and steam machineryand all engines and appliances would come within the category of ships' fittings. The ship building industry, which has assumed very large proportions in the State of New South Wales, should not be placed at a disadvantage in having the articles which go to make up ships subject to duty, whilst the ships themselves are allowed to come in free. Duplicate propellers are generally sent out variably stored at the docks or ship building yards, such as Mort's Dock and Engineering Works, and the Government Dock Yards in Sydney. I do not wish to see our industries taxed to the advantage of the foreigner, and upon this matter free-traders and protectionists should be able to stand upon common ground. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) -In deference to the wish of the Government I shall withdraw my amendment, trusting to their promise that the matter shall receive consideration at a later period.

The freezing machinery used in meat works is of a special type, and I do not think that any portion of the equipment of the Northern meat works was made in Australia. The remarks of the honourable member for Illawarra, the honourable member for Coolgardie, and the honourable member for Barrier, are extremely unjust, and show the basest ingratitude after the manner in which I supported them in connection with the exemption of vermin killers. The honourable member for Herbert, with obher honourable members, was, to a large extent, responsible for refrigerating machinery of all kinds being retained on the dutiable list. I do not know whether the honourable member voted against the proposal, but if he were in favour of it , it was unfortunate that he was not present in order to support us on the division. In view of bhe importance of placing all refrigerating machines on the freelist, the honourable member for Herbert would do well to press his amendment to a vote. If we secure the exemptions contemplated by him, there will be no just reason why we should not again 'test the feeling of the committee on the question of placing all refrigerating machines on the free list. I believe that on reconsideration of that matter we shall secure a majority of votes. member machinery in connection with this amendment. machinery used in meat works,"" is included in the amendment now before the committee. * The CH AIRMAN -The commitbee have already decided that refrigerating machinery should not be placed on the list of exemptions, and I am therefore of opinion that the honourable member for Herbert cannot include freezing machinery used in meat works in his amendment. committee were considering the question of placing refrigerating machinery on the free list, you decided that it would be competent' for honourable members to propose the exemption of any special refrigerators after the committee had declared against bhe general In any case I cannot exemption. The exemption of dairying machinery was then proposed, and it would have been quite competent for any honourable member to afterwards move that meat freezing machinery be placed on the free list. To my mind, it is remarkable, in view of the decision given last evening, that any exception should now be taken to the course proposed by the honourable member for Herbert. should not have risen but for a remark which fell from the Minister for Trade and Customs. The right honourable gentleman asked whether the meat industry should be treated better than are other industries. I wish to point out to him that in .relieving these machines from taxation he is not benefiting those who are engaged in the meat industry-bh e canners or suppliers of frozen meat-bu t he is benefiting the whole community. This industry has to compete in the markets of the world. It is threatened with extinction by the Argentine producers, and we know that recently in South Africa a difference of a very small sum turned the balance in regard to a contract for' a considerable quantity of meat against Australia. It is one of the most important industries in the community, and it benefits the whole of the continent. I know that some Australian meat works are not conducted upon strictly commercial principles. The Sydney Meat Works are an example of this. Those interested in that venture are concerned in the large producThe honourable ing interests of Australia, and their desire cannot discuss refrigerating is to retain a market for their surplus stock, which otherwise would not be absorbed. They recognise that by securing such a "" Freezing market a benefit is conferred upon Australia and those engaged in our large producing interests, even though a loss is sometimes suffered. Consequently we should give that industry every opportunity for competing with the rest of the world. Under these circumstances, I hope bhat any honourable member who entertains the view that the action of the mover of this amendment is an inconsistent one, will not pause to consider that, but will support his proposal. move to add after the words ""freezing",34,Pairs

I am sure there is no honourable member who does not recognise that meat-freezing machinery order, may I be permitted to say that the committee have already decided the question of whether refrigerating machinery generally shall be subject to a duty. The honourable and learned member for Illawarra is therefore seeking, by the words he has suggested, to raise a debate upon a matter which has already been decided. upon whether dairying is a primary industry. mittee decided the question of whether refrigerating machinery should be included in the schedule of special exemptions. The honourable and learned member for Illawarra now wishes to add to "" freezing machinery "" the words "" used in primary industries."" I consider that freezing machinery and refrigerating machinery are practically the same thing, and, except some clear distinction can be drawn between them, I must rule the honourable and'learned member out of order. The best course for the honourable member for Herbert to take would be to propose his amendment in its original form. After the whole question can be reviewed. I do not want to take this matter out of the hands of the honourable member, but a motion of this kind should be submitted.

I understood, and I think the Chairman understood, that the honourable member had withdrawn the words referring to refrigerating machinery used in meat works, and there has clearly been a mistake. If that is so, it is quite competent for the committee to discuss the question whether freezing machinery used in meat works shall be put on the free list. This is a matter which is most important, and should receive the point of further consideration, in view of the fact of the many difficulties that have to be contended with in the export of meat and dairy produce. The honourable member for Melbourne last night said that he was strongly in favour of the free admission of refrigerating machines connected with larger works, while he proposed that similar machines used for dairy purposes shall pay a duty, because the latter are being made by a few manufacturers in Melbourne. This is a question which affects all the primary producers of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Melbourne was induced to alter his opinion only because of a telegram from some firm in Queensland to the effect that they were not manufacturing these articles, but only supplying them. it was the other way. rapid strides in improvements in connection with this class of machinery than in connection with any other; and I am surprised at the attitude of the honourable member for Melbourne. In many cases the machinery is patented, and cannot be manufactured here without permission, and to impose a duty would be to do an injury to that class that has been disposed of on which we depend more than any other for the success of the Commonwealth. I shall vote for this amendment, in the hope that reconsideration will be given to other rejected proposals, and that we shall have the satisfaction, in view of the closeness of the division last night, of placing all refrigerating machinery on the free list. some difference between refrigerating machinery and freezing machinery.

Whether the distinction goes so far as to require any grave difference in the machinery, such as to justify separate names, I cannot altogether determine, but I think that there must be a great deal of difference in construction. Many firms in Australia can construct refrigerating machinery, but not many can construct the better classes of freezing machinery, because the demand for the latter is not sufficiently large. slightest distinction; they both have the same trade name. great difference between a freezing chamber and a refrigerating chamber? We know that some shipments of refrigerated meat were altQgether lost owing to the lowness of the temperature, which had to be altered ; and it is likely that there must be some considerable difference in the machinery used for this purpose. given my decision in regard to the question as to the similarity between freezing machines and refrigerating machines. The amendment of the honourable member for Herbert was read from tlie chair in exactly the same form as he submitted it to the committee, but if the honourable member assures* me a mistake has been made, and that he desires that the word ""used in meat works"" in the third line shall be omitted, the amendment can be put in that form.
