69,Mr Fisher,"It is estimated that thethe Opposition generally. The Opposition press, and some people who claimed to be financiers, have condemned it, and we are promised more of this condemnation. An honourable member sitting behind the right honourable member for Swan has promised to tell us more about the unsoundness' of that legislation. The point I wish to emphasize is that the basic principle of our note-issue is that neither the banks nor private persons are asked to bring their gold to the Treasury and accept notes instead of it. If they prefer to have the notes they can bring their gold to the Treasury and get them, and if at any time they want gold they can bring their notes back to the Treasury and get gold for them. They have perfect freedom in the matter. It is true that the notes are legal tender as between person and person, except in the case of the Treasurer, who must pay in gold. There is, therefore, absolute security to all who hold our notes. We have to remember also the great convenience it is to have an Australian currency passing, between State and State without any charge for exchange, and that it also provides for greater safety. do when the gold is exhausted? hausted, because, as the honourable member for Indi pointed out the other night, if half-a-dozen lorry-loads are taken away by the banks we can bring the gold back again by calling in our accounts and balances, which in many instances are at very short date. lorries could be filled up. lorry loads were required? with eighty lorries f u l l of gold. not got that quantity of gold. interjection of the honourable member has disclosed the crux of what he conceives to be a danger, namely, the probability that the banks and the people will all demand gold for their notes at the same time. I will not speak for the great financiers on the Opposition side of the House, but I will spealc for the electors who vote for the Labour party, and I say that they will never be so insane. fidence in their own country, and ' in a principle which is sound, although it may be new to my honourable friends, and in It was suggested^ by no circumstances will they do what has been done in other places, make an unreasonable demand on the Treasuryf b r the sake of precipitating a financial crisis. I go so far as to say what I recently said on the platform in the electorate of Werriwa, that the banks are too intelligent and too careful of their own interests to make a raid on the Treasury, because such an act would undoubtedly recoil upon themselves. Buti f they did make a disloyal attack on the Treasury we could meet it, and afterwards they would require to be dealt with as people should be dealt with who endeavoured to do an injury to the community. ThenI would ask, "" Where has this money been invested?"" It has been invested with the banks themselves and with the States. When we hear the chatterI ought not to say "" chatter "" perhapswe have taken moneys from the States which we are using. for Commonwealth work. What have we done? In the first place we advanced New South Wales£ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 and Victoria ^980,000. Western Australia received ,£650,000, and Tasmania ,£500,000.

We looked for the reference to the appointment of an Inter-State Commission as we looked for reference to the Divine blessing; but, nevertheless, nothing was done. That is not our way of doing business. Where we have power to give The honourable member effect to policy, we do not mention matters in the Speech, unless we mean to give them serious attention; and, the more so, when we find the honourable member for Wimmera tabling a motion, at the first sitting of the House, in favour of the appointment of a Commission to deal with irrigation and the Murray waters question, and indicating that an Inter-State Commission is desirable for the protection of the honourable member that there are very usef u l functions which I have always thought To listen to honourable ought to be performed by an Inter-State Commission. This is a question demanding serious consideration; and I am happy to be able to agree with the honourable member in something, namely, that the members of the Inter-State Commission ought to be men of unexceptional ability and experience.

Negotiations had been opened up with the Government of New South Wales Mr Wade was then Premier-and the Government were favorable, as were the Federal Government, to the Warrego being put together in Sydney. From the time honourable members opposite came into office, on, I think, the 2nd June, until the 26th January, notwithstanding the fact that Mr Wade probed them again and again in his desire to know whether anything was to be done in the way of constructing the boat, not a single official communication passed from the Federal Government to him. the boat ?

And these are the people who talk about delay! The charge is made against this tion of the vessel. Any one would think, hearing honourable members opposite, that we had delayed the work and sent the order to another country. But, as a matter of fact, the parts were brought here as soon as they possibly could be, and the work was at once handed over to the New South Wales Government. We assisted that Government in every possible way in accelerating the construction of the vessel, even to the extent of incurring serious criticism for our partiality towards the State of New South Wales. We were anxious that the vessel should be put together in Australia; and I am satisfied that, after the example we have set, larger vessels will be constructed in this country in the near future. Surely it comes ill and unfortunately from honourable members opposite to speak about delaying the construction! The delay which occurred was something which the State had a right to regret, and which we regretted; but I am happy to be able to say that the vessel has now been certified as being one of the very best. If there has been a little delay, we have, at any rate, initiated the construction of warships in Australia, and this has resulted in an order for a larger boat being given.

Arbitration Court. I shall not labour that point further, save to venture the opinion that as soon as all parties have direct access to that Court, we shall hear much less of industrial disputes. The Leader of the Opposition suggested profit-sharing 'as the remedy for industrial trouble. The suggestion is as old as the hills. Profit-sharing has been tried again and again. I spent my early youth in a -centre of population where the experiment was often made, but it is not a remedy for the immediate trouble. I would remind the House that profit-sharing, as a system, can be carried to any length, and that it might lie carried to such an extent as to be described by some people I certainly withdraw any as Socialism. Everything depends upon the extent to which the honourable member would go; but I think he is safe in putting In the circumstances forward such a proposition.

I know what they are, and what they are worth to a country. That they came through a great struggle peacefully is a great honour to them, and to their friends. That there was not a single case of the fire-stick being used is marvellous. It shows the control they must have had over every one of their followers who might have been weak. I believe that the only building destroyed by fire during the strike was the co-operative store at Bundamba, which belonged to the unionists. No one would charge the capitalists with having burned down that store, but when dynamite was found on the tram lines the matter was treated differently. I draw attention to the fact that it was always discovered in time to prevent anything happening. ' The honourable member for Ballarat possesses an analysis of the material that was discovered. I am not concerned with whether it was dynamite, gelignite, or some other explosive, and do not challenge the analysis of Mr Henderson. We are all delighted that nothing happened; but is it to be thought that if the men who placed the explosive in position had meant anything to happen they would have failed? My honourable friend may put his statement into Hansard to malign the industrial classes of Australia, but that will not work. create a wrong impression, and have not read the report of the speech, I shall read from the corrected report the passage indicated to me by the honourable member. Referring to the matter upon which .1 am speaking, he saidThat justifies no deduction that these outrages were attempted by persons connected with the strike, or that they were committed with their knowledge, but you must realize that in every city of any size you will find, not only a certain number of criminals who seize any opportunity which a disturbance presents, but also a number of unbalanced people who in times of seething excitement, processions, marches, and so on, identify themselves with a cause with which previously they may not have had anything to do, and act without authority, under the impulse of the excitement generated. You have to recognise the fact, just as you must recognise that in a city f u l l of wooden houses there is always the danger of a conflagration. ter cannot get anything out of that. my remarks shall be qualified by the statement which I'have read; but even that statement attributes to the action of the unionists .the excitement that prevailed. What about the action of the Government of Queensland? Queensland was keeping order. That is_ what a Government is for. made for military assistance, the Government of Queensland had arranged to swear in special constables, although it is universally admitted that the unionists had done all in their power to prevent unlawful acts. I was not in Brisbane at the time, though my opinion is that, had the Government shown wit regarding the young men who in the early days of the strike went round the shops, it could have dealt with the situation at once. But that is another matter. The unionists were law-abiding to the last degree, and the city most peaceful. The police record shows that while the strike lasted serious assaults were being committed in Melbourne-here , there, and everywhere; but there is no such record for Brisbane. for Corangamite suggested fhat the outrages were due to immigrants. made that statement, and I believe that he denied the allegation. I advise my honourable friend to read what a .New South Wales Judge stated the other day on the subject. The honourable member for Ballarat complains that I dealt differently with two telegrams asking for the assistance of the military. That is so. One of the telegrams was official, and the other was not. WasI to be expected to treat in the same way telegrams from the Government of the State and from Mr Coyne? the Commonwealth Government would not interfere, there was no reason why the same thing should not have been said to the other. carefully the request of the Government of Queensland.

Owing to a little family quarrel we were able to get wind of this alteration, and demanded to see the original report. In the Votes and Proceedings of the Queensland Assembly for 1895 honourable members can see, shall I say, the expurgated copy, and the report which was submitted by the Commissioner, and which put the matter much more in favour of the shearers, strikers, and those accused of crime, than did the report presented to Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition speaks of the people who are influenced. Does he suggest that a Minister sitting in his office would be influenced by causes like that? There are two kinds of criminals. Both cream and scum come to the top, and you have to know which is which. I rely on the good sense of the people generally of Australia. I must get back to my statement regarding strikes. In 1894 I submitted to the Queensland Assembly a motion to this effectTliat the time had arrived when steps should be taken to prevent the constant recurrence of industrial disputes in the shape of industrial legislation. That was not a new idea with me. But it was the first official statement which was made. pectedly by the Premier, and carried unanimously. Holding these views, and having that evidence, I need not enlarge further on this matter. My efforts have always been directed towards establishing Courts to deal with industrial troubles, as with others. Honourable members in this Parliament know that not only did I hold strong views regarding the settlement of disputes between private employers and employees, but at one of the very first opportunities which offered for amending the Arbitration Act here, I was in favour of including Government employees as well as private employees within its operation, because I believe that our civilization, advancement, and security can be better promoted in that way than by any other method I know of. It is for that reason I regret the attempt to make this an issue now, or at the next election. I welcome it, but that is, of oourse, another matter. When the Comwhether the Leader of the Opposition, or his colleague, the honourable member for Parramatta, remembers an instance that occurred in New South Wales in the early days of Federation, when a strike by the New South Wales Government took place in connection with some wire-netting. At that time our law was absolutely defied, but Sir Edmund Barton, the then Prime Minister, in the largeness of his mind, regarded it as a paltry little matter, and felt that the State Government might be left to get over their little pettiness. rightly, some of the honourable gentleman's party badly wanted the Prime Minister of the day to turn out the soldiers to deal with that strike. told my reason on Friday for objecting to make use of soldiers at all in dealing with such a matter. I have said that if the soldiers had Been brought into the difficulty at Brisbane when the request for their assistance was made, it would have meant an end to our defence system for twenty years to come. That is my honest opinion as to what the effect of complying with the request made at that time would have been; but that is not saying that the law should not be preserved. It merely goes to show how much care should be taken in dealing with such a matter. On the question of what soldiers can do, the Leader of the Opposition told us that the mere appearance of the soldiers on the My motion was seconded unexscene in Brisbane would, have quelled the whole disturbance. I do not agree with the honourable gentleman. I believe that it would have caused disaster as surelv as that I stand here. Let us consider the difference in this connection between a policeman and a soldier. A policeman is able to go up to a person, talk to him, and persuade him to go home, and conduct himself like a good fellow. But what is the position of the soldier when the Riot Act is read? He must fire, and fire to kill. That is the business of the soldier. He cannot go up to a man, and say, "" You are doing wrong; you must go home; you should not stand there."" The soldier must take his orders from his superior officer. On the contrary, the trained policeman has a power which was described in . better terms by the late Sir Charles Lilley, when Chief Justice of Queensland, than by any other person I have heard refer to the matter. A gentleman took exception to I would ask his arrest by a policeman because he was",27,Robert Best Durin G The Last Interests Of Australia. I Agree With The

This is a wonderful power possessed by the police, and where it is well exercised, the policeman is one of the most useful members of the community. It is for this reason I contend that the military should never be brought into conflict with the citizen in matters of general civic government. The resort to the military can only be justified in the case of a revolution or something akin to it, and when it is clearly necessary to prevent the destruction of life and property man has said is not what the Broken Hill strikers said about the police. self at the present time. 1 am accused of backing up strikes. I have said, as regards the Brisbane strike, that it was wonderful that the men were able to restrain themselves as they did during that strike. I have told honourable members that they desired that their case should go to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and if they could have got there, there would have been no strike. mean that their claim was in the "" plaint,"" as they call it. was considered by the Court the Tramway Company had determined to dismiss every man who wore a badge, and every prominent unionist. true, what has it to do with the matter? There was the case to be heard, and they would have had to obey the Court. the Court. question to legal gentlemen. Here is the posivitally concerned the Commonwealth of Austion : Some of the tramway employees were members of a union. The manager had a union of his own that was really no union. He would not have a unionist at a l l ; he did not deny it. He would have nothing to do with a union at any time, and did not want it. I am in the happy position of being able to quote the exact words reported to have been used in London by a gentleman who was speaking for the Tramway Company, and knew their views. He tells us exactly what he thought of the matter. The honourable member for' Ballarat, in his best efforts, spoke highly of our Conciliation and Arbitration Act. whom I refer does not think as highly of the Act as does the honourable member. opinion. gentleman does. This gentleman says that immediately they discovered that some of the men wanted to wear a badge, they were put off the tram; not because there was any fault to be found with them, but because they were prepared to break a regulation of the company. Was it not the duty of the Tramway Company to permit the wearing of a simple badge by their employees until the matter was settled by the Court, rather than to dismiss them first, and so prejudice the case before it got to the Court? This was especially their duty, in view of the fact that the men were told on high legal authority that they had every right, as citizens, to wear the badge. But each man, as he came along with a badge, was brushed aside. They were put off the trams, and the company used their students to run the trams. They did without the unionists. Then we are calmly asked, as honest citizens of Australia, to believe that this was a conspiracy on behalf of the unions. It was, on the contrary, a demonstration of manly feeling for the protection of their fellow men. The unionists were determined that no kind of tyranny would be allowed to disgrace a free community like this. Dealing with what was said in London, I make the following quotation from a document which has come to hand: At the eleventh annual meeting of the Brisbane Electric Tramways Investment Co. L t d . , held in London on 21st May, the chairman, MrH . R. Beeton, said that since the opening of the current year they had suffered from a strike which had seriously affected the company, tralia, and had interested the world at large. Under the laws of Queensland the wages, hours, and conditions of labour were settled under the Wages Board Act 1908, and under the operation of that law the company and its employees were perfectly satisfied, and the com-",28,Robert Best Durin G The Last Interests Of Australia.

229,Mr Fisher,"No doubt the honorablepany had voluntarily, without any pressure, actually conceded an advance on the terms which .had been settled by the tribunal under that Act. that the company's employees were as contented as any body of tramway men in Australia. However, an Act had been passed, entitled the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which constituted a Court for the same purpose as the State Wages Board, but consisting of one Judge, who was bound by no rules of evidence, was entitled to refuse legal assistance to either party, and had jurisdiction in all industrial disputes, and against whose award there was no appeal. The speaker impugned the very Court which was brought into operation by the honourable member, and suggested that it was called into existence after Wages Boards had been created in Queensland in 1908. Then he proceeded to give a his-tory of the strike. Shortly afterwards agitators were sent up from Melbourne, and extraordinary demands were embodied in a plaint which was forthwith presented for determination. Without, however, waiting for a decision of the Court the agitators resolved to provoke a strike, and to this end they resolved on iSth January that the members of the Federal Union in the company's employment should wear union badges, in violation of a regulation of a company. The recalcitrants were interviewed by MT. Badger, and, as they insisted on their right to wear the badge, they were not allowed to board the cars. By availing themselves of the services of students who were under instruction for drivers, they were able to continue a reduced service. The company's depfits and offices were picketed, but, assisted by the constant presence of the police, general quiet was preserved. _But, four days later-o n 30th Januarya general strike of all trades was declared, and the industrial crisis which followed was the worse in the history of Brisbane, if not in that of Australia; practically all business was shut down and brought to a standstill. stances it redounded greatly to the credit of the general manager that, in spite of three futile attempts to blow up cars, no depredations on the company's properly were committed and no injury to workmen ensued. The chairman then proceeded to give an account of the strike, and remarked that, although the company had suffered severely in traffic and expenses, they had been sustained by the approval of the entire community, except the labour unions, and with the resumption of normal conditions, which already obtained, the board had hopes of recovering in the course of the year a large part of the loss which had been sustained. There the position is set out in polite language. It is urged that when unionists claimed the right of citizens they were not dismissed, but "" were not allowed to board the cars."" That is the official statement of the London chairman of that company. Surely he is not prejudiced in favour of the men. In the face of that statement, and in the face of this attack upon organized labour, what can be said by my honourable friends opposite? It was the Indeed, it was no exaggeration to say declared policy of the Government of which the honourable member for Ballarat was the leader, as it was also the policy of the Queensland Government, that labour must be organized, otherwise the Conciliation and Arbitration Court would be absolutely worthless. Unless labour be organized it can make no progress whatever. But the Brisbane Tramway Company would have no organization of labour. It would employ only men who swore unqualified allegiance to it. I say that the day when such a state of things can exist has long passed. Men must be allowed to associate with their fellows for their united protection, and especially when we have to deal with combines, trusts, and monopolies. I was very nearly going to imitate the Leader of the Opposition in the methods which he employed on Friday last. I do not recollect ever seeing him thump the table of the House as he did upon that day when he was declaiming against delay in prosecuting the Coal Vend. But here is another combination which -has a great franchise, and one which it did not obtain with my consent or that of the honourable, member for Capricornia. But it must conform' to the laws of the country, and I have no hesitation in saying that it did an injustice to its employees when it put them off the tram cars because they insisted upon wearing a badge. When the matter came before the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, Mr Justice Higgins declared that as citizens the men had a right to wear a badge. Consequently, they had merely In these circumdone a lawful act. Vet for having performed a lawful act they were dismissed. held that it was illegal and unreasonable for the company to refuse its assent to the wearing of the badge. me that it was unreasonable, but I did not know that it was unlawful. It is unreasonable for the company to compel its employees to wear a prescribed uniform and at the same time to forbid them to wear anything to show that they are free men. Without that freedom they might as well return to the days of serfdom, and wear prescribed collars and leg rings. That is a modern kind of barbarism. We all know that some persons will not allow their employees to speak upon certain subjects when they are employed in their factories. But",29,Robert Best Durin G The Last Interests Of Australia.

These statements dealt with finance, and were made by honourable members who sit behind the honourable member for Ballarat. And in what way did those honourable members deal with the financial question? They pointed out that the expenditure in the Post Office has increased, that the remuneration to the post-office employees has been increased, and that the expenditure on invalid and old-age pensions, and on defence, has also increased. They further pointed out that the maternity allowance will increase the expenditure of the Commonwealth. In connection with this last proposal, there has been an anger and bitterness displayed by members of the Opposition that are not complimentary to them. We may pardon biting, angry statements; but some have gone so far as to forget to be gentlemen. The proposal for a maternity allowance is not a new one; and such an allowance is an economic necessity, in my opinion, in every civilized country. The Government can best provide some assistance at a time when we are ushered into the world whether agreeable or not. Such an allowance will protect the mother, and also the child, the young Australian. None whatever. Yet It will assure the mother of a few shillings under reasonable circumstances, and make her certain of a friend, if not in love, at least in service. was to be on registration. of human nature that if a person sees a five-pound note he will endeavour to secure it if he may do so by rendering some service; and if the money be paid on registration, the mother will be assured of the necessary service. When, however, a woman under the circumstances is without anything, and has nothing to look forward to, such an allowance, so far from degrading her, will maintain her independence. A maternity allowance of the kind will not burden the Commonwealth finances, and will, I hope, prove an undoubted help in every home in Australia. I do not claim any special consideration in this connection; but I am happy to be associated with a party which regards such a policy as right, and is prepared to give effect to it whether COOK -It is "" unfair "" it be popular or not. informed on was whether the payment was to be made in one sum, and at registration? of the Government.

They say, in the first place, that is to say, if the honourable member for Flinders has been rightly reported. Well, we are prepared, as a party, to meet that charge. Here is the Act. It is not a question of whether the sons and daughters are prepared to help their aged parents. We claim that this pension is for the purpose of enabling the aged and the invalid to be as independent as persons in their situation can be. Such is the law as we understand it. I want to say more to my honourable friends opposite and to the country-that the last step has not been taken in this matter of old-age and invalid pensions yet. We must, of course, husband our finances. Wherever we find that an improvement can be made, we shall gladly make that improvement in the Act. But, vast as the sum that has been expended up to the present time is-and the amount that has been quoted is even less than the actual sum, which amounts to over £2,000,000-it am of the opinion, Mr Speaker, that, although this expenditure is growing, it is, perhaps, the best expenditure that we can incur. I will tell the House my reason for that view. This idea of the family looking after the "" old man "" and the "" old woman,"" to use a familiar phrase, comes down to us from a very early age. But what happens in many a family? Experience shows that the best members of it have had to contribute the whole amount for the support of their aged parents. 1 do not care what kind of law you pass, the ne'er-do-wells of a family will flit away, leaving the boys and girls who are the best sons and daughters to look after their fathers and mothers, and, perhaps, also their invalid sisters. Consequently, those citizens of the better class become less vigorous and less able to do their best for the country. They are able to do less than they could otherwise do in the development of the country, because of their contributions to the maintenance of their parents or the sick members of their family. But, under this system of ours, the independence of the fathers and mothers is maintained, and the best men and women in the community are left free to apply themselves to their various avocations in life; to devote themselves to labour, to purchase machinery, to expand production and industry, and thereby to increase the wealth of the community.

In the next place, they say that there is unexampled extravagance on the part of the Commonwealth Government. ments necessarily contradictory? plain, further, that we are not borrowing money. That statement is true. They urge against us that we are sustaining capital charges out of our annual income. We have been doing that successfully, and honourable members opposite know it.

But as a question has been asked concerning the referenda, I think it is only fair that I should not sit down without saying a word about them. It is, in my opinion, a national question, and one that it is absolutely necessary to settle, that this Parliament should have larger powers. The advisableness of this Parliament having power to pass one company law for Australia is obvious. A person wishing to invest money in this country should be able to know exactly what the conditions are. By that means greater security will be . given to investments, the wheels of industry will turn quicker, employment will be greater in volume, and complications will be avoided. There are six company laws in operation in Australia now. By passing a Commonwealth law at present we should merely make a seventh. I believe that when the question is properly explained to the people, they cannot fail to give this Parliament larger powers. In regard to trade and commerce, the honourable member for Flinders' has been bold enough to express the opinion that the arm of the great United States Federation is paralyzed because of the absence from the Federal Government of such' powers as we seek. The Attorney General has urged, in speeches reported in Hansard, and'from many platforms in the country, the necessity of endowing this Parliament with larger powers in respect of trade and commerce, both as regards trade between State and State and trade IntraState. those matters now. able to. I hope the people will give us those larger powers that we require. want now. late as to Intra-State trade. Then there is the question of industrial powers, which Further, I have already touched upon. The desirableness of an amendment of the Constitution in that respect is obvious. NowI come to another phase of the amendment that has been launched in this peculiar way by the honourable member for Ballarat. This motion of want of confidence in the Government was submitted as an amendment of the Address-in-Reply to the Speech deI shall leave the queslivered by His Excellency, after I had told the honourable member that if such a motion were submitted, I should accept it as, and give the Opposition all the advantages of a debate on, a motion of want of confidence. As I said at the time, we do not intend to accept the amendment, and I wish now to emphasize the point that, since the only charge made against the Government is that they did not send troops to Brisbane on the occasion of the strike, every honourable member who votes for this amendment will be voting in favour of the sending of troops on that occasion. Nothing is plainer. In the whole of the long speech made by the Leader of the Opposition there is only one accusation. The honourable gentleman says that we have failed to deal with the industrial unrest, but the main complaint hidden under the verbiage of the amendment is, "" You did not send troops to Brisbane, and because of that failure you are to be condemned."" troops in Brisbane? Government require to send troops? orable member for his interjection. The right honourable member might have a chauffeur in another part of Melbourne, and require his attendance here. If he did, he would have to direct that he be sent here. We had troops at Brisbane, but we did not intend to employ them against the civilians of Australia. We prefer to maintain them to fight the enemies of our country, and we certainly had no wish to employ them when it was quite unnecessary to do so. I repeat that those who vote for this amendment will declare that they would have supported the sending of No t as we ought to be troops to Brisbane at the time of the recent industrial trouble.

We have been told by the Opposition that Providence has been smiling on us, but did not smile on them. Two more quotations, and I shall have finished. The Governor General, in opening the Parliament on 20th February, 1907, when the Deakin Ministry was in power, saidI t affords me much pleasure -congratulate you on a period of unprecedented prosperity throughout the Continent. Finally, on 3rd July of that year, while the Deakin Ministry were in ofiice, we had in His Excellency's Speech the statement thatLast year was one of great prosperity throughthe matter? out the Commonwealth. I can add nothing to these references to the bounty of Providence, and, in conclusion, have only to thank honourable members for the kindly attention they have given me.

Of course, my ""honourable friends need not stay unless they -choose. The Prime Minister complained ithat the Opposition is making its attack in its own way, and not as he would wish it :to be made, and he said that he had been .given nothing to answer. Before the dehate is concluded he will be satisfied -that every portion of the plaint has been -opened up. His reply to the speech of >the Leader of the Opposition was not an answer to it.

As to the Brisbane e strike, he would have us believe that every one connected with it was an angel, and that nothing occurred to which exception could be taken; that every one responsible for the laying idle of Brisbane was merely an injured innocent. Here is one fact 1 should like him to note, and to inquire into. The honourable member for Moreton was good enough while the strike was in progress to send me a telegram conveying information about it. There was nothing in his message which might not have been proclaimed from the house-tops, but he was surprised to hear it quoted from the window of the Trades Hall in Brisbane the next day, and to hear a statement to the effect lo that the strikers had their own men in all the Government Departments, who supplied them with information, and enabled them to get ahead of the Ministry every time. ber for Moreton make a complaint about quiry made. Mt. JOSEPH COOK -He got no redress. I heard of this only the other day, because the telegram reached me as I was on the point of leaving home, and I did not reply to it. ber vouch for the facts? what I have stated, and I do not think that any honourable member would suggest that the honourable member for Moreton would say what was not true. If I do not say anything more regarding the Brisbane strike, it is because I wish to meet the complaint of the Prime Minister by obliging him with criticism on other matters besides those already referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. But before proceeding further, I offer my congratulations to the newly-elected member for Werriwa on his maiden speech. Through the action of the Labour party in applying a gag to the press, the public was not much informed about what took place during the Werriwa campaign. There were about ten members of the party, stationed in various parts of the electorate in charge of districts, who, knowing that the newspapers would not report them, said some very strange things-thing s which surprised even me.

The Prime Minister made some rather tall statements in the Werriwa division, to which I shall not refer just now, but I should like to draw attention to an utterance by the honourable member for Adelaide.

My honourable friends, I am afraid, for this reasondo not in their hearts take very much comfort from it. The honourable member for Werriwa told us the other day that their party had polled eight votes more than they did on the last occasion. With the place f u l l of politicians, and with two years to carry out all their humanitarian schemes, eight votes was all the plus they could muster. While they polled eight votes more for their party, we polled 1,500 votes more for ours. They are quite entitled to get all the comfort they can out of the election. Another fight or two like that one, and they will have' to come out of their comfortable positions and return to their * screaming farce over here.

In the Northern Territory are to be found the greatest problems which problems will be with us for many years to come, so that everything depends upon the character of the appoint ments which we make now. A mistake by sending the wrong men there at the present juncture will not be remedied for many years to come. Consequently, it is of the highest consequence that, irrespective of the position of any applicant, irrespective of the money which we may have to pay, the very best men in die Commonwealth should find their way to the Northern Territory. Is Mr George Ryland one of the best land experts in Australia? Is he of others who would have eagerly accepted the position to which he has been appointed if they had had an opportunity of doing so? So far as I can see, Mr Ryland was sent there merely because he lost his seat in the Queensland State Parliament, and because he happened to be an erstwhile colleague of the Prime Minister in the representation of the constituency of Gympie. We have come to a pretty pass when the highest appointments in the Commonwealth must be given to men for no other reason than that they have been unfortunate enough to lose their positions prepared to say at the poll. ing to it. that the passport to the best appointments They are all in the Commonwealth is to be rejected by the people.

I wish to say nothing against him. I believe him to be a very good man, but I do not believe that he is the man who should have been sent to the Northern Territory. All the tropical agricultural experience which he has had, so far as I am aware, has been gained in the office of the Agricultural Gazette in New South Wales.

I agree that they have falsified the statements of their opponents, but they have only done so by falsifying the statements made by their own people on the platform. NowI come to this precious bank -abou t the only thing they have left to crow about! It is a great success, they say; and we are told that everything has been done on sound banking lines. I desire to contrast their statements in this respect with the statements they made to the people of the country, Above all, we are concerned in carrying out our promises to those, who sent us here. It is the first principle of democracy, and of representative government, that we should pay some respect to what we promised the people on the hustings, and on the faith of which we got their support. Here are the statements of the party behind the Government at the last election. The Brisbane Worker, commenting on the proposal to establish the bank, saidThe establishment of a bank of issue, deposit, extinguish the other banks without com-exchange ancl reserve would be a big step towards making the Australian nation master of its own currency and liberate its citizens from the talons of the money power. Then, in a manifesto issued in Victoria at the centralized financial institution of Australia. the same time, we readBanking is one of the frauds by which capithose Christian brethren to be in the least aptalism bleeds the people.

Then, later on, only the other day, Senator whom there can be no cavil as to his Pearce, in Western Australia, saidIn respect of the Federal Bank and Savings Bank system the Government was simply fighting monopoly and boodle. That is what is said by honourable members opposite when they go' on to the platforms in the country; but how do they act? When in the Werriwa electorate the other day, the Honorary Minister, the honourable member for Adelaide, said there never was such a Government as the present oneprosperity had crowned the country since the Government took office, and everything that Ministers had done was for the welfare and success of the community-so much so, said the Minister, that the banks were now paying better dividends, and all the large companies were doing better than ever they did. Hear those Labour champions in the country alleging that, as a result of their legislation, the banks they had set out to fight and extinguish-to stop the bleeding of the people-ar e now bleeding the people more than e%'er, inasmuch as their dividends are better than ever before! Then as to the trusts, which this Government set out to curb or demolish, the Honorary Minister, followed by an ex-member of this House, Mr Hall, who is now a State Minister, said that the large companies of Australia were more successful than ever before. Are these Labour arguments? If so, what becomes of their programme? I thought this was to be a people's bank; but it turns out that it is not a people's bank at all. It is to be a bankers' bank. Here is what they have done, according to the Minister of Home Affairs-the great banker of the MinistryMany people say it will be detrimental to the existing trading banks.

All that I wish for him is that he may have a career which will be prosperous, ancl as long as he pursues the sane and safe policy that he has already sketched out for himself I shall not make very much complaint. As to the bank itself, the Prime Minister is going about the country trying to make us believe that honourable members on this side have always been opposed to the establishment of a national bank, and that we have always been opposed to a Commonwealth note issue. He has been trying to make the country believe that all the measures which have been passed since this Government came into office have been passed in the teeth of the Opposition; whereas the contrary is the case. able member take the proposals submitted to Parliament by this Government as they were brought down to the House, and contrast them with the proposals which have been placed upon the statute-book, and he will see that there is nothing very funny about my statement. He will see that that legislation has been shaped and moulded by the criticism of honourable members on this side. To say, therefore, to the country that the Commonwealth Bank and the Savings Bank as they exist at present have been established in the teeth of the Opposition is not true. Nothing of the kind is the case. It will not be found that views have been expressed on this side against the bank as such after the proposals of the Government had been amended and safeguarded as we thought they ought to be; and it is most ungracious of my honourable friends to go to the people of the country and tell them that the Government had to jam these banks down the throats of this House. The contrary is the case. The Opposition has moulded and shaped these measures, and has given them the safeguards they have to-day. member and his party ought to remain on the Opposition benches. why the country should be grateful to a competent Opposition. I think I am entitled to make this statement, because one of the charges made by the Prime Minister, when in the Werriwa electorate the other day, was that we had in this country a feeble Opposition, without any policy. Why he. of all men, should begin to measure the intellectuality and status of other people is beyond comprehension. But let that pass. I do not hesitate to say that the Note Issue Bill was amended drastically as the result of discussion in this House. What, after all, is this precious Note Issue Act considered from the point of view of a Labour measure? Is it any longer a Labour measure? What Labour purpose is it serving? Is it bringing any more grist to the mill of the worker? Is the worker obtaining any more wages because of the passing of that Act? How does it affect him in his daily life? It is quite true that this Government have issued Commonwealth notes, and have got from the banks nearly £10,000,000 in sovereigns. It is quite true, also, that they have lent out something like half of that amount to the States, and are receiving interesf upon it. The remainder is in the Treasury till. I am told that the seals are on it, and that no one can get at it. I am inclined to think; however, that the Treasurer is going to get some of it very shortly. At the end of last session he succeeded in passing a Loan Bill, which enables him to take some of that money, in excess of the stipulated reserve, whenever he chooses to do so, and I understand that he intends to supplement his other financial resources from the money which he says is no longer needed as a backing for the Australian note issue. I mentioned this at Werriwa the other day, when I tried to trace this matter to its economic issue. I asked, for instance, who was paying the interest that the Treasurer is obtaining on the money loaned to the States. Are the States paying it? They are. But where do they get the money with which to pay it? Out of the pockets of the workers of Australia -ou t of the Consolidated Revenue. And where is the difference to the working men of Australia between the Government adopting that course and floating a straightforward loan in the money market? member talking of the working men of Australia ! to consider the matter from the point of view of the workers? shall begin to think that the honourable member is in earnest if he keeps on speaking in this way.",44,Foster Tha T Is Not A As Good A Man As Hundreds And Thousands

When we come to consider the banking and note issue question from the point of view of die working men of Australia, whose sole guardians the Government claim to be, we find the position ludicrous in the extreme. What does the Treasurer claim for the Note Issue Act? fit that has resulted to Australia is, according to him, that the Government have made a profit of £1:83,000 by loaning at interest the sovereigns they have obtained from the banks for nothing. My remark at Werriwa was that the Government had given the banks an I 0 U for this £10,000,000, and that they proposed, under the Loan Act, later 011 to send some further I 0 U's into the Treasury vaults, and to bring the money on to the counter of the upper chamber, and with it pay the expenses of the construction of works by the Government. Is that a misstatement of the facts ? believe; the Prime Minister is going to do this. By means of his note issue he has obtained from the banks practically £10,000,000 in gold. minus that amount with which to earn dividends; yet their dividends, according to Ministers, are greater than ever they were. The moment the banks lost the use of this £""10,000,000 in gold they had to re-adjust their interest-bearing deposits. They must pay less for their money, or charge their customers more for it. At all events, as the result of losing this £10,000,000 in sovereigns to the Government, they are paying, not less, but larger, dividends, and it is but small consolation to the busiin, and that a board of control instead of ness men, the farmers, and others of Australia, that they have to pay a bigger rate of interest on their overdrafts as the result of this splendid financing on the part of the Commonwealth Government. claims that he is making a profit of .£183,000 per annum, he is not making a penny. The whole of that amount has to be paid by the people of this country ; but instead or paying it direct to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, they are paying it to the State Treasurers, who are passstatement that there was no room in the ing it on to the Commonwealth Treasury. the Jews, they are passing it on to the Federal Government. £183,000 a year, what does it matter to me whether I pay it to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth or to a Jewishfinancier? If I had to pay it to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, would I have in my pocket any more than I should have if I paid it to a Jew? When we come down to the economic position of this matter, we The only benecannot find one farthing of reform in the whole Commonwealth bank system or the Australian note issue. It may be a very good thing from a financial point of view. I do not say it is not. But when my honourable friends opposite, who are dying to help the workers of this country, tell them that the establishment of another bank is going to help them, they are talking moonshine, and they ought to know it. Sitting suspended front 6.2g to 7.45 p.m. the appointments of which I have spoken, I wish to repeat that my only ground of criticism is that the persons chosen were not the best who could have been obtained for the positions to be filled. So far as the Commonwealth Bank is concerned, I hope that it may be a success; but if it becomes successful, it will be in spite of The banks are the bungling of Ministers. When the Bank Bill was before us, I pointed out that the Governments of the States, if their cooperation could be obtained, would help to establish the institution, and I suggested that the Prime Minister should invite them to join with him. ber knows that they would not join with him. that the States should be invited to come a governor should be provided for, to enable them to be adequately represented in the management of the institution. I pointed out that their financial business, their current accounts and loan arrangeAlthough the Treasurer ments, would do much to make the bank a success from the start,; and stated that there is room for a National Bank* to do legitimate and bond fide national business. My suggestion was ignored.

That was a clear intimation to the States that they must remove their savings banks from the post-offices. Now, having established the Commonwealth Bank, the Prime Minister is doing what I suggested should be done before the bank was established. (Having treated the Governments of the States most cavalierly, he is now inviting them to assist him, and they do not seem disposed to do so. Their attitude is, "" You have told us to go out of the post-offices, and we are going. You would not consult us when establishing the Commonwealth Bank, and you cannot have our business now."" As a result, the Commonwealth Bank has a hard time ahead of it, and will not make profits for a long while. This result will be due to the way in which the Government has treated the States in the establishment of the bank. bank, by good management arid control, will gradually obtain the business of the States. It must do so to become a National Bank. The States have the business which could make the bank a success from the start. It is stated in the Governor General's Speech, and was repeated by the honourable member for Indi, that the Federal land tax is operating very satisfactorily, land being cut up and sold in large quantities because of the tax. According to the honourable member-quotin g from a monthly bulletin-£22,000,00 0 worth of .land has been made available for settlement by the subdivision of large estates; but the statement is not supported by figures. The table which he quoted needs explanation. It is stated that £18,000,000 worth of land was sold up to the end of September; but, apparently, only £9,250,000 worth had been purchased up to the end of May. We are not told who the purchasers are. It is generally known that persons holding land in common have -had their shares divided in order to escape taxation as far as possible. done nothing to increase settlement. The Commonwealth Statistician, when asked for a summary of the statistics which have been furnished to another honourable member, replied'HerewithI have pleasure in forwarding copy of summary of Australian statistics, on pages 34 and 35 of which is given the latest official information with regard to land tax. No official statement has been published concerning acreage subdivided by owners as a result of the tax. MK. Jostfli Cook. The statement made by the honourable member for Indi is his own interpretation of the figures, and is not a fair one under the circumstances. I shall Be glad to learn that settlement is increasing rapidly in Australia. Many of the large estates in the Commonwealth should be cut up to allow of closer settlement. But I again say that it would have been better to leave this matter to the States, because they have at their command administrative resources which would have enabled them to act in a very much more effective way than the Commonwealth Government are doing. twenty years in not dealing with it. like that does not prove anything. I am only concerned now with showing that this table of figures quoted by the honourable member for Indi, and made so much of by I hope that, ultimately, the the Government, has no substratum of fact to support it. It has been claimed that £22,000,000 worth of land has been sold and purchased, whereas, according to these figures, ,£18,000,000 worth has been sold up to the end of September. On the purchasing side, there is only ,£9,250.000 worth accounted for. through that report. more to read that I know of. number of that bulletin? bulletin issued in April, 1912, which the honourable member quoted from. the 30th June, 1911. is.

It includes all the operations of selling and buying land which take place in the Commonwealth. I have not the figures, with me, but it will be shown later, I believe, But those subdivisions have that no more land is being sold and bought in Australia to-day than has been the case for some years past. the land tax is not high enough ? gument in that snigger.

The estimated revenue from the tax this year is only .£111,000 less than, the estimated revenue from it last year. Everybody knows that arrangements have been made during the course of the year whicn would account for infinitely more than that. Land held in common has been divided under separate titles, and thus the tax has been evaded. I venture to say that that operation alone would account for more than .£100,000. It would more than make up this difference, to say nothing of the decision of the Court, which has operated against the collection of this revenue to the extent anticipated by the Treasurer. Under this land tax, which was supposed to break up the large estates in Australia, when all these adjustments have been made, and, despite the decision of the Court, there will it go at reasonable prices and on reasonable still be collected this year £1,303,328. There is no evidence in these figures that the tax is bursting up the large estates. how my honourable friends plead for time when they are on the Ministerial benches. These things, then, are no longer urgent. Rut everything was urgent when they were in Opposition. Their attitude on this matter reminds me of their attitude towards the Post Office. When they were upon this side of the House a crisis occurred every month or two in regard to the Postal Department, but now that they are upon the opposite side of the chamber things are all right in the Post Office. We have had sheaves of papers laid upon the table, with a view to proving how well off the Post Office employees are; notwithstanding that to-day they are seething with discontent, and are no nearer the end of their troubles than they ever were. But more of that anon. How many more years must elapse before the revenue from I invite honourable members the land tax becomes a substantially diminishing quantity. It is idle to impose such a tax if it does not achieve its purpose. Yet the fact is that Mr Beeby says that the New South Wales Government will have to take the matter in hand and to deal drastically with land-owners for the purpose of opening up lands for settlement. other day, in the honourable member's own electorate. present, and he did not say that. Beeby sayLarge holders must bring themselves face to face with the fact that these huge areas must give way to closer settlement. These estates cannot be broken up by the repurchase system. Something more drastic must be done. In the coming session the Government will place before the House a scheme which will be fair to the big man who owns the land to-day, but it will place upon him a far more serious responsibility when we construct new railways. We will force him to give up his land and let it go at reasonable prices and on reasonable terms. Does the honourable member say that he did not make those statements. use the word ""drastic."" We will force him to cut up his land and let terms? Mr Beeby will correct the press reports at the earliest possible moment. Up to the present, he has not attempted to do so. All the newspapers report him in the same way. According to another journal he stated thatThe policy of the Government was no longer to purchase large estates for closer settlement, but it might pass legislation to compel large owners to subdivide on their own account.

I am obliged to the Prime Minister for having supplied me with these figures, because they prove that the tax is not interfering with the revenue that has been derived from it in any substantial way, having regard to the arrangements which have been made by persons who held land in common, and having regard also to the decisions of the Court which have had an adverse effect upon the revenue. Then we heard from the honourable member for Indi some statements in reference to immigration. He stated that the Government are not opposed to immigration. The Prime Minister has said the same thing; in fact, he has stated that they are in favour of immigration. But the honourable member for Indi saidI think I can say, not only for myself, but for every member of the party with which I have the honour to be associated, thut we believe lhat in Australia there is room for twenty or thirty millions of people. A little later on he saidUntil every mother's son in this country who is able and willing to go upon the land has his wants supplied, I believe it would be a right attitude for a Federal Government to take up to discourage others from coming here.

That, I take it, is tantamount to saying that we do not wish for immigrants for years to come-that they may be allowed to go to Canada, into which country they are pouring at the rate of 400,000 a year. 8,000,000 or 9,000,000 of people in Canada as against 4,500,000 in Australia.

Instead of the miscellaneous system of nominated immigrants, an officerpossessing the confidence of .the trades-union movement had been sent to England to select men, particularly in view of the railway works that the Government intended to carry out within the next three or four years, and to see that they were sound unionists. Here we have preference to unionists in immigration ; and, in this connection, there is a singular fact. When, some time ago, Sir George Reid asked for the assistance of a journalist to write advertisements in London, a man was selected who was associated Mr Holman clinched this matter by selecting Mr Andy'Spence, secretary of the Bread Carters Union, to go Home and help to select immigrants. Thus we have selected a man from the Trades Hall, who does not 'believe in immigration, to write immigration advertisements, and a Trades Hall representative to pass the immigrants. How many immigrants are We' to get under such conditions'? this. Government. vernment sent Home a man to write the advertisements. . talking of the advertising from the High Commissioner's office, with which this Government have to do. They sent Home a man who was associated with the Trades Hall; and we know that the Trades Hall is .against immigration, hip and thigh. Then, as I say, the New South Wales Government, clinched the matter by-sending The mobbing another Trades Hall man to pass the immigrants. This is the attitude' of the Western Australian Labour Government to-wards immigrationThe Labour Government's attitude towards immigration is indicated by the proposal to abolish the Immigrants Home in Perth; to house new arrivals in the dilapidated Old Men's Home in Fremantle, and to break up the Immigration Bureau Staff. The fewer immigrants the better-that is -the policy of the Labour party. It is said that the present Commonwealth -Government is not against immigration; but when they were asked by the. States to take the only step they could take in the present circumstances, the proposal. was "" turned down."" What for? Here is the statement of the Prime MinisterThe resolution of the recent Premiers' Conference quoted in your communication appears to amount to a recommendation that the Commonwealth Government should contribute a sum of approximately £150,000 per annum to the cost of the wqrk of introducing immigrants to Australia, now carried out by the State Governments, without, however, altering any of the other arrangements incidental to that policy. What other arrangement does the Prime Minister desire altered? He will not even say what he wants. What other arrangement incidental to a policy of immigration does he desire? Does he wish to have control of the lands of the State, so that he may send immigrants direct to these lands? Is that what he has at the back of'his mind ?

Almost every day we read of a fresh instance in the Old Country of the co-operation of which I,am speaking, and .it has never been. discontinued where tried.

As, to the Warrego, all. arrangements were made for putting her together on Cockatoo Island before her .parts were landed in, Australia, and no action of mine affected the matter. I had plenty to do during the eleven months that I was in' office. This Government has contracted with the' Government of ""New South 'Wales for the building of an unarmoured cruiser, fdr_ which the term of twertfy-two months is to be allowed. The report of the Defence Conference contradicts the statement that our scheme of naval defence was initiated by this Government. We are told in it thatUnder certain conditions the establishment of local defence flotillas, consisting of torpedo craft and submarines, might be of assistance in time of war to the operations of the fleet. The Government had no fleet unit or anything beyond the small vessels which, in the report, are called "" adjuncts to a fighting fleet."" Such flotillas cannot co-operate on the high WhatI suggest would assist the seas in the wider duties of protection of trade and preventing attacks from hostile cruisers ancl squadrons. The operations of destroyers and torpedo boats are necessarily limited to tlie waters near the coast, or to a radius of action not far distant from a base, while there are great difficulties in manning such a force and keeping it always thoroughly efficient. A scheme limited to torpedo craft would not in itself, moreover, be a good means of gradually developing a self-contained fleet capable of both offence and defence. It is said that even as a beginning the establishment of such a fleet would be unwise. The fleet unit to be aimed at should, therefore, in the opinion of the Admiralty, consist at least of the following :-Armoured cruiser (new "" Indomitable"" class which is of the Dreadnought type). . . . Honourable members opposite sneer at the idea of constructing a Dreadnought, but that, according to the experts, should be formation of a fleet unit. Other vessels should be laid down so that they might be finished simultaneously with the armoured cruiser. The construction of the armoured cruiser should be undertaken as soon as possible, and the remaining vessels should be constructed under conditions which would insure their completion, as nearly as possible, simultaneously, with the completion and readiness for service of the armoured cruiser, which it is understood would be in about two and a half years. It is three years since the armoured cruiser was arranged for, and it is, I believe, only awaiting the completing fittings. ' It was arranged for before this Government took office. Now Ministers are letting a contract for an' unarmoured cruiser, to be finished within twenty-two months. It will therefore not be finished until five years after its construction was first projected. It has taken this Government, therefore, five years to complete one of the subsidiary vessels of this fleet. That kind of administration wants speeding up at the earliest possible moment.

565,Mr Joseph Cook,"I do not preI the Fisher Government for land defence set out in their Gympie proposals, and elaborated later in a way by Senator Pearce. It is quite true that the honourable member for West Sydney must be given the credit of agitating the question of compulsory training before almost anybody else in the Chamber; but it is also equally true that his proposals were absolutely unworkable. them to be so. JHe wanted to train everybody between the years of fourteen and forty-five fourteen clays per annum, and make them train for nothing. He himself declared, later, that the scheme had to be put aside. While he is entitled to all the credit for originating the notion in this Chamber, when his colleagues were cutting out of existence the standing army we were supposed to have, when they did destroy every semblance of naval defence, and laid down the proposition that something under £[600,000 a year should suffice for land defence, his voice was one amongst all his party. As a Government, my honourable friends can take no credit for the present schemes of defence. Give the honourable member for West Sydney all the credit which is due to him.' Do not detract one iota from it. When you have said that, you are quite justified in saying that for organizing the schemes of defence which are being carried out the previous Government, of which I had the honour to be a member, must be given the sole credit. This Government is carrying them a little further. Let them have the credit which is due, but do not let them make those impudent assertions which they are constantly making on the platforms, that tbese are their own schemes. They are nothing of the kind. My honourable friends are carrying out the schemes of other people, and are entitled to whatever credit good administration merits. needs criticising to-day, and is going to get a little more criticism than ft has had. Here is one instance of the administration. It takes the Government five years to build a subsidiary cruiser. A new policy of administration altogether wants inaugurating in regard to the building of this fleet. The Government are spending almost £5,000,000 per annum on defence, as against their own .scheme, which, as set out in the table here, would have, meant this year an expenditure of £1,900,000 odd. The land scheme was to be carried right have here, too, the scheme of up to 1917-18, and their training was not to extend beyond the twentieth year, either. Everything after that year up to 191S, where their schemes went to, was to be on a purely voluntary basis; and all the men were to get for the training was 12s. 6d. per week at the very highest. These are their schemes which we had to brush aside. The present schemes are ours. Without going into any greater elaboration, when I He confessed see this Government spending nearly £[5,000,000, instead of less than £2,000,000, I say "" Good' luck to them."" I will not be over captious and over critical, but will get behind them as far as the substantial side of their administration goes, while they pursue this course. I only lodge an objection when now, at this time of day, they want to jump every bit of credit for the schemes which are at present in operation. With regard to this programme generally, there is nothing of reform contained in it Nothing of reform is intended except the one thing relating to the referenda. If they do not get their proposals'put through at the next election, they will not have anything to do in the next Parliament. The referenda is to be the be-all and the end-all of the next battle at the polls, because the Government cannot go on witnout the proposed alterations of the Constitution, so they say. They cannot move, hand or foot, the Attorney General has previously said,until the referenda proposals are put through. It will be our dutyto interpose objections when the time . comes to the proposals, believing, as we do, that the adjustment of the relations between the States and the Commonwealth can be so arranged as to lead to co-operative, harmonious and united work, instead of friction such' as is contemplated by my honourable friends. We do not need to That administration strip the States of every vestige of power to make the Constitution a success. That is the main fundamental issue between us. They want to destroy the Federal character of the Constitution; we want to maintain that character, making such adjustments and developments from time to time . as the growing requirements of Australia shall show to be necessary. That'is the issue to be submitted at the next election. My own opinion is that the people will decide in no uncertain way. Already they are telling honourable gentlemen opposite that they ought not longer to be there. Already they have shown the Labour party that the confidence of the people has been withdrawn. Already they have said, in unmistakable terms, "" We gave you our confidence, and you.did not make good."" I believe that an opportunity is only wanted for the people to sweep away this Administration and put in a Government that will not make fulsome promises which they are afterwards not able to perform, but will carry on in the paths of sanity and progress and moderation to the infinite advancement of this country. make a personal explanation. In his speech, the honourable member for Parramatta attributed to me words which I said I did not use. He said that in seconding the Address-in-Reply, I stated that '' that we have falsified the statements of our opponents."" When I referred to Hansard to prove that I did not use the words, the honourable member said that if the' statement was not in Hansard it must have been edited out of the report. I naturally took that remark as a reflection, not only upon myself but upon Hansard as well. I hold in my hand the Hansard proof of my speech, and there is no foundation for the charge made by the honourable member that such a statement had been edited out of the report. word of explanation in order to clear up this matter. I withdraw the statement in its entirety. It is not a statement of substance, any way. If does not matter a straw to anything I said. If the honourable member assures me that he did not use the words; I am prepared at once to say that I must have made a mistake. Mr 'HUGHES (West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [9.14] I desire to offer my congratulations, both to the Leader of the Opposition and to the honourable member for Parramatta, for their two most excellent speeches, both characteristic of the men and their manner; the one redolent of his ancient eloquence and full of those lofty and ambiguous references to events other than those which are before the Chamber; and the other characterized by that sweeping indictment of those who happen to be associated witb this side, and that force with which he invests all his utterances that makes him always worth listening to. I think they make an admirable pair. One seems' to be always . building inaccessible mansions in the skies, and the other is always consigning his opponents to perdition. The honourable gentlemen between them have said a very great deal, and it would be difficult to attempt to traverse even a tithe of their utterances. There are but two or three matters which I shall attempt to deal with. I shall not attempt to-night to touch on the matter connected with the Coal Vend case. "" Since my Department has been impugned, I am particularly anxious that what I have to say on that point should have the publicity given only to utterances made at an earlier hour There ar two matters to which I shall e refer this evening. One is the Brisbane strike, already thoroughly dealt with by my right honourable leader. I wish, to add only one or two words to what he has said. The Leader of the Opposition said a very great deal about the Brisbane strike. Amongst other things, that we had failed in our duty, and that a very lamentable and serious state of affairs arose at that time as a consequence of our dereliction of duty. The right honourable the Prime Minister has dealt with and refuted this charge in detail. We have heard a great deal about our constitutional obligations. AllI wish to do is to explain the law in relation to the constitutional obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to supply troops in cases where domestic violence exists in States. Having done that, I shall leave the Brisbane strike alone. It is perfectly true that in certain circumstances it is the duty of the Commonwealth, under the Constitution, to supply the military forces for the purpose, where a State is unable to do it, of suppressing domestic violence. But before that can be done several conditions require to be fulfilled. One of them is that the Governor of the State in which it is asserted that domestic violence exists must issue a proclamation making that statement. Subsequent to the issue of that proclamation there must be an application made to the Commonwealth Government, in whose discretion the matter then lies. There is no duty cast upon the Government of the Commonwealth to send troops whether they will or whether they will not. But there are these two conditions-on e that a proclamation shall be issued by the Governor of the State; and, secondly, that having been done, and the matter having thus been brought under the notice of the Commonwealth, that an application shall be made to them for military assistance.

I wish to say no more about the Brisbane incident. There it is. We are not asked to approve it, yet it is easily understood. Mr Badger is a man., I suppose, of very strong convictions, and he had his own idea about the wearing of a badge, whilst the tramway employees had theirs. Theii views did not coincide. If I had been a tramdriver, or the honourable member for Ballarat and I had been tram-drivers, I am sure that both of us would have been inclined to go out on strike. It is all very well for persons who are able to live in sheltered nooks and glass houses to censure strikes; but let any man be compelled to work for a bare living wage, and exposed to the taunts, the pin-pricks, and the irritating tactics of an industrial tyrant, and he will throw wisdom to the winds, and engage in a strike. The honourable member for Parramatta dealt with still another questioij. He said, ""You have imposed a land tax, and it has not done any good. There is no moie land-indeed , there is less-unde r cultivation to-day than there was previously."" He said, further, that round about the great cities land was still held by large owners, showing that that land tax had done no good. AllI can say is that the information at my disposal does not coincide with his. As to the land under cultivation in the year ] 909, the year before the tax, there were 9,891,243 acres, and in 1:911, the year after the tax, there were 11,893,838, being an increase in a year and a half of 2,002,395. Further, it is to be remembered that we see the operation of the land tax for only some seven months, that is, up to the 30th June, 1911. On that date everybody who owned land was taxed and returned as an owner, and subdivisions since that time would not appear in the land tax returns for this year. We have, therefore, seen the operations of the land tax for little more than half a year, yet its effects are, I venture to say, truly extrawas a man very well known, who had the ordinary. Land long held out of use has been put in use; and an ever growing stream of immigrants have poured into Australia. I desire to point out that in 1908, when the honourable member for Ballarat was in office, the excess of arrivals over departures was 13,150, and that in 1909 this figure had risen to 28,933, while in 1911, which was the first year of the land tax, the number jumped to 77,703. For the first four months of this year the [7]-2 excess of arrivals over departures amounts to 2 5>33 > thus showing, in the most effecz tive way possible, that, under our regime, immigration is steadily increasing in volume. And the immigrants are now able to get something they never could get before, namely, access to decent lands. This represents a tangible and practical policy of immigration. By the honourable gentleman, on the other hand, we have been fed on dreams. We have been supplied with admirable dissertations and orations on immigration and other things, which were not sufficiently attractive to induce immigration to any greater extent than is shown by the figures I have quoted. Of course, the honourable member may, if he likes, say that we have had good seasons. That is very true; and the good seasons are not our fault. The honourable member was in office during many years when there were good seasons, and he had a number ot most excellent chances to pass good, effective legislation for the benefit of the people; but he wasted those chances, and is now seriously concerned because we have not done the like. The people of this country, in spite of the gloomy jeremiads of the honourable member for Parramatta about the people turning against us, have, in the most unmistakable way, proved that they are not so turning. The Werriwa election stands out as a veritable monument. It was an appeal to Csesar'tn excelsis to those people who were addressed by the Sydney and Melbourne press particularly. I mean those people who never voted at previous elections, but who were adjured by the press to "" come u p "" and they "" came up "" in such numbers as have never been seen before. The result was that a Labour candidate was returned. As I am reminded by the Prime Minister, the circumstances of that election were singularly unpropitious to us. We had a candidate quite unknown, opposed to whom additional advantage of a month's start in the canvass. This Opposition candidate is a past-master in election methods, and In regard to immigration, he had spoken about a ruin settling on the land like a pestilence. He had pointed out the very many defects of the Labour party, its sins, vices, and shortcomings; further, he had dwelt on the Caucus rule, and all that it meant behind "" bolted doors,"" and so forth. Still further, this candidate had broken or sprained his ankle in a way calculated to make all chivalric, sentimental persons ""do the right thing"" for h i m ; and yet, in the face of all this, and in the face of the most terrible drought that that part of the country had known since 1902-3, the farmers voted for the Labour man. the face of the Brisbane strike, during which men who belong to our movement had, very naturally, being provoked by rhe tactics of the employers and their Government, done foolish things for that movement, the people supported the Labour party as still better than the Denham party. In Tasmania the Labour party came so near winning that the Government of the day was at the mercy of the gentleman who used to sit just at that pillar opposite. Once, in this Parliament, he had the Government of the day at his mercy. After having lectured Mr Reid for about one hour and three-quarters, consigning him to every imaginable inferno to which a politician can be sent, Mr Cameron decided to support him. To such pitiable depths has the Government in Tasmania been reduced. And this is the decadence of the Labour party ! This is the writing on the wall ! All that I have to say is that it is not capable of several interpretations, like the recent speech of the honourable member for Flinders. opposite has been speaking about strikes. He said that, during our regime, there has been industrial unrest; that we were called into being to settle such discontents, and that we have lived in an atmosphere of them. He quoted from a New South VVales newspaper to show how many strikes there had been. Statistics, of course, are most valuable-if they are carefully selected ! I have taken the trouble to have some prepared, so that I might supply the House and the country with those which the honourable member omitted. I wish to remind the honourable member that, during his regime, there were many strikes. will take only one-the coal strike. ber connect. fhat with our Government ? figures showing the number of days' work lost. multiplied by the number of days lost during the coal strike shows the loss to industry. months.

He went out shortly after, which, I take it, was a dispensation of Providence. The honourable member for Parramatta alluded to the fact that during the two years and two months this Government has been in office, it has had to make some appointments. Apparently, we have been guilty of appointing to office some persons who share our political opinions. When one comes to think of it , that, after all, is not a very singular thing, nor is it a very heinous offence. Why are we here? We are here because our opinions are the opinions of the majority of the people of Australia. Has it come to this then: that the opinions held by the majority of die people of the Commonwealth are such that any person holding them is to be precluded at once from public office or public appointment in this country ? If it is not so, these references to partisan appointments are simply so much hot air. Have honourable members opposite anything to say against the fitness of any individual who has been appointed to any posiMy honourable friend tion? If so, that is another matter entirely. But I challenge honourable members opposite to point to one appointment which we have made where we have chosen an unfit person. for Parramatta gave half-a-dozen instances. Campbell.

Of They never the three appointments made in connection with the Northern Territory-that of Professor Gilruth as Administrator, Mr Bevan as Judge, and Mr Ryland as Director of Lands, it is said that one man holds Labour views. But absolutely no evidence has been brought before the House, and there is none forthcoming, to support the charge that we have been, guilty-of making partisan appointments. f t is a baseless statement, made upon platforms by men who ought to, and do, know better, but who seek to make people believe that which is not. true. Their statements would be absolutely discredited if they had not at their backs the great press of Australia. We have seen them lately in such an unholy mess that if they had not had behind them the press of Australia to make explanations, or to cloak up certain matters, they would have been politically tarred and feathered. We have, then, two charges laid against the Government, and both fail. The first is that we have not fulfilled our constitutional obligations in regard to the maintenance of law and order, and the second is that we have made partisan appointments.

No. And yet he was the first appointee that we ever had the opportunity to recommend.
