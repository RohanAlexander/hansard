As I considered that quantity of apples sufficient to meet the consumption of the Commonwealth during the year, I decided that it would be unwise to permit the importation of American apples, especially as Australia has not exported to any country one case of apples during the year. I have called for another return, so that I may know what the consumption of apples has been,and how many cases there are now in stock, with a view to reconsidering the whole matter. the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr McGrath) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of' urgent public importance, namely, The matter was '' The action of the military authorities in giving to the daily press the names and sentences imposed on privates and non-commissioned officers of the Australian Imperial Force for desertion.

I do not wish injustice to be done to our soldiers in France and England, nor that such in justice shall be continued because. I am keeping quiet. We have* decided, the Prime Minister and I , that I shall censor my speech, and that he shall censor his. This gives me the opportunity that I desire to put certain statements before the House. I wish,' first, to draw the attention of honourable members to the action of the military authorities in publishing in the press of Australia every sentence that is imposed upon our soldiers in France and England. this practice On the contrary, grave injury'and injustice is done to the soldiers' loved ones in Australia. upon this question, because of my own experience while in France. was there cases came under my notice in which some of the bravest lads in our Army were sent to military for having offence against the military I have before me the names and battalions of several lads whose cases I shall mention; but I do not propose to give the names. a young private who was in the Pozieres stunt. back for a rest and went into He went into a billet and was billeted by himself. battalion paraded, but he was too ill to attend the parade. battalion received orders to march further back.

F or some reason for which he does not know, he was not called upon to serve a day of his fifteen years sentence, ! but was sent to England, and. is now out here. He lost, however, about .Â£40 as the .result of the incident. In another case, a young soldier, after coming 'out of the Fleurbaix stunt, got drunk.

Our lads ought not to be sent to compounds controlled by other than Australian officers",21,Adjournment Formal Military Punishments
25,Mr Mcqrath.,".and non-conrniissioned officers. One Australian understands another, and-our men are more likely to get better treatment at the hands of their brother Australians than if they are left to others who are not actually in the fighting line. . There is the best of feeling between the Austracomes back on a transport as a first-class lians and those of our Allies who are actupassenger, and when he arrives here he is ally fighting, but, as I have said, there is simply toid that his services are no longer another section that is not too friendly towards the Australians. I am 'anxious that our boys shall be placed in our own -compounds, and that the Government will take action in regard to these heavy sentences of ten years and fifteen years' imprisonment which are published from .time to time in the daily newspapers. Many of the officers at the Front have been on service for a long time, and have done gallant work. Their nerves, however, are shattered, and they are not in a fit state to try our men-no t fit to weigh the evidence, to carefully judge it, and to mete out the punishment that will fit the crime. It is a shame that lads who have been through Gallipoli, and in stunt after stunt in France, should be. sentenced to twelve -months' imprisonment for being away for a few days without leave. A mother saw me to-day about the case of her young soldier son, who had twenty-three days "" A.W.L.""-absen t Avithout leave. Those who have been at the Front, and have had leave, can well understand the feelings of the men when, after month after month in action they get leave. It is not much wonder that they sometimes overstay their leave; the temptation is very great. If they overstay it to any extent they are He does not return to Australia under -sentenced to twelve months in a military compound, and, what is worse, their ""names are published in the newspapers here as those of lads who have practically deserted. I can well imagine the feelings of the mothers and fathers, the sweethearts and relatives, of these boys when they read in the newspapers of the sen. tences that have been meted out to them. Another private who was away without' leave for two months was sentenced to twelve years in a compound. I have been associated with the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) for a long time, and although I have always been -opposed to him in politics, I recognise that he is generally fair. I ask him does he .think it reasonable that one form of punishment should be meted out to privates and non-commissioned officers, and quite another form of punishment to officers? An officer may commit almost any crime, and yet not be sent to a compound. If he is found guilty of an offence, he is returned to Australia. He required. A non-commissioned oflicer or private who has been guilty of the same offence receives a sentence of anything from one year to fifteen years in a military compound, and his sentence is published to the world at large. pendants are left to starve. phase of the question with which-1 shall deal on another occasion. This differential treatment is most unfair. ber say that if an officer is absent without leave, just as a private may be, his offence is treated differently? without leave or breaks a military law he is cashiered. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -He eitlier gets a severe reprimand Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -He either receives a reprimand, a severe reprimand, or is dismissed. The heaviest sentence of all is to be cashiered the service. punishment is inflicted upon an officer. the same conditions as a private, who, after going through the Gallipoli campaign and stunt after stunt in France, is being sent home invalided. He has not to submit to the treatment which such privates have to submit to on a transport, and in some cases the treatment of the privates is not too good. It is aggravating to a private who is returning home invalided to see ou the deck, which he dare not stand upon, Captain or Lieutenant So-and-so, who has been cashiered because he has failed in his duty, but who is treated as a first-class passenger. There is not a word in the press as to the officer's offence and punishment. He comes back here with all the glory of a man who has done gallant service.

31,Mr Mcgrath,"But no otherfor twenty-three days, is sentenced to a term in a military compound, and his sentence is published to the world at large. We might well take a step in advance of the British Army, and I urge the Government to make representations to the Imperial authorities in regard to courts martial. In the French Army there is a private on every court martial constituted to try a private. The private on a court martial is charged with the duty of watching the interests of the privates brought before it, and he sees that they receive justice. The honourable member for New England (Lt -Colonel Abbott) has not had the experience I have had as a private, but he knows that when a lad is brought before a court martial he has to aay ""Yes, sir,"" and ""No, sir""; that he has to stand to attention, that in most cases he cannot put his case very well, and that he has no one to plead for him. If we had privates on such courts martial, I am satisfied that severe sentences would not be so frequently imposed. ' I hope the Acting Prime Minister will see if it is not possible to have a private sitting as a member of any court martial, which is dealing with a private. I do not wish to deal at length with this ought to remember that the very spirit that question. tells me that he has some fairly strong statements from the British Government. I certainly hope that the British Government will never have their own way so far as our Army is concerned. British Government can give British Army officers the right to shoot men for disobeying an order. God forbid that such a power should be given any of our officers. While in England, I visited the House of Commons, and heard a member . of the Conservative party plead for the abolition of such a power. He said, ""I can give you, Mr Speaker, the case of Private So-and-so, whose only decorations are five wounded stripes. As an officer who.has shed his blood for his country, I know that a man is at his best the first time he goes over the parapet. He is not as good on the second occasion, and he is worse still on the third. This lad, with the five wounded stripes, on. the sixth occasion of his going over the parapet,fell by the wayside^ his nerves had gone, and bis punishment was the death . penalty, the man being shot as a coward and a deserter."" I would never give any greater' power to the officers than they have to-day, and we ought to insist that these sentences be reviewed by the civil authorities. We have already given absolutely too much power, and these officers are in absolutely f u ll control. However well they mean, we have to remember that the officer is in the same condition as the private -h e has been through hell intensified, and his nerves are gone; and he is not in a condition to deal wiih cases of the kind. Week after week we see the lists of the heavy sentences passed on our boys, who are doing everything they can for their country, and who, it must be remembered, are placed in worse circumstances in France than are the armies of any of the other Allies. In France, so strong is the demand by the French women and people that their soldiers shall be given leave, the French Government have had to concede the right of every man to go to his home once every threemonths. Our own boys are 13,000 miles away from all they love, and they have been there for a year to eighteen months without a day's leave; and yet, because some of them overstay their leave,they are visited with these heavy punishments. We The Acting Prime Minister causes them to overstay their leave is the spirit that makes them the fine fighting soldiers they are. I feel very strongly on the matterI feel for the loved ones here when they take up the newspapers and see the punishments that The have been inflicted. When I remember how trivial are some of the crimes, I cannot but think what must be> the feelings of some of their friends, who are proud of the fact that their boys are> fighting for their country and the liberties we now enjoy.

Acting Prime Minister has said, and I agree with him, that he cannot see why an officer can f a i r l y be treated differently from a private. In my opinion, instead of the punishment of an officer being lighter, it should be greater, because he is a man of greater experience and responsibility , and he has everything in his favour. is sumcient for an officer to be cashiered ? When that happens he is settled for ever, socially. sentence of twelve years' imprisonment Ke is nearly settled for ever, because when he comes out of prison he finds that his offence is known, and the stigma upon, his character remains. officer, public obloquy of the kind is escaped. I hope that the Acting Prime Minister will deal with this matter, and that all the cases of.men who have been returned to Australia for punishment will be referred to the Committee which he has mentioned. Men who had been sentenced for military offences were sent back from Egypt, and 'as there was, apparently, no proper place for their detention, the Victorians were sent to Pentridge. a Committee to review all sentences, and I believe that if a confidential report were presented it would disclose that, in practically, every case, the Committee recommended a reduction of the sentence. There is one case of special hardship to which I wish to direct the attention of the Assistant Minister for Defence. This case has been brought under my notice, and I have sent particulars' of it to Victoria Barracks. A young fellow was sentenced to imprisonment for two years. I do not know what his offence was, nor do his people. A f t e r the boy had served three or f o u r months of the sentence his mother received word that he had Ibeen wounded in the firin g line. She had received no notification that his sentencehad been reduced, or that her allotment money, which had been stopped from the date of the court martial, was to be continued. Surely, if a man is sentenced to a punishment, and his allotment money is stopped, the authorities have no right to send him back into the firing line. formation about that case. Honourable members on both sides are anxious that fair play should be dealt out to our men. We all have received letters from men stating that they have been for eighteen months or two years in France, and have been unable to get any leave in England. In one case that came under my notice, a young .fellow had been in France for two years without leave. Eventually he was granted leave, and visited friends in Scotland.

Regimental records are produced, and decorations, if the prisoner has any, are admitted and taken into account by the court martial, before, the sentence is passed. The sentence passed by the court martial is not final. It is subject to revision. It is a general rule on active service that if a man is absent for. twenty-one days from his duties in the front line after being warned for thatduty, the sentence is generally two to five years. run up to ten years; I do not remember a case in which the sentence imposed was fifteen years. There must be a majority verdict, and when the sentence is passed, all the papers are sent on to the prisoner's brigadier. Before he confirms the sentence an inquiry is made from the prisoner's battalion commander as to his history and military antecedents. In my experience everything in connection with the case is thoroughly weighed, and the prisoner is given the benefit of any doubt. all round. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -He does, so far as I oould see, speaking from my experience last winter. The honourable member Paeschendale stunt. He knows that the men were fed up; they were suffering from overwork and over strain. Immediately after that stunt, when the units were camped at Ypres and Hooge, we had several cases of court martial for desertion in the face of the enemy and in the field. Within4 or 5 miles of the front line, after Polygon Wood and Paschendaele, we had the unpleasant task of dealing with several men who were absent from their battalions -after those units had been warned for the front line, and who did not take part in those fights. I quite admit with the honourable member for Ballarat that our young Australian soldiers, when suffering from over strain and overwork, may commit a military offence that probably they would not commit in their ordinary frame of mind and in possession of their normal strength. One sees this particularly in the case of the younger . members of the units. mentioned were those of lads of nineteen years of age. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT I did not know that the honourable member was referring to youths. I have seen it more particularly in the case of lads of not mature years. The strain of holding a line is the most nerve-racking and exacting class of work a young man could undertake, and when a "" hop over "" has taken place, especially after a youth has been suffering great privations for perhaps two or three days, his temperament or his physical capacity is not the same as that I have known sentences to of a man of twenty-five years or of thirty years of age. The strain affects him more than it does a man of more mature years. Lt -Oolonel ABBOTT I quite agree with the honourable member that it is a great mistake to send boys of nineteen years of age to Prance to take part in these affairs. In cases WhereI have been connected with courts martial these circumstances have been taken into account, and although there has been technical desertion and punishment has had to be inflicted, we were entitled to put in -recommendations, which we did on several occasions, for mercy to be extended to the prisoners by the brigadier. S certain elass of offence the minimum punishment is five years? Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -That is quite correct. Por desertion in the face of the enemy, for self-inflicted wounds, .and for cowardice in the face of the enemy the minimum sentence is, generally, five years' imprisonment, but if there were circumstances in alleviation of a crime they could be added to the sentence as a sort of rider or recommendation to the brigadier. In every court martial with which I was connected, if we could see that there was a doubt, or that the soldier had been suffering from over strain and overwork, and was run down generally, a recommendation to that effect invariably went on to the higher authority, and took effect. member know in how many instances sentences havp heen upset when they have been reviewed in the Oases that have came out here ?",28,Adjournment Formal Military Punishments

Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -I understand a certain number of sentences being upset here in Australia, but of course omcers who are dealing with these matters in the field have to approach tliem in a cold-blooded sort of way. When a battalion is ordered into the line the orders are received forty-eight hours beforehand, the battalion marches up to the front line by stages, and on the night preceding the talcing over of the line it is in billets 2 or 3 miles back. The lads know what is ahead of them. They know that next day, perhaps, there will be a ""hop over."" The honourable member for Ballarat, who was at Paschendaele, knows what that means. Ninety-five per cent, of 'the men realize what may happen to them. They are taking on the greatest job that any mortal man has ever been asked to undertake-that over"" in the face of the enemy, as our Iboys had to do, against the pill-boxes of the Hindenburg line at Paschendaele. Officers who have had to deal with men who desert think that they are not dealing fairly with those who have borne the brunt of the fighting, and taken the risk of losing their lives, perhaps leaving bereaved widows and children to mourn their loss, if they allow a "" scrimshanker "" or "" cold-footerto responsibilities at the last moment, and be found wanting when the battalion goes into the line. [Extension of time granted.'] able member think of the case of the severe punishment of a man who has gone right through Gallipoli and through every stunt, and whose nerves have gone? Lt -Colonel ABBOTT The honourable member may be referring to a case of particular hardship. I cannot speak as to any of those particular cases. I can only speak of matters that have actually come under my notice on active service, but I can add this: that in most cases where severe sentences were inflicted the balance of sentence was remitted, and the soldiers reported to their battalions after serving not more than three months' detention. The treatment in the cases mentioned by the honourable member for Ballarat seems to have been harsher than that which was meted out in the instances that have come under my notice on active service, but perhaps there were circumstances connected with them that had hot can quite been brought to light. relatives when a man is sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and returns to the firing line after three months, and not a word is heard of it in Australia? It is cruel. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -There is no doubt it is. It may be a matter of policy on the part of the Government to give publicity to those cases in order that it may act as a deterrent; but no matter how long the war lasts there will be a certain number of Australian soldiersand good men, too-wh o will desert, but who, if they were in their ordinary -frame of mind and physical condition, and were able to weigh the matter and the importance of the step they proposed to take, would not do so. If it be deemed right to is, to ""hop publish the names of privates and non-commissioned officers, then the names of. oflicers who commit military offences, and come back here with every eclat and garish display, should also be published. I was pleased to hear the speech last delivered, because it went to show that the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr McGrath) was justified in bringing these evade his matters before the House. I do not propose, at this juncture, to speak on the subject of military punish-, ment at the Front; but I wish to draw attention to one phase of the matter: the deprivation *of wives and children of allowances which would have come, to them but'for the punishment inflicted on the soldiers on whom they were dependent. ' In some cases it happens that these allowances ' are not restored, although the dependants have got word that the soldiers concerned have been back in the Front, and have been wounded. I desire to draw attention to the atrocious treatment by the military authorities of wounded boys who are found guilty of offences when on their way back home. A case has been brought under my notice, with which I had intended to deal during the Budget debate, in which fifteen wounded lads landed at Fremantle.",29,Adjournment Formal Military Punishments

I admit that the suffer for the benefit of the whole, and punishment is a terrible one, but I feel unquestionably it must be made to apthat it must be permitted to stand for pear to a soldier a terrible disgrace to be the sake of the good men who have always found guilty of desertion, and a terrible played tlieir part.

We are proud to hear from the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) that that They were comparatively unabomination of the past, the death penalty, has been abolished so far as Australian soldiers are concerned. There is one phase of this matter that may not rally so strongly as it has impressed me. The medical journals show that this war, nervous diseases-, such as shock and spinal neurasthenia. Men are seriously injured even though absolutely untouched by any missile. Neurologists, who make a special study of nerves, state definitely that many men in that condition are absolutely not answerable for their actions. I know of a case, that of the son of a medical man, who was buried for four hours. He will never do a hand's turn again. He will read a few lines of printed matter, and will have no recollection of what he has read. His life is blasted for ever.

78,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [8.57],"from want of food. This, the most advanced country in the world, should take care that where wives and children allow their breadwinners to go away to fight for their country, they shall never be left short of food, no matter what offence the men commit. I took up some time ago the case of a'woman whose husband, a soldier, was supposed to have been absent without leave, in consequence of which the payments to the wife were suspended. This'woman and her children were sufferingseverely. It was eventually ascertained that the man had not been absent without leave for one day. The ""Defence Department could not be blamed for the mistake, and when it ascertained the facts it made good the payments that had been stopped. Why should not an officer be punished for any offence that he commits, just as' a private is punished? Why sliould an Officer be sacrosanct? Does not such a system come down from the old and vile times when no private or common working man was thought to', be fit for a commission, and when the power of the purse gave a man the right to command others, even where he had to depend on subordinates for guidance as to what he should do? Does it not come down from the vile times when it was thought that no one but a gentleman should be an officer? It is said that there could be no worse punishment for an officer than to be dismissed. There are swanking in the streets and in the ballrooms of Australia to-day officers I know of one who wears a medal-wh o have been cashiered, the service, and the public know nothing of their dismissal. If an oflicer or a private commits murder in civil life he is hanged for i i . Why should there be any different treatment in connection with the Army? Honourable members must have been impressed with the speeches delivered by the two honourable members who have held commissioned rank in the Australian I m perial Forces, as well as by the speech delivered by the honourable member for been fighting at the Front. By all means let officers and men be treated alike. The names of those who are punished should -not be blazoned forth in the public press. Such a practice only means that the wives and dependants of these men have to suffer. If the Censor's Department takes action to eliminate such reports from the press in the future, I shall bless it, although I have often had to curse it. I was sorry to hear that General Birdwood was among those whohad asked for additional power to award punishment. General Birdwood gets a very good name from many of our returned soldiers. him a good name, but all of them do not. that the majority speak well of him, but I am satisfied that the people of Australia will not be pleased when they hear that he is among those who are asking for greater power of punishment. The' statements we have heard to-night will serve to justify the action of those who objected to the proposal of the Government to allow youths of nineteen to enlist without the consent of their parents. The three honourable members of this House who have returned from active service have all declared 'that no one under twenty years of age should be allowed to go to the Front. I was pleased with the greater portion of the remarks made by the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt), but I shall be very sorry if he decides that his speech shall be censored. It is well that Australia should know what he has said to-night. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I hope the public, when they hear of a returned soldier acting as only a lunatic would do, will remember the nerve-racking, experience through which he has passed. I hope they will remember that these men have had to fight with masks, and to contend against a deadly gas which cannot be seen, but which attacks the lungs, one of the most vulnerable parts of tiie human system! They have had to contend with vile instruments of murder which, although deadly in their effect, do not, in the case of shell-shock, for instance, leave even a trace of injury that can be detected by the surgeon. Finally, I hope that the decision of all courts martial will be revised in Australia. A calmer judgment is likely to prevail here, 12,000 miles away from the battle front; and if cases are re-heard we are not likely to have such punishments as have been meted out to Australian soldiers, and which are disgracing and spoiling the name of Australia to-day.

Many people think that the Government deal very harshly with cases of the kind that have been brought under notice to-night; but every soldier knows when he goes on active service that to desert in the face of the enemy is one of the most serious offences. being guilty of such an offence. men are f e a r f u l for the timo being, but once they get into action their blood is up and they "" go for all they are worth."" That is my experience of men on active service. ferent to-day-it is the going up and going up the line that tells.

The Acting Prime Minister'said that if in civil life a man is punished for committing an offence, his people have to bear the opprobrium of it . But the position of such a man is different altogether from that of a man who, while fighting for his country, commits, some military offence. A man who is fighting for his country is"" no criminal. He is not like a man who has taken something that does not belong to him, or has systematically embezzled his employer's funds. As an honourable member who has led men in France said to-night, in an evil moment fear may overtake a man going into action, and he clears out. Because that man is a coward, are the whole of liis relatives in Australia to be branded with his cowardice? many cases it is riot cowardice, but nervous fear, that is responsible for his act; b u t it is blazoned forth in the press of Australia that Private So-and-so has received a sentence of twelve years for deserting in the face of the enemy. God knows the sentence itself is bad enough. I suppose these long sentences are intended to act as a deterrent to others. the f u l l term. about' to make.

H a d they returned .after only a few hours' absence without leave, they would have, been sentenced, perhaps, only to pack d r ill , or to confinement to camp, or to fatigue duty, instead of to a term of imprisonment.

As to courts martial, those on the spot know the conditions, and what the actual crimes are -What can we know about this in Australia?

Had the Government nothing to say about this proposed representation in London? Are they ashamed of the proposal, or are they prevented by the Prime Minister from referring to it? I have very great difficulty in ascertaining from the Acting Prime Minister when Mr Hughes proposes to return to Australia. I hope that no one will get the impression that, because I have some remarks to make concerning the Prime Minister's policy, I am attacking him personally. To-night's Herald contains a reference to "" an attack by the honourable member for Capricornia upon Mr Hughes."" I made no attack on Mr Hughes as Mr in the world, appear to be under the imHughes, but I am concerned about the doings of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth in another part of the world. I tried to ascertain from the Acting Prime Minister yesterday when the Prime Minister will return to Australia, and he could not give me even an approximate date. I do not Wonder that the Prime Minister has not returned, because I have read in the press that he has been very well received and entertained, and, as the honourable member for Melbourne interjects, "" How can he leave the duchesses ?"" cable message published a few days ago stated that at a supper given by the British Parliamentary Association to the Australian Prime Minister there were present 1 prince, 2 marquises, 10 earls, 8 viscounts, 25 barons, and 60 knights, so we must excuse the Prime Ministeri f he prolongs his stay in the Old Country. But I take very grave exception to his declaration that he represents the Commonwealth in the speeches he has made upon various matters. In this connection, I observe in the Ministerial statement this paragraph. Tlie members of the National French Misparent a little later; and that it may indeed besion, headed by General Fau, have arrived income, by comparison, in certain instances (by Australia, and are the welcome guests of the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States. Everywhere they are received with popular enthusiasm, and the Government trusts that the visit will cement the ties between the people of this country and the great Republic position? Por example, are they prepared to sell Australian wool to France? In 1913 France bought Â£6,087,941 worth of greasy wool and Â£1,341,915 worth of scoured wool, or a total of Â£7,429,856. The British Government is said to have bought the whole of the Australian wool clip for the period of the war and twelve months afterwards. France all the wool that is required. British Government does distribute to our Allies portion of the wool purchases. I notice that many members, and other people who do not know what is going on pression that the sale of the wool clip was a great commercial deal. It is referred to as "" the greatest single deal in the world's wool history,"" and the Government seem desirous of crediting the transaction to the business acumen of the Prime Minister. He had very little to do with the deal. Anybody could sell a commodity if he were prepared to dispose of it at a price which was about two-thirds of its value. I shall read to the House from the Melbourne Herald of 20th of this A month the opinion of people in London on this wool dealAustralian pastoralists appear, according to cablegrams published in London, to be satisfied with the net return they will receive from the purchase by the Imperial Government of their wool during the period of the war and one year thereafter. . . . Yet there are .some able business men ih London personally familiar with both the Australian position and. the prospects of the textile markets, who are saying that, substantial as is the price paid for the wool-5 5 per cent, above the 1913-14 average-it is too low, all things considered; that the opinions of the manufacturers have been permitted to weigh too heavily in the negotiations; that the contrast between prices and world demand will be more sharply ap-",36,Ministerial Statement

P>y the time he has succeeded in preparing the plans for the postal halls in the big cities, and generally improving the Service, he will have' little leisure to devote to the question of the protection of Australian industries. That is not his duty. It is, perhaps, his duty, as a member of the Government, to prompt the Government to introduce a Protectionist Tariff; but the Acting Prime Minister is the -man upon whom the responsibility rests of saying what the Government propose to do. sion that the Australian Parliament cannot deal with the question of the Tariff during the war. When aTe we going to deal with it, then ? Are we to wait until the war is over? The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Archibald) last night asked whether Australian manufacturers had not sufficient Protection at the present time, when no ships were coming to this country to bring goods to compete with them. He asked why they should not come forward now and establish the industries that ought to be established here. The Australian manufacturer has very poor prospects, if he has to depend merely upon the scarcity of imported goods during the present war to protect his industry, because after the war we shall see the most terrific race for trade and commerce throughout the world. I believe all those war-time agreements that are being suggested and prepared by the Prime Minister in London and elsewhere will become null and void, because it will be impossible to carry them out after the war. He is talking of boycotting German goods and German trade here, and preventing the Germans from getting our raw materials. I would draw attention to Foster Eraser's Russia j>f To-day, a book written in 1915, a year after the war started. The passage I shall quote shows that any attempt to boycott German goods after the war, or to prevent the Germans getting our raw materials, will fail, because it will be impossible to carry out such' an arrangement. At page 66, the following -appears:The shops are stuffed with German goods^the inflow of the manufactures of the enemy continues. But you cannot find a shopkeeper in Petrogi-ad who has even a tin whistle of German origin for sale in his store. You proceed to make a purchase. "" It looks rather .German, doesn't it?"" you ask. ""Oh, no, sir; it is English; it has come all the way from England, and that is why it is not so cheap!"" "" There never was a thing produced like that in England,"" you add. NoV the Bhopman says, incredulously, "" then it must be American""-comin g to .the conclusion he had mistaken the nationality of his customer. ""No, nor American; it's German!"" ""Impossible, sir,"" he declares; ""Swedish, may be; very likely it is made in Sweden; but Germanwhy, we are at'war with Germany!"" But it is German make, imported, vid Sweden. That is what is going to happen after the war. If you say you will have nothing to do with German productions, the GerSome people are under the impresman will brand them with the name of some manufacturer in Sweden, or Norway, or Denmark, or some other neutral country, and they will find their way here; and no doubt the traders in this country will buy from the Swedes, or the Danes, or the Dutch. I believe many Dutch firms have been established in this country during the war, possibly to take up German agencies. Are we going foolishly to agree to the Prime Minister's proposal that there shall be a system of Empire trade, which is going to subject this country to the competition of German goods that might come through a neutral country, or perhaps through the United Kingdom? While the Prime Minister was supposed to be talking Protection for the Empire, he is reported to have said that what we required was manufactures to come from the United Kingdom, and raw materials to come from Australia. Do honourable members agree to that proposition? I do not, for one; and I do not believe the general public in Australia aTe prepared to subscribe to that doctrine. We have an immense country, with under 5,000,000 people. We are always in fear that we shall be attacked by some, other nation.

135,Mr Tudoe,"But in the textile indusageous people have stated-and they believe it-that the Allies are out to fight for the freedom and peace of the world, but here we have a country like China, with 300,000,000 or 400,000,000 people, in which the capitalists are prepared to establish industries, the product of which will compete seriously with the labour of the United Kingdom, Trance, the United States, and Australia, where every decent-minded citizen is trying to improve his position, and bring up his family in comfort. In face of this fact, what is the use of the Prime Minister talking about boycotting goods of German origin and Protection for the British Empire? Our aim is to build up Australia, and establish a large population here. This, at all events, is the aim of the Australian Labour party, and possibly it is also the aim of some honourable members opposite. they would attempt to extend to the people of this country privileges which should be granted to them, but they un. fortunately aTe tied up, generally speaking, with a party which will not allow them to vote for legislation which -the Australian Labour party is prepared to give effect to. . 1 would warn honourable members that every country, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia, will have to set its house in order after the war. Each country will have to pass such legislation as is calculated to conserve the interests of its people, and that will mean that, after all the sentimental and idealistic talk about setting up the freedom of the world and the league of'nations, that nation which does not look after its own people by legislative enactments will be left lamenting. to bring this question of protection for the secondary industries of the Commonwealth before the people of this country, and before the Ministry, in the hope that the Government, if they really believe in Protection, will grasp the opportunity to introduce legislation before the war ends, and so protect our industries, and so also that we shall not be left at the end of the war, subject to . the dumping which will certainly occur if our Tariff is uot sufficiently high to protect Australian manufacturers. -There is one matter which I am most anxious to' bring under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs. Considerable trouble has been caused to the mercantile community by reason of the .issue of certain regulations by the honourable gentleman. With every effort made by the Government to control the affairs of this country in the interests of the people, every honourable member must have complete sympathy, and I believe that in some respects the Ministry are endeavouring to do the right thing. But their action' leaves them open to severe criticism because of the incidence and application of their efforts. The Minister recently issued a regulation which prevented importers withdrawing from bonds more than a certain quantity of goods. From the fact that the Department had considerably to alter that regulation it is I believe that, if they were free, obvious that it could not have been fully considered in the first instance. The fluctuations of Customs' business in certain well-defined mercantile items are ofso pronounced a character that there must have been a very serious oversight when the Department framed such a far-reaching regulation without providing for any elasticity in it . The result was that very soon it had to re-cast it. It is a matter for congratulation that the Minister was so satisfied with the representations made by the mercantile community that he consented to certain modifications being effected in the regulation .as originally framed. Had that regulation been insisted upon, a very serious wrong would have been done to many firms. approves of the principle of the regulation? a very excellent one. I hope that the regulation will not be merely of a tentative character. its object, because it very often happens that it is the free goods which the Department desires to reach, and it cannot prevent their removal'from bond. case in my own way. Let us assume that certain ships had discharged portion of their cargoes in Melbourne and Sydney prior to the issue of the regulation, and",42,Ministerial Statement

141,Mr Finlayson,"Let me put thethat they were on their way to other Australian ports when it was issued. Or let us suppose that some goods had been transhipped from their original port of destination to other Australian ports before the issue of the regulation. In such circumstances the firms which had not received delivery of their goods prior to its issue, would be placed at a serious disadvantage as compared with firms which had obtained delivery of them. That is a common erperience in connection with Customs matters. We all know that when a new Tr.riff is laid on the table of this House the new duties levied under it operate the following morning. It has often happened that after a ship has left Melbourne, and before her. arrival in Brisbane, a new Tariff has come into operation, with the result that business people in that city were placed under a .serious disability. very reasonable way of overcoming this handicap. I do not accuse the Minister of any desire to penalize any section of the community, but penalization does take place. The trouble, however, can easily be overcome, by making the new rates of duty apply only to goods which are landed subsequent to the imposition of the new duties, and by freeing all the goods in any ship or ships which have landed portion of their cargo at previous ports of call. bond will be covered by that. gestion a very fair one. It is obvious that if goods are imported some firms will be able, by reason of fortuitous circumstances, to place their goods on the market earlier than will other firms. Because of unfortunate circumstances preventing other firms taking delivery of goods consigned to them, they are penalized. When a portion of the goods in any ship has been discharged at one port, I submit that the remainder of its cargo should be subject to the same rates of duty as the portion which has been landed. matter. Por instance, a man in Perth may take out of a vessel half-a-dozen barrels of whisky, and place the rest of his consignment in bond. * s the honourable member knows it, because I have discussed it with him, but without convincing him that my attitude upon 1 this question is the correct one. The merchants of Sydney and Melbourne get the first grip upon goods which are imported from overseas. ese goods the people of Brisbane get the first grip upon them. . does that remark apply ? Some firms are unreasonably handicapped because of the unfortunate position which they occupy from a geographical stand-point.

I am merely pointing out that the mercantile community are always subject to the temptation-and it is one which we could all fall into, no doubt that immediately new rates of duty aro imposed, the opportunity is taken to make an extra profit upon those goods which are in stock and are free from the rates about to be applied. Naturally, the liquor people are after business in the same way as anybody else, and, if not prevented by this temporary arrangement, 'they would at once raise their prices to an equivalent of the rates to be applied under the new duty. There is yet a good deal of relief to be given in addition to that already granted under the new regulations. The Department has been amenable to a certain amount of. reason in regard to recent regulations, and has altered and improved them considerably. But there is much still to be done, and the deciding factor in the whole case is to so arrange matters that traders in one part of the community shall not be unduly penalized as against competitors in others parts of the Commonwealth.
