Postmaster","General whether, before he submits his. proposals for the establishment of the penny post, he will furnish honourable members with information showing the loss that will be incurred under the new system within the Commonwealth and within the Empire, and also owing to the extension of the system to foreign countries? I distributed a memorandum, which gave some information on the subject, and I shall be very pleased to make available any further particulars that may be in the Department with regard to the extent to which a loss of revenue will be incurred in_connexion with the despatch of letters within the Commonwealth and beyond it. whether the loss incurred in each State will have to be borne by the States respectively or whether the total loss will be debited to the States upon a population basis? present system, the loss will, of course, be borne by each State. In my opinion, there will be no loss, because the public will be able to effect a.considerable saving. that the Government propose to introduce a Bill to establish universal penny postage which will involve the Commonwealth in a loss of ,£200,000 per annum, I desire to ask the Postmaster-General what possible",13,Setup

6,Mr Poynton,"In view of the factchance outlying districts will have of obtaining the'telephonic or postal facilities which are so urgentfv needed? I would remind honourable members that in my opinion the adoption of penny postage will really involve the Commonwealth in no loss. ment we simply refuse to take a certain sum from the pockets of the people, and its introduction will make no difference whatever to outlying districts in the matter of providing them with postal or telephonic facilities. At the present time the advantage of -penny postage is chiefly enjoyed by the commercial classes, and by residents in large centres, whereas those who will derive most benefit from the Government proposals are the residents of sparselypopulated districts, who under existing conThose lines have been erected upon the neditions are called upon to pay 2d. upon each letter which they send. That condition applies to the. State represented by the telephonic facilities was refused because honourable member, because in South. Australia a letter has to bear a 2d. stamp even if it has merely to cross the street. Postmaster-General whether it is not a fact that postal facilities have been refused by the Department time and again upon the ground that it had not the money with which to oav for them. not a fact. But I would point out to the honourable member that we have to lay -down some principle, .and that all applications for postal facilities are dealt with on their merits. If he will bring under my notice any case in which the extension of postal facilities to any locality can be justified he will find that the Department has the monev which the granting of those facilities would involve. it is not a fact that telephonic communication has been denied to many country, districts upon the ground that the work would not pav ? to the honourable and learned member I wish to say that it is not a fact. Applications for the granting of telephonic communication to any locality are dealt with upon their merits, and the practice of the Department has been, and is, that if it can be shown that the erection of a telephone line is likely to pav at any time within seven years, it is willing to provide the facilities sought, upon reasonable conditions. master-Generali f it is not a fact that up to tbe present time the Department has acted upon a totally different principle, and also if it is not true that so far from promising to provide country residents with telephonic facilities, where it is shown that By its establishthe work is likely to prove remunerative within seven years, he has insisted upon obtaining guarantees from the Western Australian Government against any loss which may be incurred in erecting telephonic and telegraphic lines? swer to the honourable member, I would say that guarantees have been asked from the Government of Western Australia only in cases where it has been shown that the erection of telephone lines would not pay. cessary guarantee being given. I recollect one instance, in which an application for the work would have cost £10,000, whereas the revenue which would have been derived from it would have amounted to only ,£100 or £150 per annum. know from the Postmaster-General whether, in view of the fact that it is proposed to spend .£10,000 upon bringing into operation within the Commonwealth the wireless telegraphic system, he will arrange to have communication established between King Island and Burnie? question of the application of wireless telegraphv to our requirements is now under consideration, and the needs of King Island, among other places, will receive every attention.

Speaking from memory, the amount is somewhere between £ 9 . 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 and Prime Minister whether, in view of die fact that the claims for the transferred properties will probably amount to at least £1:0,000,000, and involve an interest charge upon the Commonwealth of between £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 and £ 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, the Government have decided what steps should be taken to meet the necessary payments. I understand that under the proposals placed before us by the Treasurer, the Commonwealth will, after defraying the expenditure for the current year, have a balance in hand of £311,000, and I should like to know whether the Government have devised any scheme for meeting interest payments such as I have referred to? ber is aware, the subject of the valuation It was decided by the of7 and the method of ' payment for, the transferred properties has been brought up in various forms. Speaking for the moment without a definite recollection of the present understanding, I may say that my own opinion is that no estimate nearly apThe proproaching the figures mentioned by the honourable member can be made fairly. Without entering into other particulars, I may point out that land for which the State paid nothing ""should, in my personal opinion, still be treated as Crown land, because it does not pass out of the control of the people of Australia. Any valuation that would include the value of that land would be unreasonable and exorbitant. So far as I can form, anv opinion, the sum that could fairly be claimed by the States for their properties would be very much smaller than that mentioned. My view is I shall that after a fair valuation the whole matter should be arranged between the States the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth by way of set-off. by striking a balance as between the States, and dealing only with the differences that then remain. That would reduce the pavment to an amount which could very easily be met out of our existing revenue. MR. C. V.

I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether Western Australia would not have had as much revenue available if it had not come into the Federation; whether, as a matter of fact, the revenue referred to did not come out of the pockets of the consumers in Western Australia; and whether it can be held to have been paid either directly or indirectly by the Commonwealth to Western Australia ? the honourable member relate not so much to matters of fact as to hypotheses or theories. For instance, the honourable member asked whether, if the Western Australian Tariff had remained, it would not have yielded quite as much to that State. revenue would not have been available to the Statei f it had stood out of the Federation ? if the people of Western Australia had chosen to retain a Tariff similar to that imposed under Federation, of course, the same sum would have been available to them. If , however, they had listened to the honourable member and his friends, they would not have had any such sum. The honourable member's second question was whether the revenue was not contributed by the people of Western Australia. In my opinion only a part of it is paid by the people of Western Australia, the other portion being contributed by those who send them dutiable goods. His third question was whether any portion of the revenue can be regarded as contributed by the rest of the Commonwealth. The revenue certainly was contributed to by those in other States, who send to Western Australia goods which were made dutiable under the special Tariff. ister kindly indicate the extent to which the Excise duty collected exceeds the amount of the sugar bounties? cise collected is very much greater than greater part of the military forces quartered that paid by way of sugar bounties.

I informed him that I would falls to the share of the Commonwealth. We pay the whole of the bounties, but receive only one-fourth of' the Excise duties. Prime Minister whether it is not a fact that under the rebate system the Commonwealth lost the whole of the rebates? the Commonwealth did not lose the whole of the rebates. They were deducted from the Excise duties, which were divided between the Commonwealth and the States in the proportion of one-fourth and three-fourths respectively. sented by the rebates was never paid into revenue. Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether he can give the House any information with respect to the absence of a cut-off in the rifles imported for the Defence Forces. I wish to know whether the cost of remedying the defect will fall upon the War Office or the Commonwealth? informed me that he intended to ask a question on this matter, and I have obtained a reply, which reads as follows:The rifles were supplied as ordered, viz., the latest War Office pattern, as issued to the British Army. The cut-off is apparently not issued to army authorities. The cut-off is omitted from this pattern, but a space is left so that it can be fitted if required. The Commonwealth military authorities have recommended that the rifle with cut-off fitted is more suitable for our forces than without the cut-off, and steps are being taken to obtain them and fit them to the rifles on issue. Future supplies will have the cut-off attached. The honourable member will see that the rifles were supplied to order, and that, therefore, we must accept the full responsi-",15,Properties

We found, however, that we could not get any definite reply from all the States, and so resolved to go straight ahead with the preparation of legislation upon the subject. But after further consideration we decided to deal only with meteorological work. A t several previous Conferences attempts had been made in Australia to secure uniformity in meteorological matters throughout this Continent. As far back as 1879 a Conference was held for the purpose of endeavouring to bring the various States into line, so as Under the to obtain that result.

The last Conference was held in 1905, and the report of its proceedings has been published. The question of the possibility of Federal action being .taken was put before the representatives of the six States.

That is to say, the representatives of the States did not think that any advantage would be gained by having one central astronomical observatory. As honourable members know, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia, have astronomical observatories which are fairlv well equipped, and possess competentstaffs. Australia has reason to be proud of the names of some of the scientists who have been associated with these institutions.

Western Australia has also a very competent officer in the person of Mr Cooke, whilst New South Wales possesses a very competent meteorologist in Mr Hunt, who stands in high repute. tives of the States met in conference, and recommended that there was nothing to be gained by having one central Federal Observatory. They expressed the view that the establishment of one central meteorological bureau to supplant existing institutions, and to singly carry out the Australian weather services, was for reasons which they gave, impracticable. They could see no advantage in doing away with the existing meteorological institutions, but they recommendedThat a central institution be established for theoretical and scientific meteorology. They set forth in their report certain conditions which, in their opinion, could be secured by the establishment of a central institution of this kind. The idea is that such an institution should not issue forecasts, but should deal with the scientific problems associated with meteorology. Mr teorology, under a Council of Meteorology; Baracchi, who bears a deservedly high reputation, and attended the conference as [75] the representative of Victoria, dissented They also reported, in from that view. He shared the opinion expressed by the Board of Visitors of the Melbourne Observatory. I think that it , to the Board asking what attitude should be taken up with respect to the Commonwealth exercising its power to take over the Astronomical and Meteorological Departments. As the outcome of this communication, the Board made the following recommendations : 1. That all meteorological work at present conducted by the astronomical observatories of Australia be. placed under a Federal bureau, which should preferably be located in the Federal' City, and controlled by a meteorologist of high standing. 2. That the astronomical observatories of Australia, relieved of all their present meteorological With those recommendations Mr Baracchi fully concurred. We had therefore to decide whether from the Federal stand-point we should be justified in taking over ascareful consideration, and having considered the opinion of experts, we came to the conclusion' that at this stage we should not be justified in exercising our powers with respect to astronomy. We had first of all the opinion of Mr Wragge, who in a letter to the Pastoralists' Review on the 15th Mav, 1.90T, statedThe centra! office on which meteorological reThe representasearches for all the stations would depend should be concerned in meteorology only, following the example set by Great Britain. Canada. India, the United States of America, France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Roumania, and other civilized countries, and should not be hampered by astronomical work or other branches of science, which professionally have no direct bearing on the work of the weather bureau. That is the opinion of a highly qualified authority, who enumerates the nations that have found it desirable in practical work to distinguish between astronomy as such and meteorology as such. Mr Wragge shows that the experience of 'these countries has proved it necessary to keep meteorology distinct from astronomy. United States is very clear, is it not?

We had to consider whether, from the standpoint of Australia, it is advisable to keep these two Departments distinct. Upon that point we had the opinion of the Board of Visitors of the Melbourne Observatory, which comprises such men of eminence as Professor Lyle, of the Melbourne University, Mr Ellery, and Mr W. C. Kernot, as well as others whose names carry considerable weight. The three whom I have named, however, are all men of distinguished scientific attainments. They were asked to deal with the practical .question whether in Victoria the Departments of meteorology and astronomy should be kept apart, and they reported as follows:Meteorology, which .consists mainly in the standing in the astronomical world of the men weather service, is. no part of the legitimate who at present direct the leading observatories function of an astronomical observatory, and its of Australia is such, and that of their successors association with astronomy interferes with the should be such, that they should have a peradvancement of the latter.

But, as the weather services of the various States could be carried on in a much more efficient manner if placed .under the control of a Central Weather Bureau, devoted entirely to the meteorological interests of the whole Commonwealth, the opportunity now offered of separating meteorology from astronomy should not be lost. They recommended accordinglyThat all meteorological work at present conducted by the astronomical observatories of Australia be placed under a Federal bureau, which should preferably be located in the Federal City, and controlled by a meteorologist of high standing.

Dealing with astronomical institutions, they reportedOn the other hand, when we consider the observatories as purely astronomical institutions, devoted solely to astronomical observations and research, and those demands of the Stale Government or the public that are germane to astronomy, we think that nothing would be gained either in efficiency or in economy by bringing them under one Federal control.

They went on to sayI t has gained a high reputation by means of the valuable work that has been carried on in it. It has been liberally supported by the Government of Victoria, and has grown into an institution peculiarly creditable to the State. Its equipment is very valuable, and compares well with that of many European observatories. Its position in the Southern Hemisphere is unique, it being the most southern observatory in the world. In it have been kept for forty years continuous records day and night of terrestrial magnetism, which are of immense scientific value. Considering these things, we think it would be a matter of deep regret if our Melbourne Observatory were to be deprived of its individuality, and have the high reputation' it has gained over a long period of years merged in some large organization or department comprising all the observatories of Australia.",19,Meteorology Bill Second Reading

101,Mr Groom,"I believe Mr Wragge'sfind that at page 203 of the report of the proceedings of the second convention of Weather Bureau Officials of the United States, the American system is described as follows:The United States is divided into seven forecast districts, the headquarters or central offices heavy rains fal l at the heads of the rivers, of which, named alphabetically, are :-Boston, Mass.; Chicago, 111.; Denver, Colo.; New Orleans, La. ; Portland, Oreg.; San Francisco, Cal.; and Washington, D.C. In other words, they have divided the United States into seven districts, for each of which separate forecasts are issued. A competent meteorologist strongly recommends that in Australia we should follow the system dictated by the experience that, although we should have a central meteorological office, the Commonwealth should be divided into districts for the purpose of issuing forecasts. I conceive that these districts will be distributed with regard to the formation of the country, rather than to the existing State boundaries. Instead of issuing all for e casts from one centre, in all probability a forecast will be issued from each of specified district centres. Western Australia is so situated that probably it will be regarded as advisable to continue to issue forecasts there, ancl probably similar provision will have to be made in the eastern States. In each of the seven districts in the United States there is a further subdivision into State districts, and local forecasts are made in each of these. I think that they are issued after the general forecasts have been made, and are. more specific on account of the local observations engaged in after the general information has been obtained. By this means, the American meteorologists are able to issue very accurate forecasts. However, these details will have to be settled by the officer who is placed in charge of the Department. With regard, to the work to be done by the Department, I think we shall be able to follow the American system very closely. In the first instance, we ought to recognise that weather forecasts are absolutely invaluable to those who are engaged in primary production. In the sugar districts of Queensland we have already experienced the very great advantage to be derived from forecasts of the cold' waves which produce frosts. proved of great value to ' the canegrowers, because they have enabled them to take precautionary measures and safeguard their crops against damage. Again, weather forecasts are of great value to us, because so many of our rivers are subject to flood. A proper system of weather forecasts would result: in the saving of hundreds of thousands of pounds every year. In the northern parts of Australia and cause the streams to rise very quickly, but by a system of flood warnings all along the rivers, we have been able in Queensland to provide for the removal of stock and the saving'of valuable property that would otherwise be destroyed. Further, in the northern parts of Australia severe loss has been incurred as the result of heavy storms» coming in from across the seas. When Queensland had a meteorological system of of the United States, and its own under Mr Wragge, these storms were forecasted with considerable precision, and warning was given to shipmasters and otters, who were thus enabled to take precautionary measures in time to avoid disaster. We hope that by establishing a proper system of forecasts, and especially by means of observations taken outside of Australia, we shall be able to warn those engaged in shipping and other occupations, and so prevent loss of life and property. It is further hoped that under the new Department we shall have what we do not enjoy at present, viz., a proper system of storm warnings for"" the benefit of shipmasters. We can reasonably expect to establish a proper study of climatic conditions of rainfall, temperature, humidity of atmosphere, and other features, which are of importance in considering the suitability of certain localities for settlement and development. We have not had a very long range of accurate records, and we know how difficult it is to ascertain the average rainfall in certain localities. Under a Federal system, however, we hope to become thoroughly acquainted with the climatic conditions of the continent. We hope also to be able to take advantage of the wireless telegraphic system, in order to obtain proper observations from the south of Australia. It is believed that if the Marconi system could be installed upon some of the ' steamers that leave our shores, and regular observations and records could be transmitted to Australia, we should be able to arrive at greater accuracy in our forecasts. The United States report of 1:905, which These forecasts have reached here only last week, refers to the great advantage that has been conferred upon the Meteorological Department by the use of wireless telegraphy. As the result of a conference of Army, Navy, and Weather Bureau officials, arrangements were made under which the bureau will receive information from vessels at sea, and by means of wireless telegraphy transmit to the vessels signals with regard to storms. The statement upon this point concludes as follows:Negotiations are also in progress with the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company for the receipt at the station of the company at Siasconset NantucUet Island, Mass., of wireless messa'ge containing meteorological observations from vessels that are equipped with Marconi apparatus, and for a transmission of storm warnings to vessels that may be in communication with the station. The inauguration of a system of interchange between shore stations and vessels at sea of messages containing storm advices and meteorological observations promises an enlargement of weather bureau work that will be co-extensive with the development and scope of wireless telegraphy, and the extension over the ocean of area of meteorological reports by wireless telegraphy may, in time, permit a service to trans-Atlantic steamers about to leave American and European ports, that will advise them regarding the character of the weather they will experience at sea. Furthermore, it is likely, that reports that will be available with an extension of wireless telegraphy will result in a communication of storm advices to vessels in mid-ocean, and render possible a storm-warning service for the western coasts of Europe. If wireless telegraphy can be brought to our aid, we may be able to very greatly improve our weather forecasts. It will hardly be necessary for me to further refer to this matter except ito say that the United States have been doing their work in connection with meteorology chiefly from a practical stand'point, with a view to confer benefit upon farmers, commercial men, and those engaged in shipping. They claim that they have practically exhausted all their possibilities in connection 'with observations from a purely practical standpoint. The report of the Chief of the Weather Bureau, for 1905, contains the following statement:Since they are now applying all of the knowledge of the atmosphere that has been revealed, . little hope for material improvement in theirwork can be held out until a substantial addition is made to the pure science of the problem. This can only come through study, and research. With 200 stations engaged in applying the science, it is a wise economy to devote at least one of them to the work of adding to the knowledge that we .ire annually spending nearly a million and a half of dollars to apply. Accordingly, we have endeavoured to lay out a plan of study and research leading to an increase in our knowledge of the laws governing the atmosphere, Mr Groom. enable our successors, if not ourselves, to add! to the accuracy of weather forecasts, and to make them for a longer period in advance. In the future they will pay more attention) to the study of the laws of the atmosphere. A special station has been-, established ' at Mount Weather, Virginia. They are embarking to a greaterextent upon original research, in order to> ascertain whether, by a closer study of natural"" laws, they can make forecasts considerably further ahead than is now possible. ,They recognise the difficulties which) hamper them at present, and they have set themselves to the solution of the problemswhich require to be dealt with. It is to* be hoped that we shall also be able toengage in original research work in thefuture. For the present, however, we desire to establish a practical institution that will confer lasting benefit upon those who are engaged in the industries of the' Commonwealth. If honourable members wilf agree to this Bill, and entrust us with the powers for which we are asking, we shall be able to establish a Department that will do splendid work in connection with the. development of this continent. [3.44] -There can be"" no two opinions as to the usefulness of this measure. It relates 'to one of those peculiar Federal functions, the discussion of which is not characterized by any conditions of politicalstorm. Perhaps it is just as well that thisBill is being ushered into the Chamber during a dead political calm.. One is very much impresed with the present stormy aspect of things, and it doesoccur to me to be fitting that,this proposal should be originated when things appear to be set so fair. Of course, I speak of the present only. The present aspect of the Chamber may be merely the calm which is the prelude to the storm. That remainsto be seen. But just at present indicationsare decidedly of a peaceful character, and perhaps it is well that we should discussthis question amidst such surroundingsIt may be that the reason why the atmosphere in the Chamber is so calm is that the experimentation, measure under consideration is a really useful one. If it were less useful to the people outside, and to the Commonwealth as a whole, it is just possible that more attention might be devoted to it. and that agreater degree of animation might be manifested.

102,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta>,"4o point out that, in my judgment, the Minister of Home Affairs is proceeding far too cautiously. He is dealing with this matter in altogether too tentative a fashion. It is a subject upon which we are empowered rto legislate under the Constitution, and in .regard to which I think we ought not to .hesitate to carry out our functions to the full. It is one of those matters in the control of which I think we can show'greater -economy and efficiency, and altogether fur-nish the people with more substantial advantages than can the separate States. By this time every man and woman in Australia is intensely interested in a proposal of this description. Now-a-days we are all .accustomed to our weather forecasts, and in that respect we are well catered for by the -daily press of the Commonwealth. Almost -every child looks at the newspapers to see what the weather is likely to be, before .attending a picnic or any other small family conviviality which may be arranged from time to time. Consequently, this is a -matter which reaches to the ramifications of our home life as welll as to every corner -of our business and commercial experience. I hope that in taking over this new Department we shall endeavour so to widen its -scope 'as to make even for more accurate weather forecasts than we obtain to-day. Of course, it is to be expected that, in as-suming these new functions, State feelings, prejudices, and predilections may be disturbed. But we cannot help this rustling in -the State dovecote when we proceed with the amalgamation of these departments for the purpose of securing a unified-and , we hope, a more effective-control . One is not surprised to find State officials looking askance at proposals for federalizing them. It was somewhat amusing to hear the Minister relying so much upon -the recommendations of State officials. -whom I referred are not State officials.

Consequently, I do not know whether we Ought to pay too much attention to their recommendations. For instance, who would expect agreement amongst them regarding a proposal to take over some of their State judicial functions, which would necessarily mean the retirement of a number of their State Judges? Who, for example, would expect unanimity in the event of a favourable recommenda-, tion, from a Commonwealth stand-point, concerning the amalgamation of our State Agricultural Departments? So we might go through the whole list of these Departments, all of which view with a very great deal of misgiving any proposal to unify them, and bring them under one control. The same objections were urged against our action in respect of our Statistical Department. Scarcely any of the Statesacting on the recommendation of their officers^-coul d see any advantages to be gained from a Federal tabulation of our statistics, but all could see many benefits to be derived from the maintenance of the States Statistical Departments. , So it is in connection with our States Parliaments. Who would expect any of them to suggest any diminution in their so-called sovereignty and of the functions which they at present discharge? Is there not a constant tug-of-war' going on between the Federal and State authorities, which tugof-war, I fear, will continue for many years, or, at least, until the permanent relations of the Commonwealth to the States have been fixed ? There must necessarily be friction, and consequently we cannot pay too much attention to recommendations which comei from State authorities, and which have to do. with the maintenance intact of State functions. Nevertheless, it is our duty to assume, as far as possible, a unified control of these departments must lead to greater The and safe stand, so far as those functions are concerned.

But I do not think that the matter needs to be seriously argued. can do very mudh better by a Federal con,trol of these functions than can be accomplished by the States in their separate capacities. Why there should be any hesit a t i o n in taking over the whole of the astronomical observatories, as well as of the meteorological stations, I am quite at a loss to understand. I am aware that the matter presented difficulties some time ago, scriptive right to his position by reason of , his long service, and the way in which he had associated himself with his Department-fille d the position of Government Astronomer . in New South Wales. similar difficulty was presented in South Australia in respect of Sir Charles Todd. But both of these officers have now retired in the evening of their lives, after having rendered very effective service to their respective States, and, consequently, there need be no longer any delicacy iu assuming control of that Department. house for astronomical observations. that we do not want half-a-dozen such observatories. servatories, honourable and learned member will tell us why ? the greater is the efficiency that is secured. several observatories are, perhaps, needed in Australia, but I do not think that we require six or seven separate astronomers in the six different States. separation, and the way in which we have been apt to regard these matters, these observatories have grown up, but I have yet to hear any valid reason for continuing them in all their trappings and expensiveness. tain observations to be made in each State, but we do not require observatories there. seems to me that if 'we had a central astronomical observatory as well as a central meteorological station. Ave might very well reduce some of our State institutions, and thus save the funds necessary to maintain and equip our central observatories, at the same time making the system a more effective one than it is at the present time. they have several astronomical observatories established within a much smaller area. ber of these observatories in Australia outside of the Government domain. For instance, in New South Wales, one of the very best astronomical observatories is a privately-owned one. It has been established in my own electorate, at Windsor. I think that everybody in Australia has heard of Mr Tebbutt and his observations. He is one of the best men in the Commonwealth, and all that he does is done at his A own expense, and in pursuance of his own private studies. _ Nevertheless, he renders very important service to the Commonwealth as a whole, and there are many others in Australia who betake themselves to that study quite apart from its bread-and-butter aspect. They make it a private hobby. It 'will thus be seen that in Australia there are probably many more than six astronomers. Indeed!, we might multiply that number many times over before we ascertained the total of those who are earnestly engaged in studying the heavens and in conducting astronomical observations. But when we speak of this matter in its official sense, we have a right to see that we spend no more than is necessary for the purpose of providing a complete and fully-equipped institution. Therefore we should do well to unify our astronomical as well as our meteorological observatories. I entirely concur in the remarks of the Minister as to I admit that the advantages which the Bill will confer, upon the commercial community. I think that we might make much more use of meteorological knowledge than we do at the Owing to our present time. Indeed, one of the results of Federation up to date has been a disf tinct curtailment of this information in the various States. I know that it has been so in New South Wales, and I venture to say that that remark applies more or less to other States of tlie Union.

I remember that it was a common thing thirty years ago for one to find in the English morning, newspapers a warning to mining districts that certain depressions were approaching, and that miners should beware of outbursts of gas and falls of earth, which might be caused by the disturbance. So far as I am aware, nothing in that direction has been attempted in Australia. That may be owing to the extent of the area to be covered, but it occurs to me that if we had f u l l control of the geographical limitations of Australia we might so arrange our observations as to make our forecasts valuable to those engaged in mining as well as in pastoral, agricultural, and other pursuits. That is one side of meteorological development about which we know very little in Australia. difficulties in the way, but I should not think so, since, in some countries, it is found possible to forecast storms two days before their actual approach. to European countries. The development of the work of the bureau in the direction I have just indicated might very well be kept in mind.

He should not have paid too much attention to the States authorities, who are very much interested in the maintenance Qf States institutions in all their dignity. He might very well have brought down an estimate showing that a saving would be effected, and that more efficient scientific results would flow from the taking over of both branches. Had he done that, we should have had no difficultv in convincing the States of the superiority of Federal over State control. That, after all, is what we have to do.

That being nomical as well as the Meteorological Department. If there is a reason for taking over the one, there is an equally good reason for the transfer of the other. The Minister seems to have been Influenced more by the views of the Board of Visitors of the Melbourne Observatory, and by those of Mr Baracchi, the Government Astronomer of Victoria, than by the opinion of the majority of astronomers and observatory officials who took part in the Adelaide Conference. That Conference accepted, even if it did not actually approve, the proposal that the' observatories should be transferred to the Commonwealth. That, at all events, was the opinion of the members of the Conference, with the exception of Mr Baracchi. make a specific recommendation. They, said, in effect, that if the Meteorological Departments were taken over the existing, institutions should remain. exception of Mr Baracchi, they agreed;, that certain recommendations should be made, and they took no exception by resolution to the taking over of the Departmentsby the Commonwealth Further than that,, the opinion was expressed that the system proposed by the Minister in regard, to meteorology should not"" be adopted.. The Conference decided that there should , 1 be a central institution, and that themeteorological observations should be carried ,out as at present, under that institution. Whether that view be right or wrong,, the Minister has not seen fit to be guided by it ; he has preferred to adopt the view of the Victorian Government Astronomer. Thequestion of the desirableness of separating; the two branches of meteorology and astronomy is one that we need not consider at present, although I agree that if the twobranches could be carried on distinctly with-, reasonable economy they ought to be kept separate. Eveni f both Departments weretransferred to! the Commonwealth, therecould be a separation of the twoa separation possibly more effective and certainlymore economical than that which will follow the transfer of only one Department. Weknow that at present the meteorological work of the States is largely done by observatory officials, and if we transfer one portion of that work to the Commonwealth, and leave the other to be carried out by the States, we shall cause a division of duties now carried so, we are bound to cause additional expense either to the Commonwealth or the States. So that the immediate result will bean increased expenditure, not necessarily by either State or Commonwealth separately, but certainly by both combined. Honorable members should be given an opportunity to decide whether both or only one Department shall be taken over. I fear that, as the measure stands, any amendment providing for the taking over of the Astronomical' Department would be ruled out of order, and therefore I should like the Minister tocreate an opportunity for the taking of atest vote upon the subject. member propose to raise the question ?",27,Meteorology Bill Second Reading

Vacancies now exist in the South Australian and New South Wales Observatories-a t least, the officers who are now performing the duties of Government Astronomer are only acting in that position. whether these vacancies would require to be filled permanently could be decided after the transfer had taken place. It seems to me that certain important work could be confined) to certain observatories, and that it should not be necessary to employ astronomers of high qualifications in every State. Some astronomical work is done at Hobart, where they have no observatory, and no highly-paid official. vatory at Ballarat, which is supported by public subscription. private observatories and others of a purely local character would exist, even if the Commonwealth took over the Astronomical Department. I contend that'we should exercise our functions in these matters to the f u l l extent. half of the work performed by the existing States Departments, and leave the other half to be carried on by the States. No sufficient reason has been advanced why the two branches of work-meteoro logical and astronomical-shoul d be treated differently in the manner now proposed. There is no doubt that the meteorological work could be carried on without our taking over the Departments, but the States are very glad to hand it over to the Commonwealth, because they do not care to incur the expense that would he involved in extending the present system, and making it more complete. regard to the astronomical work, however, in connection with which they now gain some kudos, they are either unfavorable or careless as to the transfer to the Commonwealth. I do not think we ought to hesitate to exercise to the f u l l the power conferred upon us under the Constitution, to take over these two at present closely asour circumstances will iustifv us in going. sociated branches of work. If we took over the whole of the work we could make better use of the services of the officials than if a portion of the work were still left to be carried out by the States. The arrangement proposed must lead to disruption and extra expense. If we took over the whole of the work, some scientific men, fullyqualified to act, should be requested to> ascertain what could best be done at each of the observatories. Where the work was of a purely local character it would necessarily have to be done in a particular locality ; but if it were of such a description tnat it could be as well carried out The question as to in one State as in another, much of it could be centralized. This would all tend to economy and efficiency. A t present, under decentralized control, this cannot be 1 done. If we now decide not to exercise the f u l l power given to us by the Constitution,, we shall settle the matter for all time,, because I cannot conceive of any stronger reasons existing in the future than those which now present themselves in favour of making the complete transfer I have indicated. On the other hand, greater obstacles may be presented. If we had! the observatories under our control, we could centralize a great deal of the work,, and perform it much more effectively tharu at present.

I agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that it would tend to economical administration if the Commonwealth took over the astronomical, as well as the meteorological, work now being performed by the States. The two brandies of observation are very similar in character, and should be made to harmonize as much as possible. Under present conditions, there is a great deal of duplication of work in the States Observatories, which, if they were placed under separate control, could be avoided. Of course, we understand that if the operations of the Meteorological Department are extended, the expenditure will be increased, but our object should be to obtain the maximum result at a minimum of cost. dealt with by the Commonwealth and astronomical matters are left to the States, the total expenditure upon. these Departments will be largely increased. I have not yet been able to read the report of the conference of astronomers which met in Adelaide in 1905, and consequently I am not familiar with the reasons which prompted Mr Baracchi to oppose the transfer to the Commonwealth of. tbe control of the Astronomical Departments of the States. Before we vote upon this BillI think that those reasons should be clearlyplaced before honourable members. fact that the office of Government Astronomer in two of the States is vacant to-day shows that if we assumed control of that Department we should be afforded an opportunity of making some reduction in the expenditure upon our existing observatories. That could be done easily enough, unless it is absolutely necessary that in all the observatories throughout the States high-class officers should be appointed. I have an idea that that is not necessary, and consequently I think that a material saving might be effected. saving now. the States are separate entities, and they wealth "" may "" do this, that, and the other. are not likely to relv upon the Victorian Astronomer. If we allow the astronomical work to remain with the States there is no doubt that they will continue the maintenance of their present establishments. Seeing that we have power to control that Department, I think that we ought to exercise it. A good.deal of the work that is done in each of the States is, I presume, supervised by the Government Astronomer. There would lie no necessity for that state of affairs to continue if we assumed control of both of these Departments. I hope that the Minister will afford, honourable members an opportunity of voting upon the question of whether we should not take over both the Astronomical and Meteorological Departments of the States. My own view is tliat, by so doing, we should effect a substantial saving, and at the same time secure a more effective system than we obtain at present.. gret that I was unable to be present when the Minister moved the second reading of this B ill , because it deals with a matter in which I have taken a little interest. I Andi f meteorological matters are sincerely welcome this action on the part of the Government. To me the subject of meteorology is one of the most important that they could take up. I think it is a reflection upon this Parliament tliat hitherto no action of the kind has been taken, although we have had power to deal with the matter ever since the establishment of the Federation. In our present complex civilization, when interests are so interinvolved and world-wide, the discovery and formulation of laws governing the weather are of first importance. To obtain an accurate meteorological system throughout The Australia, the Government would be justified in incurring almost any expenditure. To all sections of the community the matter is one of great importance-to those interested in commerce, transportation, navigation, agriculture, and trade of all descriptions. In short, it concerns everybody whose living and comfort depend upon the seasons and upon the weather. It is so far-reaching that it should be dealt with upon comprehensive lines.

Probably more than any other institution that we can establish, it is the one which needs a centralized control if it is to be effective. Control must be centred in one man-in one efficient head-jus t as it is in other countries, He must guide the whole ramifications of the Department, he must be in direct touch with all its stations, and he must exercise control over every officer's work. There is no occasion for me to criticise the systems which we have hitherto enjoyed. have been very poor ones. The only State which has rendered good service is that of Queensland, and the gentleman who controlled the Department there is no longer in the employ of the State Government, From the remarks which I have heard since I entered the Chamber, I gather that there is a desire on the part of honourable members to amalgamate the astronomical and meteorological services. I think that that would be a fundamental mistake. States they are amalgamated now. are separated the better.

The conference which met in Adelaide in 1905 contained 'four astronomers, one surveyor, and one meteorologist, and certainly their findings are not entitled to very much respect. To me The States might certainly they appear to have fallen very short of what was required of them, and seem to have been dominated by the astronomers, acchi to the amalgamation of these institutions are sound and well founded, and I trust that the Government will accord them due respect. In this connection, I think that 'we may fairly copy what has been done in other countries where the science of meteorology has been a very great success. In the United States, where this science has been brought to perfection to the benefit of the whole community, They matters relating to meteorology were first placed under the War Signal Department in 1870. Until 1896 they were dealt w i h by that Department, but the work grew t to such an extent, and became so intimately connected with the great producing interests Q f the country, that it was deemed advisable to transfer it to the Department of Agriculture. It was only after consider a r , i agitation, however, that that was ace complished. The work of the Departm e n t was spread out to the great lakes, sea the interior and to the central valleys.

In addition to these thirty observatories, there are 200 observing stations and 700 subsidiary stations. The operators are paid by the Government, but, in addition to these, there are 3,600 co-operators, who discharge their duties voluntarily, and are supplied at Government expense with the instruments necessary to enable them to take observations. Every one of these officials throughout the States is in direct touch with the chief of the Bureau, and can communicate with him whenever he desires, either by telegraph or telephone. to obtain an effective system the Bureau has a very wide range of operations. co-operates with Canada, thus securing observations from the extreme north of the Dominion, and also with Mexico, in the south, so that it is in touch with kindred institutions from the north to the south of the continent, which supply it with information, and from whom it obtains daily observations. The authorities of the Bureau are in touch with and receive observations from Honolulu, on the west, and with Britain, Germany, France, Portugal, and the Azores, on the east. The system is so complete that every meteorological change which takes place over a fourth of the globe, together with its bearing ancl possible results, is recorded and charted at Washington. The reports which come in are scanned by keen, experienced men, and the results are at once conveyed to every part of the continent which the changes may be expected to affect. A t 200 stations simultaneous observations are made at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. by 75 meridian time. The stations are equipped with the most delicate instruments necessary for the recording, of changes, and there is an almost continuous record of local weather conditions and changes. Twice daily these records are sent to Washington, where they are charted and studied by trained experts, who announce the weather conditions which may be expected. So acThe curately is the work done that they can send over the whole continent a warning as to the approach of a storm from thirty-six to forty-eight hours before it takes place. The paths of storms are traced, and their subsequent courses are known. Information as to precipitation is at once sent to the The chief of the DepartBureau, and the officials are thus able to foretell floods and warn the people conEach year that Department has been cerned in time to permit of their providing against them. They have also a regular transmission of observations. In less than two hours after the morning observations have been made these warnings are telegraphed from the central station to 2,000 principal distributing points. They are then sent by post, telephone, and telegraph to 200,000 addresses. This takes place daily, most of the addresses are reached before noon, and every one of them is reached before 6 p.m. ' The whole of this work is done at the expense of the Government, and it is entirely distinct from the great work which the press also performs in this direction. The United States have also a free rural delivery and a free In order rural telephone service, which carry information to the farmers all over the contiIt nent. One hundred thousand farmers, in return for a small charge, receive daily weather reports from the observatory. There are also telephone subscribers and card forecast subscribers, and no less than 17,000,000 card forecasts are sent out every year. Another point is that there is also a climate and a crop service in connection with the Weather Bureau of the United States. There is a section in each State which collects information in regard to the temperature and rainfall, and makes, observations for monthly reports. During the crop-growing season from April to September weekly mail reports concerning on crops, and also farming are sent in from 14,000 These are published in weekly and distributed throughout Apart from this practical work, comes in direct touch with the people, and in which they take great interest, men of scientific ability are engaged in investigating and elaborating the fundamental principles which regulate meteorology and the kindred sciences. are issued from December to March, showing the depth of snow on the ground and the thickness of the ice on the various rivers and other waters, while special warnings are sent along the coast. Tropical hurricanes or storms or cold waves of unusual severity are forecasted, and reports are sent to postmasters at 6,152 points. postmasters, in turn, post ancl telephone the notices to the various subscribers and other persons interested. casting notices are sent to 5,000 railway stations in all parts of the States, and are there posted in the waiting-rooms, so that travellers can at once ascertain the weather conditions in their own districts and advise their .friends at home of the necessary preparations to be made to secure their crops or other property. beneficial to the people. There is no institution in the United States which has a greater hold on the people, or is deemed to be of greater benefit to them, than the Weather Bureau. Whilst we may not be so ambitious at the outset, I trust that we shall proceed in no halting way, but that we shall establish a central bureau, where meteorology work alone will be conducted, and that we shall work on until we obtain such a system as that which I have described. It is impossible to underrate the value of this weather data to business interests. The warnings of the approach of severe and injurious weather conditions which are issued in the United States of America are valuable beyond computation. ings are sent to 300 different points along the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Gulf coasts, and also along the shores of the great lakes, and so effective is the service that for vears not one storm has occurred respecting which warnings have not been issued from 12 to 24 hours before its approach. Vessels have thus been detained in port, and it is estimated that the saving in this way secured represents a value of $30,000,000. Cold wave warnings are the effect of the weather issued from 2*4 to 36 hours in advance, and observations, persons having crops or other properties correspondents. liable to be injured by these occurrences are bulletins, able to cover them up or to take other steps the country. to protect their interests. I read a year which or two ago that in one county alone the value of the strawberry crops, which had been saved as the result of these notices, was estimated to be equal to the whole cost of the Meteorological Department during the year in question. With an accurate Snow and ice bulletins knowledge of the precipitation, the authorities, knowing the number of inches of rain that have fallen, are able to forecast floods, and so to warn the people in time to protect their property. By means of this great Department, thousands of lives and property of immense value have been saved from destruction. Since the Bureau was These properly organized under the system I have just described, the percentage of wrecks around the coast and on the great lakes In addition, the forehas decreased to a remarkable extent. In this Continent we have not the same wide range of climate, nor have we the extreme vicissitudes of cold and heat-of snow and ice-that are experienced in America. Still all this work would be useful here. Mere State work must necessarily be defective. What we need is to have the work cenThis work is highly tralized, placed under the control of one man, and carried out by a staff subject to proper discipline. This must be done in order that the Federal Department maybe what it ought to be. No other country offers a finer field for meteorology than does Australia. This Continent is peculiarly adapted to ""such work, and, given a proper system, conducted at reasonable expense, the Department should be able to forecast weather changes all over the Continent, and so would be productive of great good. This work should be carried out for the whole Continent, and not for any one part of it. The staff of the Department should be absolutely independent of the Public SerStorm warnvice. If the Department is to be effective, absolute discipline, prompt obedience, care, and attention are required. The Weather Bureau of the United States has a very well-disciplined staff, and this perhaps may be partlv due to the fact that it was for manv vears carried on under the military system. The chief can suspend an. officer at a moment's notice, and may conduct inquiries as to carelessness or breaches of discipline.

I do not see anything especially Federal about the work of the astronomical branch', though it may be that slight savings in the direction suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney could be effected under Commonwealth control. Having regard to greserit conditions, the astronomical and meteorological branches forming one Department in each of the States, it might be more economical for the Commonwealth to take over both branches^ re-apportioning the work of the observatories, than to merely take over the meteorsent state of efficiency, merely as aids and ological work, leaving the astronomical work to be performed, as now, under the control of the Governments of the States. The astronomers who met in .conference in Adelaide in 1905 appear to be opposed to the transfer of the astronomical branch to the Commonwealth. At the present time, it is, perhaps, natural that men should object to being brought under the protecting aegis of the Commonwealth Government ; but their pbjections are supported by reasons which, if not conclusive, deserve a good deal of attention. They do not think that any of the work done by the observatories can be dispensed with, and recommend that it be continued on the present lines. They say, too, that not much saving will be effected in connection with the transfer of the meteorological branch, although they recognise that a central bureau like that of the United States of America would render more effective the work of comparing and recording meteorological phenomena, and the publication of forecasts. does not seem likely that a large saving would be effected by taking over both the astronomical and meteorological branches. see. saving in the direction pointed out by the honourable member for North Sydney. neither the observatories nor their work can be reduoed. reasons for that statement. Most, if not all, the leading universities in the old country and in Europe are affiliated"" with observatories, or have observatories of their own. States of America also. astronomy studied;, but attention is also given to physical astronomy, and to the taking of observations. I know that, in connection with the 'Dublin University, Sir Robert Ball's services were at times availed of, though his official position was that of Astronomer Royal for Ireland^ and he was not directly connected with the University as a professor. Seeing how widely availed of are the opportunities for study afforded by our universities, it would be a pity if the observatories were not kept in their preauxiliaries to education, though, according, to the report, there is room for improvement in their equipment. If the Commonwealth takes them over, their sphere of usefulness must not be narrowed, and I , therefore, cannot see where any great saving cantake place, unless, by the re-apportioning of work, duplication, which is now alleged to exist, can be dispensed with. at the head of our observatories. at the head of each .observatory, who hasunder him a chief assistant'and a staff, not only of men employed in the clerical work of making records, but also of men of comparatively high scientific attainments. Mr Cooke, though a subordinate officer ire the Adelaide Observatory, was a man of fairlv high standing in his profession when removed to his present position in the Perth' Observatory; and there must be others possessing great professional knowledge, whoUnder the circumstances, it would always be entitled to fairly good salaries. If the result of transferring theobservatories to the Commonwealth werethat men of high attainments were not appointed to the vacancies created by theleaving of men of good professional reputation, the service might be impaired. It is probably considerations of this sort that have induced the Government to say that at this stage it is not necessary for the Commonwealth to take over both the astronomical and the meteorological branch, and, going on the statements in the report to which I have referred, it does not seem to me to be necessary. One of the weaknesses of the Bill is that the States mav refuse to co-operate in the manner provided"" for by clause 5, in which case there would be a duplication of staffs. The measurehas been framed on the assumption that the States will co-operate, though we have nopower to compel them to do so.",35,Meteorology Bill Second Reading

If the States render us any services in connection with the Meteorological Department they will no doubt charge us for them, but such items of expenditure will merely involve a cross entry, so far as the whole of Australia is concerned. almost impossible to estimate what the Department will cost. The question of the expenditure upon such work should really be only a secondary consideration. should pay regard, ira the first instance, to the necessity of making the Department of practical use. must be extended, probably at an increased cost, but we shall be fully recompensed for any outlay by the greater value of the information furnished to those deeply concerned in our weather conditions. We must leave it to the Minister to see that the Department is organized with due re-, gard to economy, consistent with the highest degree of efficiency. quite agree with the honourable member for Echuca that efficiency should be the first consideration, but I do not think we should pass measures of this kind without having some idea of the expense involved. I have already stated that the Commonwealth is the proper authority to control such a Department, and I hope that its administration will prove of the utmost benefit to the people. The Minister tells us that, under the arrangement made at the Hobart Conference, the States will debit the Commonwealth with the cost of any services rendered by them in connection with the new Department. Mr 'GROOM -That applies to all Departments. indicates that the payment for such service will in certain cases be made by a mere book entry, it will be a somewhat serious matter as between the Commonwealth and the States, because it will involve a further drain upon our fourth of the Customs revenue, instead of the cost being charged to the three-fourths share that falls to the States. I am confident that the present Minister will exercise economy, but, as is often said, we do not know what future Ministers might do. The principle of the Bill is perfectly sound, and I do not wish it to be thought for a moment that I am taking the slightest exception to it. I trust that the services rendered by the new Department will more than compensate the public for any expense that it may"" entail. [5.40] I agree with'the honourable member for Echuca that our first object should be to make the Department useful. I am afraid that if we leave the States to still carrv' on the astronomical work now performed by them, their Departments will be maintained upon the same footing as at present, and we shall merely be adding We another Department to those already in existence, and thereby increase the tota[ expenditure. The very first thing to be The work is one which aimed at in. connection with a new Department is efficiency, but economy also must be studied. I do not see what is to hinder us from paving regard to both these matters. I think that, if .we had an efficient central bureau, all that we should need besides would be a few small observing stations in various localities, from which results might be transmitted to> headquarters. I judge from the figures supplied by the Minister, that the equipment of the States Departments varies very considerably. In New South Wales, the Astronomical and Meteorological Department emplovs nineteen officers, whose combined salaries amount to £ 4 , 0 0 0. In Victoria twenty-five officers are employed at a similar outlay. The astronomical and meteorological equipment in Victoria is valued at y?/io,ooo.

The States now pay us for the weather telegrams, but they will be relieved of that necessity if we take over the Meteorological Department. is that we shall have to pay for them out of our one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue, instead of their being paid for by the States out of their three-fourths share. It seems to me that we must add the cost of the weather telegrams to the estimate of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 furnished by the Minister. I think that such an estimate ought to have been submitted to the House upon the motion for the second reading of the B ill. It ought to"" have been possible for honourable members to see whether any saving in the cost of administering this Department is contemplated, and, if so, in what direction. Surelyi t would not be a difficult matter to get either Mr Baracchi, or some other officer, to submit an estimate of the probable efficiency and expense of the Department, regarded as a whole. I think that the matter rightly comes up for consideration now that we are allocating the functions of the proposed bureau. The estimate to which reference has already been made was, I understand, formulated by Mir. Wragge, some five or six years ago. However much we may admire that gentleman in certain directions, I have yet to learn that we can regard him as a financier. My experience of him is that his attributes lie in an entirely different direction from that of financial management. Unless we can increase the usefulness of this Department by assuming control of it , we had better leave it alone entirely. I fear that an increase in its usefulness will prove expensive, if we are to deal with it in this piecemeal way. If we are to leave to the States their observatories, their buildings, their instruments, and their many highsalaried officials, and if we are to establish a central bureau with another set of highly paid officials, we shall certainly increase the total cost of administering the Department, without being able to insure a more efficient service. I do think that all the money which may be spent upon the central Federal bureau ought to be derived from the shearing down of some of the States bureaux. I may be wrong in entertaining that idea, but, if so. it should at least be possible for the Minister to prove that I am mistaken, according to the views of the best authorities. am rather interested in the opinions which have been expressed by two honourable members who hail from the "" land o' cakes."" I refer to the honourable member for Echuca, who represented one side of the case, and to the honourable member for Wide Bay, who put the other side. Upon this occasion, it seems to me that the honourable member for Echuca has adopted the role which is so frequently adopted by the Treasurer, when he exclaims ' ' Oh! what is a million?"" Upon the other hand, the honourable member for Wide Bay asks the Committee to proceed with caution, and to obtain from the Minister an estimate of the probable cost of the working of a Federal Meteorological Department. I agree that, before the Bill is finally disposed of, honourable members should be given some guarantee that due regard will be paid to the economical administration of this new Department. The deputy-leader of the Opposition stated, at the outset of his remarks, that lhe agreed with the honourable member for Echuca, but in his closing observations he conclusively showed that he was entirely in agreement with the honourable member for Wide Bay. that I agreed with the honourable member for Echuca that we ought to make this new Department an efficient and useful one. that point. In dealing with this question we have a right to know how we are going "" to raise the wind."" That is a matter of grave importance. Before we give a blank cheque for the creation of a new Department we should have some idea of what its cost will be, and how that cost is to be borne. The Minister of Home Affairs has stated that the cost of weather telegrams will no longer be borne by the States when this Bill has become law. Then the £ 4 0 . 0 0 0 which has been hitherto paid by the States will represent a loss to the Commonwealth. Of course, we are all aware that the same taxpayers will have to provide the monev.

When an officer is appointed by the Government under this Bill he will probably find it necessary to adopt the plan of dividing Australia into forecasting districts which may not be based upon mere State lines, but upon geographical features. For instance, there may be one in Adelaide, another in Western Australia, and two or three upon the eastern coast. I have here a map showing the way in which that practice works in the United States. The opinion which I have expressed is that which is held by eminent meteorologists in Australia. They believe that it will be necessary to carry out the system to which I have alluded. [5.58] I regard the explanation of the Minister as satisfactory. Reference has been made to the forecasts formerly issued by Mr Wragge. Honourable members_have spoken of their general accuracy, but it should be remembered that they were based on information furnished by officials in the different States. These officers are in a better position to issue reliable forecasts than any central bureau. As regards South Australia, Mr Wragge's forecasts were framed on local data, but the locallv-issued forecasts gave a much higher percentage of correctness. If we are to have reliable forecasts, and to establish a general average of accuracy throughout the Commonwealth, those forecasts will have to be made in different centres, in the way that has been suggested by the Minister.

I have risen to suggest that, when a Commonwealth Meteorological Department is formed, consideration should be given to tlie statements made by Professor Gregory in a lecture delivered in Melbourne on the subject of Australian meteorological conditions and the forecasting of weather. He is of opinion that the temperature of the waters on our coasts, influenced as it is by ocean currents, may have a material effect upon our weather conditions, and suggested that a small sum should be expended annually in recording the temperature of the seai at various places. He admitted that it would be some time before suffiI quite agree with the cient data would be available to substantiate I would point out any reasonable theory, but he thought that an expenditure of £ 5 0 0 per annum might produce results of value in meteorological research. I think it would be well for the Commonwealth Department of Meteorology, when created, to give attention to that suggestion. I wish it to be clearly the amendment as unnecessary. Clause5 specially refers to the utilization of the services of the officers of the States. Our Public Service Act contains a provision enabling the Government to avail itself of the services of officers of t'he States, and (Parramatta) allowing our officials to do work for the States authorities, and in this clause we are declaring that we intend to make use of that provision, and take advantage, for a time, of the services of States officers. The clause amounts to a declaration that we are going to exercise tbe powers whose exercise is provided for by the Public Service Act, it may be with unnecessary amplification of detail. On the other hand, the power proposed to be conferred by the amendment seems to be inherent in the Government. If we say that the Government is to undertake the control of meteorological observations, it will have power to do so. . cannotsee that paragraph c of clause 5 has the application which, the honourable and learned member wishes to give to it. necessary; it is surplusage. ment may be redundant, but I point out that paragraph c of clause 5 errs in the same direction.

267,Debate (On Motion By Mr Joseph Cook),"Debate resumed from 31st July (vide That the Bill be now read a second time. -through the Bill very carefully this morning, and I think it is to be more com-mended for its purpose than for what it achieves. I had thought that a Bill which aims at uniformity would have been more in line with English legislation. We have welcomed the tendency recently shown to promote uniformity throughout the Empire in matters regarding which there is no necessity to have local diversity; especially when that uniformity is only part of the .greater scheme of uniformity which is aimed at under international reciprocity treaties. The growth of international re-ciprocity in these matters makes us more hopeful that the comity of nations will become a little more marked than in the past. Imperial statesmen, as well as commercial representatives of the Empire, desire that there shall be' uniformity as far as possible in regard to patents, copyrights, and designs. Copyright is a general term, covering copyright in books and designs. From the syllabus of the Sixth Congress of the Chambers of Commerce of the Empire, published in the Weekly Times of 20th June, 1906, I find that one of the notices of motion given wasThat it is desirable that the law of copyright should be uniform throughout the Empire, and that the existing laws relating to copyright be amended when necessary by Imperial and Colonial legislation, so as to give to all citizens of two matters had been dealt with in the one the Empire, subject to local conditions and formalities, identical rights and protection throughtrouble of repeating the provisions. Why out the Empire for all their productions, whether 'literary, artistic, musical, or dramatic. The same principle, of course, applies to designs. I think that the expediency of Imperial uniformity in these matters was referred to at some of the Imperial Conferences of the last few years. mentioned at the Conference of 1902, if -not at that of 1887. Under these circumstances, it is to be deplored that Ministers, -whilst professing to follow the spirit, depart from the letter and structure, of the Imperial Acts. .1 do not intend, in connection with such a technical subject, td quote more than one or two instances of the departure referred to. In England, designs and patents are dealt with in the one Act, and the articles to which designs have to be affixed and with respect to which designs may be registered are scheduled, not in the Act, but in the rules laid down by the Board of Trade. These rules have a publicitya far wider publicity-tha n regulations such as those prescribed by the' Bill, which will be found only in the somewhat cloistral seclusion of that interesting periodical, which no one reads, called the Commonwealth Government Gazette. In a matter of this kind, which is to some extent Imperial, if not international, it is desirable that our laws should be made as public as possible, so that people of other nations, as well as the citizens of the Commonwealth, may have an opportunity of ascertaining by reference to the statute-book the full meaning and scope of our legislation. . If, however, they have to wade through the, sometimes not properly indexed, files of our Government Gazette and Blue Books to find out which of the articles will come within the categorv of designs, they may quite innocently commit an offence against the law. The Board of Trade have made rules in England, under which fourteen articles are specified as coming within the designs part of the Patents Act. I cannot understand why patents and designs should have been dealt with in two separate measures, except that it may have been desired to introduce the Bills in different sessions. The effect is to duplicate the machinery, because in the English Act' a great many of the sections are quite as applicable to copyright in designs as to patents. Under this Bill we have adopted a good many of the sections of the Patents Act, whereas if the measure we should have saved ourselves the should we not follow the sufficiently concise terminology of the English Act? They have a good drafting staff in England, and it is desirable that, as far as possible, our laws should run upon all fours with the Imperial. Statutes, so that the decisions of the CourtsI t was upon Imperial Statutes may be applicable to the interpretation of our local laws. The Privy Council still reconciles most of the decisions of our Courts, and that tribunal is nothing more than another edition of the House of Lords. The same Judges sit upon both Benches, and act as interpreters of Imperial as well as Australian legislation. Therefore it is eminently desirable that there should be no difference in the wording or structure of the Imperial and Australian",43,Meteorology Bill Second Reading
268,"Page 2056), On Motion By Mr Groom",,44,Designs Bill Second Reading
269,Mr Glynn (Angas) [7.3°],"I lookedStatutes. At all events, where no apparent object is served, I do not see why the Commonwealth draftsman should alter the structure of the Imperial provisions, split up the sections, and very often vary the terminology. Clause4 of the Bill contains a definition of ""design."" It is very small, and embraces only a small portion of the Imperial definition. It may simplify matters if I read section 60 of the Patents Designs and Trade Marks Act of 1883, which contains a definition of "" design."" It reads"" Design"" means any design applicable to any article of manufacture, or to any substance, artificial or natural, OT partly artificial and partly natural, whether the design is applicable for the pattern or for the shape or configuration, they be by printing, painting, embroidering, or for the ornament thereof, or for any two or more such purposes, and by whatever means it is applicable, whether by printing, painting, embroidering, weaving, sewing, modelling, casting, embossing, engraving, staining, or any other means ""whatever, manual, mechanical, or chemical, separate or combined. In drafting the Bill, which from the marginal notes professes to be in conformity with the Imperial Act, the method 'has been adopted of knocking out a part of the specification in the Imperial definition and then dividing the remainder into two sections, one of which is included, as it ought to be, in the interpretation clause, whilst the other is not. The definition of "" design "" is to toe article found partly in the interpretation clause, -and partly in clause 5, which may be regarded as one of the enacting provisions of the measure. The structure of the expression in clause 5 has been varied from that adopted in the English Act. Some words have Thus it does not afford any indication of been added, and others have been left out. what is meant by the Legislature as does In clause 4 it is provided"" Design"" means an industrial design applicwe have omitted the words "" artificial, or able, in any way or by any means, to the purnatural, or partly artificial and partly napose of the ornamentation, or pattern, or shape, or configuration, of an article, or to any two or tural."" That fact enhances the difficulty more of those purposes; The word "" industrial,"" which has been cate added, and appears also in the title of the Bill, does not occur in the English Act, ficial and I fail to see the object of its insertion stances. here. It may mean a limitation. The Immeaning that perial Act of 1883 was a consolidation of to the word ""I industrial."" the Act of 01842 and some amending adopted is not in the interests Acts. ornamental designs, but the Act of 1883 reAgain, in the Imperial Act there is a'delates to ornamental and useful designsthe word "" useful "" not being employed in finition the definition, but being the result of the definition. Therefore, designs under the apply Imperial law, as well as under the Bill, or to any substance as aforesaid in the class or may be ornamental or useful. If the word classes in which the design is registered. "" industrial "" is not qualified by the use of other words, the meaning of the tenn "" design "" will be somewhat limited. Owing to the distinction previously drawn and still drawn in the Act of 1883 between ""ornamental "" and "" useful,"" the word "" industrial "" may limit the application of the definition. It is certainly inconsistent with the subsequent wording of the clause, which includes the word "" ornamentation."" It is incongruous with the context. I regret that the Minister has not shown us why this departure has been made from the wording of the English Act, and why a word has been inserted which may lead tb diversity of interpretation. In the English Act the means of attachment are specified, whether weaving, &c. That, I believe, is done with a twofold object. The first is a desire toindicate to some extent how the attachment is to be made, because in both the Imperial Act and in this Bill there is a provision that the registered mark must be attached to the goods. It is not left to each person to decide with what publicity the mark shall be so attached. In the English legislation, I repeat, the method of attachment is specified. But in this Bill the definition is contained in two provisions. Clause 5declaresA design shall be deemed to be applied to an. when(4) the design is applied, in any way, or by any means to the purpose of the ornamentation, or pattern, or shape, or configuration of the article, or to any two or more of those purposes. the Imperial Act. Again, from that clause which I have been endeavouring to indiin connection) with the use of the word ""industrial,"" which, is more related to artisubstances than it is to natural subwhich I By the excision of the words to have referred the limitation of have indicated may be given As the method The Act of 1842 dealt only with I fail to see why it has beenofemployed. lucidity,. finition of copyright in designs. That dereads"" Copyright"" means the exclusive right tba design to any article of manufacture, Designs Bill. The draftsman of this Bill has not followed the Imperial Act in that connection. The word "" copyright "" is not defined in our interpretation clause, where one would naturally look for it , but is inserted in clause 12, where its meaning is expressed .in different word's. that° Copyright in a design means the right to apply the designand then these words are addedor authorize another person to apply the design to the articles in respect of which it is registered. Why are these words inserted? They cannot be required in connection with assignments, because the latter are specially provided for. designate persons who take designs for owner of the copyright, "" sells or offers for value or consideration. The object of that sale "" any article to which the design or definition is attained by clause 30, which any fraudulent or obvious imitation of it is supposed to be similar in purport to has been applied. I point out these diffisection 58 of the Imperial Act. clause readsA person shallbe deemed to infringe the say that the Imperial Acts are always copyright in a registered design, if , whilst the copyright continues he, without the licence or right, but I do say ""that they are generally authority of the owner of the copyright . does certain things. used subsequently, I hold that there is no better drafted than are the corresponding necessity to include them in clause 12.

But why is not the person authorized under perial legislation in this connection. clause 12-if the definition contained in some of our State Acts we have literally that provision means anything-as o enadopted the phraseology of legislation in titled to sue for and recover for his own the old country. This is notably the case use the penalty provided under this clause ? in connection with the Sale of Goods Act. It seems to me that a departure has been I do not think that I need detain the House made from the English terminology withfurther in discussing this Bill, which is out regard to its effect. manship ? the Imperial Statute the particular Act in industrial design under clause 39. That relation to which knowledge is implied is clause providesspecified in connection with the word "" knowing! v.""

That is what is meant by [REPRESENTATIVES.] Designs Bill. specified, and then the word ""knowingly "" is used in connection with it, so that there can be no misapprehension as to what was the intention of the Legislature. Then, again the words in which an offence is declared in this Bill are different from those emThat clause provides ployed in the 'Imperial Act. For instance, section 58 of the Imperial statute proexclusive videsIt shall not be lawful for any person to publish or expose for sale any article of manufacture or any substance to which such design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation thereof shall have been so applied, &c. In this Bill, however, a person is deemed to infringe the copyright in a registered design if , whilst the copyright continues, They are not intended to lie, without licence or authority of the The culties to indicate that a departure has been made from Imperial legislation.

""The Supreme Court"" means the Supreme Court of a State or any Judge thereof. . . . the Minister will tell us why this method of drafting has been adopted. Will he tell us why, for instance, the definition of "" design "" in the English Act has been cut down, then divided, and added to? For instance, the word ""industrial "" is used in this clause, although I cannot find it in any Act. in the report of the Convention of 1883. Will the Minister tell us why there is such a variation from the English Act? of Home Affairs) [8.2] This form of drafting has been adopted with a view to make the definitions as short and as simple as possible, so that they may be readily understood. Any departure that has been made from the English Act is not one of principle: the substance of the English legislation has been preserved. If the honourable member turns to the definition of the word "" design "" he will find that it contains everything in the English section that is essential. In that Act the word "" design "" is defined as meaningany design applicable to any article of manufacture . . . and by whatever means it is applicable, whether by printing, painting, embroidering, weaving, sewing, modelling, casting, embossing, engraving, staining, or any other means whatever . . In the Bill we define "" design"" as meaningan industrial design applicable in any way or by any means to the purpose of the ornamentation, or pattern, or shape, or configuration, of an the moment, he did not anticipate-of the article, or to any two or more of those purposes. The English definition, after setting out It does various means by which it is applicable, contains the words, "" or any other means whatever."" sign "" applicable in the widest way. I think that the definition is a decided improvement upon that contained in the E'njg[ repeat that the Bill is essentiallylish Act. I would point out that the word "" a r t i c l e "" has been defined in the Bill shortly as meaning "" any article or substance."" Designs are usually applied only to industrial purposes. In the International Convention the word "" industrial "" is expressly used. We haive there the words Committee: "" industrial designs or models,"" which constitute the subject-matter of the Convention. patents and everything else. "" in d u s t r i a l "" is used, I am informed, in the Tasmania^ Act, and also, I believe, in the South Australian Statute. It certainly makes clear the purpose for which a design may be used. A comparison of this clause with the definition clause in the English.

I have endeavoured to point out to the Committee the possible danger of this definition. The same method is adopted in the Copyright Act, the Patents Act, and also, I believe, the Trade Marks Act, and we have found that the perfecting of the English expression in connection with definitions is faulty. The Committee will remember that that was our experience in connection with the definition of ""trade mark."" The definition in the Trade Marks Bill was an emendation, it was said, from the latest English Statute, but on close examination it was found to be nothing of the sort. I am merely pointing out that in many cases we may not attain our object in making these departures. Unless the draftsman is particularly careful to see that he has condensed the essence of various English definitions, there mav be a clanger which, at object being, to some extent, varied.",46,Designs Bill Second Reading

The head office was at the Seat of Government, and, I think, it was proposed to have a sub-office in Sydney. In all the other States, however, there were to be mere agencies, the records kept at those agencies being far more meagre than was necessary for the information of those concerned. I do not know that even yet the necessary information is obtainable in the sub-offices relating to patents, although, at the request of certain commercial bodies in South Australia, I forwarded their remonstrances to the Minister, and he consented to adhere to the provisions of the Act by creating sub-offices. What appears to be still wanting at the sub-offices is a complete registration showing the applications and the entries, that are made from week to week, so that by examination a person, say, in Adelaide, can find out what is being done just as if he had made the examinat tion at the principal office. I am informed should they be that the necessary work of registration and indexing can be done in. the sub-offices without involving much extra expense. If that be so, I hope the Minister will see that it is carried out, not only under the Patents Act, but also in connection with this measure. The information required at the sub-offices, under the Patents Act, is not complete, or, at all events, it was not a fortnight ago.

Now, it is obvious that he could not manufacture in the Commonwealth a wall paper or a carpet 'for. which he had registered a design within six months from the date of such registration. TQ obtain the necessary machinery to enable him to do so would involve the expenditure of many thousands of pounds. Consequently, he would enjoy no protection whatever. I can readily conceive that there might be many instances of that kind. pose a limitation as to the use of any design in Australia. to use an article is a very different matter from manufacturing it. who has to use it. of a thing, I take it, means its consumption. by the registered proprietor of the design or under his authority. and "" manufacture "" are -synonymous terms. Clause 28 providesThe owner of a registered design shall, within sonably consider whether in the cases two years after registration, substantially use the design, or cause it to be substantially used in Australia in the manufacture of articles, and if he fails to do so, the copyright in the design shall cease. Provided that if such design is used in any manufacture abroad, the period aforesaid shall be limited to six months. I am bound to say that the provision is not very clear, and in my opinion the Minister's explanation does not cover some of the cases suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney. Certainly it does not cover cases in which the article could, under no circumstances, be manufactured in Australia within the prescribed period. not prepared off-hand to agree with the Minister's claim tliat this provision substantially follows the lines of the Imperial Act. Certainly, the section in the Imperial statute is rather peculiar in its phraseology. It readsI f a registered design is used in manufacture in a foreign country, and is not used in this country the words ""used in manufacture"" not being repeated. It seems difficult to speak of "" using a design"" except in connection with manufacture, but when we find that the words "" in manufacture"" are used in the first part of the section, and omitted from the second, we are justified in believing that a Court would probably hold that the Legislature intended to make some difference between those two parts. would seek to ascertain if there was a difference in meaning between the two terms. Consequently, the Minister's claim that he is following English legislationhas scarcely been established. But the main question at issue is as to whether this clause is reasonable. I must confess that a person who is manufacturing abroad, and sending his articles to Australia has not any very strong claim to our protection in the matter of his design. If he wishes a quid pro quo he had better give the quo before he' accepts the quid, or, at any rate, within a reasonable time after he has received it. Of course, the Patents Act provides similar-thoug h not by any means identical-protectio n to the patent.ee of articles which are manufactured abroad. Certainly, if there be a choice between the clause as it stands, and no such provision, I shall support the clause. At the same time, I think that the Minister might reawhich have been raised, the clause would not operate unfairly -to those who arte 1 sending into Australia goods which are manufactured abroad.

We have ample power to protect our own people by means of the Tariff, and by other means without endeavouring to accomplish that end in an indirect way in a measure for the registration of industrial designs. I would ask the Minister how he can justify the granting of patents for articles which are not manufactured in Australia in the light of his statement that we should not register designs relating to goods not manufactured in Australia?

Then, as the honourable and learned member for West Sydney asked, "" What protection will be conferred by this clause upon the person who cannot manufacture here?"" If it be impossible for him. to do so point of view? because so small a quantity of the goods is used here, or because the climatic conditions are not suitable, or because the material from which a particular article can be manufactured, is not obtainable in Australia.

The Minister knows perfectly well what interpretation is attached to the word "" user"" in other cases. The clause will tend to encourage dishonesty, and, moreover, it does not permit us to deal reciprocally with Great Britain. drafted this clause in the Senate he saidI suggest that we should embody in the form of a proviso the substance of the Imperial Act. with that phase of the question.

I do not speak from an absolute knowledge of the law, but my commercial experience leads me to believe that one could protect oneself in that way. If that be so, there should be some reciprocity.

According to my reading of the Bill, however, that will not be possible. made in Great Britain will give only a right to register, and the consequent rights which the Act confers. measure will deliberately deny the right in question. exactly all reciprocal arrangements made. Minister can assure me that neither in Great ""Britain nor any foreign country can an Australian register a design and be protected in that market in respect of goods made by him according to that design in Australia view of the English Act, that goods made according to a design registered there must be manufactured in Great Britain within a limited time. lish Act does not bear out that view. leave the honourable and learned member for Angas, with his legal knowledge, to deal person invents a design-especiall y if he be a British subject-and registers it here, he should not be prevented, even when there are no manufacturers of goods of that design in Australia, from taking action against competitors elsewhere who may be pirating it and using it to his detriment here.

It has been stated by the Minister and other lawyers in the House, that perhaps the wording of the clause at present covers such an appeal ; but how .the use of the word ""rectification"" applies to such appeals, I am at a loss to understand I find on referring to a dictionary, that rectification means, "" the act of rectifying or setting right that which is wrong."" when something is omitted. absolutely nothing in it wrong? The clause relates to something that is wrongly inserted in the book. which is supposed to contain a list of the registered designs. the refusal by the law officer to register a design would be an entry rightly, and not wrongly, omitted? no entry at all, so that from that point of view it could not be either right or wrong.

The Encyclopcedia of the Laws of England, Volume 4, refers to this question. It states, at page 235I f the comptroller grants the registration, he gives a certificate which is prima facie evidence of what it states (Act of 18S3, ss. 40, 96); but after hearing the applicant, he may refuse registration, a i d from his decision-there is an appeal to the Board of Trade. Opponents are not heard; if any party is aggrieved by registration, his remedy is to apply to rectify the register. All this is done under section 90 of the English Act of 1883.

417,Mr Groom (Darling Downs,"Ministe rposition is no doubt complicated by the desire to pass legislation in this particular form in order to fall into line with international conventions, but I think that the point raised by the honourable member for North Sydney is well worthy of consideration. If some design occurs to the mind of a person in England and to the mind of a person in Australia at about the same time, and the latter applies for registration, the former may subsequently apply for registration, and secure priority for his application. similar provision in the Patents Act, but I am doubtful as to its wisdom. It is conceivable that information with'regard to an Australian invention might be cabled to England, and, although application for registration might be made in England subsequent to the date of the Australian application, priority might be obtained by the English applicant. I suggest that the clause should be postponed. 1 members to pass the clause now.

My opinion is that sequent application, over an Australian applicant for a copyright of a design would be to the last degree unreasonable. Notwithstanding that a similar provision may be in the Fatents Act and in the Imperial statute, I do not think we should allow the clause to pass in its present form, unless it can be shown that some grave irregularity would arise. should be amended by the insertion of the words "" of a subsequent date"" after the word "" applicants.""

I do not intend to repeat the arguments I used during the second-reading debate. I desire merely to test the feeling of the House upon the question of whether we should not take over both the Astronomical and the Meteorological Departments of the States. I think that we should do so. If we neglect to do so, it will be an intimation to the States that we are very unlikely to assume control of their Astronomical Departments in the future.

If any State officers can ibe spared we shall be very glad to utilize their services with a view to effecting economy. But the proposal to take over the Astronomical Departments of the States is opposed by Professor Lyle, Mr Baracchi, and Mr Kernot. They declare that these institutions are essentially State institutions, and that they are engaged in scientific research of an advanced kind.

433,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"relating to astronomy in the thirty-nine subvery much surprised if the work is done jects upon which we are empowered to legislate under the Constitution. The fact that it has been included is the best answer to the honourable member. the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Echuca, and' which doubtless were urged at the Federal Convention, a decision adverse to them was arrived at. It is not the intention of the supporters of this proposal that this related group of subous States, with a mod'est Department, and jects should be taken over by the Commonwealth-becaus e they, are very intimately related, not only in the public mind, but in themselves-for the purpose of mixing them up and thus creating confusion. But they maintain that the two Departments may be kept as distinct under Federal as they can be under State control. After all, we must recognise one outstanding fact, namely, that very frequently in Australia a single officer has combined a knowledge of these two services so far as their supreme control was concerned. have never heard that the services in New South Wales suffered anything from being under the control of one head, and I have yet to learn that the two services in South Australia were injured from being under the capable control of Sir Charles Todd. That gentleman had the ability to prosecute the study of both of these sciences with marked success. criticise him. that! there are not many individuals in Australia who are capable of successfully criticising Sir Charles Todd in either of these two branches of knowledge. He had made himself a. master of both of them with great advantage to his own State and to the rest of Australia. If we can combine these related forms of wisdom in one man, is it not better that we should do so? What the people require is to obtain as great a degree of efficiency from these services as is possible, together with economic management. I know that in this Bill provision is made to take advantage of the services of certain States officers, but I venture to say that the Federal officer who will be appointed will not be able to exercise the same control over them as he would exercise if they were Federal officials. I shall be as efficiently under, this separate-and it may sometimes be conflicting-contro l as it would be if the control were unified. However, we are required by the Constitution to take over these services for good reasons which were offered to the Convention delegates, and there seems to be no valid reason why, at the present stage, we should separate this group of functions. If we had an efficient central staff, all we should need would be observers in the varia modest position. These observers would be subsidiary to the central bureau. That plan has been found to be a very excellent one in every other Department of business enterprise, from the stand-point of the saving of labour and money, and of contributing to greater efficiency of control. What works advantageously in every department of commercial life ought to work equally well even in scientific circles. I cordially support the proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney, in the belief that its adoption would ultimately lead to greater economy and efficiency. wish .it to be distinctly understood that I do not support the motion mainly upon the ground of economy. I am entirely in accord with all that the honourable member for Echuca has said concerning the fundamental difference which exists between these two Departments. The services should be kept absolutely separate. They deal with different subjects, and consequently should be kept apart. At the same time, I'fail to see why the Commonwealth should not take over both Departments and keep them separate from each other. that ? monwealth could keep these two great Departments separate just as well as can the States. There is ini the Constitution an implied direction that we should simultaneously take over both services. Sub-section v in . of section 51 empowers us to make laws with regard to .astronomical and meteorological observations-in other words, to take over these two Departments. The implied direction there is that if we take over one Department we must assume control of both. The Constitution links them together as kindred subjects.

442,Mr Kelly,"I think so. The Comnevertheless, I think that the Commonwealth should take over both of them. We can keep them apart under our own jurisdiction. In Australia sufficient importance has not hitherto been attached to the science of meteorology. We could have had forecasts, and in the course of time reliable forecasts for seasons, as well as in regard to local disturbances. When the Commonwealth takes over this great Department, I trust tliat it will see that it is completely reorganized, and made of substantial advantage to the great producing interests of the 'Commonwealth. like to mention that in the report of the Conference which the Minister circulated amonigst a few honourable members ithis afternoon, it is mentioned that even if the Astronomical Department be not taken over by the Commonwealth, the two branches of astronomy and meteorology will be carried on together by the States. That is a matter which affects my judgment in voting for the recommittal, because, if the two branches are still to be worked as they have hitherto been tain that statement. tion to that effect. have been made. recommendations of the Conference. They States at the present time have not both say that if the Commonwealth does take over services ? the meteorological branch, it will still be. conducted in Adelaide, and some of the has practically neither service. . other capitals of the States, in conjunction with the Astronomical Department, so that, a desire on the part of honourable members even if both were taken over, there would be to assist by every means in our power those no difference so far as administration is who are helping to make the country that concerned.

It was most richly deserved, and as Sir Charles has retired from the Commonwealth service. I thin|k one may say very fairly that there never was in Australia a more efficient public officer. His scientific attainments are recognised throughout the world. I intend to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for North Sydney, because the two Departments in South Australia are at present practically conducted as one, and whilst I am sure that their division would have the effect of increasing the expenditure, I am by no means satisfied that it /would in any way add to efficiency. I agree with the honourable member for Barker that it is inadvisable for the House to take any action calculated to increase our expenditure.

I am dealing with the question on broad lines, and it appears -to me that we shall increase the expenditure of the States as a whole by allowing the astronomical branch to remain, under their control whilst we take over the Department of Meteorology. If the astronomical branch is taken over by the Commonwealth it will be possible to have a chief astronomer, with his administrative staff, at the Seat of Government, and merely observers elsewhere, who will send the records of their observations to the head office for classification. This will save expense in administration. In any case, the meteorological work may be, and should be, kept apart from the astronomical work. It is much the more practical, and therefore the more immediately useful of the two. With regard to the objection of the honourable member for Franklin, Tasmania will have more to pay, even if we take over the meteorological branch only, because, instead of getting her meteorological information practically free of cost, as at present, she will have to pay her share of the cost of the Commonwealth Department. would be still heavier if the astronomical branch were transferred to the Commonwealth. position of one State should not be allowed to prevent an arrangement being made which would be advantageous to the Commonwealth as a whole. know what astronomical work is being done in Australia? though no doubt it is of great scientific value.

If the clause were only to apply in special cases, such as those mentioned in the memorandum that has been read, I should not object, but it gives the same power in regard to every account that has to be audited. That is my objection. The Treasurer points out that there is a similar provision in the New South Wales Act. Eveni f that be so, I am not aware that the finances of New South Wales have been conducted in a manner much superior to that jn which the finances of the other States have been managed.
