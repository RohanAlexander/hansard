( FINANC E) BILL . h i Committee (Consideration resumed from 12th October, vide page 4400): Clause 2The Constitution is altered by inserting, after section eighty-seven thereof, the following section :"" 87A -(1. ) Notwithstanding anything in section eighty-seven of this Constitution, the Commonwealth may, in the year beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and nine, out of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of Customs and of Excise, apply towards its expenditure for the service, of that year any sum not exceeding Six hundred thousand pounds over and above one-fourth of the said net revenue. ""(2.) From and after the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and ten, section eighty-seven of this Constitution shall cease to have effect."" understood the Prime Minister to state some days ago that he proposed in Committee to reply to the criticism to which the Bill had been, subjected during the debate on the motion for leave to introduce it, and on the motion for the second reading. I desire to know whether he proposes now to make a statement as to the position of the Government, and as to whether, in his opinion, their proposals have been successf u l l y attacked. ter) [2.41] I recall a remark I made to the effect that the specific questions raised could probably be best dealt with in Committee, ancl that I should avail myself there of an opportunity to make a rejoinder so far as was necessary to any criticism that has. been or may be offered. No objection, however, so far as I recollect, was taken to the clause now under consideration. It simply authorizes the Commonwealth to retain £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 more than it could otherwise do, and repeals the Braddon section six months in advance. answer should be made to criticisms relating to other parts of the measure. [2.42] -This clause may well occupy the attention of the Committee for a few moments. The Government require a certain sum of money, and the States immediately concerned have raised no objection to the retention of a sum of [188] ,£600,000 to provide for the cost of services which would otherwise have to be borne by the States. The Government I shall policy has caused the expenditure of the Commonwealth to exceed the one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue, which we are entitled to retain. There are two avenues to a settlement of the financial question on more equitable and just lines than is proposed in the Melbourne agreement. The first of these is that the States might pass legislation indemnifying the Commonwealth in respect of the extra amount required for Commonwealth purposes, and also in respect of the sum of £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 for which this clause provides. If that were done, it would be unnecessary to amend the Constitution. The States would permit the retention of the additional money that is required by the Commonwealth, and which is equal to ios. od. per head of the population. In this way we should secure a continuation of the Braddon clause, as first approved by a majority of the people of Australia, subject to its present limitations. It will be remembered that subsequently, at the suggestion of the Premieof New South Wales, the Premiers of the States met in conference, and agreed to a variation of the Braddon clause, as passed at the Convention, providing that it should remain in operation for only ten years. The end of that ten years' term is within sight, and it has been found that the Braddon section, instead of being a "" blot "" on the Constitution, secures to the State? the revenue which is indispensable to some of them. Under my suggestion, that section would continue in operation, together with the agreement, until the people were called upon to sanction an alteration of the Constitution. I come now to the second avenue open to us. The Government propose to retain this sum of £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 at the beginning of next year to liquidate the deficit that has occurred in connection with the payment of old-age pensions, but I contemplate a further step s The Government have said that they require an additional sum, amounting in the It is not one on which an aggregate to £ 2 , 3 7 3 , 1 0 0 , to cover their expenditure, and that amount could be secured by inserting in clause 2 a pro(Robertson) vision for the retention for a period cf ten years of a further sum of ios. 9d. per head of the population. Subject to this amendment this Bill might well be passed. No State would suffer under my proposition.

42,Mr Henrywillis,"fact that we have taken over certain services that were formerly provided for by the States, and which are better managed by the Commonwealth than they could now be managed by the State. No harm would then accrue to any one, and the finances would be adjusted for a further period of, say, ten years. It is contended that the States are afraid of the Commonwealth ; but there is no need for them to be afraid, seeing that both State and Commonwealth Parliaments are returned by the same people. Men who have managed the affairs of the States come into the Commonwealth Parliament, and take leading positions here. They are taking a prominent part in legislation, and now have a broad view in contradistinction to the narrow parochial view they formerly took. The environment of the National Parliament has made them regard affairs from a different tralia, were deducted, as I propose, stand-point, and rendered them patriotic and more useful. Formerly, they represented small communities, but now they feel that they represent the whole of the Commonwealth. We are the same people -one people, and inseparable-and the representation is as safe in the hands of this Parliament as in the hands of the State Parliaments. An argument used in favour of an alteration in the Constitution is that the bookkeeping period would cease, and much annoyance, trouble, and expense be saved. The bookkeeping data was not availed of to any very great extent in arriving at the decision at the Premiers' Conference, and the data that is now being collected might continue to be collected, ancl at the end of a further period of ten years might be more used than on the present occasion. At the Premiers' Conference it was resolved in a haphazard way that the Commonwealth should pay to the States 25s. per head of the population. no sound basis for thatdecision. I had an interview the other day with Senator Pulsford, who has looked into the financial question very thoroughly, and the whole burden of his argument, set forth in his letter to the Sydney Daily Telegraph, shows that the States will not lose. That is what we all say-that the States cannot possibly lose by what is done in the Commonwealth Parliament, seeing that we represent the States, and will see that justice is done. There is nothing in the contention of Senator Pulsford to show that any injustice will be done; and he has proved, what I have proved, that one at least of the States will suffer very Mr Henry Willis. materially in consequence of the haphazard decision to which I have referred, and that is the State of New South Wales. The Melbourne agreement having been arrived at without any fixed data on which a calculation can be made, has, at least, one objectionable feature; and it is a very far-reaching defect, inasmuch as it is undoubtedly inequitable. This fact in itself is sufficient to justify a review of the situation. When the calculations were madesuch as were made-it was shown that the Commonwealth would return to the States under the three-fourths distribution, as follows :-Ne w South Wales, £ 2 os. 4c!.; Victoria, £ 1 12s.; Queensland, £ 1 16s. 6d.; South Australia, £ 1 ns. 6d.; Western Australia, £ 2 5s. p-d.; and Tasmania, £ 1 4s. iod. If the 10s. od., which would be the per capita throughout Austhe payments would be:-To New South Wales, ,£1 9s. 7d.; Victoria, .£1 IS. 3d.; Queensland, £ 1 5s. 9d.; South Australia, £ 1 os. 9d.; Western Australia, £ 1 15s. ; and Tasmania, 14s. i d . It will be noticed that Western Australia loses ios. per head-that is, she is getting 10s. less than her equitable share of the distribution-and the Premier and other representatives of that State stated that, in consideration of the loss, they would require .£3,250,000, which they regarded as the equivalent. New South. Wales is losing 4s. 7d. per head, but no consideration whatever is given to that State in consequence. Queensland comes very close to the quota of 25s. inasmuch as the payment to her is £ 1 5s. 9d. ; that State will lose but 9d. per head under the proposed arrangement. We can understand that the Premier of Queensland, having virtually nothing to lose, is quite agreeable to the adoption of the There was agreement, and that Western Australia, having her loss made up by the payment of a lump sum, is also satisfied. Considering that New South -Wales contains more than one-third of the population of Australia, her loss will make up for the gain by Victoria. In the case of Victoria, the gain is the difference between is. 3d. and 5s., that is to say, 3s. 9d. per capita; in the case of South Australia, it is 4s. 3d.; and in Queensland, it is the difference between £ 1 5s. 9d. and 25s. Honourable members can work out the figures for themselves. Four States stood to gain, and have gained, at the expense of New South Wales. Whea Federation was established, it was said that the bookkeeping system would give to each State what it was justly entitled to; but New South Wales made a greater loss than any other State when one-third of her revenue was taken from her. That was the price that New South Wales paid for Federation ; but it was before she had made such a loss, and before there was a possibility of a greater loss owing to a high Tariff, that the Premier of the State, at the clamour of the people for a review of the Braddon section, insisted on a Conference, so that at the end of ten years any injustice might be righted. But now we have a proposal to perpetuate the injustice, inasmuch as the State of New South Wales, instead of getting all she is entitled to, is to have another slice of her revenue taken from her. done New South Wales any good? has also done a great amount of good to Victoria. In proportion to population, the gain by Victoria is quite as much as that by New South Wales, and, therefore, I ask why the latter State should be called upon, as she practically is, to pay the Victorian old-age pensions? South Australia is another State that, in proportion to population, has gained quite as much as New South Wales or Victoria. /Why should South Australia benefit as she has done, to the extent of 4s. 3d. per head of population, at the expense of New South Wales? The honourable member for Indi has touched the only point that can be urged on behalf of the States that are seeking to benefit; but as to the making of concessions, both Victoria and South Australia should bear their share if any State is unfinancial. It is claimed that New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia have benefited very largely at the expense of Tasmania; but seeing the smallness of that State, the gain is infinitesimal. Tasmania stands to gain the difference between 14s. i d . and 25s., but it was always known in the beginning of Federation that if a State were impecunious, it might be relieved. That situation, however, does not arise, because Tasmania is far from being impecunious. Tf Tasmania says she must have relief, relief will be given her, but she puts in no such claim. She seeks only for fair play. Let it be said on behalf of Tasmania, that from the very beginning she said she would always refuse to ask any State of the Union to give up to her anything to which [188]2 she was not entitled. It was that spirit that brought about Federation, and the people of Tasmania to-day, if they were consulted, would not sanction any proposal by which their State would take from any other State what she was not entitled to. The special allowance proposed for Western Australia, to be paid at the rate of £250,000 a year, amounts, when capitalized, to a lump sum of £3,250,000. New South Wales, again, must be the source from which that money will be derived. The amendment which. I propose, therefore isThat after the word "" pounds,"" line 12, the following words be inserted :"" and a further sum of ten shillings and' ninepence per head of population shall be retained during a period of ten years from the thirtieth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and ten."" I do not expect any antagonism to this proposal from the Prime Minister. It really settles the financial policy of the Government. It gives the Government twelve pence for every shilling which they would get under their agreement, and the States can take no exception to it, because every State will get under it four farthings for every penny they would receive under their own proposal. But what I ask for is a fair and honourable"" adjustment, and a re-arrangement of the agreement, by which the State of New South Wales shall be satisfied and have justice done to her. This is the place where I should speak, if I speak at all. I hope my speaking is not censurable, for if I do not speak now, I should for ever hold my tongue. The Government, therefore, can have no quarrel with me for moving this amendment, and, if they make a quarrel of it, it will be a quarrel of their own seeking. Honourable members should remember, however, that the fate of no Government depends upon the carrying of this measure. Even if we throw the Bill out, we shall, by leaving things as they are, and taking an indemnity from the States by way of legislation, accomplish all that the Government propose to do in the adjustment of the finances. Tf the Commonwealth fails to do justice to the States, they can repeal their legislation at once, but if they withdraw it without reason the Commonwealth can at once terminate fhe Braddon section :».nd secure its finances. .The whole matter depends on mutual trust. For my part, I would sooner see the Bill withdrawn. Air. TILLEY BROWN -We must have some settlement.",17,Constitution Alteration
43,Mr Tilley Brown,Has Federation,19,Constitution Alteration
44,Mr Henry Willis,"Yes; and itdisputed. myself clear to the honourable member, but that is my loss. I think it will be clear in Hansard that no alteration of the Constitution is at all necessary, ancl that ample safeguards would exist if this Bill were defeated. This Parliament expressesthe voice of the people of every State of Australia. If the voice of the people is expressed here rather than in six different places, let us accept that voice, and let it be decisive. If , however, a majority of the House says that this Bil l must be taken to a division, then my"" amendment would be a just solution of the situation.

The States also would collectively receive the same sum in surplus revenue, but more equitably distributed. I appeal to the right honourable member to support me, seeing that it was he who suggested the holding of a Conference of Premiers nine years ago, because he regarded the Braddon clanse as unjust to New South Wales. the Conference. several other reasons, one of which was the Federal Capital site question. right honourable member wanted the Braddon clause to be altered, because as it left the Convention it was to be permanent. He wished it to be reviewed in ten years' timea most excellent arrangement. But did. the right honourable member himself ever think that when it was reviewed at the end of a decade, New South Wales would be called upon to pay old age pensions for Victoria? It was the very opposite reason that caused public opinion in New South Wales to insist upon a review of the Braddon clause, as proposed in the Constitution B ill , and the right honourable member very ably and effectively caused it to be altered. The burden of my argument is that the present proposalT h a t is not of the Government is not just to New SouthI fear that I have not made Wales. While there will be given, under my proposal, to the Commonwealth every protection that the Government ask for in their scheme-becaus e the King's Government must be carried on-and the Commonwealth will have no cause to complain, every State will also receive to the fraction the sum that is offered under the Premiers' agreement, and, therefore, the States will have really no cause for complaint. My point is the inequitable distribution of. the surplus revenue under the Government scheme. I put in a claim for equity, and for justice to be done to New South Wales, and this proposal of mine will do it. t e r ) [3-9]--No one can take exception to the action of the honourable member for The effect Robertson who holds a strong view upon the method of settlement he has himself evolved, for placing it once more before the Committee in a clear fashion; but the fact stares one in the face that, while the honourable member proposes this amendment in It will come the interests of the States, no State has accepted it, or recommended it for consideration. When the honourable member says that we should take an indemnity from the six States, instead of proceeding to legislate ourselves to replace the Braddonsection, by payments to be made to the States, surely he remembers that his proposed indemnity can only be granted by the free consent of each State,, and that no State has shown the slightest disposition to take such a step. The honourable member makes his appeal on behalf of the State of which he is a citizen and representative. So far as concerns the disposition of the sum intended to be allotted by the Commonwealth, the allotment as between the States has been made by the The direct representatives of the States, their Premiers and Treasurers, presumably authorized to speak on this subject for their Legislatures, and for a very large proportion, if not for the whole, of their citizens. The honourable member considers that New South Wales will suffer under the proposed arrangement, and I understand that the Premier of the State, in putting the case for the agreement before its Legislative Assembly, laid stress upon what he termed the sacrifices to be made.

Consequently, whatever the merits of this proposal, it is not practical. cure its adoption, the honourable member would have to satisfy the Committee, not only that the proposal of the Government should be rejected, but also that his scheme should be accepted. well he may be satisfied with what he has termed an actuarial method of distribution, as a practical proposal the amendment is not one which we should be asked to examine since, under existing circumstances, this could not yield a profitable result. The honourable member considers his scheme more generous to some of the States-because under it some of them would benefit more than others-tha n is the arrangement provided for in the Bill. He also urges that his proposal is more advantageous to the Commonwealth than that of the Government. According to the stand-point from which our future is regarded, it may Or may not be to the advantage of the Commonwealth that the Braddon provision should be extended for ten years, subject to the payments to which he refers. In his opinion the extension would benefit -the Commonwealth as well as the States; but I do not think that he has obtained support for that view from members of this Parliament or any others who are considering the matter from the Commonwealth stand-point. While it is in evenway to the honourable member's credit that he has made an independent investigation, the character and reception of his proposal are such that it does not appear that we should gain anything by debating it at length. The honourable member has made his statement fairly. I think the Committee understands that the acceptance of the proposal would imply the passing of six Acts of Indemnity by the State Parliaments, an extension of the Braddon provision, subject to a -per. capita payment of ios. pd. for ten years, and a distribution of Customs receipts which would vary in each State, instead of being the same in all, as provided in the Bill. proposes that the States should be taxed equally, and that the distribution should be It shows that the in proportion to the amounts contributed to the revenue. the present system of dealing with the States as separate entities. Practically he asks for the continuation of the present system. The proposal of the Bill is to substitute perfect equality, abolishing State boundaries, and treating the finances of To sethe Commonwealth from an Australian stand-point wholly and solely. It is this scheme which I hope will commend itself to a majority of honourable members. However .The criticism of the Prime Minister of the proposal of the honourable member for Robertson is fair. The mind of the latter always deals in a practical fashion with financial questions, and in this instance he has paid particular attention to the fact that the State from which he comas will not be as well off under the proposal of the Government as some of the other States. He, therefore, proposes to continue the Braddon section for ten year -., asking an equal contribution from each State to provide the money necessary for new services. the bookkeeping system, too. everything consequent upon the present arrangement.

I regret that I cannot support his amendment, because, if it could be dealt with from a general point of view, and the whole question could be reopened, -something might be said for it. We know, however, that there is a much larger issue involved in this Bill, ancl that is as to whether or not this Parliament is to continue to exercise the powers that were delegated to it by the State Parliaments in the first instance in passing Bills accepting the Constitution, and by the action of the people themselves in giving to this Parliament power after 1910 to deal with its own revenue in its own way.

Prime Minister has said that he does not think this is the proper time to reply to the criticism on the Premiers' agreement, as he does not remember any particular criticism being directed to this clause. seems to me, however, that .this clause is the essence of the whole agreement. has been described by the honourable member for Flinders as an "" E s a u "" clauseas representing the miserable mess of pottage for which the future of the Commonwealth is to be sold-and , therefore, I think that any reply ought to be made now. If the clause be passed, how is the Committee, having proposed to take from the States ,£600,000, to which they are entitled, going to refuse to give the States that which they make the price of the surrender of, the ,£600,000 ? Those who are opposed to the agreement, must vote for the excision of this clause, which, to my mind, is the most humiliating ever submitted to a national Parliament. originally that for ten years the States should be given three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue. The Commonwealth is now short of funds, but instead of waiting until the ten years have expired before we alter the original agreement, the Ministry, not having the courage of their opinions, or the pluck to face the difficulties of the financial situation, are going down on their hands and knees to the States, ancl offering to sell the whole future of the Commonwealth for the miserable mess of pottage of £600,000. It is a wretched proposal from beginning to end. marvellous how men who pose as Liberals and Nationalists, and who have taken up the position that the Treasurer and others have dn previous Conferences, could, in this instance, go on their hands and knees to the Premiers, in secret conference, and ask them to provide the funds to meet the exigencies of the next, twelve months. knees ""-tal k sense ! sentatives at the Conference did go down on their hands and knees, and that is why they shut the door-so that the public -could not see them. isters changed their opinions as soon as they got into the Conference. ions, and we have never yet been told the suggest that this clause be postponed until reasons why. In the case of all previousConferences, we knew the arguments on both sides, but now we can only conclude that the Ministers representing the Commonwealth did go down on their hands and knees, and surrender the national birth right for a paltry ,£600,000. All we It are told is that the arguments used forced the Prime Minister to the situation he has It since taken up, but we have not been told what those arguments were. Even now, it would be interesting to know them, but it would have been infinitely more interesting if the whole of the discussions had been reported. Take, for instance, the argument used by the Prime Minister just now, in reference to the proposal of the honourable member for Robertson, that no one State had accepted this proposal or recommended it for acceptance. But how do we know what the States recommended for acceptance? Does any one imagine that the agreement was arrived at without numbers of proposals being put forward? When the honourable member The Constitution provided for Wimmera interjected about the £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 , the honourable member for Flinders, with that feeling of national spirit which we all ought to have, said,"" I do not wish this Commonwealth to have the name of ' Esau' attached to any of its agreements."" We ought to be prepared to say straight out that we will have none of this begging of money from the States. We are told that the States require all the money they have for them-, selves, and yet, without giving them any, notice, we propose at once to ask them to. find money which we could find for our-, It is selves if the Government had the pluck, and spirit to introduce the necessary measures.

I wish to state in as few words as possible the reason why I and others have taken this course. I intend to leave to a large extent on one side at present the financial question, which we discussed fully on a preliminary stage of the Bill. The proposal of the Government is a most important matter financially, because if the agreement is carried out it will involve the committal of this Parliament to the payment to the States for all time, or until the Constitution is again altered, of 25s. per capita of the population without any control over it to meet changed circumstances, or to provide for requirements which may arise in the future.

The proposal contained in this Bil l involves our going backupon that, and reinserting in the 'Constitution a provision which will bind us to pay 25s. per capita until such time as the Constitution is again altered in that regard. It seems to' me that this House will be wanting in its duty to the Commonwealth and to ihe electors of this country if it accedes to such a proposal. I feel that in this matter we are entitled to speak our minds, and I am pleased, therefore, that a form of amendment has been adopted which places us, with the consent of the Government, in such a position that each honourable member, wherever he sits, may say what he thinks and vote for what he believes to be right. Mr WF.BSTER -I s it not always so? because anv partu obligation is set at once on one side. We ought to look on this matter in a calm and dispassionate way. If u l lv admit that the Premiers must watch over the rights of their States. Tn consenting to an agreement insuring the payment to the States of 25s. per capita, they were clearly within the line of their duty. But in asking this Parliament to provide for the amendment of the Constitution by the insertion of a provision which will continue to have effect until withdrawn by another vote of the people, they clearly went bevnnd their province. Minister told iis in his onening sDeech that the influence which would amend the Constitution would be eauallv effective in bringing about a second amendment if necessary; but, in mv oninion. it is inconceivable that an arrangement which confers pecuniarv advantages on some of the States would ever be altered with their consent. I have the utmost respect for the opinions of the people, but looking at this as a purely business arrangement affecting State interests, and remembering that the Constitution cannot be altered unless the consent of an absolute majority of both Houses of the Parliament, and subsequently of a majority of the people voting as a whole, and of a majority of the States, is obtained, I say that to ask States deriving a. direct and positive advantage from' the agreement to consent to its alteration would be to ask them to do more than they could be expected to do. Mr W. H . IRVINE -The three smallest. States could always prevent a second amendment of the Constitution. maining three would not constitute a majority. One has only to consider the matter for a moment to be convinced of the unlikelihood of getting three of the States to agree to a second altera. tion of the Constitution, notwithstanding that the great majority of the people of the Commonwealth might be of opinion that it should be made. As a member of this Parliament and a Federalist, I regard the stipulation that the arrangement should be inserted in the Constitution as a direct reflection on the good faith of future Parliaments. If those elected by the people of Australia are not to be trusted to act in the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole, God help the Federation ! By agreeing to the insertion in the Constitution of an arrangement which we shall be powerless to alter subsequently, we shall be involving f uture""""Par1 laments in difficulties which we cannot measure. Why should we make their posi-= tion inferior to ours? Why should we say that they are not to be trusted to deal' fairly with the interests of the States and. of the Commonwealth? If they will beunfitted to do so, there is a poor look-out for the Federation. I do not object to theagreement as drafted, although I do not think that it provides the best settlement of the question. My view has always beenthat the Commonwealth, when the time The Prime came, should take steps to settle all the financial questions once and for all, leavingthis Parliament in the position which it is intended by the Constitution to occupy. The obligation of the States would then be fairlv met and protected, while we should' be free from entanglements in our electoral' OT financial arrangements.

I wish to make it evident to the Premiers and to the country that there is a majority of honourable members who, while ready to sanction the agreement, wish to limit its duration, so that a subsequent Parliament may review the position in the same way that we are now able to do. Should my amendment be carried my idea is that the arrangement shall continue until the payments to the States aggregate £7,5 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum-whic h is somewhat in excess of the interest payable on the money borrowed by the States up to the time of Federation-and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides. an equitable proposal.

Though this responsibility was assumed since, we have now something more than the duty of endeavouring to induce the Committee to adopt the view that commends itself to us. If we f a i l to agree new situations may be created, which will have to be met with a f u l l sense of the Ministerial responsibility then attaching to us. At present, we desire, if it can be obtained, a practical expression of the judgment of honourable members on a proposal which, reckoning its indirect influences, is probably the gravest this Parliament has yet met. I pass now to the brief reference made by the honourable member for Mernda to our unknown financial obligations in the near future of the Commonwealth. He did not develop that aspect of the question into which he entered fully in his original speech on this B ill , being content to briefly summarize and dismiss the very serious and complicated set of questions that arises when we attempt to peer into the future. In explaining the agreement in the first instance, I endeavoured, in several parts of my argument, to make it clear that the only judgment we can be expected to apply to the determination of such problems, is that which we should employ as business men. if we were risking our joint fortunes in some great commercial or industrial undertaking. We should necessarily exercise all the prudence we possess in examining all the factors. Then, as men who enter into these great undertakings do every day in this citv. we should rely upon common sense and judgment, as fallible human beings must. No one can speak with absolute positiveness of th°. complex events before us. relations, over which we have no control, may gravely alter the whole current of our national fortunes. markets of the world respond to influences operating on them from every portion of the globe; and these might have a serious effect on our revenues. that the conditions of this agreement are elastic, and more elastic than many of those offered as substitutes. Having regard to the necessary and natural limitations of human judgment we must make our choice. ThoughI attach weight to the opinions of many of my honourable friends who take a contrary view, having re-read their speeches and re-examined the figures-I see no reason to qualify my expectations. So far as the ordinary current of human affairs permits forecasts, we are justified in believing that the payment of 25s. per head to the States will involve no burden that this Commonwealfe ought not to be well able to carry for at least the next twenty years. Beyond that, one need' not look. It is said-and this is the gravamen of my honourable friend's whole argument-that there should be some fixed term, determined either by the amount of payment made on the per capita arrangement-whic h he, in a general way, fixes at £ 7 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £8,000,000-or , as it has also been suggested, by the numbers of our population, or a fixed period of years. Each of these methods of determination has something in its favour. Let me quote one of the State Premiers on the duration of the proposed agreement. Mr Kidston is reported in the Brisbane Courier of the 22nd inst. to have saidIt has been argued that there should not be a fixed agreement because it is not known how it might suit twenty or thirty years hence. Instead, these objectors would have a fixed agreement for twenty or thirty years. Now, if they make a fixed agreement for that length of time, no matter how badly it suits, it will be unalterable until the end of the term. But instead, if they simply embody the agreement in the Constitution, and find in ten years or more that it does not suit the circumstances of the day then the men of that time will just have the same power to alter it that we have to-day. It is not binding matters in the future in any way; it is leaving the people of the future at perfect liberty. This gives a manifest advantage to the adoption of the agreement as it standi and the embodying of it in the Constitution. No man can say with certainty that any agreement made to-day will suit the circumstances of Australia ten, twenty, or thirty years hence. Buti f you make an agreement for twenty years it will be out of the power of the Federal Parliament, with all the people of Australia behind International it, to alter it until the end of the term. As I pointed out in anticipation, when previously addressing honourable members, that Again, the financial statement as to the inalterability of a fixed term is not legally sound. That is to say, if we made an agreement nominally fo i Still, we claim one hundred years, and the peop'e were satisfied that it ought to be alteredin five years, they would have the power to al.er it. Mr Kidston overlooks that. What he means is clearly that, when there is a fixed term, there is a moral obligation or a political obligation-it is a mixture of both. By fixing on a term, we indicate the period for which we expect the agreement -will, run; that element must not be ignored, because there is such an implication. Butno implication' of the kind is absolutely binding on a self-governing people. Thev remain masters of their own affairs. Large numbers-quit e sufficient perhaps to make a minority into a majority on that ground alone-woul d consider that a fixed term meant an obligation for that period, not to be departed from except in face of a national calamity such as war. But this agreement is placed in the Constitution simply and solely subject to the conditions on which the Constitution is alterable; it may be altered at the very next general election after the one at which it is adopted. Certainly its binding force will tend to disappear as times change and with every succeeding general election. Still this is the highest security which is in the power of this Parliament, providing its project receives the approval of a majority of the electors collectively and in a majority of the States. The question-now is, whether by the proposed limitations we are really securing any substantial gain or extra freedom for future Parliaments. Even taking into account fhe fact that any term indicated has an implied obligation against its alteration, except in case of some utterly unforeseen national calamity, we are trusting wholly to our present prevision. The question to those of us who take this position assumes .a different aspect from that which the honourable member for Mernda submitted this afternoon. If I recollect the tables correctly, his proposal means that £7,500,000 , taking our present increase of population, would become payable by the Commonwealth some sixteen years hence. years. years as the mean. It is probable, and I hope it will prove actual, that the population will increase at a faster rate; and, in that case, the proposal might apply for only twelve years. to say, therefore, that this proposal, put into its equivalent in time-and I am far from denying its advantages over the mere time proposal, because it does adjust itself to circumstances-mean s twelve or fifteen years. period, except by convincing a majority of our electors and a majority of States. Honourable members, of course, realize that to f u l l y argue this question would occupy too long; and there are other matters to which I must refer. rather surprised, however, that it should have escaped, not only the honourable member who spoke to-day, but all our critics who dwell upon the insuperable difficulties of convincing our electors in sufficient numbers of the need for constitutional amendments. Why we ourselves have been living witnesses of a f a r greater transformation of public opinion in Australia, in a Federal direction, than any referendum for an alteration of the Constitution ever can require. We, who took part in the Federal campaign from, its inception in 1890, know only too well to what a handful of people in two or three States the proposal then appealed. As we went on year by year, it seemed as if the additions to our ranks were too inconsiderable to be worthy of note; and what was the task? We had to conquer the electorates in every single State in Australia; we required to capture every Legislature and every Legislative Chamber in every State before we attained the goal. Federation was ultimately adopted by a special referendum in every State. On the present occasion honourable members are dwelling, reasonably enough, on the difficulty of getting four States out of six to agree; but for Federation we had to capture the whole six through Legislatures whose powers were being curtailed, whose authority was being diminished, and whose revenues were being transferred. We had, therefore, every obstacle that could possibly weigh against a future amendment of our Constitution in the strongest four Legislatures, not elected for Federal ends, but on local party platforms, with Ministries that saw their dominance displaced; to sixteen and };et in ten years every single State was brought into line. great ideal. which the appeal was made at that time. now to the pockets. and now it is pounds shillings and pence. we never shall have a campaign turning Our proposal reaches no . fixed merely on pounds shillings and pence; there will be what an honourable member is pleased to call sentimental considerations associated with the purposes for which the pounds shillings and pence are to be employed.

Prime Minister, in elaborating this question, showed that the Government had the support of all the State Ministries. But what does that amount to? The State Governments were naturally looking for the best agreement possible in the circumstances; but did our representatives make the best agreement they could for the Commonwealth? I hold that they did not. The Prime Minister, in his own words, entered the Conference opposed to the making of a permanent agreement to be embodied in the Constitution. "" without having arrived at a conclusion as to the terms to be fixed. I am free to confess the fact."" Those are the words I used. orable gentleman's correspondence with the Premier of New South Wales, wherein he stated more than once that his Government thought that nothing more than a temporary arrangement was necessary. The Prime Minister now says that he agreed with some reluctance to an arrangement providing for an alteration of the Constitution. He also states that the agreement made with the Premiers might be of no longer duration than it would be if. amended as proposed by the honourable member for Mernda. If that is so, why does he object to the amendQueensland voted solidly in the same numment? To say that what purports to be a permanent agreement made with the State Premiers may be altered within ten years is to go as near a political violation of pledges 973,113 persons voting for that alteration, and obligations as possible. ston, Premier of Queensland, said. gentleman explained it away. man said that the proposal made by the honourable member for Mernda meant an agreement for ten, -fifteen,or twenty years, and went on to argue that the permanency of the agreement made with the Premiers of the States could be varied at any time if the people so desired -Does he seriously believe that if the agreement as it stands is embodied in the Constitution, it will be altered embody this agreement in the Constitution. within the next ten or twenty years? quire it. most decidedly it will. would an alteration be made? The Prime Minister enumerated one or two, such as war, or fear of foreign aggression, or stress of any kind. What does that mean? It means that at a time of Undoubtedly the disaster-a t a time when the States would most need the money that they were entitled to receive under this agreement-the Commonwealth would propose to take it from them. The States might be impoverished at. the very time that it was proposed to take from them that which they were entitled to receive under what is assumed to be a permanent agreement. Surely the Prime Minister does not want us to accept that proposition. Then he tells us, in his own inimitable style, that it is open to the people to insert this agreement in the Constitution, as proposed by him, and later on to omit it. It is true that the Constitution provides that a"" proposed amendment of the Constitution must be approved by a majority of the people and a majority of the States. It is equally true that, with the co-operation of the State Governments for the time being, the proposed amendment of the Constitution may be carried. But it is not true to say that a majority of the electors of the Commonwealth can afterwards alter that. At the last general election the voting was as follows :-Ne w South Wales, 381,336; Victoria, 381,185 ; Queensland, 124,539; South Australia, 70,517; Western Australia, 52,712; and Tasmania, 48,879.

In other words, the desire of nearly 1,000,000 people in the six States for an alteration of the Constitution could be defeated by the votes of 86,000 persons in the three smaller States. While the population of the States remains in the same proportion as at present, that will be the position as long as fhe Commonwealthexists. it can be argued that the people will not The Government have entered into a compact with all the State Governments which, as the Prime Minister has said, is partly political and partly financial.

I thoroughly agree with that. The honourable gentleman also said that if this agreement is embodied in the Constitution it can be taken out again. No one knows better than does the Prime Minister that when he says so he is simply trying to mislead the electors.

Minister is prepared to sacrifice the best inshould not return a single sixpence of the terests of the Commonwealth for a party advantage extending over three paltry years.

He said that the State of South Australia would have to Its effect must develop the Northern Territory if we did nothing with it as a Commonwealth, and the State Government will require money for the purpose. If the States intend to develop any part of their territories they must find the necessary funds for the purpose. Who can say what the obligations of the Commonwealth will be in the near future? Who could have said three, let alone five, years ago that they would have grown to their present magnitude? Who can say what they will be in another five years ? Even though we might be able to do so this year, who will say that we are in a position to tell the State Governments that we can continue to hand over to them every year 25s. per head of the population of the States?

Other honourable members opposite will go to any length rather than vote for a land tax. choose which alternative they will follow. They must either go to the London market and borrow, or they must leave great Commonwealth undertakings untouched; or they must tax the poor. The Prime Minister has referred to Western Australia, but it is a remarkable thing that he makes no reference to those States in which the Labour party is completely in accord with the opposition in this Parliament in regard to the agreement made with the Premiers. glad to say that the Labour party in South Australia,and in Victoria, have no sympathy with the action of part of the State Labour party in New South Wales.

The Prime Minister said this was not a party question, but the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out that, according to the Prime Minister's own statement, the Government propose, in the event of the agreement being defeated, to take it to the country. It is, therefore, perfectly clear that any honourable member who is not prepared to accept the Government programme will not be put on the Government ticket. In the face of that, it is absurd to say that every honourable member has a free hand. the attitude taken up by the Age and the Argus, which represent in this city the two opinions on the question, that opposition of no ordinary character or virulence will be offered to any man who does not favour the particular view put forward by those respective journals. The honourable member for Mernda has claimed the right to have a free hand on the question, and has tabled an amendment to test the feeling of the Committee. That right has been accorded to him by the Prime Minister in words, but if his amendment is carried, and the Government take the question to the country, as they say they will do, what will the honourable member's position be? Can he, in honour, stand upon the Government ticket, or, if he is prepared to do sOj. cient time, but that the Committee should can the Government accept him?

They are saying nothing, ami waiting to see what turns up. Last night the honourable member for Batman asked us to trust the people, but now that. we desire to obtain their views in regard to a matter which is infinitely more Federal Capital shall be at Dalgety or Canberra, he is as silent as the grave. So, too, are others who yesterday were furiously of his opinion. The reason is that, while their desire to serve the Democracy is great, their desire to retain their seats is greater. We, on this side, are not afraid to trust the people, and it is not our fault that this and several other questions were not settled by the constituencies four months ago. We wished to go before the electors, and were not allowed to do so. Under the It is perfectly clear, in view of proposed agreement the people will be deprived of their right to deal with this question. Democracy means the rule of the majority ; but if the agreement be embodied in the Constitution the majority will no longer be able to enforce its will in financial matters. That is why we oppose the proposal. We declare that the right of people to govern is inalienable; that it is not intermittent, but persists continuously. The people have the right to repeal tomorrow the law which they make to-day. It is to be assumed that the Prime Minister has made the best defence that can be made for this proposal. He declared that a better arrangement could have been come to if there had been suffiaccept the proposal of the Government.

The chief reason why many electors in New South Wales opposed the acceptance of the Constitution was that under it a Chamber would be created in which the people would not be represented according to numbers, but in which the States would have equal representation. The argument adduced in favour of the adoption of that undemocratic provision was that it was necessary for the protection of State Rights. That Chamber exists to-day, and it exists primarily to safeguard State Rights, it is in no respect a Chamber analogous to the House of Lords, or to those amusing parodies upon it which are to be found in AustraliaI refer to the Legislative Councils of the States. The latter are admittedly Chambers whose purpose it is to revise, deas a drunken man finds his way home. lay, and obstruct legislation, whereas the function of the Senate is primarily, if not many things for which ,he is sorry, but wholly, to safeguard the interests of the States. That being so, I contend that both States and people are represented in the fullest and most effective way in this Partook place the previous evening. The hon-, liament. In the House of Representatives they are represented upon the basis of one adult one vote, and one vote one value, whilst in the Senate, Tasmania, with a population of 180,000, enjoys equal representation with New South Wales, which possesses a population of 1,600,000. Why was the principle of equal representation of the States in the Senate adopted? To protect State Rights. Yet, in the face of this, an attempt is being made to foist upon this Parliament an agreement which has been arrived at between the self-constituted representatives of the States for this particular purpose. The State Premiers were never authorized by the people to represent them upon this question. They had no mandate upon it. As has been pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Hindmarsh, the position occupied by many of them is humiliating in the extreme, and almost very slender majorities.

They propose to hamper and cripple the National Parliament in everything that it does or attempts to do. that we ought not to consider an agreement between the State Premiers and the Commonwealth Government in respect of an adjustment of the financial relations between the States and the for the simple reason that there exists a Chamber clothed with ample power, and created only to preserve the interests of the States as such against those of the people as such. Are we to assume that the Senate has fallen so low as to be unable to exercise those functions for which it was called into existence? The Prime Minister spoke of the necessity of embodying this agreement in the Constitution, saying that it could be done only by the ,approval of a majority of the people. that amount to a misstatement While it.is true that we cannot amend the Constitution without the approval of a majority of the people, it is equally true that once it is amended a majority of the people may vote a hundred times over to remove that amendment, but without effect. The people have a right to go wherever they like, but they have no right to retrace their steps. ciples of Democracy that the people have a right to do whatsoever they please. been pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition, and the honourable member for Hindmarsh, that it would be poss ble for 1,000.000 voters in the States to endeavour to repeal the -Constitution in some particular, and for 86,000 voters, or a bare majoritv, in the three smaller States to orevent effect being given to their will. I do not propose to dwell upon that fact; the figures speak for themselves. A statement has been made as to the of Constitution, to the States an assurance that would not possess if it were passed in an ordinary Statute. we have no right to try to make anything more permanent than the people Directly the people are unable to do what Mr Hughes. they desire, the Constitution,, that prevents them doing it, ceases to be DemoIn cratic. Therefore, when we speak of a thing being permanent in a .Democratic community, we mean,that it is permanent -because the people approve it . When the people cease to approve it, it may be permanent, but it is no longer Democratic. Let us consider whether there is anything in My point is fhe argument that the States would have a better, assurance if this agreement were embodied in the Constitution than they would if it were embodied in a Statute. Literally, millions of pounds sterling of capital are Commonwealth, invested to-day in protected industii«s in Australia upon no other 'assurance than that which this Parliament from time to time can give by StatuteI t would be possible for this Parliament, within twenty-four hours, to repeal every duty in the Tariff Act, and so to bring thousands of men in manufacturing industries to the verge of ruin. It would be possible, yet does any I do not believe it. one believe that it would be done? Is not the assurance which the manufacturer possesses based upon that general approval th,at the people in this country give to the policy of Protection? Whether it be right That is one of those half truths or wrong., .so long as the people approve it , of fact. the position of the manufacturer is assured. Does any State need a better assurance in this regard than any citizen has? The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out that sugar-growers have invested much money in the industry under cover of a Statute for promoting the production of sugar by white labour. They have no assurance from day to day other than that given It is one of the basic prinby the approval of this Parliament, and the tacit understanding that the Statute in quesIt has tion shall not be repealed for a certain time. Again, take, if honourable members please, the White Australia policy. What as; surance have the people, with whom we have.made a bargain of the most solemn kind, that this Parliament will not repeal the White Australia legislation? They have exactly the same assurance that we have that a Judge, in the exercise of his judicial functions, will be guided by reason, intimate knowledge of law, and an inflexadvantage ible rigid adherence to that which he beincluding this agreement in the lieves to be right; which make judicial since we should thus give decisions acceptable, or, at least, worthy they of the consideration and respect of the people. It is because this ParIn a Democracy, liament reflects public opinion in ' this country thiat the States of Australia may desire. always rest assured that it will deal fairly by them. It is not this Parliament that speaks; it is, rather, the States themselves speaking in their national capacity. What is this ridiculous twaddleI can call it nothing else-that masquerades under the guise of State Rights? A Commonwealth elector is asked to so tie his hands that he must for all time dip into his pocket every year"" for 25s. to hand over to himself as a State elector. himself to that extent whether he desires or does not desire it. We must never forget, as the Prime Minister reminded us recently, that the Federal elector and the St,ate elector are one and the same. We are asked to say to the State elector, in his Federal capacity, "" You must pay yourself 25s. per annum to the end of time, and if you change your opinion you must nevertheless continue to make that payment."" surer brought in his Budget Statement I contrasted the scheme of the Government as then proposed with the scheme propounded at the Brisbane Labour Conference, and said that, whereas one was a tentative proposal, the other was a settlement for all time. The Ministerial statement-date d 20th July last-quit e a long time ago now, when the Fusion Government set sail with banners flying, trumpets blowing, and the sails bellying out to catch every capful of breeze-contained , amongst other things, the following: A temporary arrangement for a term of years to replace the existing distribution, in which the obligations of the Commonwealth are recognised, is being prepared for submission. The understanding was that some substitute for the Braddon section was to be introduced, limited to a term of years. The Brisbane scheme laid down the principle that the relations between the States and the Commonwealth were to be discharged on the basis of a provision for the then existing expenditure, plus the expenditure on defence, transcontinental railways, and similar purposes, the residue to be divided amongst the States per capita. What the per capita payment was to be was not set forth, and that it was to be embodied in the Constitution, I absolutely deny. The party to which I have the honour to belong have always been seized with the importance of the principle, without which Democracy cannot exist, namely, that people have the right always to govern themselves. It was that principle which actuated us, prior to Federation, in opposing the Constitution B ill , because it contained a provision which prevented Democracy having unfettered control of its own destinies. That a party constituted as this is would appoint delegates to a Conference, and that those delegates would agree to perpetuate such a violation of the basic principle of Democracy, without setting forth this abandonment of principle in plain terms, is unHe must tax thinkable. I do not believe that they ever intended to do so; and I think we shall be able, in a little while, to provide the Chamber with absolute proof, which even the Treasurer will be constrained to accept, that the Brisbane Conference never meant anything of the sort. 1 have here the statement by Mr Holman, that he did not say the agreement was to be embodied in the Constitution, but that the Brisbane Conference said it was to be When the Treaembodied. Of course, this is a matter which can only be decided, first, by the probabilities of the case, secondly, by the environment or circumstances under which the delegates were selected, and, thirdly, by a reference to the delegates themselves as to what they did mean. An inquiry is being made; and the result will be published at a very early date. As the Brisbane scheme did not contemplate embodiment in the Constitution, I feel in no way bound-and in this matter we all speak for ourselves rather than for each other-to depart from the attitude I have taken up in regard to the constitutional restrictions on the rights of Democratic government from the very inception of Federation. I have always regretted that the majority of the people were prevented from having their way; but, at the same time, I have to face facts. We must seek to amend the Constitution if we wish to extend our powers. I shall never agree to deliberately re-shackle this Parliament by imposing other constitutional restrictions, now that the restrictions under section 87 are running out. It is perfectly well known to honourable members that there is another reason why we should not agree to this proposal; and that is that we cannot afford to do so. The responsibilities and liabilities of this Parliament are every day increasing. If it is the intention of the Government to carry out the pledges they made bei fore they took office, ""when some of their members were engaged in pointing out each other's shortcomings, I venture to say that this Parliament cannot, for any length of time, with the present revenue, afford to pay 25s. per head to the States. We shall be compelled to resort to further taxation; and, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh asked, "" In what direction shall we turn? ' ' Shall we impose revenue 1 duties ? There seems to be a general consensus of opinion against those who call themselves State Righters, but who are, as I have said, really reactionaries in a very flimsy disguise, that we ought to impose revenue taxation. and I hope that no one who calls himself a Democrat will ever agree, with such a policy. highest taxed through the Customs in the world, and the classes of this country are the lowest taxed in the world through direct taxation. half the taxes, and the Lloyd-Gcorge Budget is asking them to pav more; while here timidity marks us for its own when we propose to even reach to the height that Conservative England has long ago scaled. Buti f tlie Government rivet this agreement on our necks, I warn them that one of the immediate consequences will be the imposition of direct taxation. The people of the country will not be fooled twice running. They may agree to the 25s. petcapita proposal. I venture to say that, if the question of who should pay it , the classes or the masses, were put to a referendum, there would be an answer that would cause astonishment opposite. I challenge the Government to put to the referendum the question whether the shortage in what is necessary to meet the Commonwealth and State liabilities shall be made up by direct or indirect taxation, and to get the State debts and by its superior credit their answer. question to the electors I question individually; but .1 ask the Goget the benefit of our better management. vernment to let the people have a chance I decline to assent to that proposition. of saying whether they realize what this payment of 25s. per head means.

I cannot pathetically spinning romances as to what understand the frame of mind of a man could be done if we spent a little money in developing that country. Where is the money to be obtained from? Is it to be derived from duties on sugar, tea, kerosene, rice, and calico? Is the poor man to pay again ? No, sir. If the people of this country are to be trusted where they have only a' chance to empty their pockets, they should be trusted where they have a chance to put the taxation upon the shoulders I shall never agree, of those who ought to bear it-thos e who are the most lightly taxed class in the world.

I was unable to gather his precise ideas as to an arrangement between the States and the Commonwealth which, in his opinion would be satisfactory. I was not present when he was speaking. He has put his matured ideas in the form of a memorandum, and I believe that what he proposes now is that the arrangement should take the shape of the payment ultimately of an amount equal to the interest on the preFederation debts of the States. What that means in money I do not know, probably an annual payment of over £ 7 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . I decline to commit myself to an approval of that proposal. I shall want to know the conditions ' on which that obligation is to be imposed upon the Commonwealth.

No doubt in the fullness of time, when there shall have been evolved in the House a sufficient chorus of public opinion to make it worth his while to utter a definite statement, he will do so. Until then, however, we must hear him speak with that variety of voice which is so charming and yet so unsatisfactory. I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment, and, ih doing so,, express its disapproval of the proposal to embody the Premiers' agreement in the Constitution. My opinion is that the Tremiers' Conference is a body not at all authorized to deal with these matters. There exists a Chamber capable and clothed with the authority of the people for that very purpose. The Senate exists for that purpose, and for that alone. It will be a shameful reflection upon that Chamber to assume that its members are unable to exercise the very function for which they were elected. I shall not believe that they are so incapable or so unreliable that the people cannot trust them. Buti f that day has come, then one thing it. proves, and that is that the time has come when the Senate should be abolished, and the second Chamber should be a peripatetic Premiers' Conference, meeting as occasion may arise. On the horns of this dilemma the Prime Minister is impaled, and he may choose whichever horn he pleases. But that the Senate and the Premiers' Conference should dictate to this House is intolerable. That the people of this country should be told that the Premiers' Conference is to decide what the relations between the States and the Commonwealth shall be, and that, although at the next election one half of the Senate will be clothed with the authority of the people, each State returning the same number of senators, yet they will not be capable or authorized to determine what the financial relations of the Commonwealth ' and tbe States shall be, is a thing which I never will believe. I hope that the amendment will be carried, and that in any event the Premiers' Conference agreement will not be embodied in the Constitution. I trust that it will be clearly understood that we object to this proposal, because it is in the last degree undemocratic. We object to any interference with, the principle of government by the majority of the people, and this is in its essence an infringement of that great principle. [189] An amendment has been moved by the honourable member for Mernda which meets with my f u l l approval up to a certain point. I understand that the Government will take its acceptance as an intimation that the Committee desire that the principle of the Commonwealth making an annual payment of 25s. per capita to the States shall not be implanted in the Constitution for ail time. I know that the argument has been used that the Bill is merely a referendum to the people, and that no one should object when they will have the power, if they think fit, to make the desired alt&ration. I believe that I was the first man in Australia to lecture on the referendum. I hold in my hand one of the latest books published on the subject, and I challenge any honourable member to cite a parallel to the present case. There is only one country in the world which stands preeminent for its use of the referendum, and that is the country which is said to be the school-house of the European world. I allude to Switzerland. According to this book forty-two referenda have been taken in that country, and I challenge the Prime Minister, with all his genius and diplomacy, to cite a single instance where so iniquitous a proposal as the one before the Committee was sought to be embodied in a Constitution by means of a referendum. He will not deny that under article No. 118 the Swiss Constitution can be altered at any time. The argument is used that whenever the people desire to alter this agreement, if embodied in the Constitution, they can do so. There was never a more cunning device than that which the Prime Minister has put forward in this case. It astonishes me that any Ministry or any Parliament should in these days have the audacity tp propose to bind unborn generations with a law which, like those of the Medes and Persians, is never to be broken. It is an insult to the Democracy of Australia, who possess the widest franchise in the world, to suggest that the proposed agreement shall continue to operate for all time.

Much as I loathe this proposal I should be willing to swallow it if it were accompanied by such a provision as that. It is proposed that the operation of sections 93 and 94 of the Constitution shall cease to have effect, and that after the ist July, 1910, the Commonwealth shall pay to each State by monthly instalments, or apply to the payment of interest on debts of the State taken over by the Commonwealth annually, a sum amounting to 25s. per head of the number of the people of the State.

Radical measures which the Democracy of Switzerland eventually accepted were refused again and again during the period covered by the forty-two referenda to >vhich I have referred. I say that these were radical measures, but I challenge any one to quote a more reactionary proposal than Does the that now presented to this House.

Can he not look a little further ahead, to the time when the history of this period is being written? Will not the historians in those days blame himfor trying to insert such a reactionary clause in the Constitution, which, I am sure, he wishes in his heart to make as democratic as any in the world? He knows that in Australia we have not the initiative and the referendum, as the Swiss have, and that if this provision is inserted in the Constitution it will require an upheaval like the terrible revolution that swept the United States with blood and fire, to alter it. I have only to add that, inasmuch as the agreement is to pay to the States for all time 25s. per capita, that amount must be found, no matter how the revenue from the .Tariff may diminish. Therefore, those who support the agreement must be prepared later to vote for a land tax. With a population of 4,000,000, we must, under the agreement, pay £5,000,000 yearly to the States, and if we cannot afford to do that, and at the same time meet the Commonwealth expenditure, we must make up any deficiency by means of a land tax. That is the ""silver lining to the cloud. If this proof this attempt to uphold the present sysposal be stamped and branded on our Constitution, we have the consolation of knowing that the imposition of a land tax must surelv follow. [8-57J--Afte r the eloquent appeal of the honourable member for Melbourne, I feel that nothing will cause the Prime Minister to relent. I rise merely to enter my protest against the proposal to break the promise made to the electors when they were asked to vote for Federation. The Prime Minister is now holding out a helping hand to the drowning State politicians. In their hour of trial, they ask him to save them-, and in trying to do so, he is putting a blot upon our Constitution, and postponing the grand work of the future. I am one of those who took part in urging the people to accept the Constitution. Those who did so pointed out to them the value of a National Parliament, and promised economy and reform in regard to the State Governments and Parliaments, whose expenditure was to be reduced to a minimum, and the abolition of that abominable Tory institution, the Upper House, which is based on the principle of the House of Lords, which has ever kept back progress. The State Governors were to go, and many other expenses were to cease. We were to have a National Parliament, which would look after the interests of the people as a whole, and a death-blow was to be dealt to parochialism. To-day, after eight years of Federation, the storm is breaking which will give the people their rights. The avowed object of those who wish'to embody this proposal in the Constitution is to give security to State politicians, and to uphold the iniquities which Federation was to abolish. But, should'they succeed, a fire will be lighted which will destroy what they wish to preserve. The people, when appealed to in the right way by those who possess the national spirit, will understand the iniquity of having fourteen Houses of Legislature. They know how necessary is defence, the taking over of the Northern Territory, and the construction of transcontinental railways, and will not permit the hands of the Federal Parliament to be tied by a systemof parochialism which would prevent the progress of Australia. I am not an advocate of centralization. It would be a mistake to try to govern the Commonwealth wholly from one centre. I believe in the extension of local government, and hope, to see that come about as the result tem. When the British flag was planted c.n these shores, only one Colony existed, but later, Victoria was separated from New South Wales, and then Queensland, while other Colonies were established in the west. The time has arrived when there should again be a shuffle of the cards, and a subdivision of the large States. That would remove the curse of centralization from New South Wales, which drags everything to Sydney. member connect his remarks with the question ? to discuss this matter in detail, but it is necessary to give reasons why we shoul-d not vote for the proposal of the Government. It is as plain as daylight to me that the Government is being influenced by those who are anti-Federal, and wish to put the interests of the States before those of the Commonwealth. At the present time, practically our only source of revenue is the Tariff. I regret that its return is so large, and that its incidence is not more protective. But should the proposal now",52,Brown I S This In Ran After Or Sought Office Rather Refusing
249,Mr Frank Foster (New England),,53,Brown I S This In Ran After Or Sought Office Rather Refusing
250,The Chairman,Will the honourable,53,Brown I S This In Ran After Or Sought Office Rather Refusing
251,Mr Frank Foster,"I do not wishbefore us be carried, the Government, to obtain more money, will have to impose revenue duties, and to abandon Protection. That would be a reasonable outcome of the Fusion, and of the watering down of Australian sentiment by those who brought it about. As a sturdy Protectionist, I shall oppose any attempt to impose revenue duties upon the people of Australia. I take it that whatever Government may be in power after the next general election will be compelled to grapple with the question of direct taxation. But can honourable members repose any confidence in a Ministry which is so un-Federal in its attitude as is the present Ministry ?When the fight over direct taxation takes place, and the States exclaim, "" The Commonwealth must not trench upon our prerogative,"" what can we expect from the Government but an ignominious climb down ?' That is the time when revenue duties will be imposed upon such articles as tea and kerosene. Of course, I recognise-as did the Brisbane Labour Conference-that at the termination of the Braddon section of the Constitution, the CommonAvealth cannot fairly retain all the revenue that is collected from Customs and Excise. A portion of it must be returned to the States. But surely the necessities of the Commonwealth should be considered before a single penny is returned to them. I am.quite prepared to support a proposal to annually hand back, to the States a per capita amount of the Customs and Excise revenue; but I am not prepared to tie the hands of this Parliament in that connection for more than a very brief period. I might countenance an agreement under which the States would be returned a per capita contribution of 25s. annually for a period of five years. But I could not go further. If the proposed iniquity, in the form of this agreement, is sanctioned by honourable members, I feel satisfied that the electors, at the earliest opportunity, will remember the expenditure to which they are subjected in maintaining the State Parliaments, the State Governors, and the State vice-regal-establishments. The Prime Minister prefaced his speech with the assurance that he experienced considerable trepidation in addressing tbe Committee upon this question, in view of the very great importance of the issue which it involves. Like him, I , too, feel considerable trepidation in speaking to the amendment, in view of the attitude which I and other honourable members have assumed upon this question. Equally with the Prime Minister, I regard the present, as one of the most important junctures ii> the history of this Parliament. I feel my responsibility quite as much as does the Prime Minister, if I may.judge him by the speech which he delivered this evening. For the tone of that speech, I have nothing but admiration. In his opening, sentences, the honourable gentleman very straightforwardly admitted that the honourable member for Mernda had addressed himself to his proposal in terms of the most measured and conciliatory character. I , too, recognise in the speech of that honourable member every indication of a desire to divest his utterance of any words which might create even a suspicion of any sinister purpose. He feels, I take it , just as I do-and as does every honourable member upon this side of the Chamber who differs from the Government upon this question-that it is only upon the most serious ground that he would take up the attitude which he has assumed. I cannot, moreover, allow the Prime Minister's speech to pass without saying that I regard it as a splendid tribute to the Liberalism of the party which sits upon this side of the Chamber, and as a complete answer to the charge which is frequently made by honourable members opposite. Not only have certain Ministerial supporters intimated their intention of taking exception to the course which the Government propose to follow, but the Prime Minister has very nobly and magnanimously admitted that he cannot reasonably complain of certain honourable members who have given a great deal of attention to' this question, adopting an attitude in accordance with their personal views of its importance and its possible far-reaching consequences. I say_j therefore, that the formal amendment for the elimination of the word "" the,"" with a view to further amendments at a later stage, has been submitted by the honourable member for Mernda, after full deliberation,, and with a view to vindicating the position which he, and those who are associated with him, have assumed upon this question. The Prime Minister has very properly responded to the speech of the honourable member by intimating that this question is not to be regarded by the Government as a party one. Of course, I cannot forget the",53,Brown I S This In Ran After Or Sought Office Rather Refusing
252,Mr Bruce Smith (Parkes) [9.10],"words-and they were somewhat in the shall not be suspected, however, of desirspirit of the he completed his speech, when he cut down as much as possible the amount stated that if the. proposal were carried that the States wish in the future to reagainst the Government they would conceive. sider it their duty to go to the country upon stress that the State Premiers have dis-the question.

I do not proState pose to repeat the arguments that I used own particular policies. I have followed when this question was before the House on with some interest the statements made by a previous occasion, but I do desire to take the Premiers of the States at different times, advantage of the opportunity to vindicate and have noticed invariably that in their myself before my constituents and those endeavour to swell the category of the needs honourable members on this side of the of their particular States, they have in-House who may not see eye to eye with me cluded many items of expenditure that are as to the effect that this agreement may have of a purely loan character.

I recognised, os I recognise now, that the question of the allocation of the Commonwealth Customs revenue is only one of a number of financial problems which have yet to be settled We all know that it is intended in the future, if the States will agree, that the whole of the existing debts shall be ultimately taken over by the equally recognised that it may be desirable interest on the debts shall be paid by the Commonwealth, and that the debts shall be consolidated, with a uniform debenture stock for the whole of Australia, instead of having six separate issues of debentures and a further issue for the Commonwealth. The commonly-accepted proposition is that, by concentrating the whole of the State debts, in the Commonwealth, and adopting a uniform debenture stock, the Commonwealth will be able to borrow from those who lend us money in the Old Country, at a lower rate of interest, and so save a considerable sum per annum for the whole of the States. But there is the further aspiration that, when putting our finances, for the purpose of borrowing, upon a final and permanent basis, we should make some provision by which a sinking fund could be accumulated in order to ultimately pay off the debts. Here, then, are all those financial problems outstanding; and, beyond an intimation in the agreement that the Premiers will consent to an investigation, there is not a single word as to whether or not any one of the States will consent to any of these steps being taken in the interests of the people of Australia. that he is not bound"". has already said that he is not bound; and any one who has seen the report of the debate which took place in the New South Wales Parliament on the last Budget, can read between the lines that the politicians of that State are not in the mood to grant one tittle of concession to the Commonwealth in regard to the finances. These were the reasons which actuated mv mind in resolving that, so far as I could help it, no alterations should be made in the ""Constitution until"" some of these questions had gone beyond the stage of a mere agreement as to an investigation. To agree to an investigation is about as definite and binding as the promise of a Minister that he will give consideration to the request of a deputation, and is to be relied on just about as firmly. I have always been, and shall always be, against treating the Constitution as a battle ground for the people. My own opinion of the Constitution is that it is our Magna Charta. I think we should take off our hats to our Constitution whenever we approach it, and should regard it Commonwealth. It is as the basis of our national life-as the deed of partnership of the Australian that the whole of the people one with another, with a High Court to watch over it, and see that there is no encroachment on one side or the other, by either people or politicians. Such thoughts bring me to the conclusion that it is undesirable to be constantly calling on the people to settle questions with regard to the technical wording of the Constitution. In the first place, the people do not possess copies of the Constitution. They may have had copies ten years ago, but we know that in the usual course of events such papers are lost. For us to call on the people -o n the average man and woman-fro m time to time to provide himself or herself with a copy and to look into the technicalities of it, to study the measure before Parliament; and see how far it involves an alteration of the Constitution and ascertain the effect that it is likely to have on the body politic, is an absurdity of the first order. We should, I contend, treat the Constitution as a very sacred document. We should make as few alterations in it as possible, and should avoid making it a battle-ground for politicians before the people. We should endeavour always to bring proposed amendments of the Constitution up to such a point of agreement that we may be able to say to.the people, as we did in connection with the last Constitutional amendment proposed, that all parties are practically agreed upon the suggested alteration. We have before the two Houses of this Parliament at the present time no fewer than six B.j'ls, <;ach involving an alterialion of the Constitution. I ask honourable members to consider for a moment the position in which we should place the average elector in town or country if we asked him to decide first of all with regard to the election of three senators, to choose between the Labour party and the anti-Labour party in a general election, and, in addition",56,Brown I S This In Ran After Or Sought Office Rather Refusing

264,Mr Bruce Smith,"Unfortunately , have said, do know, that the whole thingpopulation has reached 6,000,000. At present the population of the whole of Australia is about 4,500,000, and that proposition, therefore, means that the payment of 25s.. per head will be continued by the Commonwealth until Australia has acquired 1,500,000 more people than at present. The States cannot justly complain of the way in which the Commonwealth is dealing with the matter. are, at all events, a few honourable members in this Chamber who would like to see the whole of the Customs revenue taken from the Commonwealth. member may not hold that view, but he cannot speak for the whole House. I have heard some very significant statements made in this Chamber as to what the Commonwealth ought to do with its revenue. Whether that is typical or not, the States have a sufficient assurance in our action to-day, seeing that even when the Commonwealth has the power to take the whole of the Customs revenue, it has not desired to do so, but that they will say, '' This will suit rather recognises that the people who contriour time, and therefore we will accept bute the taxes to the States and those who contribute the taxes to the Commonwealth are one and the same. It is simply a question of the allocation of money between the two interests. Naturally the States consider first their local interests, and the Commonwealth considers first its Commonwealth interests. We are now giving an assurance -in making this provision in its per capita form for a number of years, until the population reaches 6,000,000-that we are not dealing with our revenue with a niggardly hand. The State Premiers when they come to consider whether this is not a very fair substitute for the all-time proposal which was embodied in the agreement, and whether, after all, there is any need to be anxious, will, I am sure, readily accept it. I think, therefore, that the Prime Minister's little exhibition of rhetoric with regard to a possible shipwreck is one of those exaggerations which one is justified in incorporating in a speech when advocating a certain course. The Prime Minister is quite justified in appealing to any members of his partu who might be in a half-and-half mood, in order to try to win them over to his view of the matteT. He believes that it is in the interests of the Commonwealth to carrv the agreement as it stands from beginning to end. lieve that. cerned with ancient history. We, on the other hand, believe that it is much safer for the Commonwealth to limit itself to something like fifteen years. When the Prime Minister indulges in rhetorical-' There figures in order to affect those who are hesitating as to which course to take, I am equally justified in trying to cut down their effect by showing that, by looking at the matter in a calm, quiet, and composed spirit, and remembering that the Premiers of the States are practical men, who want to get on with their State business, and not to provoke a quarrel between the States and the Commonwealth, so far' frOm there being any 'possibility of shipwreck, the State Premiers will at once accept the situation, saying, ""We will take what you suggest; it will last our time."" Very few Premiers in office at the present time can count on being there for more than fifteen years. The probability is, then, it."" There is another aspect of the question with which I should like to deal The Prime Minister to-day, and on a previous occasion, talked of the ease with which a reversing amendment of the Constitution could, if necessary, be obtained ; but no one knows better than he that, should we agree to make this substantial contribution to the States for all time, it would be no easier to obtain a rearrangement than to get butter out of a dog's mouth. The States would reply, "" The agreement is for all time. There is no intimation in the Constitution that it should be for a limited period."" An alteration could be secured only by the consent of a majority of the electors in a majority of the States. It is easy to turn a windlass forward, but, when you do so, the little paul at the foot drops into its place with a click, and you cannot turn it back again. If , in the same way, the Commonwealth wishes the States to forego this contribution, they will reply, "" No."" Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia, although their populations may aggregate only one-fifth of that of the Commonwealth, would be able to prevent any alteration of the Constitution. teration has become necessary, some of",59,Brown I S This In Ran After Or Sought Office Rather Refusing

The inference to be drawn from the Prime Minister's speech was that an aggregate majority of the people can. secure an alteration of the Constitution. Nothing of the kind. twenty years hence, we find that we have gone too far, it will be impossible to secure an alteration of the Constitution without the consent of a majority of the States. Therefore, we say, make the agreementfor a limited time, giving the States to understand that at the end of the period fixed, the matter will be reconsidered. As I said the other day, we are wiser now regarding the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth than we were eight years ago. subject are infinitely clearer and more exact than they were in 1901. Is it not fair to assume that in 1920 we shall be a« much wiser than we are to-day as we are now than we were in 1901 ? Why should we give to the States all that they ask, and all that they can ask, while they merely agree to ""an investigation "" ? Were a man to say to me, "" I shall give you £ 1 0 if you will agree to 'consider the propriety' of giving me ^1,000 at the end of the year,"" I should certainly accept the money, because it would cost me nothing to consider the proposal. Similarly, it will cost the States nothing to agree to an investigation regarding the future management of the debts, the unification nf the securities, and the establishment of a sinking fund. The Commonwealth then should limit its gift to a reasonable period-. The proposed amendment saves the States prejudicially, and is compatible with the adoption of the agreement. Should the amendment be carried, the only effect upon the agreement will be to limit its duration. It will clearly indicate that there is no desire to alter the terms of the agreement in a way which would necessitate another Conference, but that this House thinks that' the agreement should be for a limited period only. It would allow the States to pursue any policy of development and immigration until their population numbered 6,000,000, when it would have a currency only until the Parliament otherwise decided. I strongly deprecate any reference to shipwreck. It should not be suggested that the Premiers are able to produce a shipwreck. I believe that they will welcome the amendment, and that it will cause most honourable members to be satisfied with the agreement, while it will not in any way interfere with the financial security of the States. was very refreshing to hear the honourable member for Parkes say that he is wiser now than he was eight years ago regarding the working of the Constitution. able member? party to which I belong strenuously opposed the provision of the Constitution which the honourable member has been con My present views on the) demning to-night.

The honourable member for Parkes says that he does not think that the Prime Minister meant what he said at the end of his speech, because it differed so much from what he said at the beginning. One is surprised that the honourable member should have fallen into the same mistake. In endeavouring to take credit to himself, and those who are associated with him, in their opposition to the proposed agreement, the honourable member alleged that they were free and uninfluenced by any caucus.
