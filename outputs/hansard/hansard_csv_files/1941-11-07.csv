36,Mr Falstein (Watson) [10.53],"( Mr Menzies), which have displayed gross puerility and a complete lack of social conscience. Opposition has said that this budget is concerned only with vote-catching and similar political considerations, but to that statement. I give the lie direct. This budget is concerned with human values, and not with the things mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition. It is extraordinary that each speaker on the Opposition side has in turn put forward the proposition that, in order to preserve democracy, a totalitarian state of affairs must be introduced in Australia. What is needed is not totalitarian methods, but a re-orientation of the social outlook. If this war is to be prosecuted with the utmost vigour, in order to save Australia for Australians, and not for the profiteers, that change must be made now. I heard the Leader of the Opposition say that what was needed at this time was confidence in the banks. honourable member for .Kooyong stated that the budget was inflationary, indeed he said that, in his conversations with Dr. Schacht, the German he had formed the opinion that he was a radical. tive. I take it that the right honourable gentleman meant that Dr. Schacht was radical in the same sense as the 1940 budget of the right honourable Government radical one. For a long time the people have in Australia, tries, nothing dence trick. Why do the banks have such fine buildings and magnificent The object is to put up what the Americans call a ""front"". they hope to, and in fact do, induce people to place with them their savings, upon which they in their turn can "" pyramid "" credit for their own profit. The Leader of the Opposition said some measure of compulsion be used against the people in order to force them to contribute towards the war effort, but the banks, he added, could be relied upon to do the right thing. Australia period of depression did the banks then do the right thing? They will assist a governor. Fwlstein. ment to continue in office only so long as it pursues a policy not in conflict with The Leader of the what they consider to be their best interests, and they are the sole judges in that regard. It is not in the interests of the mass of the people that the banks should be allowed to determine the amount of credit to be released. Can anybody deny that it would have been advantageous to release £200,000,000 of credit during the last depression? Already the right honourable member for Kooyong has said that it is recognized as sound banking practice that the credit structure of the nation can be resorted to up to the point, at any rate, where all available men and material are f u l l y utilized. The right to pursue that policy was deliberately denied to the Labour Government by the banks during tlie depression. Certain remarks offered by the right honourable member for Kooyong and the The right Leader of the Opposition were puerile. The former said that, if the Governand ment increased taxation and utilized the national credit, it would taki? financier, away fro m some people the incentive to earn profits and higher incomes.

38,Mr Falstelt5t,"I know_ nothingla that horse-racing to-day is an industry, and employs a large number of persons who could not otherwise be employed. Honourable members opposite have talked about the war effort. For many of them the idea of a proper war effort is inextricably bound up with the amount of money they can make at the expense of the nation in the prosecution of the war. member deny that a good war effort has heen made? last Government made a satisfactory war effort. I have in my possession a signed statement by a responsible person that Mr W. J. Smith, chairman of directors of Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, took certain technicians off work which was being done for the Commonwealth Government on a cost-plus basis, and employed them on the construction of a horse-float for his own use. Government doing about it? M.'r. FALSTEIN -The honourable member for Wentworth could not have been too well satisfied with Mr Smith's conduct, because he told me once that he was considering "" declaring"" that gentleman and his firm. This is indicative of the kind of thing that was happening under the previous Government, and it explains why the workers had begun to regard the war effort of the Commonwealth Government as nothing more than a big joke. How could any man be impressed with the urgency of producing war materials when his employer took him away from war work in order to build a horse-float? To-day there is a Labour Government in power which will, I believe, accept its responsibility and really govern the country, instead of allowing it to be run by departmental heads, and by pressuregroups representative of big business interests in Melbourne. The new Ministers will endeavour to impress their personalities on their departments and in this way will achieve better results. The maximum allowable income tax deduction in respect of life insurance premiums is £100. No worker can afford to put £2 a week into life insurance, so it is obvious that, when the last Government raised the amount of the maximum deduction from £50 to £100 a year, it did so for the benefit of its friends. A deduction of £100 is altogether too much. The amount should be reduced to a maximum of 10s. a week, or £26 a year. Life insurance canvassers are to-day offering the public a twenty-year endowment policy, and honourable pointing out that if a man pays a premium of £100 a year on a policy, the saving which he will make by way of income tax deduction will show a return of more than 20 per cent, on the policy. It is disgraceful that advantage should be taken by private business concerns of a provision intended to assist people to make provision for their old age, or for the protection of their families in the event of their death. Even that would not be so bad if it were not for the disgraceful manner in which insurance companies treat their agents, who are not paid a salary, and have no fixed hours of work, but receive an advance against commission amounting, in some instances, to as much as £3 a week, but usually to no more than £2 10s. a week. If they are injured in the course of their employment they are not covered by the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act. It is high time the Government took over life insurance companies, and nationalized the business in the interests of the country. The annual revenue of the Australian Mutual Provident Society is at least between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000 and the Mutual Life and Citizens Company pays its original shareholders dividends at the rate of 100 per cent, per annum. These huge profits are earned by exploiting those who bring the business to the companies. They keep their agents just so long as they are able to sell insurance to their friends and acquaintances. When they can no longer do that the companies get rid of them. It is a well-recognized fact that out of any group of twelve insurance agents, there are always four going, four on the job, and four coming. If the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) wants workers released for the war effort, let him support the nationalization of the insurance companies, and in that way make available the services of many employees.",14,Budget 1941 42 Revised

From the tone of his speeches in this chamber it is evident that he is a Fascist. One gentleman, Major A. F. Hudson, who was employed by the Mutual Life and Citizens' Assurance Company Limited as its new business manager, had a rapid rise from lieutenant to major. From time to time he went into camp, but as soon as he received a notice calling him up for the duration of the war the company with which he was employed found that his services were essential to the conduct of its operaa taxing machine. tions, with the result that he was granted a total exemption. The Commonwealth wasted money in training that man, for as soon as the time came when he could be usefully employed, the big life insurance company stepped in and instructed its servants, the previous Government, to release him. He was released. That is a disgraceful state of affairs which ought not to be possible in this country. Mention has been made, particularly by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin), of the fact that not sufficient men to reinforce the Australian Imperial Force are offering their services. I am pleased to see that provision is made in the budget for an increase of soldiers' pay by Is. a day. In my opinion, that increase is not enough, for I hold the view that, before any person ought to be asked to enlist in the services and risk his life, he should he given a guarantee that, should he lose his life, or be maimed, as the result of his war service, his wife and children or other dependants will be given the same measure of security as he could provide for them if he were alive and 100 per cent, physically fit.

I am disappointed at some of the omissions from the budget, and also the indications in it that the Government contemplates doing some things which I think ought not to be done. I shall refer first to postal charges. I believe that no good purpose will be served by turning the Postmaster-General's Department into done already. there are a number of post offices in which on days when pensions or military allotments are paid, as well as at other times when the demand for postal services is heavy, the available accommodation is inadequate. Successive Postmasters General have said that the existing state of affairs cannot be alleviated because the department has not the money to do the work, and that all expenditure must be approved by the Treasurer. of those things had I remained in office. supporter of the Government, I say now that I do not propose to accept from its Ministers less than I accepted from Ministers in the previous Government. In deed, I shall expect a great deal more from the present Administration. I am disappointed also that the present budget does not contain any provision for an increase of the maternity allowance, or for a liberalization of the basis on which that allowance is paid. I hope that this omission will be rectified in the supplementary budget which will be introduced later. At present the maternity allowance is not paid in respect of a first child should the income of the parents exceed £260 per annum. The salary limit increases by £13 per annum for each subsequent child. The basis of the allowance should he much more is a matter for liberal, and the allowance itself should be raised to at least £10.",15,Budget 1941 42 Revised

51,Mr Falstein,"Although I am aI n this connection, I urge that the sales tax on contraceptives should be increased. Persons who resort to the use of contraceptives should be forced to pay. In my opinion, the sales tax on these articles should be increased to 1,000 per cent, instead of the 20 per cent, now in operation. How can we expect to have an evenly balanced population in this country unless every encouragement is given to increase the number of Australian-born babies? They are the country's best immigrants. Because of the great use made of contraceptives, a sales tax at the rate of 1,000 per cent, would result in a handsome sum being paid into the Treasury every year. The present price-fixing methods do not satisfy me, and I know that other honourable members also are dissatisfied with them. Professor Copland, the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner, has the record of having wrecked at least two governments. If I were the Minister in charge of bis department, I should dismiss him at once. As Ministers and members have to accept electoral responsibility, they should govern this country, and not rely on departmental officers. I know that some departmental heads have conducted the affairs of their departments and have not acquainted their Ministers with much that has heen done in their name. For instance, Sir George Knowles, not the Bight Honourable ""William Morris Hughes, has for a long time been Attorney-General of Australia. Knowles has never been Attorney General of the Commonwealth. he has been Attorney-General in fact, although not in name. I hope that in the supplementary budget, provision will be made for the nationalization of key war industries, including the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited. Since the recent change of government I have become more than ever convinced of the need for the nationalization of these industries. I doubt if there is any war industry in this country in which there is not some ramp or racket. ber is badly informed. mind. claim to be better informed than is the honourable member for Swan( Mr Marwick). I refer the honourable gentleman to a statement which 1 made early in my speech to-day that the days when humbug and "" boloney"" were the chief attributes of members of Parliament are past. I hope that the supplementary budget will provide for the payment of unemployed persons, of whom there are still a great number in Australia. I should also like to see provision made for widows' pensions. Finally, I express the hope that the budget for 1942-43 will contain provisions to ensure that the financial and monopolistic institutions which have controlled Australia for so many years will be utterly overthrown, and that, at last, the people of Australia will rule Australia in the way in which Abraham Lincoln envisaged responsible government, when he spoke of "" government of the people, by the people, for the people."" If the things which I have indicated were done in this countrj', there would be security and a proper reward for those who toil. people of Australia expect the Government to carry on a vigorous war effort, and therefore it is the duty of this Parliament to devise ways and means to meet the cost of the war and ensure that the burden of taxation will be equiGeorge tably distributed. I appreciate the great problem which has confronted the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) and his advisers in formulating the taxation measures necessary to give effect to the Government's proposals. That has not been an easy task, because already we have so many phases of taxation that the advisers of the Government are at their wit's end to know in what way taxation can be increased. ' I am confident that any person who could suggest to either Commonwealth or State Governments any new form of taxation which would yield a considerable amount of revenue, would be received with open arms and regarded as a genius.

That has not only embarrassed the State Governments, but has also made it most difficult for the Commonwealth and the States, not to mention the municipal bodies, to devise ways and means of raising tbe revenue to assure an equitable distribution of the burden, not so much between the States, as between taxpayers. As tbe result of the overlapping of Commonwealth and State taxes, some taxpayers are called upon td pay more than others. That was not the intention of the .founders of federation. .Having been forced to encroach upon the field of income tax in order to raise considerable sums, the Commonwealth is now tapping sources of taxation which the States almost exclusively enjoyed, including gift tax, succession duties and land tax. The present system results in serious competition, inequities, and irritation. This problem which confronts us tion. In many directions, overlapping occurs between the public services of the Commonwealth, States, and local authorities. I need refer only to the matter of health. The Commonwealth, the States and municipal bodies have health departments. That is indeed foolish and is not conducive to efficiency. I have referred to this matter on previous occasions, because I have had experience of it in several quarters. At one period, I was associated with civic administration, where we had our own health officials. Over and over again I have seen conflict between Commonwealth, State and municipal health officers. tinue while we have divided control. built a very expensive city hall in Brisbane, which upset the system of rating. for all time. liquidated in time. As the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) has made such a foolish remark, he will doubtless be interested to learn that the contract had heen let and the foundations of the city hall had been laid before I took office. My responsibility was to see that the work was continued. ber certainly saw it through. Order! The honourable member for Melbourne must not introduce "" red herrings "". able member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner) referred to the necessity for establishing one central taxing authority in order to overcome the problem of dual taxation. WhilstI agree with that advocacy, 1 consider that we should go beyond it. We must have one purse from which to meet the requirements of 'Commonwealth and State Government's. One taxing authority should be responsible for raising the necessary revenue. Whether we like it or not, the financial burden which the Commonwealth has to shoulder will before very long force the issue of unificaduring the period of the war will become intensified when we tackle post-war reconstruction. If we had one central authority to control the whole of the finances of tbe Commonwealth, we should be in a much better position to-day. In my opinion, the principal difference between the financial policy of the present Government and that of the previous Government lies in the attitude of the respective parties towards compulsory loans. Last year, the total national income was £800,000,000. This year, more than £500,000,000 of that amount will not be called upon to make an additional contribution to the war effort. In the absence of proposals for compulsory loans, or substantially increased taxation, a -I agree. grave danger arises from the difficulty of diverting this huge sum from civil to war expenditure. The only alternative to compulsory loans is rationing, which will cause more trouble and will not be so equitable as were the proposals of the previous Government. The Opposition has made it clear to the Government that this problem is most serious. The policyis endangering the war effort, and if allowed to continue may lead to inflation. It was gratifying to hear the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) emphasize so soon after taking office, that there is no easy road in public .finance, and that we cannot pay onr way simply by making book entries.

70,Mr Jolly,"Yesterday , the honormay defer our obligations, same day, in some way, some one will have to pay. The Treasurer has exposed the foolishness of the idea that it is possible, simply by entries in the ledgers of the Commonwealth Bank, to pay our debts and to meet war expenditure. The issue of bank credit is justified only when it is supported by an increase of tangible assets; otherwise it must result in inflation. The War-time (Company) Tax Bill 1941 should be carefully reviewed before Parliament is asked to proceed with it. Upon small and new companies, which have not been able to establish reserves, it will operate most unfairly. Even under the provisions of the bill many large companies, because of their reserves, will not be called upon to meet any substantial increase of taxation. But a heavy burden will be placed upon the shoulders of smaller companies which have a capital of £100,000 or £200,000, but no reserves. Whilst their profit will be limited to £4,000 a year, another company which has the same amount of capital, but which has been in existence for some years and has established reserves of £100,000, will still be permitted to make a profit of £8,000 a year. That is not equitable, and I trust that the Treasurer will appoint a parliamentary committee, as was done last year, to review the provisions of the bill before Parliament debates it. When examining the balance-sheets of some of the major companies in Australia. I was surprised to find, notwithstanding the fact that the Government proposes to reduce their profits to 4 per cent., that they will pay very little tax indeed. In my opinion, the Government's estimate of revenue from this source will not be realized. I should like to say a few words in connection with the proposal of the Government' to aggregate the incomes of husbands and wives for the purpose of arriving at the rate of tax to be applied to both incomes. No objection could be raised to the amalgamation of the two incomes for that purpose where the wife has received property from the husband. I understand that, under the present law, the commissioner has the right to aggregate the income of a husband and wife Mr Jolly. where he is satisfied that transfers of property have taken place for the purpose of evading income tax. It appears to be unfair, however, that a wife who had certain property before her marriage should be called upon to pay a higher rate of tax than other taxpayers. I have a practical case in point which I desire to submit to the committee. In this case, the wife had an income of £1,600 and the husband an income of £1,100. Under the law, as it stands to-day, the wife would pay £748 and the husband £331, or a total tax of £1,079; but under the proposals now before us, the wife will pay £1,088 and the husband £621, a total of £1,709, or an increase of over 60 per cent. The point I wish to make is that, under the taxation proposals now before the committee, although the rate of tax on an income of £1,600 is increased by very little, under the amalgamation proposal, the wife and husband will have to pay an additional £621 in tax. The same unfairness is apparent in all separate incomes under £1,500. I should like the Treasurer to explain what will be the position where a wife has an annual income of £500 and her husband, a business man, shows a loss. Will the same principle he applied? In a good year, when the husband makes a profit of £3,000, the rate to be applied to both incomes will be determined on their joint income of £3,500; but if, during the following year, the husband shows a loss of £1,000 will that loss be set off against his wife's income, so that she will have no tax to pay? I submit that if the law operates to the detriment of the husband and wife in good years, in all fairness, it should operate to the advantage of the wife when her husband makes a loss. Where the husband suffers reverses, both husband and wife are entitled to some consideration. I greatly regret that it has been found necessary to increase postal and telephone charges. The post office, whose main objective is to provide a service to the public, should not be used as a taxing authority. The post office is already being used as a taxing machine; but it is now proposed that an additional £2,000,000 shall be collected by way of increased postal and telephone charges, principally from those engaged in business. I should like the Assistant Postmaster-General( Mr Lawson) to give special consideration to the unbusinesslike way in which postal works are financed. Before the postal authorities can commence to put into operation their works programme they have to await the passage of the budget and Estimates. I suggest that, in the interests of economy and of the service itself, some better arrangement could be devised. Normally, the budget and Estimates have not been disposed of until almost one-half of the financial year has gone by, and there is always an inordinate rush to complete works before the end of the financial year. I have suggested on several occasions that we should introduce a system somewhat similar to that in operation in England undeT which funds are provided for a three years' programme of postal works. I have been told by postal officials that they have repeatedly complained of the unfairness of expecting them to rush these works through. General knows only too well what it means to have to rush works through in Queensland during the summer months. authorities are not bound to complete the works before the end of the financial year. attention to this matter last year, and I close of the year, the amounts remaining unexpended in the votes are repaid to revenue, and the works for which the money was provided cannot be completed until the new Estimates have been passed. That is why the postal authorities have to rush them through in the few months of the financial year that remain after the budget and Estimates are passed. The chief executive officers of the post office ordinary civil expenditure. I enter my are very much concerned about the present practice. I propose now to say a word or two about the increase of soldiers' nay. There is some -justification for the payment of the proposed increase at once to married men; hut in the case of single men it would be much better to defer payment until their return to civil life. The lumpthe preceding year's provision. If it he sum payment of deferred pay made to our soldiers on their return from the last war was of great advantage in assisting them in their return to civil life. I believe that such a system would be of great advantage under present conditions, at any rate, to single men. The Government should give the soldier the option of immediate payment or deferred payment. Quite a number of our fighting men would, I am sure, prefer to receive the increase in the form of deferred pay. I speak with some interest in this matter because I have three sons in the Australian Imperial Force. I know that it would be in their interest if the payment of the increase were deferred until after their return from the war. The Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) said yesterday that single men contribute to the maintenance of the family. That may be so in some instances, but I believe that the majority of single men bear no share of the family expenses. I urge the Government to give serious consideration to the need for giving our fighting men the opportunity of saying whether or not they would prefer the payment of the increase to be deferred until after their return from the war. The Assistant PostmasterI am pleased to know that the Treasurer intends to investigate the prospect of effecting economies in connection with our ordinary governmental civil expenditure. I am satisfied that there is room for conordinary government departments. I drew do so again because I find that the ordinary votes and miscellaneous services, which cover administrative expenses as distinct from war expenditure, amount to £6,159,000, as compared with £5,265,000 in the previous year, or an increase of over 15 per cent. That increase requires some explanation, particularly at a time like this, when we are calling on the people of Australia to economize in their emphatic protest against the lack of information regarding many of the items included in the Estimates. Members of Parliament are entitled to some explanation of the votes placed on the Estimates and submitted for their approval from year to year, particularly those which have been increased by comparison with not possible to give the information to honourable members in Parliament, some arrangement should be made by which they could get the information from the",19,Budget 1941 42 Revised

72,Mr Jolly,"Immediatel y after theTreasury officials. When I noticed that one vote for the Postmaster-General's Department, which has nothing to do with the war, has heen increased by 100 per cent., I made inquiries of the Director of Posts and Telegraphs and got a satisfactory explanation. It might be a good thing if the Treasury officials added a footnote in the Estimates, explaining why abnormal increases of the previous year's vote have been provided. In conclusion, I ask the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) to see that a thorough check is maintained) over our huge war expenditure. As a member of the Joint Committee on War Expenditure, I have had some opportunity to observe what is being done in this connection. I was greatly impressed by the complete cheek applied to our various war activities, so as to assure that mine, Mr William Wall, a cane-grower value is being received for the money expended. Treasurer whether the Auditor-General has sufficient staff to make a proper check of war expenditure, because I am not altogether satisfied that the check is as thorough as it might be, not because of any failure on the part of the Auditor-General to carry out his duties, but because he has not sufficient staff available. I urge the Treasurer to increase the staff of the Auditor General in order that an adequate check may be maintained. AlthoughI am impressed with the system introduced in the various .war activities to check war expenditure, that system will be futile unless the Auditor-General or somebody else has an adequate staff to see that the check is fully maintained. The Auditor General's report will shortly be before us. I trust that it will contain a statement by the Auditor-Oeneral that will assure the members of this Parliament that we are at least getting full value for the immense war expenditure we are called upon to meet to-day. The first matter on which I intend to address the committee is the liquid fuel rationing scheme, and I repeat the statement. I made as a. member of t h j Opposition that those who told the biggest lies originally receive the greatest petrol ration. I intend to cite some facts which I hope will cause the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Beasley) to re-organize the whole petrol rationing scheme. Eirst, there is an amazing disparity between the petrol rations allotted to taxi drivers in Townsville using cars of the same model. One receives 32 gallons a month, another 42, and another 53 gallons. In Mackay the allowance to taxi drivers ranges from 19 gallons to 60 gallons. Such a state of affairs is absolutely unjustified, and, without increasing the aggregate of ration tickets issued, the Government could ensure a more equitable issue of tickets to men whose livelihood depends on their taxi cabs. iSecondly, primary producers have been treated unfairly in comparison with people in the cities. At a branch meeting of the Australian Labour party I asked a good friend of living a few miles out of Ayr, whether he Yesterday, I asked the could supply me with instances of what he conceived to be real injustices. He said "" I have received a letter from the Liquid Fuel Control Board in which they tell me that no increased ration can be allotted to me although I am getting scarcely enough petrol to start the tractor, let alone attend to my public duties as a member of the Ayr Council"". This man is not getting sufficient petrol to enable him to travel the few miles between his property and Ayr in order to attend the fortnightly meetings of the council, and he finds it impossible, owing to the shortage of petrol, to use his farm implements as they should be used. It transpired that the morning on which he received that letter two very well-dressed young fellows came to his farm in a big truck to canvass for orders for enlargement of photographs. They were employed by a city concern, whioh does very fine work, but Mr Wall was not so interested in the quality of the work as in how they were able to obtain sufficient petrol to travel around the country in order to secure orders for the enlargement of photographs. They told him that they were allotted 80 gallons a month. Whoever was responsible for their receiving such an allotment of petrol was either unfair or stupid, because Mr Wall, a primary producer doing a national service, does not have a ration one-fourth as large. That is not an isolated case, and",21,Cameron Th E Postal Siderable Economy In A Number Of Our
73,Mr Martens (Herbert) [12.0],"I hope that the Government will do .something to correct such inequalities. It must so re-organize the scheme as to unable people plying motor vehicles for hire to obtain equal quantities of petrol iu order that they may earn their livelihood ; it must also ensure that primary production shall not be hampered. In doing so there would be no need to increase the total quantity of petrol made available 'because many changes could be made. For instance, the Government would be well advised to examine the waste of petrol which occurs in the displays of armoured vehicles in the cities. In that way a lot of useless work is being done. 1 should lie greatly interested, too, to hear a state of fact the problems were well known ment which would justify other misuse of petrol in the city areas. I asked the former Minister for Supply and Development what amount of petrol was issued to private car-owners in the various cities where excellent tram and bus services are available, but I was told that separate figures were not recorded as between the city and rural areas, and that an aggregate quantity of petrol was issued through the Liquid Fuel Control Boards of the various 'States. Those private vehicles could well be up on blocks, and the petrol allocated to them given to the primary producers who keep the cities in prosperity. It is amazing to see the number of motor vehicles at Sydney bowling greens, race-courses, sports grounds and coursing grounds, all of which are amply served by buses and trams. If people are not satisfied to ride in buses or trams they should be made to walk. Why, some men in Sydney receive four times as many petrol ration coupons for private cars as primary producers receive for farm purposes! The whole arrangement is stupid and cries for re-organization. How any one could swallow the lies that have heen told by people in order to obtain a larger petrol ration than should be given in the circumstances is unimaginable. The history of the Miowera military camp near Bowen is remarkable. The former Minister for the Army( Mr served in Palestine and other places Spender) told me that the Miowera camp had been opened on the recommendation of the General Officer Commanding Northern Queensland Forces and that it had been closed on the recommendation of the same officer. It is a remarkable thing that one officer should be able to make two such recommendations aud have them acted upon by the same Government. I asked the former Minister for the Army, ""Has the camp at Miowera near Bowen been closed down? . . . What was the reason for the closing down of the camp ?"" His reply was, "" Yes. . . On account of water supply and sanitation preventing the proper development of training"". I do not believe that the present Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) will be able to find on the departmental record any evidence to support that. As a matter before the camp was suggested. There was no water except that contained in a dam in a small creek. Naturally the water became brackish in a short space of time because the intake of fresh water could not keep pace with what was pumped from the dam. When the camp was originally recommended the commanding officer ascertained that the cost of bringing water from the inexhaustible Don river would be between £4,000 and £5,000. The then Minister said that sanitation was a difficulty. It had to be a difficulty in the circumstances, for if 1,000 men are concentrated where there is a lack of water danger to the community is inevitable. The camp was to have been permanent and was to have held 1,000 men. It was closed after £8,673 had been expended. That figure does not include the cost of moving the troops, who are now encamped on the Townsville showground, which is miles away from a rifle range, and is entirely unsuitable for training purposes, as compared with what the Miowera camp would have been had proper steps been taken to ensure an adequate water supply. I had the pleasure of inspecting the Miowera camp, where 1 dined in the officers' mess with the commanding officer, Major Snodgrass, and his staff. The commanding officer told me that it would be difficult to obtain a better site for a camp. Having in the Middle East in the last war, he ought to know what he is talking about when he discusses camp matters. His experience lends force to his statement that the Miowera camp was ideal, but for the water shortage. That was the only trouble apart from the attitude of the owner of the property on which the camp was established. His attitude is quite understandable when it is realized that he was trying tofatten cattle on land on which hundreds of men were being trained and that he was receiving as rent only £2 a week. Many people imagined that it was because of the influence of his brother-in-law well known in the United Australia party circles, that Mr D. A. Herron, the owner of the property, was able to lease the land to the Commonwealth. The falsity of that is shown by the meagre rent paid to him and by the fact that no man would be willing for such a small return to destroy his chances of pursuing his profitable industry of breeding fat cattle. The Townsville camp is not satisfactory and another site must be found. strongly advised the Government to consider the reports of its officers on the Miowera camp, which apart from the easily rectifiable trouble about water, is regarded by every one as being splendid for military purposes. The statement was made yesterday that northern Queensland has been neglected in the allocation of munitions contracts. Not only has northern Queensland been neglected, but also the whole of Queensland has largely been neglected in this connection. A so-called expert, Colonel Evans, reported that the foundry at Mackay and that at Brandon, near Ayr, were not suitable for munitions work. He be a difficulty at Brandon, but that the boring and planing plant was quite all right. Another expert, however, said the opposite, namely, that the foundry was quite all right for castings, but that the boring and planing plant was not what was wanted. We would seem to have too many experts when two of them can express contrary opinions about the same place, and when one of them can say that its castings are not suitable, in. spite of the fact that the foundry can do the work very well, and has been doing so for years in the manufacture of rollers for sugar mills, involving heavy castings six Mr Martens. feet in length. It was only after the manager of the Mackay foundry, Mr Cameron,, came south to talk to higher authorities, that he was able to prove the efficiency and worth of the foundry's plant and obtain orders. The Commonwealth Manpower and Resources Survey Committee was surprised to see the quality of the work that was being done at the Delta foundry. That establishment has difficulty in handling bisr jobs, but, in spite of what experts might say, it has done and is doing all of the ordinary foundry work. When the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) was Minister for the Army, I asked him whether some arrangement could be made to utilize the sugar mills in the slack season on munitions work. He replied that such an arrangement would not be economical. At the same time the Plane Creek mill has been engaged on munitions work I uninterruptedly for a year. A greater share of this work could be undertaken by the sugar mills. I hope that the Government will do more in that direction than the last Government, which spoke so much about its war effort. Machinery in sugar mills in the Mackay district, which is valued at £3,000,000, can definitely be utilized for certain classes of munitions work. I asked Mr Cameron what degree of co-operation he expected to receive from those mills. He told me quite a number of things which I shall personally bring under the notice of the Minister. However, he said, "" We have an organization which, when we get going in the near future, will surprise Australia"".

A few years ago, at a very early hour in the morning, when practically every honourable member was sleepy and tired, a Minister of the late Government, a canny Scotsman, put through the House an amendment of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act. At first glance that amendment appeared to be of minor importance, but it gave to the Government discretion to decide what works should be referred to the committee for investigation. Previously, the act provided that all proposed works, estimated to cost £25,000 or over, must be referred to the committee. I urge the Government to restore that provision in order that all works estimated to cost £25,000 or over shall be automatically referred to the committee for investigation. The committee has effected enormous savings in respect of works which have been referred to it for investigation. Last year the late Government endeavoured to ignore a report, by the -works committee, on prodesire was to ignore the works committee posed departmental offices for Canberra. Its behaviour, and particularly that of the Minister for the Interior at the time, were worthy only of a selfish school boy. The committee's recommendation was not viewed favourably by the Minister. He wanted to erect two temporary administrative buildings, whereas the committee declared that such a proposal constituted a serious diversion from the Griffin plan, and, accordingly, recommended that permanent administrative accommodation be constructed, or, alternatively, that the block at Civic Centre known as Melbourne Buildings, be completed at a cost of £50,000 in order to provide the immediate accommodation required. No attempt has yet been made to implement that recommendation of the Public Works Committee. On the contrary, the late Government hastened to rent office space in the capital cities, were framed in order to prevent aliens 1,000 principally Sydney and Melbourne, and even in Canberra, with the result that its rent bill was increased considerably. Although the late Government originally proposed to expend £80,000 on the erection of temporary office buildings, it took no steps to provide the £50,000 which the completion of the block at Civic Centre was estimated to cost. Expert evidence was given on oath before the committee that the latter accommodation would be a payable letting proposition when the Government vacated it on the erection of the administrative block. The Patents Office building is not in accordance with the Griffin plan. That work was not referred for investigation to the works committee because the then Prime Minister was determined that the committee should not prevent its erection. The amendment to which I referred was put through this chamber at 3 o'clock in the morning in circumstances in which honourable members had no opportunity to realize its importance. canny Scotsman? member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) was the Minister in charge of that measure. He secured that amendment on behalf of a Government whose sole when it considered that course convenient or expedient. A review of the work of the committee shows that it has saved to this country a considerable sum. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward) has announced his intention to promulgate regulations in order to prevent rent racketeering. He intimated that rents would be pegged at the 1939 level. I have in mind a house at the corner of Blair-street and Beach-road, Bondi, which has been purchased by one of those people who were chased out of Germany by Hitler.

I should like to know how much they pay for their privileges. It is disgraceful that these people are allowed to buy property in this country before they are naturalized. We are told that they were hunted out of Germany without a shilling, yet they can afford to buy expensive properties. I also have in mind a block of flats at the corner of Curlewis-street and Glenayravenue, Bondi, which was purchased by one of these refugees at the price of £15,000. The whole of the ground floor of that structure has been converted into shops, and large plate-glass windows now extend along the whole of the frontage of the property. I am informed that such renovations cost £11,000. Yet all of that expense apparently has been borne by one of Hitler's victims, one of those persons who, we are told, were chased out of Germany after being deprived of everything. To-day, Australian tenants are being harassed by these people, some of whom should be in internment camps. I make no secret of the fact that I have reported at least one of those gentlemen to the Investigation Branch. That particular individual owns a large block of flats. Recently he was coming out of the front door of his property when he met another of his kind coming out of an adjacent barber's shop. The first thing to appear through the doorway was his nose. As he approached his friend he clicked his heels. I was passing at the moment. He looked at me and wondered who I was. I have no doubt that he said to his compatriot "" H c i l Hitler"". I hope that regulations will be framed with the object of preventing Germans of this kind from ousting Australians from their properties. They should not be allowed to own property until they are naturalized. I am glad to be able to say that they cannot do so in Queensland. Yesterday the honourable member for Boothby (Dr. Price), almost with a catch in his throat, declared that what we wanted in this country was a Churchill. Let me read to the honourable gentleman the following extract which I take from A Prophet at Home by Douglas Reed:Tlie 'Tory system, through this miserable doctrine of the little exclusive coterie united by money and the piece of coloured ribbon, is responsible for the social evils of this country and the long foreseeable wars that find it unready. For this reason I , for one, deeply regretted that Mr Winston Churchill, who as an "" unreliable man "" of "" poor judgment "" had suffered too much from this very system, to the misfortune of England, took over, when Mr Chamberlain laid it down, the leadership of that Tory party which, in an election speech at Dundee in 1908, he described, according to the newspaper report, in these terms:We know what to expect, when they return to powera party of great vested interests, banded together in a formidable confederation; corruption at home, aggression to cover it abroad, the tyranny of tariff jugglery, the tyranny of a well-fed party machine . . . dear food for the million, cheap labour for the millionaire. That is the policy which the Tory party offers you. That is the policy of the Tory party in this Parliament. It was the policy of the Government which we displaced a month ago. From the criticism by honourable members opposite of the budget proposals, although they do not put their views on the matter as bluntly as Mr Churchill, it is clear that they wish to see a Tory policy implemented in this country. It is a pity that Mr Churchill has to deal, with Fifth Columnists like the Cliveden set and the Duke of Bedford. Mr Churchill's job, and the job of this Government, could be rendered much easier if people of that kind were interned.

I have watched them carefully for the last man, they sit at your right, but they appear gloomy; and one begins to wonder whether their gloom is due to the fact that they have already discovered that there are some difficulties in running a government in a war like this, or whether it is simply 'because there are two wings of the Government party whose views do",25,Cameron Th E Postal Siderable Economy In A Number Of Our

I suppose there is one wing which considers that the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley), in his budget, has gone, perhaps, rather further than is wise; and they are not too pleased about it. And there are others who probably think that the Treasurer has not gone far enough; and those honourable gentlemen are looking forward with avidity to the day when he will go far enough, if that day ever comes. ing. encouraging to us. We have heard so much of the things that would, be done so soon as the Opposition of a. few weeks ago assumed office. able member expect within three weeks? the point. When Government members were in. opposition their policy, it was said, was cut and dried and ready to be put into operation forthwith. Now we have a series of apologies from them. time available for the preparation of the budget is concerned there is no need for apology; though honourable members opposite have found sufficient time to take definite action in certain directions. Sometimes when one is looking through old papers, one comes across an extract which is apposite to the moment. Yesterday the Prime Minister( Mr throughout, and it was only to be exCurtin) rebuked the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) for being inconsistent, but I have here evidence that inconsistency can exist in other quarters. In the Melbourne Argun of the 4th .September, 1940, the then Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) is reported to have referred to the Beasley group, which at that time did not see eye to eye with the Curtin group, as follows:The Beasley group has no part in the Labour movement. group has no reason for its existence. It split from the Labour party for a reason that 1ms since vanished, t t would split in any cusp. Vor air. Menzies to say that I w i ll not be able to form a Government without the Rensley group is wishful thinking. Yet it came to pass, although to be quite fair I do not think that the decision as to the personnel of the Labour. Government was made entirely on the merits of the members concerned. I have no reason to have a personal liking for the Beasley group's political views, but I have a certain respect for men who possess obvious merit, and some have been omitted from the Ministry, who, I think, should have been given a chance to display their ability, particularly at a time like this. That is merely my own personal opinion, based on the wider view that we all should be working together. I have quoted to honourable members just what the Prim"" Minister said in respect of a certain section of his party only a year ago. ber should hear what we said about the then Leader of the Opposition. that the. honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) did say some interesting things about the Curtin group at that time, and if he will rise and give to the committee some details of what was said. I shall listen to him with the greatest of So far as the shortness of the interest and pleasure. The budget should be no surprise to any one who has watched public life, particularly the political side of it, during the last year. It is completely consistent with the repeated refusal by honourable members opposite to form a national government. The. attitude of Labour party supporters has been quite uniform pected that when they finally gained occupation of the treasury bench, some such budget as this would be introduced. But considering the situation on the widest possible basis, what is the general attitude of the Labour party? Surely this: they hope that we shall win the war; they are opposed to conscription of manpower, whether for military service overseas, or for industry; and it appears that they are opposed to the conscription of wealth, although not to the In fact, thi' Beasley point of preventing them from very nearly applying conscription to certain tax-paying groups which do not include their own political supporters.. I think that' is a fair statement of 'the position.

With reference to the question asked by the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) this morning, I do not know Mr Nash, the New Zealand Cabinet Minister whom we had the honour of accommodating with a seat on the floor of this chamber the other day; I have not spoken a word to him in my life, but one cannot fail to be impressed by the sane and common-sense approach which the New Zealand Labour Government, of which Mr Nash is a member, has made to this problem. Even though some honourable members may not be prepared to listen to what I say, I strongly urge them to read the report of Mr Nash's speech which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald and which came like a breath of fresh air. As for the budget itself, we can dismiss ficates will be insufficient-and I am not it fairly quickly. The contrast between talking as a doctrinaire, lawyer, or this budget and that introduced by Mr professor of economicsI ask honourable Fadden some weeks ago appears to be members whether it is not obvious that simply that a mere trifle of £16,000,000 if we create, as we have done in the last more has to be found now by way of two years, what might be called a group loans or through the release of credit. on an increased standard of living due That is the first point. The second point to higher wages, there will be increased is that this budget makes no provision spending on luxury goods, particularly for compulsory loans. All contributions when the group concerned consists of by loan are to he made on a voluntary wage-earners who previously had not very basis. Those are the essential distinctions much pocket-money? between the two budgets. I disagree with naturally they will want to spend the this budget; I think that it is a bad additional money on some of the pleasures budget.

There are three outstanding reasons why I consider that this budget is essentially bad, and I shall start by mentioning briefly what they are. The first is that voluntary contributions to loans and war savings certificates will inevitably prove insufficient. I have no doubt whatever on that score. The second reason is that there is a most unfair distribution of taxation, an unduly heavy load being placed on those earning high incomes. The third reason is that in my opinionI am confident that it is shared by many othersthe budget has definite inflationary tendencies.. It may be argued that that was also the case with the Fadden budget and, to some extent, with the budget introduced last year, and I shall have a few words to say on that score when I come to the general subject of inflation.

I am of the opinion, as are in its expectations from voluntary loans. many people beyond the walls of this I come now to the second reason why House, that the Government's proposals I consider that this is a bad budget, in this connection cannot be regarded as namely, that taxation on higher incomes being, in any sense,, equitable or just. is unduly heavy. When the right honorI t is not right that the rich people who able member for Kooyong said yesterday constitute a very small section of the that this additional taxation would check community, should be savagely penalized enterprise, there was an outcry from -for that is what is proposed-whils t honourable obviously that must be the result.

And they are not alone. wealthy families. another aspect of the subject. Many wealthy men iu Australia to-day are giving their service to the nation freely, or for a very small remuneration, in order to help the present war effort. I wish their names could be written up somewhere so ""\ve could see them, for a lot of critics do not know what service of this kind is being done. be suggested by some that these men have some ulterior motive in mind. It will be said that if they are not receiving pay for their services, they will expect to be compensated in some other way. If they were materialists, as has so often been suggested, would they have given up their businesses at a time like this in order to serve the country in an honorary capacity? that they are trying to get something out of it? orable member for Reid practically made that suggestion last night. I have sat in this House for years while attacks have been levelled against the great industrialists and merchants of Australia and suspicions cast upon them. I repudiate all such attacks and suspicions, for they are gravely unjust. It seems to me that they have been made in order to undermine the reputations of these people, or to serve as an excuse for the kind of action that this Government is now taking. The honourable member for Bass had something to say yesterday about conscription. He put his case reasonably enough, but I think his view is quite wrong. It is, of course, possible to put a case reasonably, even though it be badly based. The honourable member, as I understand him, said that honourable gentlemen on this side of the chamber were in favour of the conscription of man-power for overseas service, hut were not in favour of the conscription of wealth. the Opposition were in favour of the conscription of man-power and material but not of wealth. in favour of the conscription, in its due order, of man-power for service anywhere, in the Army or out of it, including industry. That, at any rate, is my position. We are also obviously in favour of the conscription of wealth, as it may be required, for the prosecution of the war, in the first place of income and, subsequently, if necessary, of capital, until the whole of the resources of the country have been Of course, it will brought into the war effort. Our whole effort must be co-ordinated. Unless we can draw upon the whole of our man-power for service overseas or for service in industry, we shall fail to make our maximum war effort. Our present man-power position is absolutely hopeless. The policy of the Government suggested seems to be based upon the use of manpower, which, actually, is not available to us. However, the Government has decided to apply conscription, or what i.s near enough to conscription, to the incomes of a 3inall handful of people in this community who have large incomes, and do not belong to the Labour party. It seems that for Labour supporters the slogan is "" Victory without debt"". I have received, I suppose, a couple of hundred circulars carrying this slogan, and I daresay other honourable members have also received them. It is utterly impossible to emerge from, a war of the magnitude of this one without having incurred heavy debts. How can any reasonable person expect to attain such an impossible end? One communication that I have received on this subject reads as follows:As my Federal representative, I hereby request you to insist upon the Commonwealth Bank making use of its powers, as set forth in paragraph 504 of the Australian Monetary Commission's RepoTt, to finance the present war by the issue of interest-.free money, and to oppose .'ill attempts to introduce the "" Keynes Plan"", or any modification of it, into Australia.",30,Cameron Th E Postal Siderable Economy In A Number Of Our

Such a thing would, of course, be impossible. The third subject which I wish to discuss is the deliberate and definite inflationary tendency of this budget. Personally, I consider that this tendency has been in evidence for the last year or so, but not to any major degree. The budget introduced a few weeks ago by the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden) showed a marked increase in the inflationary tendencies that were noticeable in last year's budget; but such tendencies are far more manifest in the budget now before us. Everybody knows that our currency and the currencies of other countries are already inflated to a certain not stand here to put a case for one degree. Our difficulty is to have controlled inflation instead of progressively increasing inflation, which leads to disaslarge electorate, and it is my duty to ter. I said only last week that this budget had very inflationary tendencies: and a leading banker stated the same thing. In a matter of money, I place my trust in men who understand finance. If I am to have a surgical operation I prefer to have it done by a surgeon rather than by a carpenter or a blacksmith. Few of us here, however great our qualifications may be, have the ability to manage the affairs of a great bank. The work is specialized, and is not confined to operations within Australia. A banker must be able to pit his brains against the best brains of other countries. That cannot be done successfully by an untrained man. Mr Mono AN down a few times. tell the honourable member a well-known story about the artist Whistler; it has a great deal of truth in it, and its application is general. During the course of a law suit, Whistler was asked whether he had painted a certain picture, and when he answered in the affirmative he was asked how long it took to paint it. He answered, "" half a day "". Counsel asked, "" How much did you charge for the painting?"" Whistler replied, ""£200"" . Counsel then asked, ""Do you dare to 3ay that you charged £200 for the work of half a day?"" Whistler answered, "" No, not for the work of half a day, but for the knowledge of a life-time."" That is analogous to the work of a great banker. I leave that for the honourable member to turn over in his mind. The following cablegram from the London Financial News appeared in the financial news section of a recent issue of the Melbourne Argus:The state has heen reached in Australia at which inflation can be averted only by a curtailment oF general consumption. Consumption is still high . . . Inflation looms if sound finance is sacrificed for vote catching. I believe that it is generally admitted,, even by honourable members who support the Government, that this is a votecatching budget. Therefore, if that statement is as sound as I believe it to be, inflation looms ahead of Australia. I do section of the community only. People of all classes, wealthy and poor, live in my ensure, as far as lies within my power, that our monetary policy is sound and that they are not robbed by inflation. I shall give some illustrative quotations from a book entitled, The Social Revolution in Austria, by C. A. Macartney, which deals with events in Austria after the war of 1914-18, when the country embarked on inflation. These extracts show clearly the dangerous path which Australia may be forced to follow. what happened in Australia as the result of deflation. the control of the Government of the I would close the banks time, led by the late Mr Lyons, and of the Commonwealth Bank, this country pulled through the financial emergency in a way which startled most of the countries of the world. startling to the workers. provided a notable instance of extreme poverty supervening on the false control of money.

Some men will not return from the fighting zone to receive their deferred pay. The general line of the Fadden budget was to build tip the deferred pay of all members of the fighting services. That would be a good policy to adopt in respect of those who are not in the fighting zones.

I am, however, in favour of one provision in the budget, affecting the invalid pension. Invalidity always has, I think, a prior claim. I was glad to see in the budget the provision that the percentage of total invalidity is to be somewhat'reduced. All of us have dealt with cases of men who, for all practical purposes, have been useless, and yet have not been able to obtain a pension because of the absence of total invalidity. This alteration is reasonable and sound. If I were to deal at length with the banking institutions, my remarks would respect of tlie leaders of our other industrial enterprises. I should have something to say in regard to the competence of bank managers, and would affirm that the profits made by the banks are not great now, and that we have had splendid of New South Wales was established in 1S17.

There are, however, one or two bright spots in it, and I am glad to know that the Government has adopted in principle some of the leading features of the Fadden budget. I refer to the proposed establishment of a mortgage bank, the limitation of profits and the control of private banking. Having regard to the difficult times through which we are passing in tlie greatest crisis in the nation's history, any unprejudiced person who has studied the Fadden budget will agree that it was a statesmanlike effort. Viewed all round, it was direct, honest and capable, and reflected great care, tremendous thought, and expert financial and economic planning. It was a genuine attempt to be fair to all. There was no thought of party political advantage or sectional favouritism in its preparation. It declared that no section of the community would be sheltered from whatever share of the costs of the war it had the capacity to bear. Such war burdens were to be spread equitably over all classes of people. When Prime Minister the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) proposed to raise) £322,000,000, with no increase of direct taxes on individuals, and no further indirect taxation. It is a matter for regret that the Government has not adopted the modified form of the Keynes plan for post-war credits and the proposal of the Fadden Government for deferred pay for soldiers. I suggest that the alternative to the adoption of those two proposals is a very heavy increase of direct and indirect taxes, of which we have ample proof in the present budget. The adoption of those features of the Fadden budget would have assisted considerably to meet the post-war problems and the depression which will undoubtedly come. We may take action to minimize the evil effects of the depression, but, as sure .as night follows day, that depression will come. Many Australians with a substantial postwar credit, and many spldiers with a good deferred pay cheque would he able to weather the depression far more easily than the proposals of the present Government will permit. It was rather refreshing to hear the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) say, in the course of his budget speech, that no book entries by the iCommonwealth Bank could reduce the calls on the real resources of the country. I am glad that the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) and the Minister for Home Security( Mr Lazzarini) have at last approved of a government pronouncement on such sound and orthodox lines. Apparently, those Ministers have thrown overboard their oft-expressed fantastic views on finance generally, and at last realize the impossibility of securing a quart from a pint pot. I hope that the Government is sincere in its declaration, and will not permit uncontrolled inflation, which has brought disastrous results to many other countries. It has been said that the budget is a vote-catching one. I claim that it was prepared designedly to dangle political baits before the unthinking and uninformed elector. He may think that those on the lower and middle rungs of the income ladder will escape tax, but an close examination we 'find that the indirect taxes proposed in this budget will make a much larger hole in the basic wage man's weekly budget than on the banking account of the man in receipt of £1,500 a year. The increased taxes to be imposed an individuals amount to £9,000,000, and an exactly similar sum is to be raised by indirect taxes. By the imposition of these indirect taxes the Government is unfair to the poorer sections of the community which it claims to protect. It is generally admitted that indirect taxes press most heavily upon those in receipt of the smaller incomes. We find that the workers' beverage, tobacco and cigarettes are to bear increased imposts. Many household commodities used by the workers will bo taxed to the extent of 20 per cent. Even the clothes worn by the workers will bear increased taxes. Building materials will go up in price, and these increases will be reflected in increased house rents that the workers will be obliged to pay. The president of the New",35,Victor S Without Debt
142,"Mr Gtjy (Wilmot) [2,57]","Th eSouth ""Wales Trades and Labour Council, Mr Maloney, M.L.C., recently statedIndirect taxes must seriously affect the purchasing power of the lower paid workers and reduce their standard of living below that to which it was reduced by Mr Fadden's budget of 1940. The problem facing the Treasurer to-day is the same as that which confronted the Leader of the Opposition a few weeks ago. The Government proposes to raise £29,000,000 by means of increased taxes, whereas the previous Government proposed to get £32,000,000; but, out of that sum, £25,000,000 was in the nature of a loan or post-war credit, leaving only £7,000,000 to be obtained by increased taxes. It is to be regretted that Parliament has rejected the compulsory loan plan because it is now impossible to do by direct taxation -what the ex-Treasurer could have accomplished by this simple and ingenious method of post-war credits. We all recognize that money must be raised if we are to put forth our maximum war effort. Many taxpayers would regard themselves as fortunate to be allowed to lend money at 2 per cent, rather than have to pay the money away in taxes. I am afraid that, under the severe taxation proposed in this budget, we shall run a grave risk of drying up those fountains of surplus funds from which loan money is normally drawn. High taxation will have a disastrous effect on our attempts to raise war loans. The net result of the Labour Government's budget, after allowing for increased taxation and the flotation of public loans on the basis of last year's borrowing, is to leave a gap of £94,000,000, or £13 for every man, woman and child in Australia. In other words, that amount of money is to be raised over and above what was raised last year. The sum of £22,000,000 is to he raised by increased taxation, leaving the enormous amount of £72,000,000 to be found by public borrowing. I trust that the Government will use its best endeavours to keep the wheels of industry turning, for it is the first duty of any government to prevent continual stoppages in the war industries. Strikes and stop-work meetings are just as helpful to Hitler as if the men concerned in them were fighting in the enemies' ranks. I hope that the Government will confine its activities to the winning of the war, and will leave political manosuvring in the background for the time being. There is at present a definite call for all the people of the community, trade unionists as well as employers, to brush aside petty differences, whether political, industrial, commercial or social, and to combine in a common effort for the common good. We must subordinate all considerations to the one thing that matters-the winning of the war. We have a heritage to fight for, we have our democratic institutions to fight for, our standard of living to fight for. Everything dear to us is at stake in this great conflict. Recriminations, bitterness and wrangling must be put aside. The safety of the nation is at stake, and we cannot allow discord and disunity to disorganize our war effort. The spectacle of national disorganization and discontent would be an invitation to an enemy to strike a blow at Australia. We must not allow anything to stand between us and a proper realization of the country's needs. I said at the beginning of my speech that there were one or two bright spots in this budget. I was pleased to note that the Government proposes to take action to stabilize rural industries. One of the most important and urgent problems confronting us at present is the preservation of our primary industries. It has been stated that all prosperity comes from the land-that the land is the backbone of Australian economy. Therefore, positive action must he taken for the protection of the man on the land, because, if the primary industries perish, so also will Australia perish. We must endeavour to stabilize the finances of the primary producer. Farming incomes must be increased. The primary industries have been hit more severely by the war than any others. What with the scarcity of petrol, and the difficulty of finding markets for primary products, many farmers will soon be unable to carry on. In many instances, costs are in excess of returns. Potatogrowers had a bad time during recent years. If they are prevented from securing a reasonable price for their potatoes during a time of scarcity, they should be protected against los3 when there is a the adult members of his family glut. However, when the grower has a and his employees, he would think chance of getting a reasonably high price that during the time of scarcity, in order to Unfortunately, he cannot do so; his make up for the losses previously incurred returns are falling and his costs are the authorities step in and iix a maximum rising rapidly. Some people say that price. If a maximum price, is fixed when the remedy is price-fixing, but the pricesupplies are short, surely it is but a fixing machinery seems to work difnatural corollary that a minimum price ferently when dealing with the products should be fixed in time of plenty. The of secondary industries from the way it Government has already acquired such works when dealing with primary proproducts as wool, wheat, and lamb, in ducts. What happens when the prices order to save those industries from ruin. of primary products rise in sympathy It is only logical, therefore, that somewith a calamitous season or soaring thing should be done to save the potatoproduction costs? There is a public outgrower from ruin. The potato-growing cry, and the price-fixing authorities are industry is just as important as some stirred to take action. A maximum of those industries which have been price is fixed with little or no regard assisted, and provides just as much to the costs of production.

One Workers in secondary produce is left to rot in his fields or on the wharfs and becomes an absolute loss. I am reminded of a school teacher who once asked a pupil to describe a farm. The pupil wrote "" A farm is a piece of land surrounded by mortgages"". In many instances that is a true description, due largely to the non-existence of a mortgage bank or of reasonable facilities to obtain finance. I trust that the Government will push ahead with the proposal to establish a mortgage bank. It is long overdue. I compliment the Government on adopting the proposal of the Fadden Government in this connection, and I urge that no time be lost in establishing it, because I believe that it will be of great assistance to our rural industries, provided that adequate long term credits are made available at reasonable rates of interest. The establishment of -a mortgage bank should certainly create greater stability in the primary industries. Much has been done in the past for the primary producers by the provision of bounties and advances, but we have now reached the stage when we must have a comprehensive scheme to increase the income of primary producers, rather than a scheme which will enrich their creditors. In this connection statements by two prominent persons may be of interest to honourable members. I shall refer first to the statement of Sir Frederick Leith Ross, who is in charge of the plan of the British Government to feed Europe with dominion surplus foodstuff. He recently saidI t is necessary to remember that primary production is the base upon which the whole economic structure is built , and the base cannot carry the superstructure of industry, trade and finance, if prices rise to levels at which they either discourage consumption or inoite to over-production, or, alternatively, if and tended to equalize the community's buying they fall to levels spelling bankruptcy for primary producers. I agree with that statement. It is necessary to have a comprehensive scheme, in order to stabilize our primary industries. The second statement to which I wish to refer is that of Professor 'Copland, the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner, who is reported to have saidI believe that there should be an attempt to prevent any rapid recession in prices at the conclusion of the war and that if there is any recession, unemployment and social distress [0] w ill have to be faced. The problem w ill have to be tackled through the medium of minimum price levels, expansion of public works, import regulations, &c. I agree w it h t h a t statement also, a n d I urge t h a t e f for t s be made to meet such contingencies. One of the greatest problems of a g r i c u l t u r e is h o w to overcome gluts a n d surpluses. One causes t h e other. The y can be g r e a t l y reduced, or even abolished, in n o r m a l seasons by fixi n g m in i m u m prices w h i c h w ill prevent f a r m e r s from p e r i o d i c a l ly a b a n d o n in g the p r o d u c t i o n of a c o m m o d it y because its price has reached l o w levels. The U n it e d States of A m e r i c a has attacked t h is problem in recent years. I shall quote from the r e p o r t of the Secretary for A g r i c u l t u r e in the U n it e d States of A m e r i c a for 1940I n spite of the outcry raised against it at first in some quarters, the farm programme that has been developed since 1933 has been generally recognized as a truly national programme. It has become to be accepted as a means of advancing the general welfare as well as that of agriculture. Under the farm programmes, farm and nonfarm groups have benefited together. Farm incomes have been practically doubled. Farm bankruptcies have declined by more than 76 per eent. Farm mortgage debt has been substantially reduced. More than 6,000,000 farmers have co-operated in soil conservation and crop adjustment plans. Improvedf a r m buying power has tremendously benefited urban business. Farmers are now able to buy from cities as much as they did in 1929, whereas in 1932 they only bought 58 per cent, as much. Farm machinery sales have quadrupled. About 20 per cent, of the factory re-employment is a direct result of increased farm buying power. Surplus disposal operations have relieved the farmers surplus problems and aided the nation's poor. Agriculture has never lowered its production below the wants of the people, but, on the contrary, has merely checked its over-production. Federal action to raise farm income has not hurt the rest of the community, but has raised power. Employed wage-earners can command more agricultural products with their payrolls than they could in 1929. The food stomp plan has universal approval. Opposition to the national farm programme has practically disappeared, criticism now only deals with details. Almost every one admits that what the Government is doing for agriculture is broadly what must be done. In view of such a fulsome eulogy from the United States of America after the scheme has been in operation for some years, could Australia do wrong in adopting a similar plan? The present Secretary for Agriculture in the United States of America has referred to the "" problem of farmers' surpluses "" and to a "" food stamp plan"". Various schemes have heen devised for the purpose of disposing of surplus products in ithe domestic markets of that country. They are designed to bridge the gap between the surpluses on the farms, and the need for supplying more food and other necessaries to people who lack adequate purchasing power. iOne plan envisages the purchase by the Federal Government of the surplus products for distribution to the States for use by the poorer classes of the community. During 1939-40, more than 1,300,000 tons of 40 different surplus products were purchased, distributed to the States, and fed to 11,000,000 persons in 3,000,000 families. Under the food stamp plan, people in the lower income groups and in indigent circumstances buy an orange coloured food stamp for $ 1 . That enables them to purchase $1 worth of food. In addition, the holder of the stamp receives a blue half-dollar stamp which entitles him to obtain, free of charge, half a dollar's wonth of surplus foods. States of America is so satisfied with the operation of the plan that the Government is extending its scope. The Secretary of Agriculture has directed that important revisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act should be made. This proposed extension has heen placed before all leaders of organized agriculture for consideration, and will be debated by Congress at an early date. The essence of the new proposal is to be found in the preamble to the measure which readsA bill to promote the national defence and security by stabilizing agricultural prices, by encouraging the farmers' production of foods for better nutrition, by assisting small farmers equipped. Millions of pounds' worth of and for other purposes. The Government should give serious consideration to this system, because it offers the means of preserving our primary industries. If we allow them to fail, we also shall perish. previous speakers have dealt exhaustively with the budget proposals of the Labour Government, I shall confine my remarks to a brief outline of the achievements of the previous Government. The Prime Minister( Mr durtin) and his Ministers would be well advised to follow the excellent example that has been set by their predecessors. The change of government was most unfortunate. People do not swap horses when they are crossing a dangerous stream. Since the outbreak of war, I have consistently advocated the formation of a national government, because the duty devolves upon every honourable member to pull his weight in this period of extreme crisis. Failure to achieve a national government has been, to me, a source of profound disappointment. Although the Advisory War Council was established, it was a poor substitute for a national government and it counts for very little indeed. The representatives of the Opposition upon that body have no responsibility. I regret to state that I have heard confidential subjects, which were discussed at meetings of the Advisory War Council, spoken of freely in public. That failure to observe secrecy is inexcusable. Members of the Opposition will render to the Government all assistance that lies in their power in order to enable the counThe United try to achieve a maximum war effort. The dangers that menace Australia have increased in intensity almost daily during the last two years, but the former Government left no stone unturned to meet any emergency. Its object was to keep the . battle-front thousands of miles from our shores and to date, that has been realized. Australia's front line is not in Northern Australia but in Malaya and even in the Middle East. When the former Government sent the Australian Imperial Force abroad, it made every endeavour to ensure that the troops were well trained and properly material, in addition to that used by our troops, has been exported to theatres of war for the purpose of assisting Great Britain. For Australia, there is no comparison between the present war and the World War of 1914-18. During the last war, many thousands of Australians who fought overseas were supplied with uniforms and were partly trained in Australia,' but their equipment was furnished by iGreat Britain. To-day, our",36,Victor S Without Debt
143,Mr Stacey (Adelaide) [3.28],"A stroops must be fully equipped in. Australia. Tkef ormer Government also bad the responsibility of equipping many Mew Zealand troops,, and sent a great deal of war material to various parts of the British Empire. As recently as two years ago, Australia was regarded as being principally a primary producing country. To-day, the manfufactura of war materials has been developed on a vast scale in nearly every State. Four years ago> the House decided after prolonged debate that it was impracticable to manufacture motor cars in Australia. When the call came, we accomplished the infinitely more difficult office for only about three weeks, the task of making aeroplanes. two years of the receipt of the blue prints of the Wirraway aeroplane the first Australian-built Wirraway was in the air. The success of our aircraftman ufaetu ring industry speaks volumes not only for the efficiency of the Australian workman but also for the completeness of the preparations that had to be made before the first aeroplane could leave the production line. By now over 1,000 aeroplanes of the Wirraway type and other types have been manufactured in Australia. We also have the satisfaction of knowing that we are able to build the Beaufort bomber, which was once thought to be. entirely beyond our capabilities. Our achievements in that direcI am surprised to see included in the tion are all the more remarkable when it is realized that we had to start without a nucleus of trained men and with no machinery suitable for the production of aircraft. It was impossible in many cases to import machines from overseas, and we had to manufacture them here together with the necessary machine tools required for the manufacture of the various components. orable members who have not yet done so to visit the workshops in South Australia in order to see at first hand what wonderful strides have been made in that State. Until a few years ago South Australia was principally >a primary producing State. Honourable members should visit the Islington workshops, where they will see some of the finest machines and tools that exist in any part of the world. Most of them have been made in Australia. At Salisbury, buildings for the manufacture of munitions cover 2,QQ0 acres, and are completely equipped with machinery manufactured in Australia. This speaks volumes for what was done during the last two years by former governments. Much more might have been done had honourable members opposite accepted our invitation to form a national government as a step towards securing a real "" all-in"" war effort. Instead, however, they were content to stand aloof and criticize the Menzies and Fadden Governments for what they termed their inaction. A l though the new Government has been in Within Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) and his supporters have been proud to broadcast to the world the wonderful things that have been achieved in Australia. Have all these achievements been secured in three weeks? I remember one member of the present Ministry saying in this chamber, not long ago that if Australia were invaded not one division could be raised in this country to defend it, and even if such a division were raised it could not he equipped. A few days ago the present Prime Minister, broadcasting to the world, said, ""We are now ready to face the enemy."" That also was a wonderful achievement after three weeks of office! Ministry to-day as Minister for the Interior, Senator Collings, who, not long ago in the Senate, characterized Mr Churchill, a man whom we ought to go down on our knees and thank God for, as a "" scoundrel"" and a "" mad dog"". Any one who makes such utterances has no business to be included in any government. RecentlyI advise honan excuse was published in the press for the non-inclusion in the Ministry of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) on the ground that his ill health prevented him from accepting a portfolio. In this chamber not long ago the honourable member referred to the British fleet as a "" l o t of pirates"". Do honourable members consider such a person to be suitable for inclusion in the Government of the Commonwealth? I thank God to-day that the honourable member has been left out of the Ministry. supported the proposal of former governments for the establishment of a national government. did not advocate the inclusion in it of men of that type. I also remember having heard, less than two years ago, some of the present Ministers say that they would not send one man overseas to fight on foreign battlefields. Not long ago, when the then 'Government sought to reintroduce compulsory military training iu Australia, the proposal was hotly opposed by members of the present Ministry and their supporters. Where would we be to-day in the event of invasion if we did not have the necessary trained men to place in the field to oppose the enemy, and if our factories were not equipped to manufacture the necessary materials of war? I am prepared to assist the present Government in every way provided it does the right thing and follows along the lines laid down by its predecessors. In past years, Australia has been called Australia, must have earned millions of upon to budget for an amount of approximately £70,000,000; to-day, however, owing to the exigencies of the war situation, we are called upon to budget for the staggering amount of over £300,000,000. I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) upon the budget which he presented to the House. Its preparation must have entailed a large amount of work. It was a fair budget which called for equal sacrifices from all sections of the community. Every man and woman in Australia to-day is prepared to accept a fair share of the burden of our war commitments. Government asks -TOBACC O RATIONING-DEPARTMEN T the honourable member. On the contrary, the revised budget proposes to place an unjust burden on a small section of the community. The Fadden Government was forced to relinquish the reins of office by the defection of the honourable members for Henty( Mr Coles) and Wimmera (Air. Wilson). For about twelve months the honourable member for Wimmera wore two engagement rings, but eventually he decided to marry into the Labour party. The honourable member for Henty, who entered this Parliament about twelve months ago with a very exaggerated opinion of his own ability, first went into the party room of the United Australia party to hear what was being said. Then, I believe, he visited the Labour caucus to hear what was being said there. Eventually, he became a member of the United Australia party; but for some reason which I cannot understand, he decided to join forces with the Labour party and said: "" We will turn the Fadden Government out of office "". Well, they have been given their rewards. The reward of the honourable member for Wimmera is that he is to be given a trip overseas to the exclusion of a member of the Labour party, and the reward of the honourable member for Henty is that he will have to pay excessive taxes. I strongly advise the Treasurer to keep a well-trained eye on the honourable member for Henty and on C. J.

149,Mr Barnard (Bass) [3.48],"I rise2. Is Scottsdalu district included; if not, can tlie Minster say why? 3. Isi t a fact that the present buildings in use at Scottsdule are most uneconomic for processing purposes? I was in for m e d 1. New mills arc being established at Wynyurd, Divers tone and Deloraine and deseeding depots at Bi'iinxholni. CuiiLpaiiia, Evendale, and Sheffield. 2. As indicated in (1) above, a new deseeding depot is being established at Brauxholm, which is in the Scottsdule district. A deseeding depot already exists at Lilydale, which Iso serves that area. 3. The mill machinery at Scottsdule i« housed iu leased premises. This arrangement provides reasonably satisfactory facilities for the deseeding, retting and scutching processes involved and the bulk of the 11)40 crop for this area has already been processed at the mill in question. WhilstI commend the Government for its decision to erect the new mills and deseeding depots indicated in the answer, T. consider that an unsatisfactory policy is being applied in respect of Scottsdale. Scottsdale is in the centre of a large flax producing district and is within 30 miles of Lilydale, where a deseeding depot already exists, and of Branxholm, where a deseeding depot is to be established. Being housed in leased premises on the showground, the scutching mill machinery at Scottsdale is unsatisfactory. It is also incapable of handling all the flax that would be grown in the locality, a rich agricultural area, if better facilities for scutching were available. Accordingly, I ask that the Government reconsider its policy and establish a new scutching mill at Scottsdale. the attention of the Government to the fact that men employed in the collapsible boat section of the Clyde Engineering noon, Company Limited will be put off to-day is some foundation for the question submitted unless the company receives further by the honourable member for Grey. It was orders for work which they have been proposed that the Board of Area Management specially trained to do. It is likely that in these men will be out of employment for a astounded to think that I was not consulted, considerable time. member for Reid( Mr Morgan) that the Minister for Munitions ( Mr Makin) has discussed that matter with me, and that night.

I shall not divulge the men that they will be kept in the name of my informant, because, employment. have been in communication with Sydney with a view to. having the men retained in employment at least until the matter can be adjusted. week I asked the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) in the absence of the Minister for Munitions ( Mr Makin) whether it, was true that contracts worth £6,000,000 for the manufacture of Bren gun carriers had been taken from Government factories, which had satisfactorily produced 1,100 Bren gun carriers, and given to a large motor firm. With other members of the Joint Committee on War Expenditure, I have listened intently to evidence given to that body at its sittings in camera, during the last few months; but I take this opportunity to say that the question I asked was not derived from any evidence given before that body. It was prompted by information I received from a private source. I now wish to know whether the annexes at Government workshops are producing Bren gun carriers satisfactorily and at a reasonable cost, or whether it is now held that they could be produced cheaper under contract by private firms. The Minister stated yesterday that my information was hardly correct. However, last night when I was absent from the chamber, he explained that he had just secured certain, information, and he was astounded to know that action had been taken without his permission or knowledge. I said last night. SinceI answered that question this afteri t has been revealed to me that there Victoria would consider to-morrow some suggestion along the lines indicated. I am but this evening I issued a firm instruction that the matter must not be proceeded with reference to me.

Is the Minister considering granting a contract to the value of £6,000,000 to any one firm for the manufacture of Bren-gun carriers f dentally, the Minister, in his reply, suggested that I mentioned Ford Motors Limited, but I did not mention the name of any firm. Does the Government, the Board of Area Management in Victoria, or the Minister intend letting a contract valued at £6,000,000 for the manufacture of Bren-gun carriers to a private firm? Will the whole, or only a portion, of this work be let to any one particular company? for Munitions) [3.59] -Certain aspects of the matter just raised by the honourable member for Grey( Mr Badman) were concluded by my predecessor;. but in regard to those aspects which have not yet been determined I have given instructions that no further determinations are to be made by the Board of Area Management until I am further consulted. I am determined that this work shall be distributed as widely as possible, and that no one company shall be given a monopoly of it. The instructions I have issued will afford me an opportunity to review the matter, and to the degree that I am still able to make any determinations in respect of it I shall ensure that the interests of those who previously did this work are fully conserved. [4.0] -In conformity with the promise made by the Government in the budget statement, a committee consisting of Mr E. V. Nixon and Mr J. A. L. Gunn, chartered accountants, and a nominee of the Taxation Department is being appointed to examine the proposed taxation on ex-Australian incomes, and to devise a formula to meet any cases of undue hardship. I have discussed this matter with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) who agrees with the proposed appointments. this opportunity to refer to the difficulhas risen the industry should take the ties which now confront the poultry industry, which is fourth in importance among our primary industries. Owing to war conditions it now finds itself in difficult circumstances. Through the shortage of shipping space the export of eggs has been very much restricted. Plans are now' being worked out, and to some Incidegree have already been implemented, for the conversion of eggs into pulp in order to take full advantage of the limited shipping space available. This improvement will result in .an increase of exports. The proportion of space saved by this means is as much as two-thirds of the space required for eggs in the shell. Since the outbreak of war the poultry industry has suffered by reason of the fact that whilst the price of eggs has remained stable the cost of articles required by the industry, such as wheat and its by-products, has risen very substantially. Many producers who, previously, were comparatively prosperous have recently been forced out of business. This has resulted in a contraction of supplies of eggs, and that in turn will not only adversely affect the interests of the industry in this country, but will also operate against the interests of consumers in Great Britain, as that country relies very largely on Australia as a supplier of eggs, particularly since shipments from China have been greatly curtailed. The difficulties now confronting the industry can be remedied either by increasing the price of eggs or by decreasing the price* of commodities used in the production of eggs. The. former remedy would have undesirable -repercussions in Australia and also in our overseas markets. Consequently, I suggest that steps should be taken with a view to seeing whether the prices of articles used in the production of eggs cannot be rednced. The present difficulties of the industry are indicated by the following figures: Since before the war the retail price of wheat has risen from 2s. lOd. a bushel to 4s. OA. a bushel. At the same time, as I hawe already said, the price of eggs has remained stable. Many people with whom I have discussed this matter point out that before the war the industry enjoyed prosperity because wheat was cheap, and contend that now that the price of wheat bad with the good. The average gross price of wheat from 1929 to 1939 was 3s. 2d. a bushel, which corresponds to a retail price of 3s. 7d.",43,Comes Appointment Op Committee Poultry Industry Potas H Supplies

158,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,Treasurer ),44,Comes Appointment Op Committee Poultry Industry Potas H Supplies
159,Mr Ryan (Flinders) [4.1],"I takeThat compares with the present-day price -of 4s. 9d. a bushel for wheat obtained from the produce merchants. It is easy to see. that the industry is in diffiActing upon instructions from the Goculties -because of that increase of price. The same applies to other fodders used in the poultry industry. The price of bran has risen from £4 a ton to £6 10s. or £6 15s. a ton, and there has been a similar increase in the price of pollard. In fact, even at these high prices, bran and pollard are sometimes unobtainable. The shortage is due to the fact that the millers are not gristing the same quantity of flour as in previous years, and consequently there is a reduction in the quantities of by-products available. Let us turn now to the other side of the picture, namely, the position of wheat stocks abroad and in Australia. The position, as I see it, is very unsatisfactory. Last year the world shipment of wheat reached a record low figure of 320,000,000 bushels, compared with the previous record of 350,000,000 bushels m 1890. This year prospects are even worse, and the world shipment will probaibly not reach more than 300,000,000 bushels. At present the world's surplus wheat stocks amount to 1,200,000,000 bushels, of which 375,000,000 bushels are in 'Canada, 385,000,000 in the United States of America, 200,000,000 in Argentina, and 20,000,000 in Australia. The low figure for Australia ia due to the fact that last year we had a serious drought which reduced our yield considerably. Indications are that this year our surplus will reach 100,000,000 bushels, which is a very large quantity for this country. There will be similar increases in other countries, where good harvests seem to be assured. The world, therefore, is faced with the probability of ever-increasing wheat stocks, so long as the war lasts. There seems to be no reasonable prospect of disposing of the huge surpluses which are now being built up. It is argued that when the war is over there will be a heavy demand for wheat in war-stricken countries, but that demand will be temporary only and will not absorb the huge stocks which will be available. Australia is definitely faced with the prospect of accumulating an enormous surplus of which there seems to be little possibility of disposing. It is, therefore, the responsibility of the Government to explore every possible means of disposing of our wheat. vernment the Power Alcohol Committee of Inquiry has indicated one way in which a certain quantity of wheat can be used: It is proposed to produce 40,000,000 gallons of power alcohol, of which 38,500,000 gallons will be obtained from wheat. That production will absorb approximately 17,000,000 bushels, which is a very small quantity compared with the estimated surplus of 100,000,000 bushels. Other ways and means must be -found to dispose of our surplus wheat. It is clear that quite a large quantity can be diverted to the poultry industry. At present that industry is responsible for the consumption of 25 per cent, of our wheat consumed locally. use a lot more wheat if it were cheaper. the eggs? sent overseas. I do not suggest that we can use anything like our entire wheat surplus in this way, but at least a portion of it could be absorbed. giving financial aid to two States which <-annot find means of exporting their eggs. assisting the poultry industry. One is to give direct financial assistance, and the other is to improve the internal economy of the industry by supplying wheat and wheat products at reasonable prices. What does strike one is the discrepancy between the price which is paid to the farmer for wheat, and that paid by the poultry-farmer. The wheat-farmer gets 3s. Id. a bushel for wheat on the farm, whereas the poultry-farmer pays 4s. 9d. a bushel. That discrepancy of Is. 8d. a bushel is due largely to distribution costs. We all know that distribution costs are high, and must necessarily remain so. Those costs absorb a large percentage of the retail price, but I am confident that some improvement could be effected. If not, I suggest to the Government that it might be possible to provide some concessional price to poultryfarmers, partly to help the industry and",44,Comes Appointment Op Committee Poultry Industry Potas H Supplies

165,Mr Ryan,"There are two ways ofpartly to assist in the disposal of our wheat surplus. This matter has already been taken up with the Department of Commerce and I have been informed that poultry-farmers can obtain wheat in truck lots from the Australian Wheat Board at 4s. 3fd. a bushel, plus a l^d. a bushel freight, making a total of 4s. 5Jd. a bushel. In the Dandenong Ranges, a short distance from Melbourne, it is necessary to take truck lots of 132 bags and to pay cash. At present, the poultry-farmer goes to the produce merchant and buys wheat for 4s. 9d. a bushel -3fd . a bushel more-bu t for that additional margin he is financed, he obtains storage, and is given transport facilities. Many poultry-farmers are not in a position to pay cash; they have no storage accommodation, and owing to petrol rationing, they .are unable to transport the wheat. Therefore, they are unable to take advantage of the lower price by purchasing wheat in truck lots. I have already spoken to the Minister for Commerce( Mr recently arrived in Australia. Of this Scully) who was sympathetic. He has promised to go into the matter further. I ask the Government to consider this problem, not only from the point of view of the poultry-farmers, but also as an aid mated that it intends to hold, for this to the disposal of wheat stocks. In addipurpose, part of the 300 tons which Tastion to the question of wheat, there is also the necessity to provide by-products in larger -quantities and at a reasonable price. Commerce) 14.14] I admit that quite a lot of what has been said by the honortons which is particularly needed in Tasable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) is in accordance with facts. I did give to the honourable member an assurance that I would take the matter of the poultry industry up with the Australian Wheat Board, to see if it were not possible to arrive at some equitable arrangement whereby poultry-farmers could secure fodder at a reasonable price. However, distribution costs must be considered. I have been advised that in some parts of Australia the price of poultry feed is excessive. Another matter that has to be borne in mind, however, is the over-production of eggs. Officers of the Trade and Customs Department and also of the Commerce Department are inquiring into this subject. Recently, plants have been installed for the drying and pulping of eggs, but we have only a limited egg market in the United Kingdom and the shipping problem is still most acute. As I see it, the outlook in respect of egg production is not very satisfactory, particularly as production is increasing at an alarming rate. has been a decrease recently. mation conveyed to me. I am informed that there has been a definite increase in the major egg producing areas of the Commonwealth. However, I shall hear the honourable gentleman's representations in mind and take up the matter of wheat supplies with the Australian Wheat Board. to the notice of the Government certain unsatisfactory factors in relation to a shipment of 1250 tons of potash that has quantity, 300 tons were destined for Tasmania, hut the Commonwealth Government, having decided to store 600 tons of potash in Melbourne, has intimanian interests have bought and paid for, and in respect of which they are incurring storage charges. It seems unfair that part of the reserve stock which the 'Commonwealth Government desires to hold should be taken from the 300 mania. If part of the Tasmanian supply is to be held in Melbourne, who will pay the storage charges? I also wish to know who will meet other expenses, including interest on the outlay? We appreciate the position of the authorities, but we feel that the Tasmanian people are not being dealt with justly. ject falls within the scope of the Department of Supply and Development, but 1 shall make inquiries, and, if necessary, will submit the details to the Minister for Supply and Development. and the four or five importers concerned are anxious to know what the Commonwealth Government intends to do.",45,Comes Appointment Op Committee Poultry Industry Potas H Supplies

171,Mr Beck,"The matter is important,I wish now to refer briefly to the unsatisfactory conditions that prevail in regard to the rationing of tobacco. The new rationing scheme provides for supplies on the basis of the September purchases of last year, plus 10 per cent. Consequently, if a large buyer obtained bis supplies say, every two months last year, and a two-monthly period ended in, say, August or October, he would have had no September purchases on which a ration could be fixed. It seems, therefore, services branch of the Army in calling that by fixing the ration on September purchases the authorities were not sufficiently far-seeing. I ask the Government to investigate the position for, as things are, some purchasers in. Tasmania who obtained no supplies at all last September, have not been able to obtain any supplies, whereas other purchasers, who may have obtained double quantities last September, are able to get abundant stocks. Another difficulty arises in the case of firms obtaining their supplies from firms on the mainland. I have in mind the case of a purchaser who, in September, 1940, bought a total of 22,550 cigarettes from Messrs. W. Eeddan and Company, 330 Flinders-lane, Melbourne. Instead of this purchaser being able to obtain a ration based on his purchases of last September, plus 10 per cent., he has been able to obtain only 5,050 cigarettes. The Melbourne suppliers appear to have met all the demands of their Victorian customers, and to have disregarded the needs of their Tasmanian customers. I am sure that the Prime Minister( Mr might have ended fatally and been the Curtin) -who represents one of the, less populous States of the Commonwealth, must become sick and tired of hearing about the way the more populous States and the larger businesses in those States, treat the other States and the smaller businesses of those States. I urge the Government to make an immediate review of the basis of the tobacco rationing scheme, with the object of introducing a more equitable arrangement. bring to the notice of the Minister for the Army (Mir. Forde) a matter of urgentimportance concerning the administration of the medical branch of his department. A report has just been published in the Sydney Morning Herald that a young woman suffering from shock died a day or two ago because she was not able to obtain the attention of a doctor. Her own medical attendant had been called up for military service and, apparently, no other doctor was available to attend to her. I have made repeated complaints to the Minister for the Army and to his predecessor in office concerning the action of the medical up so many doctors for service in military camps. I am given to understand that whereas fewer than 500,000 men are in uniform at home and abroad, one half of the medical practitioners of the country have been called up for service, leaving the other half of them to meet the medical needs of the remaining 6,500,000 people in Australia. It appears that the military authorities have called up doctors in utter disregard of the interests of their patients. When a young doctor in the electorate of Yarra was called up he was told that his patients could be attended to by doctors in the surrounding districts, but the other doctors, after attending to their own patients, could give only the fag end of their time to the patients of the doctor in camp. I am credibly informed, and I am sure that I could obtain specific information without difficulty, that two young women who were recently confined and were patients of this doctor nearly lost their lives because they could not secure the attention of their doctor. These cases subject of coronial inquiries similar to the one in New South Wales. The Minister for the Army will, I hope, give me an assurance that the present procedure in connection with the call up of doctors will not be continued. Most of these Army doctors have to attend a sick parade each morning, and then they have nothing to do for the rest of the day. It ought to be possible, even for some of the antiquated medical gentlemen who occupy high positions at Army Head-quarters in Melbourne, to devise a scheme whereby one doctor could attend to the needs of three battalions of troops,, instead of requiring three doctors to do the same work. The soldiers are supposed",46,Comes Appointment Op Committee Poultry Industry Potas H Supplies
172,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [4.22],"Ito be medically fit when they are drafted into camp, and they should require less medical attention than an equal number of people in the general community. The military authorities are acting without any regard to the health needs of the community. Unless the Minister for the Army gives a general direction along the lines that I have indicated there will be other tragedies. I am satisfied that some of the people who are in command of the medical staff of the military forces are determined to have their own way and to force young doctors to serve their time in camps regardless of the interests of civil patients. I have supplied the Minister for the Army with abundant evidence in support of the charges which I have made, and I hope that action will be taken to prevent a repetition of the tragedy which has impelled me to speak on this subject now. The needs of our public hospitals and our industrial communities are very great, and are of equal importance to the needs of the young men who are called up for compulsory military service and sent into camp classed as physically fit. I make no reference to the number of doctors who are being sent overseas with the Australian Imperial Force. But medical men should not be sent into camp in Australia against their own wishes and better judgment in order to serve for only one hour a day examining a few men on sick parade, and who play cards for the rest of the day in order to fill in time. I refer now to the fact that there was an outbreak of scurvy at Darwin recently. The cause of scurvy is well known; sailors in Captain Cook's day knew how to cure themselves, and it is a grave reflection upon somebody that scurvy should be allowed to break out at Darwin. letter from a medical practitioner who says that the outbreak occurred there recently. any rate, the health authorities at Darwin should have seen that the food supplied to the people was sufficiently varied to prevent an outbreak. I shall hand this letter to the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) immediately, and he can inquire into the matter. Minister) [4.29] -in reply-The matters which have been referred to by honourable members will receive the ful l and immediate consideration of the appropriate Ministers. I have no knowledge of an outbreak of scurvy at Darwin, and the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) informs me that he knows nothing of it. Only last week I held a long consultation with the Administrator of the Northern Territory, and the matter was not mentioned by him. I shall endeavour to ascertain the facts of the case. The Minister for the Army will give immediate attention to the allegation that the health needs of the civil population have heen neglected as the result of the Department of the Army calling up medical men for service in military camps.
