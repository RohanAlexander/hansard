Is it a fact that the marginal costs of moving goods or stock by rail are sometimes very low in comparison with total costs? Is it a fact, therefore, that great national advantages can be obtained if the railways are used more effectively to cope with seasonal conditions in various parts of Australia? Does this sometimes involve interstate as well as intrastate movements? Would it not be convenient for the Commonwealth Government, in its efforts to foster exports, to subsidise operations of this kind? Can the Minister tell me specifically what negotiations have been undertaken with the various State railway authorities in an effort to co-ordinate them in a plan for this matter of great national advantage, particularly when seasonal conditions are so variable in different parts of Australia? gentleman raises a question of Commonwealth subsidy in the transport of stock, this is rather a question of policy which I do not think should be dealt with at question time. I am afraid I cannot tell him what discussions have taken place between the Railways Commissioners of the Commonwealth and the States regarding the coordination of stock movements. I do know that Commonwealth Railways has kept its freight rates deliberately low. In fact over some sections of the Commonwealth railways freight is transported at a loss. It has refrained from increasing freight rates in recent times in accordance with other freight movements because it realised that pastoralists have been suffering from the effects of drought. Commonwealth Railways is making in this sense a very real contribution in respect of the problem of transporting stock to or from drought stricken areas. Minister for Primary Industry relates to the fishing industry. Has the Minister seen sugaddressed to the Minister for Social gestions to the effect that a papal bull may shortly be issued which will cause a change in the dietary habits of some millions of Australians by promoting the consumption of meat on seven days a week?

I would like to give the House some explanation why it has been necessary to introduce this Bill. I want to set out the course which the Government is following in reladon to this matter and the problem of which this Bill is a manifestation. Some weeks ago I introduced a Bill to declare that rates of tax for the presentfinancialyear. That Bill comprehended both the proposed special rates and the additional 2b per cent, levy. The Bill was passed by this House but the Opposition voted against it. As I recall the debate, the substantial objection of the Opposition was to the additional 21 per cent, levy on individuals. The Bill then went to the Senate but it has not been accepted there. In fact it did not get beyond the second reading stage in that chamber. A motion for the second reading was defeated, the Opposition being joined by one Government senator to produce that defeat. This rejection by the Senate presents a series of problems unless the matter can now be dealt with satisfactorily in some other fashion. The Government is trying to meet the difficulty created and at the same time enable the Senate to give what would appear to be a more faithful expression of the majority view held on each of the matters contained in the former Bill. It seems clear enough from the record of the debates on the Bill in the Senate that it met the fate it did because it dealt with both of the matters I have referred to in the one measure. It also seems clear that if there had been separate Bills dealing with each of those matters there would have been a majority of the Senate voting in favour of both proposals. The Government has accordingly decided to follow the course of submitting two separate Bills. The Bill now before the House proposes the imposition of the 2i per cent, additional tax on individuals.

67,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"conclusion in this House before the first Bill the Government asked them to shoulder. is passed through all stages in both Houses, because the second Bill will amend the first. That is why we are following the course that I am now outlining to the House. BeforeI say anything about the formal provisions of this BillI want to mention some of the extremely grave effects that would follow if the present measure is not passed in the form proposed, or if its passage is further delayed. There would inevitably be delays in the issue of notices of assessment and there could be serious effects on revenue collections for the year. The administrative difficulties that would be encountered would certainly result in much inconvenience to taxpayers through delays in advising them of their liabilities. There would also be quite heavy additional costs in the collection of tax. Should Parliament fail to agree to the additional tax of 2b per cent, for individuals, possibly as many as 200,000 assessments now awaiting issue will have to be re-calculated. These are assessments which involve provisional tax for 1965-66 including the proposed 2 i per cent, additional tax. In relation to these assessments there could be serious delays in the collection of tax of the order of £250,000,000. As to instalment deductions from salaries and wages, a most serious situation could develop. It would presumably be necessary to adjust instalment deductions. New scales would have to be worked out. There would be extreme problems associated with the advent of decimal currency which existing scales were, after much forward planning, devised to overcome. There would be a loss of revenue for the year of many millions of pounds. I do not question the Opposition's right, or its sincerity, when it objects to the additional tax, but I do recall that public reaction to the Budget was as favourable as any reaction to any one of the series of Budget. I have introduced, or indeed to any Budget that I can recall. It is no exaggeration to say that individual taxpayers had expected rather heavier taxation than was imposed. For the most part, knowing the purposes to be served by the additional taxation, they undertook with equanimity the relatively small additional burden that They saw the necessity for it and this was clearly explained to them. Therefor, I ask the Parliament to acknowledge the responsibilities that the Government faces in its Budget programme by giving this Bill a speedy passage. PerhapsI should add in passing, Sir, that the decision of the Senate and its conduct in relation to the tax legislation raises, I believe, an important matter of constitutional principle and practice in the relations between the two Houses concerning financial matters. I do not propose this morning to elaborate on that or to attempt to debate the matter fully. But I believe that it is desirable that the issues raised engage the attention of this House on a future occasion. I turn now to the formal provisions of the Bill. Apart from some minor adjustments associated with the proposed change to decimal currency the general rates of tax payable by individuals are very much the same as last year. Individuals are, however, to be called upon to pay additional tax of 2b per cent, of the tax calculated in accordance with the general rates. The adjustments to the general rates will not increase the tax payable at those rates in relation to taxable incomes up to £24,000. As to taxable incomes in excess of this amount there will be a slight increase in tax payable but it will be only £1 for each £3,000 of taxable income over £24,000. The Bill expresses all proposed rates as percentages of taxable income instead of, as in the past, as so many shillings and pence, or so many pence, per £1. This will mean that on the changeover to decimal currency the rates will represent so many cents per dollar. Another feature of the Bill is that it discards the old description of the tax on incomes in favour of a simpler description. Instead of being known as income tax and social services contribution the levy is to be known simply as income tax. Apart from the matters that I have mentioned, the measure does not vary in any significant respect from the Act declaring the rates of tax for the financial year 1964-65. I commend the Bill to the House and for the reasons that I have stated I ask for a speedy passage for it. Leave granted for the debate to continue. Mr Speaker, we are prepared to assist ( Mr Deputy SpeakerMr P. E. Lucock.) the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) in giving the Bill a speedy passage if it is to be passed but I must disappoint him by indicating that we intend to vote against it. I repeat briefly the reasons that we gave previously for our opposition to the earlier tax legislation. First, we do not believe that there ought to have been any increases in taxes. Allan, Indeed, in view of the present state of the Barnes, C. E. economy I believe that there is a rather Bridges-MaxweU, C W.

I . distribution of the additional burden as Fox, between all taxpayers. I do not want to Gibbs, W. T. traverse those arguments any more fully at Giles, this stage. Like the Treasurer I consider that there are certain fascinating aspects of the treatment of the Government's tax legislation in another place. Like him I believe that in the very near future we in this House should consider the relations between this chamber and the other place on financial matters, with particular attention to what those relations should be. I find at least some elements of paradox in the treatment by a House that calls itself a House of review of Bills that, under the terms of section 53 of the Constitution, it may not amend. It can reject them but it may not amend them. This seems at least to imply that when that section was put into the Constitution in the historical context of the situation at the end of last century-the Constitution did not become operative until 1901-som e limitations on the powers of the Senate with respect to measures of this kind were thought to be necessary. I hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that Mr Speaker, as the custodian of the rights of this House, will look into this problem in the future. As I have said, we offer no barrier to the passage of this Bill through all stages today if it is to be passed, though we intend to oppose the measure itself.

68,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [10.29].,"AIR NAVIGATION (CHARGES) BILL 1965. Second Reading. Debate resumed from 3rd December (vide page 3588), on motion by Mr charges will still only have reached about FairbairnThat the Bill be now read a second time. The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. Late in 1961, Mr R. M. Ansett took full page advertisements in newspapers and sent letters to all honourable members setting out his requirements for civil aviation for the following 10 years. Accordingly, the letter was sent to the Parliamenment deficits. In 1963-64, the last year for tary Draftsman to produce a bill which ordained among other things, that air navigation charges should not be increased at a greater rate than 10 per cent, per annuni. The present Bill is in accordance with Mr Ansett's requirements and the statutory provisions made pursuant to them in 1961. It is increasing air navigation charges this year 10 per cent, above those applying last year. Most of the expenditure for providing air navigation facilities on the on buses, and occasionally on ferry services. ground, by radio and through meteorological services are met from ordinary Consolidated Revenue and not from air navigation charges. Lastfinancialyear air navigalion cost the Australian people £20,700,000 and air navigation charges provided £2,220,000 towards that sum. Last year £2,400,000 more was spent on air navigation purposes and £350,000 more was raised in air navigation charges. It is estimated that the additional charges from this Bill this year will be £620,000. It is to by air to an entirely disproportionate extent. be expected that the air navigation expenditure this year will go up by about £3 million. The increase in air navigation charges last year, it will be noted, amounted to only one-seventh of the increase in air navigation expenditure. This year the increase in air navigation charges once again will be a small fraction of the increase in air navigation expenditure. Until 1971 it is not possible under this Parliament's obligations to Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. to increase the air navigation charges at a greater rate than 10 per cent, per annum. During the currency of the agreement so far the percentage of air navigation expenditravel on expense accounts or railway ture met from air navigation charges has increased from 8.9 per cent, to 10.7 per cent. One would expect that by the end of the Ansett decade the percentage of air navigation expenses met from air navigation 12b per cent, or 13 per cent. Accordingly, the Australian people will continue to make much larger provision for air transport than they make for any other form of transport. In fact, they will make more provision for civil aviation than they do for all other transport combined. Honourable members frequently hear references to the subsidies involved for rail transport in Australia through State Governwhich the Commonwealth Grants Commission has reported on State railway deficits, the sum total of the deficits amounted to less than £114 million. It is true that there are some other budgetary provisions made in some States concerning the amortisation of loans for developmental railways. In addition to the railway subsidies there are losses which are borne by State Governments on trams, where they still run, and Australian taxpayers pay more to maintain civil aviation than all other forms of transport. This is all the more remarkable when one considers that most freight in Australia still goes by surface transport. We spend very much less on roads, railways, wharves, shipping and urban transport than we do on civil aviation which carries so very much less freight than any of the other forms of transport. Furthermore, this Parliament subsidises travellers The average subsidy last year on every air trip was £4. Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes -On every passenger? who embarked. flight? flight. This is a very large subsidy indeed for a form of transport which most passengers use on government warrants or expense accounts. Very few rail passengers warrants.

Very few people indeed travel across Bass Strait by sea on Government warrants or expense accounts. But in air transport, the percentage of people whose journeys are financed that way is by far the highest of any form of transport in Australia. It is as well, I think, to consider this aspect when one hears the annual complaint about the rise in air fares. Air fares are not the same burden to the traveller as fares in any other form of transport. Fares have been put up a very great deal in recent years. Between December 1957 and October of this year, air fares for tourist passengers were put up by 57 per cent, and those for first class passengers by 44 per cent. The yearly increases have varied between 3 per cent, and 10 per cent. The increases of 57 per cent, and 44 per cent, for tourist and first class passengers respectively are the compound increases in the last eight years. The increase in fares has primarily been caused by the Government's obligation to ensure that Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. pays a 10 per cent, dividend after all its ordinary commercial obligations have been met. The principle was stated in these terms by Senator Paltridge in September 1961In order to meet reasonable private enterprise standards, Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. must bave a target of the order of 10 per cent, after -tax and a reasonable allocation to reserve. Every increase which has been permitted to Ansett-A.N.A. and which has been required of Trans-Australia Airlines has flowed from the fact that Ansett Transport Industries Ltd, of which Ansett-A.N.A. is a subsidiary, must pay a 10 per cent, dividend after tax and a reasonable allocation to reserve, on the sum total of its operations, not merely on its air operations. For example, if Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. had to carry losses on a new television subsidiary then allowance would have to be made with respect to its air subsidiary to counteract those losses. I quote the following from the annual report of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. for the year 1964-65Establishment finance and costs in our television subsidiary-particularl y in reference to prodividend for A.T.I, as a whole. I reiterate grammes-ha s been much higher than envisaged. that the increase in air navigation charges The net profit that is of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd is after writing off substantial operating losses for the 11 months' commercial operations of Channel0 Melbourne. In the present financial year, Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. will have to pay off its losses on South Pacific Airlines of New Zealand, which was owned, as to 49 per cent, of its shares, by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd., and which has now gone into liquidation. The Commonwealth's guarantee is not to Ansett-A.N.A.; it is to Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. Accordingly, through licences to operate, through licences to import, through leases on Commonwealth aerodromes, through a restriction of air navigation charges, and through a multiplicity of other civil aviation provisions, the Commonwealth ensures that the sum total of the operations of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. in television, hotel keeping, tourism and road transport, will all be conducted at such a level as to provide a 10 per cent, dividend. The financial accounts of Ansett-A.N.A. -formerl y Australian National Airways Pty. Ltd -ar e not presented to Parliament. The financial accounts of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd., the holding company for this and some 50 other companies, are not presented to the Parliament. The Auditor General does not audit the accounts of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. Only 60 per cent, of the investments of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. are in airline operations. By restricting air navigation charges, with which this Bill is concerned, and by a host of other concessions, the Commonwealth ensures that the 60 per cent, of operations are kept so profitable as to counteract any losses, operational or establishment, in the host of other activities for which Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. is the holding company. I have made this analysis because the complaint is so often made that air navigation charges are responsible for the increase in air fares in Australia. The Commonwealth decides whether air companies will operate, where they will operate, with what they will operate and on what terms they will operate. All these matters are determined in such a way as to ensure this 10 per cent, this year will be £620,000. The increased income that the air companies will make as a result of the 6 per cent, increase in their fares, which was permitted to AnsettA.N.A. by the Government and imposed on T.A.A. by the Government last October, will be of the order of four million pounds. One must dispose of this suggestion that air fares are going up because this Parliament increases air navigation charges. The increase on air navigation charges permitted by this Parliament has been limited for 10 years expiring in 1971. By that time the air navigation charges will still meet no more than one eighth of the air navigation expenses paid in Australia-the expenses, not the capital. Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes -Ho w much? per cent. Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes -And when will that percentage be reached? reached in 1971. In the first year of the present system, 1961-62, air navigation charges met 8.9 per cent, of air navigation expenditure. Last year they met 10.7 per cent, of air navigation expenditure. My estimate is that by mid-1971 the percentage will be 12i or 13. We must expect that air navigation charges will meet merely oneeighth of the cost of providing services for air travellers-radi o and meteorological services and the running costs of the airports themselves. This is the most indulged form of transport in Australia. It is the one to wbich we ourselves mostly resort, and we resort to it because we do so on warranton what would be called in private enterprise ""expense account"". I am not disparaging air transport. AllI wish to point out is that air travellers, mainly as they are ness and governments in Australia would expense account travellers, are indulged by the Commonwealth Parliament to an extent that travellers by all other forms of transport are not indulged. I have constantly stressed the necessity to tion is distorted in the whole of Australia. co-ordinate and to rationalise transport serGovernments are primarily responsible for vices in Australia. Some of them are State Government services. Some of them are Commonwealth Government services. Some of them are a combination of private enterprise and State Government or a combination of private enterprise and Commonwealth Government services. There is, however, no machinery for co-ordinating the services overall. None of these services could be provided on the surface, around the coast or in the air without Government prescription of one kind or another. Of all forms of transport, however, air transport is the one that is most completely controlled by governments. It is impossible to run an an airline without importing aircraft. The Commonwealth Government decides whether an aircraft will be imported and on what terms it will be imported. Again, it is impossible to operate an airline without using an aerodrome, and this Government operates every aerodrome in Australia. We know that it is in the highest degree unlikely that we will ever be able to operate air services in Australia except with aircraft imported under Commonwealth licence or without the permission of the Commonwealth to operate from the aerodromes it builds. Accordingly the capacity to regulate transport in the air is greater than in any otherfieldof transport. The degree of control is already much greater than in any other form of transport. The greatest difficulty in transport today is in the cities. The expense of transport in Australian cities is much greater now than it ever was, not only in terms of dollars and cents for the fuel or the fares, but still more in the time lost. It takes longer to get into or through an Australian capital city now than it ever did despite new freeways and better roads. If governments are to subsidise or rationalise transport in Australia the great field that should attract their attention is urban transport. In this Bill we are dealing with a form of transport which is pampered, indulged or considered more than any other. It is clearly a very important form of transport. Busibe crippled without the splendid internal air services that we have. It is, however, appropriate in considering this annual Air Navigation Charges Bill to consider the extent to which the general transport situathis. We do not oppose this Bill.

We do not in any way subsidise the construction of our national highways, although the cost of highways is a major factor in our price structure. We do not subsidise other forms of transport, but we extend to civil aviation this excellent subsidy, which last year amounted to £18.5 million. The payment of this subsidy means that difference.

An aircraft has a fairly limited life and we know, in point of fact, that we cannot extend our air services without increasing our air fleets. Our air fleets can use per passenger mile something Uke 15 or 20 tunes as much oil or fuel as a train would. With the aircraft industry, especially as it is in Australia at the moment, any increase in traffic requires an almost proportionate increase in national outlay.

The posikept in Consolidated Revenue and less than tion in Australia is quite different from that 30 per cent, was used for roads. This ratio in countries where airline companies have been in operation for many more years than they have been in Australia. Therefore, so as to foster good relations and good conditions so far as flying is concerned, and to encourage people to travel by air, the Government has contributed largely to the facilities that are necessary to make flying, above everything else, safe in Australia. It has been very successful. I believe every honourable member will hope, with me, that this safety record will continue because it is that which makes airlines profitable. Safety influences more people to travel by aeroplane and our safety record in Australia is good. I listened with great care to the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Jones). He said most of the money spent on civil aviation was spent in the big cities. Then he made a plea for Newcastle. I think he said that Newcastle was the sixth largest city in Australia. Therefore, he made a plea for another city. So far as this money which is being collected is concerned, I would like to see more of it being made available for aerodromes in isolated places. On the other hand, we have to realise that while the Government will collect more money it will still be spending a tremendous amount of money on its present programmea lot more money than it collects. Nevertheless, I believe that, progressively, aerodromes in country areas should be taken over by the Government so that they should be made operational for larger aeroplanes. I am particularly concerned with places like Mildura, Swan Hill and Kerang where there are aerodromes. I am asking that an increased amount of Government money be spent on these aerodromes to encourage flying into these decentralised areas.

Now more than 80 per cent, of the money is used for roads and less than 20 per cent, is kept in Consolidated Revenue. Without stretching for too long the tolerance that you have given on this subject, but being anxious to speak, although perhaps for not as long as the honourable member for Newcastle, I want to say that Labour's policy has changed a bit in this regard. I want to quote from ""Hansard"" of 9th December 1948. The Prime Minister of Australia at that time, the late Mr Chifley, saidAlthough from time to time claims are made that the whole of the proceeds of the petrol tax should be devoted to road-making and maintenance, 1 do not consider that any government in this country will ever agree to that being done. That was said by the great leader of the Labour Party. So far as this Bill is concerned, from what has been said, the Opposition supports it. As it is a Government measure my party also supports it. I hope that it will have a swift passage and will prove of value to civil aviation. with pleasure to support this Bill, perhaps with greater pleasure than usual, because of the infiltration of the Christmas spirit into the chamber. Everybody seems to be agreeing on one line of thinking in their concern at the magnitude of the subsidy extended to airlines in Australia by the Department of Civil Aviation. There is no doubt, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) said, that civil aviation in Australia receives the greatest subsidy per medium of departmental accounts than perhaps the whole of the other transport systems in Australia put together. I certainly agree with his observation, and indeed, with the observations of the honourable members for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid",32,Pairs
89,Mr Bosman (St. George) [11.39],"I riseIt is interesting to note that throughout the world many governments found themselves in extreme difficulties and lost tremendous amounts of money over a period of time in the field of aviation. Not the least of these was the United Kingdom Government. However, it was obvious that our Government was aware of this situation in the early 1950's, when there were many problems. But now we have a balanced and rational airlines system. This is conceded today on both sides of the House. The co-ordination is excellent. The airlines point. I notice from reading this current are operating in an acceptable financial manner although some aspersions have been cast on Mr Ansett as to just how much he is making out of the aircraft activities he is engaged in as compared with his other Operations. position seems to be balanced up to the point at which we come to the Department of Civil Aviation. The Department, as I indicated earlier, no doubt carried out its function in a reasonably capable manner. It must have done so to have been able to bring the airweights of up to 25,000 lb. The second is lines system to the situation in which we find it today. But now we are ready to move into another phase, although we are shackled somewhat by the Airlines Agreements Act. This Act was renewed in 1961 in adverse circumstances because of the economic situation at that time. Aircraft passenger traffic had dropped quite substantially and no doubt the agreement was negotiated on the basis of the trend of figures in that year. The situation now is that the Department has to have a look at the question of running the airline system throughout Australia on an economical basis, possibly as a business undertaking, and the people who use the airlines must be prepared to pay for them. The Government has collected money from these people over a period of time per medium of these airport facility charges and navigational charges. I wonder if this is the right manner of going about it. Some doubt has been cast on this procedure by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and I must admit that I do not entirely disagree with him as to whether or not the increases in air fares which followed the increased charges levied by the Government by way of air navigation charges were just intended to 14. The Sydney-Melbourne route, for to cover the increases, or whether a little has been added for the balance sheet. I am not entirely prepared to disagree with his observations on this point. I wonder, again, whether we should now consider making some form of direct levy on the passenger traffic in the airlines system, bearing in mind that we are obliged to provide certain facilities under the airlines agreement. Those people who use the airlines gain great benefit from them. It may be interesting to consider the method of levying these navigational charges at this legislation that, first, the Director-General of Civil Aviation will have power to fix what is called the "" all-up "" weight of the aircraft which are used on Australian air routes. For instance, the Fokker FriendNevertheless, the whole ship is listed as having an all-up weight of 42,000 lb. The Viscount 800 has an all-up weight of 72,500 lb.; the Electra is assessed at 116,000 lb.; and the Boeing 727 at 152,000 lb. The method which the Department is using is to place the various weight groups into four distinctive categories. The first category is those aircraft with all-up those with an all-up weight of between 25,000 lb. and 50,000 lb. The third is those with an all-up weight of between 50,000 lb. and 100,000 lb. The fourth group contains those aircraft with an all-up weight in excess of 100,000 lb. For each of these four categories, there is a unit charge per 1,000 lb. For the first group the unit charge is 6.58 pence per 1,000 lb. or part thereof. The figure for the second group is 10.24 pence per 1,000 lb., or part thereof. The third group is fixed at 13.17 pence per 1,000 lb. or part thereof. The fourth group is assessed at 15.37 pence per 1,000 lb. or part thereof. Multiplying those charges by the all-up weight of various aircraft we find that the basic unit charged for a Friendship would be £1 15s. lOd. to take off from an airport. For a Viscount it would be £4 0s. 2d., an Electra £7 4s. 9d. and for a Boeing 727 it would be £10 6s. 3d. For the Boeing 707, an international aircraft, it would be £18 3s. 4d. This is the unit charge, but the Department has a factoring system which it applies to all the airline routes. The factor for a particular route might be any number up instance, is given a factor of four, and for a Friendshirj. which, in fact, rarely flies the route, the unit charge of £1 ISs. lOd. would be multiplied by four, giving a figure of £7 3s. 4d. The figure for the modern Boeing 727 would be four times £10 6s. 3d., or £41 5s. for every flight between Sydney and Melbourne. Snr Wilfred Kent Hughes -I s that for the complete trip? landing-the complete trip. For the SydneyPerth route the factor is 13, so that for a Boeing 727 the figure would be 13 times £10 6s. 3d., or £134 ls. 3d. for every flight between Sydney and Perth. If we go a little further with our calculations and consider a Boeing 727 on a flight between Sydney and Melbourne with a full load, the cost per passenger would be about 10s. If we go even further and divide that cost by the number of miles flown we find that it would cost about one farthing per mile per passenger. These charges are based on the facilities offered by the Department of Civil Aviation. They include the safety facilities, such as beacons, instrument landing systems and so on, and also, of course, the runways and terminals. This one farthing per mile would cover a passenger from the time he arrived in the airport area at the point of embarkation until he departed from the airport area at his destination. A charge of one farthing per mile or 10s. for the trip between Sydney and Melbourne seems to me a very reasonable charge for the safety and other facilities available. We are obviously bound for some years to come by the Airlines Agreement Act to restrict any increases of air navigation charges to a maximum of 10 per cent, per annum, but I wonder whether the Government should consider some means of levying a charge on the people who use the aircraft instead of giving a subsidy from the general revenue. Under the present system the whole of our population subsidises the people who travel by air and who gain great benefits from the advances and huge expenditure that have been made in civil aviation in Australia. I suggest to the Minister for National Development ( Mr Government agreed to this because it Fairbairn), who is now at the table, that the Government might consider a direct tax on passengers. It could use the airline companies to collect the money, and the fact that the levy was being made could be specifically stated on the tickets issued by the companies. Many countries impose an individual tax on users of airports. Apparently this has been found distasteful or unsatisfactory in Australia, or perhaps it has been considered that there is no requirement for it. We must remember, however, that the Department of Civil Aviation has introduced developments over the years which have brought the Australian airline system up to a high standard, and it is time now for the Department to look at its own internal financial system. We should endeavour to lower the charge made on the general revenue of the country and use some more positive means of obtaining the necessary revenue for the Department. National Development) [11.50] I will see that the representations made during this debate are brought to the attention of my colleagues, the Minister for Civil Aviation (Senator Henty) and the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Freeth). I want to correct briefly an allegation made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). He said it was possible to include costs other than air travel costs when calculating the fares to be charged by the airline companies. We know that this is completely inaccurate. It would be quite impossible, for example, for the cost of developing a television station to be added in when calculating reasonable air fares, because Ansett-A.N.A. is an entity complete in itself. When it makes a profit, of course, it pays the profit into the accounts of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd., but it is a completely separate entity and its fares are set by the Minister after considering the costs that have to be faced by the airline companies. Another allegation was made that these increased fares were forced on Trans-Australia Airlines. This, of course, was not so. Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett-A.N.A. made a joint submission to the Government asking that fares be increased and the realised that since the last fare increase there have been two major increases in costs. One of them was increased air navigation",33,Pairs

In fact if it had not been for the fare increase T.A.A. would have been showing either a marginal profit or a marginal loss.

Honourable members will recall that the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act was designed to meet special conditions of peacetime service not hitherto encountered in Austrahan experience. Its broad purpose is to provide repatriation cover for serving members of the forces whose service outside Australia in warlike operations or in disturbed areas involves them in hazards additional to those of normal peacetime service. Eligibility under the Act has therefore been provided in respect of death or incapacity arising out of service whilst allotted for special duty in a proclaimed special area. Areas may be proclaimed and allotment made with retrospective effect* The benefits provided are generally the same as those in respect of the two World Warsf' and the Korea and Malaya operations. The' operation of this legislation has been generally satisfactory. It is, however, now pro* posed to make changes which will have the* effect of extending eligibility under the Act in two respects. First, although such a situation has not occurred up to the present, there is a possibility that members of the forces serving outside Australia could suffer incapacity or death as a result of the action of hostile forces, but would not at present have immediate access to repatriation benefits. For example, a serviceman involved in an action extending beyond a declared special area would not, if incapacitated in that action, presently be covered by the Act. There is also the possibility that service personnel not allotted for special duty in a special area may become unexpectedly involved in isolated incidents. The Bill therefore provides repatriation cover for those involved in contact with hostile forces outside a special area in circumstances of the kind I have mentioned. It is proposed that the incapacity in respect of which benefits will be available will include any subsequent incapacity or death arising therefrom which is attributable to the serviceman's contact with hostile forces. Second, qualifying service under the Act is at present related to presence in a special area whilst allotted for special duty. It is now proposed that the commencement and termination of qualifying service be related to the times of allotment to and from special duty so that the cover will extend for both forward and return journeys to the period during transit between Australia or the point of allotment outside Australia, as the",35,Pairs

The effect of this will be that the period of qualifying service under the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act will be the same as was the case in respect of the Korea and Malaya operations for which provision is made: under the Repatriation Act. The Government has decided to make this amendment retrospective to the commencement of the principal Act which came into operation on 28th May 1963. The proposals in the Bill are designed to give a more extensive repatriation cover to servicemen engaged in warlike operations outside Australia, and will no doubt be well received by serving members of the forces. I commend the Bill to the House. Leave granted for the debate to continue.

I say first that we position which was put forward by the regret the fact that the Bill has been preOpposition sented to this House only this morning and for servicemen leaving Australia to serve that we are asked to proceed to debate it overseas in the specially defined areas. straight away. The consideration of this measure in another place was completed yesterday. I have a roneoed copy of the second reading speech just made by the Minister for Health( Mr Swartz) who made perfectly clear that members of the represents in this chamber the Minister for Australian Labour Party who make up the Repatriation (Senator McKellar). However, fied that it covers completely all the requirewe on this side of the House have had ments that should be incorporated in an Act only the most limited time to consider an to provide benefits for servicemen who are important measure directly affecting memrequired to serve overseas.

I think it would be as well to recall the Government has adopted a policy of conevents that have led up to the presentation scription, all personnel who enlist or are conof this Bill to the House only in the dying scripted for one of the three armed Services, hours of the sessional period. Honourable whether serving overseas or not, should have members will recall that some time ago full cover under the Repatriation Act. I am when the measure was being considered in sure that the Minister for Health, who was another place the Australian Labour Party formerly Minister for Repatriation, must proposed an amendment because it conappreciate that because of the commitments siders that sufficient coverage for repatriain which Australia has become involved in tion benefits is not being extended by the recent years there are far too many acts Government to members of the forces who affecting Australian ex-servicemen and leave this country for service overseas in servicemen. It is the contention of honorwhat the Government has described as warable members on this side of the chamber like operations. The amendment proposed that all this legislation should be overhauled by the Opposition in another place was in order to ensure complete cover not only designed to provide complete coverage from for ex-servicemen of the First and Second the time of departure from the last port World Wars, those who served in Korea and of call when leaving Australia to the time those who have been allotted for special of arrival at the first port of call on return service in specially defined areas overseas as to Australia. We beheve that this is a matter only of common justice. The Government refused to recognise this when it introduced the Bill some time ago in another place. The Opposition then had time to consider the measure. It was able to ascertain on that occasion that this cover would not be provided for servicemen who were leaving Australia on their way to what are now described in the legislation as special areas overseas. The Opposition felt that the coverage should apply, as I have already indicated, from the time that a serviceman who had been allotted for special service overseas left from the last port of call until he reached the first port of call on his return to Australia. The Government postponed the legislation in another place to give further consideration to this in another place that this coverage should, in common justice, be provided Although we do not intend to oppose the passage of this Bill, I think it should be Opposition of this Parliament are not satisoccasion that, particularly now that the",36,Repatriation Special Overseas Service Bill 1965

The honourable member for Lang on that occasion was speaking on the repatriation measure which had been introduced by the then Minister for Repatriation who is now Minister for Health and should be given to all servicemen who are who is now sitting at the table. We felt serving in any area that has been defined then, and we still believe, that there was by the Government where it is possible that a need to consider complete repatriation they might be required to engage in hostile coverage and benefits for all members of action.

We do not been prepared merely to describe these press this point at this stage, but we suggest places as areas in which Australian servicethat it is a matter that should engage the men can be engaged in warlike action.

The amendments as incorporated porates the amendment proposed by the in this Bill by the Minister for Repatriation F. 14706/65 -R -[141 ] Opposition in another place. The Bill will now provide a measure of cover for servicemen who are assigned to special overseas service in a specially defined area. They will be covered for repatriation benefits no matter what means are used to transport them to an area overseas. I do not feel that the Bill provides adequate cover for all personnel who serve overseas. I have indicated would happen in the event of a serviceman happen in this situation. If repatriation cover would not extend to such a case the Government should give serious consideration to bringing it within the ambit of the legislation. I believe that the same consideration the Government should extend full repatbeen foreseen by the Opposition when the in another place also provide that a serviceman who is allotted to a special service area in another country will be covered for repatriation benefits as from the time of that allotment. The Opposition agrees that this provision will be readily acceptable not only to servicemen who are proceeding to a special area from Australia but also to members of the armed forces serving outside Australia who are allotted to service in a special area. As I have indicated already, the Opposition does not oppose this legislation. We appreciate the fact that the Minister for Repatriation and the Government have been prepared to accept the views expressed by tiie Opposition that repatriation benefits should be available to servicemen allotted to service in special areas, from the time they leave this country or from the time they leave an area-othe r than special area-in which they are now serving, until they return. I repeat that the Minister for Repatriation might give consideration also to amending the Repatriation Act to extend repatriation benefits to all serving members of the forces in this country. We think that this is fair and proper. We feel that they should be covered by the Repatriation Act rather than the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act, as at present. I realise that this is really a subject for another debate and I do not wish to deal with it at any great length this morning. I know that the Minister for Health( Mr Swartz) will understand that lengthy delays occur when a member of the armed forces who suffers a disability during his full time service in Australia is obliged first to have his disability accepted as being due to his service and then to lodge his claim with the compensation authorities. We submit that the Government should give consideration to the representations made by the Opposition on a number of occasions that .the Repatriation Act be amended to include all serving members of the armed forces. I do not wish to delay the House any bers of partnerships who lack, or are longer. I rose merely to make one or two deemed to lack, real and effective control of comments about the legislation before us their shares of partnership income. and to express our appreciation-if that is necessary, for the prompt way in which the Government accepted the amendment that ance with legislation introduced last year was proposed by the Opposition in another after the Government had considered the place. I deprecate the kind of publicity that report of the Commonwealth Committee on was given to those proceedings and the way Taxation 1959-61 drawing attention to the in which the Press gave the credit for moving the amendment to a number of Liberal supporters in another place. The fact is that this amendment was prepared by the Opposition. Had the amendment not been proposed by the Opposition, the Bill surely would have been passed in its original form by the Senate. Therefore I suggest that those people who will enjoy the additional benefits which are incorporated in this legislation will give thought to the effort that was made on their behalf by the members of the Opposition in another place. We do not oppose the Bill. We commend the Minister for the way in which he has amended it to provide the type of cover which I am sure not only all the members of this House but also all ex-servicemen's organisation and other interested bodies agree should be given to those who serve in the defence of this country in areas overseas.

I have found that the officers of the Taxation Branch exercise their judgment reasonably, but no Bill should place upon the Commissioner of Taxation the responsibility of exercising a discretion whether funds representing £500 million worth of assets should be taxable or not taxable. As I say, the trustees cannot know their liability for probably 12 months or more after the year of income in question. The Bill is contrary to every principle of Liberalism. Liberalism presupposes the right of thc individual businessman, and the right of the trustees of a superannuation fund, to carry on according to their own judgment so long as they do not interfere with others or act contrary to the public interest. How wrong it is for a bill to impose a penalty tax on what are clearly bona fide transactions, and then force the funds to use one of the escape clauses or rely upon the Commissioner of Taxation. 1 believe that the trustees of the funds should be allowed' to manage their own affairs in their own way.

That principle is completely obnoxious to me. It is completely obnoxious to every principle that I believe this Government has followed in the past. The Bill can do irreparable damage to Australia. It will have a most serious effect upon the savings of the community and on the willingness of people to invest their small savings in superannuation funds. The people who will be hit by it will be the small people-the employees and the wage earners-wh o put their small savings, supplemented by contributions from their employers, into these funds hoping to get some worthwhile Benefit on their retirement. Now they can find that their funds will be subject to a 10s. in the £1 penalty tax, perhaps because the trustees failed to comply in some respect with requirements. If, for example, an employer fails to make a contribution to the fund-and the employee has no control over that-the fund becomes liable to the penalty tax. I realise that the Commissioner has discretion to waive this liability, but 1 say without fear of contradiction a fund's tax liability should not depend upon the discretion of the Commissioner, however excellent that Commissioner may be. Of course, one understands why the Australian Labour Party is supporting this measure. This gives a perfect means of socialising and nationalising industry. Why leave the penalty at 10s. in the £1? Why not make the penalty tax 19s. in the £1 and wipe out all private superannuation funds, leaving in existence only government superannuation funds? Why not apply this principle to the Press? The Press might be interested in this. Let us impose a penalty tax of 19s. in the £1 on all newspapers. We will soon discover whether they find it worthwhile continuing in office when they have to pay 19s. in the £1 tax on their income. Of course, the Bill would provide that they do not have to pay the 19s. in the £1 tax on their income if they publish matter meeting with the approval of the Socialist government. No wonder the Labour Party so strongly supports this Bill. Let us apply this principle to television and radio stations. Let us make them pay 19s. in the £1 tax on their income unless they broadcast material acceptable to the government of the day. It is Labour's policy to nationalise insurance in this country. That policy is in the forefront of Labour's platform. The simple way to give effect to that policy is to impose a penalty tax of 19s. in the £1 on the income of insurance companies, thereby wiping out the private funds and leaving only the government fund to carry on. The next step is banking. It is Labour's policy to nationalise the banks. This is the way to do it.

The views on these matters. As is right he has Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) said that this put those views again to the House today legislation was based on recommendations of in quite strong terms. I would not like the the Ligertwood Committee. The Ligertwood House to believe from my silence that the Committee did not in any part of its report honourable member's attitude represents a recommend the imposition of a penalty tax. realistic view of the situation as the GovernNobody objects to a concession being given ment sees it. Nor do I believe that his to somebody who is doing a job in the attitude represents the general attitude of interests of the country. We give tax conhonorable members who support the Gocessions to exporters. I do not think anyone vernment and this measure. The honourable objects to that. What is objectionable about member said that the Bill was contrary to this Bill is the imposition for the first time Liberal philosophy. This legislation has been of a penalty tax if superannuation funds, hammered out in the Government, which is partnerships and trusts do not comply with composed predominantly of members of the certain conditions laid down by somebody Liberal Party. After a good deal of disoutside the Government. Let us look at the cussion the Bill has received the support of discretions that are given to the Commisthe majority of Government supporters in sioner of Taxation. With regard to partnerthis House. The honourable gentleman may ships the discretion is expressed in these express his view of what is a Liberal termsWhere thc Commissioner is of the opinion that, have operated unfairly to the general body by reason of special circumstances, it would be of taxpayers. In the eyes of the Ligertwood unreasonable that this section should apply tn any income, this section does not apply to that income.

So, instead of having the certainty which sound and just tax laws require, we have complete uncertainty. We have a penalty rate which is not intended to apply to 90 per cent, of the transaction, but then we provide that that penalty rate is reduced to nil provided the Commissioner of Taxation is prepared to grant an exemption. The Bill is so completely obnoxious to me that I cannot support it. I am prepared wholeheartedly to support a proper tax measure introduced to prevent avoidance of tax. My complaint is not aimed at what the Government has in mind to achieve but at the method by which the Government attempts to achieve a particular result. My objection is that the legislation penalises the genuine Treasurer) [12.41] -in reply-The honorattitude on these matters. Here we have on the one hand the devices employed which exhaustively, the only way to deal with this cretion by the Commissioner of Taxation. objectives. As to the tests, all but one-the test that there should be a contribution by the employer to the fund-hav e flowed from the recommendations of the Ligertwood Committee. So1 would say that what the honourable gentleman has said as to the likely effect of the legislation has ranged from the alarmist to the fanciful. Certainly nothing in the experience of the formation of new funds since the legislation was first introduced would suggest that the legislation has had any deterrent or inhibitive effect on the channelling of the savings of the community into this type of institution. The time is hardly appropriate for a more detailed discussion of these matters.

Senate's amendment No. 5Leave out "" Five hundred pounds "", insert "" One thousand dollars"". General) [2.16] I move That the amendments be agreed to. These amendments are in what might be described as two categories. One category, easily despatched, relates to an omission by me and, I suppose, by the House as a whole. There was a failure to substitute the decimal currency equivalent for some figures in pounds in clauses 34, 82, 83 and 84. The proposal is to insert the decimal currency equivalent. When the amendment we next come to was moved in the Senate, the Government took the opportunity to correct this omission. There will be no difficulty whatever in accepting the amendments in this category. The amendment of consequences is the amendment to clause 39. It proposes to omit sub-clauses (4.) and (8.). Sub-clause (8.) is consequential on the elimination of sub-clause (4.). This brings me to sub-clause (4.). Clause 39 deals with exemptions in respect of practices. Sub-clause (4.) was an amendment that was introduced to make certain things abundantly clear. It was proposed to make clear that a personI use the term "" person"" in an embracing sense, covering corporations and unincorporated bodies-wh o is the owner of real property can, in pursuance of his property rights over the real property, require the person to whom he gave a lease or a licence to take the goods that are supplied by the owner of the real property. The view I hold is rights of this kind has traditionally been able to exercise proprietary rights and is able to continue to exercise them in the tradiargument-a n argument of some validity In another way, the amendment to clause duced in May last, is now very relevant in that there has been a change of the conditioning words in relation to the three categories of examinable activities of the practice of monopolisation. Each of those three categories is now conditioned by the opening words "" taking advantage of his dominant position "". I think there is a good argument that a person exercising his proprietary rights is not taking advantage of his dominant position but is taking advantage of his proprietary rights. That is paragraph (a). Paragraph (b) deals with a person, who advances credit to another person, requiring the person as a condition of the advance of credit to take his supply of goods or services through the person advancing the credit. Our colleagues in another place were very concerned about the use of the word "" credit"". "" our colleagues "" in the sense that they are parliamentarians, as are we. Our colleagues in another place were very concerned about the word "" credit"". They felt, I think erroneously, that credit could be carried to an extraordinary degree, where a person could lend a pittance of credit and require the person to whom it was given to take a great deal of service. This overlooked the reality of the situation; if the credit was small, the influence likewise would be small and would, therefore, be unreal. However, after giving close examination to this suggestion, I am prepared to come to the conclusion that the reality of the situation is that it is very unlikely that the goods or services that the person advancing the credit in fact supplies",42,Income Tax Bill No 2 1965

I said the other night that I and in a way that envisages no future for thought Mr Ian Smith was confident that them as real human beings in that society. sanctions would not be applied to his This kind of attitude in the modern world country or that if they were applied they cannot survive, and it will be overthrown would not be effective. I understand that to by force eventually if it is not overthrown be the belief of the Government of Rhodesia in some other way. I have no sympathy today. I believe that if sanctions are not for those who advocate the exercise of force effective, the use of force in and around along a frontier in some other place. I think, Rhodesia will sooner or later become inevitas E. H. Carr said in his book "" The Twenty able, and a great many people, innocent as Years' Crisis"", that the most important well as guilty, will suffer from that force. thing in the post-Second World War period I think it is most essential, therefore, that is to try to find a way of making necessary the application of sanctions to Rhodesia be changes peacefully. Changes are necessary thoroughly backed by those involved. I in Rhodesia but the Smith Government has regret that there is a lack of sincerity and refused to make them and negotiations have a lack of earnestness on the part of quite proved impossible. The only other step a number of people in Great Britain, where seemed to be economic sanctions. Perhaps some of the leading members, if not the it could be said that the Wilson Government leader himself, of the Conservatice Party was too soft. Perhaps it could be said that are unwilling to support this policy to the its most serious mistake was to announce full. Quite a large number of business that it would never use force. That may leaders are also unwilling, because of the well have been a card better kept up the profit they make from dealing with sleeve. Rhodesia, to support the application of sanctions.

I policy. Were there a united attitude towards do not mean the Labour Government only; sanctions they would be much more likely I include also its Conservative predecessor. to be effective. The honourable member for Chisholm much patience. The great majority of chooses to call for negotiations about African leaders and the great majority of Rhodesia. Negotiations have been going on thoughtful African people believe that for four or five years. The negotiations durBritain has shown too much patience. What ing the last four or five months were rewe should seek to avoid is the African counferred to in detail in the correspondence tries-thos e adjacent to Rhodesia and others placed before this House by the Prime -launchin g some kind of military action Minister( Sir Robert Menzies). The British against the segregationist Government of Government was prepared to make a great Rhodesia. The only hope of avoiding that number of concessions, and in fact did is to ensure that economic sanctions are make concessions but it became apparent, made effective. Speeches of the kind deas the Prime Minister himself said, that the livered by the honourable member for Government of Rhodesia was not prepared Chisholm and his supporters on the other to budge an inch. It was the Government side of the House help not one iota in this of Rhodesia that made it inevitable that connection. In fact they tend to make fairly some other course of action would have to be taken. There is only one other thing I want to say. I do not think the House and tha people of Australia should lose sight of what is involved in this situation. There is a small number of people in Rhodesia, 220,000 in all, who are ruling a large numI do not think the honourable member for I think that both British Governments have shown patience in this matter-perhap s too remote the possibility of economic sanctions being effective. It is always a meritorious exercise to pour oil on troubled waters; it is not so meritorious to pour oil on troubled waters with the intention of striking matches and setting that oU aflame. I support what the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) has said and done in this matter. I think that his attitude, in a situation that all of us regret, has been impeccable and not only in the interests of AustraUa but also in the wider interests which we should be serving. The acdon of the Smith regime-it is not right to call it a Government-is to be regretted from two angles. The first is what I might call the angle of expediency. We do not want revolution against constituted authority in a matter of this kind. We have to maintain the integrity of our government institutions. The legally constituted authority in Rhodesia is now the United Kingdom Government. This should be recognised. To have impeached and impaired the integrity of the order and authority that existed in Rhodesia has been to do no service at all to the British people or to the people of Africa. In the second place, we regret very much the kind of thing which is happening in Rhodesia. We know .that in a situation such as exists there the majority must be brought to rule. It may be, and I think it is, that the majority is not yet sufficiently educated and advanced to accept its full responsibiUties. It is perhaps our faultI use the pronoun collectively because we in Australia really have nothing to do with this-that they are not sufficiently educated and advanced. We should be helping them as far as possible and as quickly as possible to take their rightful places. I do not believe that we can do other than what we have done. I contrast that attitude of the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) in this matter with the attitude he has adopted on other issues. He said a moment ago that it would have been better for the United Kingdom Government to keep up its sleeve the card renouncing the use of force. I think there may be something in his argument. The disclosure of this card may have given aid and comfort to the side it was not intended to support. I wonder whether perhaps the honourable member's attitude on Rhodesia is consonant with the attitude that he takes on Vietnam. Let him search his conscience and see whether what he is doing and saying now may be giving aid and comfort also to our enemies and helping them to perpetuate the present condition of war. He may be the enemy of the Vietnamese people if he is judged on principles the same as those that he adduced in regard to the Rhodesian people. I do not propose to detain the House longer, Sir. It is late. I simply record my support of what the Prime Minister has said and done in this matter. I apologise to the House for rising at this time. I understand that in my absence the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes), by interjection, stated to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) that statements I had made or actions I had taken while I was in Singapore should be investigated. I should like the honourable member for Chisholm to make clear to the House by a public statement what it is that he suggests I did in Singapore so that I shall have an opportunity, before the House goes into recess, to clear my name of the smear that he has directed at me. You wUl recall, Mr Speaker, that several years ago, at a time like this on the eve of the Parliament's going into recess, a certain accusation was made against me by another honourable member. That matter is still subjudice and is still being fought out in the courts. The matter raised by the honourable member for Chisholm in his interjection should be put straight in the records of this House. In all sincerity, I ask him to state what I am supposed to have done or said in Singapore so that we may have it all clear and above board. If he will tell the HouseI in turn can refute what he says or agree that it is correct. Sir Wilfrid Kent HughesI wish to make a personal explanation. IfI referred to Singapore I am sorry. It was a slip of the tongue. I meant Saigon and I was referring to what the honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren) said last evening in his speech on the motion for the adjournment of the House.

General) -by leaveMr Speaker, in answer to a question in the Senate earlier in the present session, the Minister representing me in that chamber stated that it was hoped that it would be possible to prepare a reprint of Commonwealth acts as at 31st December 1965. While the necessary precursor to a reprint, a Statute Law Revision Bill, is well in hand, events now show that the date originally contemplated for the reprint is impracticable. It was realised when 31st December 1965 was tentatively chosen as the date as at which the acts would be reprinted that a problem would arise in relation to references to amounts of money. That date would precede the changeover to decimal currency and reprinting of the acts with the references to the present currency would obviously be unsatisfactory. The Parliament has just passed some 32 bills that make specific amendments to acts in connection with the changeover to decimal currency. There are, however, hundreds of acts in which references to money occur but it is not proposed that these shall be specifically amended this year. Nevertheless, by virtue of section 10 of the Currency Act 1965 these other references to the present currency will, where appropriate and unless a contrary intention appears, be construed as if they are references to decimal currency. This, however, does not amount to a textual amendment of an act in which such a reference appears, so that the text of the act remains unaltered. To effect a textual alteration, some further legislative action has to be taken. When the question of the preparation of a reprint of the acts was being considered, it was thought that some general formula could be devised, to be authorised by an act, whereby textual amendments could be made in the reprint in the acts not specifically amended. The reprint could then have been prepared with the references to money in decimal currency. One of the problems that was encountered when contake was that it might be considered improper that it should be left to a person reprinting an act to alter it in accordance with his understanding of how the act should be read. It was thought rather that each reference to money should be reviewed and a specific amendment of that reference made. This more exact kind of amendment, no matter what form it takes, will involve the preparation of an instrument or instruments, of a kind yet to be worked out, of formidable dimensions-a n undertaking that will take considerable time. Even if it had been possible to reprint the acts, making the necessary alterations consequential upon decimal currency, officers of my Department would have had to be diverted from the work in which they are currently engagedin particular, drafting legislation, especially in the last two or three weeks of the session -to undertake the preparation of the reprint. This would inevitably have led to delays in the carrying out of the work of the Department-somethin g that honourable members. I am sure will agree is highly undesirable. May I here remind honourable members that a reprint of Commonwealth acts is annotated with cases relevant to particular acts. The preparation of these case notes is, of course, a major undertaking in itself. Taking all the foregoing into consideration, I have decided, with great regret, that the only practicable course is to postpone the preparation of the reprint for the time being. I would, however, point out to honourable members that all the more important acts of this Parliament are being continually reprinted in pamphlet form. The more frequently amended have been reprinted more than once since the last reprint of acts in 1950. The Income Tax Assessment Act, indeed, because of its importance, is reprinted annually. Thus an up to date version of the acts most often used is readily available. In fact, honourable members may feel that it is of greater use to the public to have the more widely used acts available in an up to date pamphlet form than to have a",50,Rhodesia

However, the project of a complete reprint of the acts has not been abandoned and I hope to introduce next year both a general Statute Law Revision Bill and also a bill to change, by some appropriate measure yet to be worked out, all old currency references to decimal currency references. the Opposition) -by leaveMr Speaker, I think all honourable members will agree that the Commonwealth system of bringing acts up to date is the best in Australia. There is not the slightest doubt about this. The Commonwealth does a better job of reprinting its Acts and presenting them in amended form from Parliament to Parliament than is generally done in the States. The Attorney-General( Mr Snedden) has pointed out the difficulties encountered in having this work done. Those difficulties are associated with the problem of obtaining draftsmen, lawyers and other officers who can undertake this work. I suggest to the Minister that the Government should seriously consider increasing not only the numbers but also the salaries of the competent officers who assist the Government in this task. I refer to remuneration particularly because we should attract to the service of this Parliament the best brains we can get to help the Commonwealth Government. There is no doubt about the supreme importance of Commonwealth legislation compared to other legislation. It is true that Commonwealth acts are readily available in pamphlet form but there is a good reason for making a complete reprint of acts from Parliament to Parliament or even from year to year. We shall need to reprint acts not only to make alterations consequent on the introduction of decimal currency. We also ought to make reprints because of vast changes that take place from Parliament to Parliament. The multiplieity of bills that we have passed in this Parliament will take a considerable time to incorporate in the printed records of the Parliament. I hope that the Attorney-General will be able to secure more parliamentary draftsmen, and I hope he will be able to secure more lawyers in his own Department to bring these acts up to date. Incidentally, and perhaps somewhat irrelevantly, 1 hope that the GovernmentI trust that the Attorney-General will be one of those who will assist me in this regard-wil l not take too much notice any longer of what the Public Service Board recommends in regard to the salary of "" Hansard"" reporters and all those other people who are so useful to us in the performance of our duties here. leave to make a statement not exceeding three minutes on this subject.

It is a good thing to have a reprint qf our acts to date, but surely it is essential, and should be the normal thing, that when an amending act is passed by the Parliament an incorporated act should be available in print within 30 days. Too often during this session we have had to deal with amending acts which required knowledge of a pakapoo ticket in order to know what we were doing because the acts had not been consolidated. I believe that once we get this in order the mechanical operation of having a consolidated act always published within 30 days after an amending act has been passed by the Parliament is not beyond the capacity of the Public Service to achieve. I think we have been accepting too low a standard, and I ask the Attorney-General( Mr Snedden) to haye another look at this and, after he has succeeded in getting a complete set of acts up to date, to accept also the proposition that when an amending act is passed by the Parliament, within 30 days a consolidated act will be available to the public.

Initially the concession will apply to those colleges listed in the schedule to the States Grants (Advanced Education) Act 1965. Other colleges will be prescribed as they are approved as colleges of advanced education by the Minister in Charge of Commonwealth Activities in Education and Research.

Territories) by leave Commonwealth and State Ministers responsible for Aboriginal welfare meet every two years to examine progress in this field throughout Australia and to increase co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. The 1965 conference was held in Adelaide on 22nd July 1965 under the chairmanship of the South Australian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Honourable D. A. Dunstan. All States except Tasmania attended. Unfortunately this year the business of Government prevented, at the last moment, any Commonwealth Minister attending. I was represented by the Administrator of the Northern Territory and the Director-General of Health represented the Minister for Health( Mr Swartz). Perhaps the most valuable result of this conference, as of the others that preceded it, was the interchange of ideas and information that took place. I shall give later some detail of the progress throughout Australia in the field of Aboriginal advancement that was revealed by the discussions. There were, also, decisions on some matters of policy, the most important of which was a re-affirmation of the objective of assimilation, with some changes in the language in which the principle has been expressed. I shall tell the House later in some detail of these matters also. In recent years the record of every State in the field of Aboriginal advancement-as , I believe, it is of the Commonwealth also-is one in which they can take pride. Governments have, of course, no monopoly of energy, altruism and wisdom in this field; but neither have they a corner on lethargy, self interest and stupidity, as some of their critics are all too prone to imply. Some of these critics are using the Aboriginal question for their own political ends and would be most disappointed if it were no longer a "" question "". Even among those who are sincere in their criticism, many spend a good deal of their energy seeking someone to blame-Australian s of the past or Governments of the present, employers, townspeople in some particular done for Aborigines.",52,Reprint Of Commonwealth
139,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar),by,53,Aboriginal Welfare
140,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,,53,Aboriginal Welfare
141,Mr Barnes (Mcpherson,"Minister forThe major obstacle, however, is not a lack of desire by governments and others immediately at grips with this problem to do well; it is not parsimony or vested interests. The main obstacle is the intrinsic difficulty of the problem itself. In no place where people of an advanced and dynamic culture have met those of a static one has it been anything but desperately difficult to save the people of the primitive culture. In the case of the Australian Aboriginal the gulf between the two cultures was very wide. Neither at home nor abroad, and especially not abroad, do we do Australia a service by being professional knockers of governments which have responsibilities in this field of Aboriginal advancement. WhatI have said for some critics does not apply to the many people and organisations of goodwill who are genuinely trying to understand the problems and to assist in their solution, particularly in the field of personal relations between the two races. These people do not refrain from stating their views about Government action but they are willing to listen thoughtfully to what the governments say and to give them credit for experience and some sincerity and sense. It is necessary that we beware of seeking for the Aborigines objectives that are mutually incompatible. There are those who on the one hand want the Aborigines to retain fully their own racial separateness, their own language, customs and characteristics and on the other would have them achieve educational, social and economic standards that are not inferior to those of other Australians. They fail to realise that keeping fully to the former will prevent the latter. This brings me back to the Adelaide conference. I mentioned earlier that at the conference all governments re-affirmed the policy of assimilation. This means that they are in no doubt as to the side on which they stand in any case where there must be a choice between racial separateness and full membership of the Australian community. They did, however, restate the policy in the following wordsThe policy of assimilation seeks that all persons ing act in Victoria has placed the Aboriof Aboriginal descent will choose to attain a gines Welfare Board under the jurisdiction similar manner and standard of living to that of of the Minister for Housing. A person other Australians and live as members of a single Australian community-enjoyin g (he same selected from nominations by the AboriTights and privileges, accepting the same gines Advancement League is now included responsibilities and influenced by the same hopes and loyalties as other Australians. Any special measures taken are regarded as temporary measures, not based on race, but intended to meet their need for special care and assistance and to make the transition from one stage to another in such a way as will be favourable to their social, economic and political advancement. This is a somewhat shorter statement than the earlier one. As now expressed it states explicitly what has always been implicit in the assimilation policy, that Aborigines must themselves choose to become part of the general Australian community. This is not in any way to imply that the attitude of governments is to be a neutral one as to the choice to be made. Governments will provide every opportunity they can whether in education and training, in housing and employment, or in any other way for Aborigines to attain full Australian standards. They will give every encouragement to Aborigines to avail themselves of these opportunities. But the use of the word "" choose "" is to recognise that an important element is that the Aborigines see the goal and want to reach it and that means must be found for them to participate fully in the shaping of their future. It will be noted, also, that the restatement of the policy omits the words in the earlier statement referring to Aborigines observing the same customs and being influenced by the same beliefs. This change was made to avoid misunderstandings that had arisen that the assimilation policy sought the destruction of Aboriginal culture. It does not. As I mentioned earlier, the various governments reviewed their recent progress in Aboriginal advancement. Most striking was the progress made in bringing Aborigines within the ambit of the general law and general community services that apply to the rest of the community. In the Northern Territory there are now no laws which discriminate against Aborigines; they are equal at law with all other Northern Territory residents though some special benefits have been retained to them such as special rights to reserved lands, including royalties arising from those lands, and the right everywhere to take natural game and to use natural waters. An amendon the new Board. In Queensland new legislation has been passed placing Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders to the maximum extent possible on the same footing at law as all other members of the Queensland community while continuing essential provision for their special care and assistance. In Western Australia amended legislation aims to promote the integration of Aborigines into the general community and to provide special welfare measures during the transitional period. One special provision is retained in regard to liquor where prohibition is applied to Aborigines in the area outside the south western land division in that State. The 1963 conference in Darwin agreed that in principle it would be preferable that any restraints during a transitional period should be applied to areas and not groups of people. In Western Australia the position public relations field.

The conference Council Committee which had been formed at the request of the 1961 conference of Ministers to look at medical research projects dealing with Aboriginal people has been active. The Central Reserves Committee, a consultative body of officers of the welfare authorities of South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory and the Department of Supply has been constituted to deal with the problems of some 2,000 Aboriginal people inhabiting approximately 100,000 square miles of reserves in Central Australia. The conference agreed that Queensland should join this Committee because of the increasing movement of Aborigines between this area and Queensland. The conference reviewed the work that has been done and is to be done in the undertaking a major project of research into Aboriginal assimilation, to undertake a general role of advice to governments on The conference discussed the training of Ministers gave some consideration as to the advice they might give to the Commonwealth about requirements for Aborigines to register for national service. They conasked that consideration be given to paying full repatriation benefits to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders who are called up. There was a useful exchange of views on Aboriginal communities and their future in economic opportunities for Aborigines and the economic development of reserves. This brings me to the important matter of Aboriginal employment. I will take this opportunity of stating the present position briefly. The North Australian Workers Union has applied to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for the removal of the exclusion of Aborigines from the Cattle Station Industry (Northern Territory) Award. This application affects the future employment and wages of some 1,500 Aboriginal men and women, who comprise the great bulk of Aborigines employed in the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth Government has formally intervened in the public interest in the proceedings before the Commission, exercising its statutory power under section 36(1.) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to do so. The general policy of the Commonwealth Government in the field of Aboriginal employment is one of non-discrimination. The Commonwealth has stated its view to the Commission that as a result of the proceedings the minimum wages and conditions of the award should apply equally to Aborigines as to other Australian workers. The Commonwealth is concerned that the manner of implementing the application should not do unnecessary harm to the very people whom the application is designed to assist. It believes that there could be no substantial objection to a proposal which would obtain ful! award rates for all workers in the industry within a period and by steps determined by the Commission. Outside thc cattle industry, there are about general objectives related to assimilation, 250 Aborigines employed privately and 300 employed by the Administration and Commonwealth departments. The Government's general policy objective of non-discrimination applies also to this employment and the Government will be pursuing this objective when the Commission's decision is known say: ""All Aborigines are citizens within in the cattle industry case. I feel that the results of the conference tralia is still putting Aborigines through a in Adelaide show that continued co-operaprocess of applying for citizenship rights. tion between the Commonwealth and the. States on Aboriginal welfare matters is achieving the aim of Australia-wide progress in a difficult and changing field. Tho areas of difference have receded to a large degree over the past two years and further progress is assured. Ministers responsible for Aboriginal welfare will continue to meet every two years and there will be an annual meeting of officers. The next conference will be held in Perth in 1967 at the invitation of the Western Australian Minister for Native Welfare, the Hon. E. H. M. Lewis. I present the following paperStatement of Policy and Text of Resolutions approved by Conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers on Aboriginal Welfare held in Adelaide on 22nd Jury 1965and move That the House take note of the papers. will be brief. I do not want to start a debate now, but there are two things I should like to say. First, we regret the timing of this statement. This has been an issue that has been discussed in this Parliament for quite a time. The Minister for Territories ( Mr Barnes) has now made a statement that deserves a debate, but, of course, the Parliament will not have time to debate it. The second thing I should like to say about the form of the statement is that I regret that the Minister spent so much time on his critics. Every member of the Parliament knows that this is a field in which there are cranks. It is a field in which there are damaging critics. It is a field in which there are insincere critics. All of this is known. However, when the Minister makes a statement we look for a clear statement of his policy and tbe policies of the governments with which he has been associated at ministerial conferences between the Commonwealth and the States. We regret the way to get these statements containing citizenship and so forth because they honestly have no meaning for us in terms of policy. I remember that a Western Australian Minister used to go to conferences and the meaning of the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948-1960"". But Western Aus-",53,Aboriginal Welfare
142,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [3.25],"IIf they are citizens already, why does this happen? These objectives have no clarity. Assimilation has no clarity. If assimilation is that Aborigines should come to share the ideals, convictions, rights and interests of the general Australian community it is an objective that does not put the Administration under discipline. Can an administrator say: ""TodayI have done so-and-so to help the aborigines share the rights, ideals and so forth of the Australian community ""? What we long for in the Minister's statements is a clear statement of objectives in health, education, land ownership, agricultural education and housing. We should like to know what is going to happen to the large reserves. What is to happen to those reserves next to towns where fringe dwellers live? What is being done about the fringe dwelling groups? It is very easy to change words. The new South Australian Government has a different emphasis on some of these things. We can change the forms of words very easily because they are merely formulae and do not really tell us anything about policy. Assimilation is not telling us anything about policy. The Minister has spoken of equality before the law. This is an excellent objective, but social reality is vital. It is the social realities of the conditions under which the Aboriginal people are living that matters. Equality before the law can be really oppressive to a primitive people. I remind the Minister that in the early days of the industrial revolution in England some of the more brilliant critics of the form of society then used to say that there was equality before the law in that era of great poverty because both prince and pauper were entitled to sleep on the Thames embankment. Social reality is what matters. It is the social things that are being done in the Government's Aboriginal policy that we are interested in. I honestly think that if as much time were spent on debating the liquor rights of Aborigines as seems to be indicated in the Minister's statement, then this is an example of the pathetic level of our thinking on this subject. I realise all the problems associated with denying liquor and so forth to Aborigines, but must we be like a gramophone needle stuck in a crack on the record still on this question of liquor rights, liquor rights, liquor rights? If this happens every time we discuss Aborigines then we are not getting very far. What the Minister said about the application of the North Australian Workers TJnion before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was interesting. I do not want to appear in the role of a critic, but we on this side of the House are frustrated over one thing. We have sometimes asked questions about the Commonwealth level of wages paid to Aborigines employed by the Services, but on a number of occasions Ministers have turned the question into wages paid to Aborigines serving in the Services. I know that an Aboriginal corporal or an Aboriginal sergeant gets the same pay as a non-Aboriginal corporal or a non-Aboriginal sergeant, but the thing is that when we were in Darwin we saw the Services, which are instruments of the Commonwealth, employing Aborigines in a civil capacity as labourers at wages that were about one third or one quarter of the European rate. The North Australian Workers Union may get a different pastoral award, but what is the Commonwealth doing about the low wages it pays? This we cannot find out, and I long for the day when we will get a statement on Aboriginal matters that deals with specific social realities and not with assimilation, citizenship, liquor rights, equality before the law and generalisations. speak on much the same theme as did my friend, the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley). I speak first in defence of those people who one way or another have given a great deal of dedicated service to arousing the public conscience on Aboriginal welfare. I am one of them. I have spoken often in this House on this subject. I lay no claim to moral virtue. I learned of the real problem of our Aboriginal population only after I entered the Parliament. For six or seven years I have been President of the Aboriginal Advancement League of Victoria. I have attended every conference of the Federal Council for Aboriginal Advancement-con ferences to which we have often invited every member of the Parliament, including the Minister for National Development ( Mr Fairbairn), who seems to find some humour in the situation; yet they have not attended. As I have seen them, these conferences were attended initially by handfuls of people but",56,Aboriginal Welfare
143,Mr Bryant (Wills) [3.31],"I want tofn recent days by hundreds of people. There is no doubt that people generally are concerned with this subject, but none of those intimately concerned have attended these conferences. We want action. It is disappointing to me that the statement before us does not indicate fields of action. In effect the Minister has indicated that the Commonwealth, to a large extent, remains neutral. No Minister was able to attend the conference held in Adelaide. Surely there was someone who could be found to attend the conference in Adelaide-and conferences no matter where they were held-unde r ministerial auspices, particularly when the Aboriginal population of the Northern Territory is so large. Ministers can find time to attend conferences in Teheran, Washington and New York, and I have no doubt they could find time to attend conferences in Moscow if called upon to do so. What was disappointing to me was that the Commonwealth-the authority with all the resources, including powerful administrative and financial resources-wa s not represented at ministerial level. 1 do not blame the Minister as a person, but this is an important national and international subject.

It is nonsense for anyone to Anthony, Mr Aston, Mr Chipp and Mr come to this House and say that the ComDrury have been appointed by the Prime monwealth has abolished discrimination in its Acts and ordinances. The fact remains that some discriminatory ordinances are still operative. I understand that this is the position. As soon as this ministerial statement was introduced I sent to the papers room of the Parliamentary Library for information and I have received documents indicating that there are differentiation and discrimination in Aboriginal employment. I presented a petition on this specific subject only yesterday. While the Social Services Act includes discriminatory clauses, while the National Service Act remains unaltered, and while section 51 (xxvi.) of the Constitution precludes the Commonwealth from taking effective action, the Commonwealth cannot remain neutral. I hope that thc Minister will accept the challenge that this problem presents to him and will recognise that, with all the resources of the Commonwealth at his disposal and paying regard to the goodwill and arousing conscience of the people of Australia, this is not a case for politics in this Parliament. No government and no party has a clear conscience in this field.

CAIRNS (Yarra) [3.37] -Some few weeks ago, the Minister for Trade and an agreement had been reached on the formation of a free trade area between Australia and New Zealand, following negotiations between Mr Marshall, the New Zealand Minister of Overseas Trade, and himself, and that it had now been confirmed by the two Governments. ln general the Opposition welcomes such an agreement because we welcome anything that will bring about an increase in trade between this country and other countries, particularly countries that are less developed than is Australia. But we do so on one condition: That no section of the Australian people will suffer significant damage and that if this proves inevitable in any situation, as it might, national action will be taken to give ample warning of the changes and to give compensation to the injured sections. Whilst the Opposition welcomes the Agreement we do not welcome the way in which it has been introduced; nor do we welcome the absence of any sign on the part of the Government that it would be prepared to compensate injured sections. In fact, the Government is prepared to run the risk of injuring sections of the community and not to provide for any compensation. This is the weakness in the Government's approach to all trade agreements. The Government has not adequately given warning and has not provided at all for any possible compensation. In fact, 1 think it came as a surprise to most people when the Minister announced that a free trade agreement had been signed with New Zealand. We knew that some negotiations had been proceeding but I found, when I was in New Zealand in the middle of this year, that most New ZealandersI mean most of those who were members of the New Zealand Parliament on both sides-though t that an agreement was still a long way off. New Zealand seems to have been more anxious about this Agreement-perhap s I should say those in and around the New Zealand Government seem to have been more anxious-tha n anyone on this side of the Tasman. This was understandable because about £80 million worth of commodities were exported annually from Australia to New Zealand but only about £20 million worth were imported into Australia from New Zealand. New Zealand balance of about £60 million, which is quite considerable. I do not think that this Agreement will affect the situation quickly or materially. In his statement on 17th August last the Minister saidA free trade area has a technical connotation. It is an arrangement between two or more countries which provides for the goods included in it to be traded free of duty between them, but allowing each country to maintain separate tariffs on imports from countries outside the arrangement. It is different from a customs union which, in addition to requiring free trade between the countries or areas members of the agreement, also requires that they have a common external tariff. Under the present arrangement, this is a free trade area, not a customs union. The Minister further saidThe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade requires that, when two countries enter into a free trade agreement, substantially all the trade between the two countries should be subject to the free trade provisions. Only in one sense is this true. The Minister saidThere are no precise rules to indicate the dimensions of the trade which must be included, and there is no strict rule governing the period over which substantially all of the uade must be brought into the free trade agreement.",58,Parliament House
145,"Page 14), On Motion By Mr Mcewen",,59,Trade Agreement
146,Industry ( Mr Mcewen) Informed Us That,"Apparently this can extend over a long period of time and apparently the requirements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are not offended. It is fair to say that there would be a great deal more trade between Australia and New Zealand if there were not any tariff or other barriers between the two countries. The Minister said that about 60 per cent, of the trade between the two countries is included in the Agreement but he also said-thi s is perhaps the key proposition in his speechThe bulk of the items to be included initially more than the squeak of a mouse. This in this 60 per cent, of the trade between the two is true of the economy as a whole. countries are those already traded on a duty free basis. In other words, the bulk of the items that will be included in the Agreement are items that are pretty nearly the subject of free trade now. This means that the Agreement is only a marginal one without much significance to the economy as a whole. The commodities that are being brought within the scope of the Agreement may be considered under four headings. The first includes those goods on which duties were very low before the Agreement. Now they are to be made free quickly. They represent the greater part of the commodities under the Agreement. The Minister referred to them as ""the bulk of the items"". They were practically free before. They are the only items that will become free quickly. So one can understand that the Agreement is not of much significance. The second category includes items that will be made free over a period of eight years. The third category includes items that will be made free over a period beyond eight yearsI think nine years is the only case. The fourth category includes items which will never be free under this Agreement. Another most important proposition was expressed by the Minister in these termsWhere serious harm or serious unemployment would result from competition by the other country the items concerned will never be traded duty free. In other words, the most significant areas of trade between New Zealand and Australia are excluded from the Agreement. This is another reason why the Agreement is not of significance. I think it is fair to say that the Agreement was introduced into the House with a great flourish of trumpets. If one wants to have trumpets blov/n in this House it is the Minister for Trade and Industry He brought in the Agreement with a great flourish of trumpets but if you look at the Agreement you will see that it is nothing There are a number of areas in which the Agreement can have a significant effect on particular products and I want to speak about this for a minute or two. The products that I think are really significant from a national economic point of view are forest products from New Zealand and steel and manufactured products generally from Australia to New Zealand. Undoubtedly, in the end there will be great scope for increased exports of Australian manufactured and steel products to New Zealand, and perhaps this is the most significant area of operation of the Agreement from Australia's point of view. On the other hand, it would seem that the only significant compensation for New Zealand is in forest products-timbe r and paper. We can be satisfied that there is very little that affects the Australian economy immediately, but the question I want to raise is: Why has New Zealand entered into this agreement? I can see no good reason from the point of view of the New Zealand economy as a whole for its doing so. New Zealand has a Tory Government. It is a Government that reflects very strongly the interests of primary producers. Therefore, il is a Government that is not as inclined to encourage manufacturing industries as is the Australian Tory Government, which is made up of a great many people with influence from city industrial areas and industrial concerns. New Zealand is still predominantly a primary producing country and its Tory Government still reflects predominantly primary production interests. Therefore, it is prepared to accept an agreement with Australia that will discourage the development of manufacturing industries in New Zealand. However, the long term",59,Trade Agreement
147,( Mr Mcewen) Who Can Blow Them Best.,"interest of New Zealand requires a more rapid increase in its manufacturing industries than the present New Zealand Government is prepared to undertake. I do not think that the agreement can be considered to be one of advantage for New Zealand in the long term. Dr. Mackay -I s the honourable member playing New Zealand's side of politics? Dr. J. F. CAIRNS -Yes. I think the attitude of the Opposition in the New Zealand Parliament is the same as I have just been stating in this Parliament. I want to mention some items that may have adverse effects upon the Australian economy. They are the importation of pork, cheddar cheese, peas and beans. The import of pork and cheddar cheese is controlled. On the face of it, these items reprepare better than we have prepared in this sent only a small proportion of the Australian output each year. The amount of pork that can be imported from New Zealand duty free is limited to 3,000 tons in the first year. The amount is increased by 5 per cent, in the second and all subsequent years. This involves an increase of only 350 tons on the amount imported in 1963-64, which is about 5 per cent. It is a small increase, but it may have an impact upon the industry. From then onwards, the increase each year is about 5 per cent. The production of pork in Australia in one year is about 80,000 tons. Assuming a pig weighs 100 lb., this is an increase of about 350 a year. It is debatable whether this is a signincant factor. But there is an upper limit which may have been exceeded if the agreement had not been signed. The upper limit for cheddar cheese is 400 lb. in the first year, 800 lb. in the third and fourth years, and 1,000 lb. in the fifth year and later. Australian production is about 60,000 tons and the increase is less than 1 per cent, each year. Whilst the impact of these increased imports may be significant for various parts of Australia where cheese and pork are produced and, with beans and peas, may be significant where there is no upper limitit is here perhaps that the effect will be greater-ther e are three offsetting factors. First, limits are set for pork and cheese. Secondly, the increase that comes from normal Australian demand can be expected to be 4 per cent, or 5 per cent, a year and the increase in exports can perhaps be adjourned. expected to be 3 or 4 per cent, a year, meaning that perhaps 5 per cent, to 8 per cent, will be the increase in demand for these products for Australian consumption and for export. The increase from New Zealand is considerably less than that. I said that the Opposition welcomes the agreement in general. We do not welcome the way it has been introduced and applied and we feel that there are prospects of damage to certain sectors of the Australian economy for which the Government has not made adequate preparation. This may not be important at this stage of our development. But if Australia is going to enter into trade agreements with other countries, particularly the underdeveloped countries where the need is great, we must precase. I think we need to give ample warning, and this may be done in the operation of the sliding scale for the products that will be imported, as with pork and cheese. Why the sliding scale could not be applied to other products and why it has been confined to pork and cheese I do not know. I think it eould be applied equally to other products like beans and peas. The sliding scale of increase allows the industry concerned to have some warning about what is happening. In addition, where damage is done, compensation should be paid. I think it is time that a government of Australia considered setting up a fund to compensate people for losses incurred as a result of agreements of this kind. Perhaps this is the rock-it is not a large one at this stage-o n which the desirable trend to increase trade with other countries will founder. Opposition will come from sections of Australian industries, employer and employee alike, that will be injured if these agreements are entered into. I think the big deficiency in this agreement and the one relating to underdeveloped countries, which we debated a week or two ago, is the complete absence of any realisation that it is wrong to cause sections of the community, perhaps alone, to suffer the damage that is inflicted by the implementation of a national policy that is in the interests of the country as a whole and of the outside world. Debate (on motion by Mr Wentworth) Motion (by Mr Freeth) agreed toThat the House, at its rising, adjourn until a date and hour to be fixed by Mr Speaker, which minded by the Leader of the Opposition time of meeting shall be notified by Mr Speaker( Mr Calwell) that I might say a kind to each member by telegram or letter. LEAVE OF ABSENCE. Motion (by Mr Freeth) agreed toThat leave of absence be given to every member of the House of Representatives from the determination of this sitting of the House to the date of its next sitting. Valedictory. Prime Minister) [3.54] -On the assurance of my colleague that all seems clear elsewhere, I move That the House do now adjourn. 1 would like to remind honourable membersI am sure they have forgotten-that this will be our last day of sitting before Christmas and the New Year. Therefore, it is proper that I should say a few words about you, Sir, about those associated with you and about those who look after us in this place. It has been a very strenuous session, a very strenuous year, and in those circumstances I continue to marvel at your own uniform fairness and good temper, because both qualities can easily be strained in the course of a long session. We are indebted to you for thera. We are indebted to the Chairman and the Temporary Chairman of Committees. We are indebted, as always, to the Whips who "" do good by stealth and blush to find it fame "", but upon whom we all, on both sides of the House, depend a great deal. They have done their work extremely well. I want to say "" Thank you "" to the Clerks at the Table and to the whole of the parliamentary staff, because they bring to bear on our work a degree of expertise and of guidance that is highly appreciated on both sides of the House. I want to say thank you on your behalf, Mr Speaker, to "" Hansard"", to the broadcasting functionaries, to the staff of the Library, to the attendants in the House and to those who look after the refreshment services and the other amenities of the Parliament. phonists. word about the telephonists, with whose voices I am quite familiar, particularly when there is a Party meeting. They do a great job and we are indebted to them. These remarks I have just made are normal enough on this occasion, but I do want to say-and I say this as a great respecter of Parliament and of the parliamentary institution-that the standard of the Parliament and the standing of the Parliament both depend far more than some people think on the attitude of the members of Parliament. I am bound to say, as a very old inhabitant-on e of the three fathers of the House-that I do not remember any Parliament in which members have worked harder, in which they have made more definite, positive contributions to debate than this Parliament. This augurs well for the future. It is easy enough for the onlooker to be a little cynical about Parliament. That is a rather cheap thing. Parliament is the supreme forum of the nation. The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia is more democratically representative of the people of Australia than almost any other Parliament that I can think of is representative of a people. The result, when we have a proper representation of the people, and members bend themselves to their duties in this Parliament, is that this becomes a good Parliament, and I am perfectly certain that the contribution that has been made by all honourable members to the standing and work of this House will be remembered to their credit and will inure for the benefit of the standing of the Parliamentary institution itself in our own democratic world. A good parliament cannot exist without good members. A good parliament cannot exist without good debate-stron g debate, strenuous debate and, every now and then, if you like, heated debate. But we all know from our experience that when the debates are over we look round the House and we on each side of the House know that we have a lot of close personal friends among our political opponents.

I agree with all that the Prime Minister has said about the importance of Parliament. I particularly agree with him in the remark he made concerning the democratically elected institution of which we are a part. There is no State Parliament in Australia that is really representative of the people in the sense in which this Parliament is representative of the people. They all work under some gerrymandered system or other; but this Parliament, from the beginning of Federation has, as nearly as practicable, represented the will of the people. Of course, it all depends upon a count of heads. As one Conservative in England said 100 years ago: "" Democracy rests on majority rule "". Somebody else has said that there is nothing sacred about majority rule, nothing sacred about the rule of 99 over 1 or 51 over 49. This is method of order, but not necessarily justice; but it is the only system that is an alternative to some form of Fascism, some form of Communism or some form of authoritarian control. I think that this occasion could be an ment side and Opposition side alike and, historic one. I do not want to peer too in short, to hope that all will have a happy far into the future, but I have whai' Carlyle Christmas and a prosperous New Year and would have called a preternatural suspicion that this country will go on progressing that things might happen next year.

A taxpayer is subject to tax on his taxable income, that is, his assessable income less allowable deductions. The Income Tax Assessment Act provides that all losses or outgoings, to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are of a private or domestic nature. Interest incurred by a dealer in real estate which meets the requirment of these provisions qualifies for deduction in determining the dealer's taxable income. 6.

The provisions and conditions for the granting of furlough for the Armed Services are essentially the same as those applicable to the Commonwealth Public Service. The Prime Minister, on 19th November 1965, in reply to a similar question relating to the Commonwealth Public Service said that furlough provisions for officers dismissed from the Public Service were under consideration and that proposals would be placed before Parliament as soon as practicable. Furlough provisions for servicemen will be considered in the light of these proposals. Armed Forces: Campaign Medals. (Question No. 1440.) Mr Whitlam asked the Prime Minister, upon notice1.

163,Mr Hulme,"The answers to the honordrawn attention to the placement of life insurance funds in shares and debentures of H. G. Palmer (Consolidated) Limited, a company under a receiver appointed on 28th October last by the trustee for the debenture holders. It is understood that a statement of this company's affairs as at that date is being prepared and that the hearing of a petition to wind up the company has been adjourned until February next. At the present time, therefore, attempts to assess the outcome of these placements would be mere speculation. The Insurance Commissioner has assured me that he is keeping himself informed on developments in this matter as they happen. The honourable member's question regarding possible action to prevent the hazarding of policy holders' funds relates to a matter of policy on which it would be premature to reach decisions at this stage.

Has a survey been carried out to ascertain passed on to consumers. whether the subsidy on the wholesale price of petroleum products has been passed on to consumers? 2. If so, what was the finding? 3. If a survey has not yet been made is it intended that one will be undertaken? 4. If it is not intended to institute a survey does this mean that the Government considers a survey is not necessary? The Minister for Customs and Excise has supplied the following information1. Since the commencement of the petroleum products subsidisation scheme, checks have been made to determine whether the benefit of subsidy has been passed on through wholesale outlets. In addition a continuing survey is being carried out at selected retail outlets throughout the Commonwealth by officers of the Department of Customs and Excise to ascertain whether consumers were receiving the lull benents. 2. In every instance the check revealed that oil companies and agents have passed on the subsidy through their wholesale selling prices. Generally speaking the survey of retail prices has dearly indicated that consumers are receiving the benents of the subsidies to which they are entitled, although in isolated instances some pricing anomalies have come to light. It must be appreciated that in a scheme of this magnitude where eligible products are sold through many thousands of outlets information regarding specific localities at which it is suspected that the full benefits are not being 3.
