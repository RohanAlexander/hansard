That is what is to be applauded. It is not a confidence A third condition that I think is sensible is that trick. The absolute honesty of this Bill should be signs approved by the Minister for Transport and applauded. The Government says: 'We will raise Construction as Australian Bicentennial Road money for roads and by the establishment of a Development Trust project signs be erected special trust fund we will make sure that money is where these specific moneys are being spent.

This is not a confidence trick; it is often we have seen State governments spending something which is to be applauded and someFederal money on roads without designating that thing which the Australian public will appreciate it was Federal money.
