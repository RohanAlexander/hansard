Can the right honourable gentleman indicate whether the Government is taking any action to prevent that threatened calamity? press statement to which the honourable member .has referred, but I assume that it relates to an inter-union dispute on the south coast coal-fields regarding the driving of a tunnel in one of the mines. strike on the coal-fields is threatened. cussed that particular trouble with the Minister for Shipping and Fuel. The dispute is between the Australian Workers TJnion and the miners' federation, the point at issue being tbe union to whicb the men engaged in driving the tunnel should belong. Negotiations are actively proceeding to-day in an endeavour to solve the problem. THE PARLIAMENT. CALL FROM THE CHAIR. whether you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are aware that the Australian Broadcasting Commission announced during the news session at 7 o'clock last night that an arrangement had been reached between the Government and the Opposition parties to confine the debate on the privilege motion to four speakers from each side of the House, and that the honourable members who would receive the call during the evening would be the honourable member for Parkes, the honourable member for Barker, and the Minister for Information? Were you, Mr Deputy Speaker, a party to that arrangement to stifle a discussion, thus enabling the Australian Broadcasting Commission to forecast correctly what would take place in the House last evenindependent members no longer have any rights in this chamber, and are neither consulted nor considered when such arrangements are being made? Cbair bas no knowledge of tbe announcement by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to which the honourable member has referred.

7,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Th eImmigration been informed by General MacArthur's head-quarters that two Australian girls whom he is seeking to recall from Japan are employed by the American Red Cross and not by the American army authorities, and that their dismissal, a statement which appeared in a cableor the application of economic sanctions to force them to return to Australia, between the Australian and American is beyond the jurisdiction of the American army authorities? In view of that fact, does the Minister still intend to ask article was written, but the Melbourne the American Red Cross to force those girls to return to Australia? Has he seen a report that the Acting Prime Minister of New Zealand said he would not recall New Zealand girls as they were free to come and go as they desired ? bit interested in any opinion the Acting Prime Minister of New Zealand may hold, or in the interpretation which the honourable member for Flinders places upon something he has read in the newspapers that is supposed to have emanated from General MacArthur's head-quarters. MR, A. A. CALWELL, M.P. Immigration had an opportunity this morning to read the latest issue of the Melbourne Herald in which a scurrilous article appears concerning himself ? Under the heading ""Contempt"", it deals with the statement by the Minister in the House in which he made allegations about "" cracking "" cables with respect to the "" Manila girls"", and consists of lengthy comment. Has the Minister any statement to make upon it? Further, is the Melbourne Herald owned by Sir Keith Murdoch, who is alleged, in the past, to have stolen documents while on Gallipoli, and is notorious' for sacking journalists in companies of ten in moments of anger? In view of the scurrilous nature of the article, will the Minister, who is not only the first but also the finest Minister for Immigration we have yet known, defend himself against this attack? [58] article to which the honourable gentleman has referred. Obviously, it was written in pique because I had said that as Minister for Immigration I was determined to find out how the Melbourne Herald obtained certain information which could only have been based upon grama secret document-that passed governments. It was because of my statement that this vicious and scurrilous Herald is notorious for that sort of thing. It is true that in the past that journal has published the contents of stolen documents. It published the document to which I referred last night that told the story of the cables that passed between the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) when, as Prime Minister, he was in England, and the Ministers of his Government in this country. About the same time, that journal also published stolen documents which passed between the then Premier of Victoria. Mr Hogan, and certain of his Ministers in that State. The Melbourne Herald is adept at that sort of thing, but that is only to be expected because during World WarI . Sir Keith Murdoch smuggled uncensored documents from Gallipoli. in defiance of his word to Sir Ian Hamilton. Honourable members who are interested in that phase of past history can find all they want to know about it by reading Sir Ian Hamilton's Gallipoli Diary, particularly the second volume of it. The ethics of the Melbourne Herald and all the people associated on an editorial plane with Sir Keith Murdoch are the ethics of the gutter. is it? have made upon me is particularly filthy. If the honourable member for Gippsland supports that sort of thing he is in the same category.

The growers in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia have voted in favour of the Australian Government's stabilization plan, and the Premier of South Australia has promised that his Government will fall in with the scheme if South Australian growers vote in favour of it. In view of this circum stance, will the Miniserection of houses in the Northern Territer immediately communicate with the Australian Wbeat Board, OT whatever authority is responsible, with a view to arranging that, if South Australia adopts the stabilization plan, cornsacks shall be advanced to the farmers on the basis that payment will he made out of their first returns from the new wheat pool? M""r. POLLARD A question along the same line was asked in the House last week, and I replied that the Australian Wheat Board would have 'absolutely no security for bags forwarded to some wheat-growers, and therefore, it required payment in cash. have funds standing to their credit with the board, but these may be entirely inadequate to meet the cost of the bags forwarded to them. However, it appears most likely that the States will pass legislation complementary to the Commonwealth act so that the incoming wheat crop will be delivered to .the board and thus provide some security against the cost of the bags advanced to growers. I shall discuss this matter with representatives of the Treasury in order to ascertain whether, after the proposed South Australian legislation has been"" enacted, arrangements can be made to help growers who do not desire to pay cash for cornsacks before they sell their wheat. the Minister for Works and Housing witli reference to the impending Public Works Committee investigation of proposals to erect a school, a hostel and a wharf at. Darwin. Will the Minister instruct the Ohief Auditor' at Darwin, who is the representative of the Commonwealth Auditor-General in the Northern Territory, and also the chief costs clerk of .the Department of Works and Housing at Darwin, if such a person exists, to give evidence to the Public Works Committee, so that the committee may have information of the total cost of the four houses which have been erected by the departmentsince 1945? They may also be able to supply the committee with figures showing the costs of tory by private contractors. Such evidence may assist people who had their homes confiscated to secure their re-erection on a replacement value instead of on fhe basis of 1942 values, which is the Government's policy at the present time. power'to instruct that the representative of the Auditor-General's Departmenl should be called by the Public Works Committee. That committee was appointed under an enactment 'of this Parliament, and it has the right to call before it for discussions, Other growers consultations and advice any persons whom it considers would be able to supply valuable evidence. With regard to the cost of the four houses mentioned by the honourable member, I make it quite clear to the House that I should welcome an examination of any huildings by the committee, first as to construction, and secondly, as to comparative cost as between houses built by the department and those constructed by private persons or private contractors, not only in Darwin., but .also .in any other part of the Northern Territory.

There have been more than four built. In addition, over 144 houses which were either bombed, partly burnt, or damaged by white ants, have been completely rebuilt, and are now iu first-class condition. As the honourable member knows, a good deal of deterioration takes place in buildings in the tropics because of white ants. That was particularly noticeable when the Army was in occupation of the buildings. Many of the houses had to be stripped to the stumps and foundations. They have now been renewed. private houses? newed aud rebuilt by my department. In regard to the matter of replacement, I discussed with private people during my recent visit to Darwin the policy which has been adopted by the Government in assessing compensation for war damage. Because of the "" New Darwin"" plan, it has been necessary to move certain houses, my words were, without being able to and to arrange for the acquisition by the Government of certain other buildings. 1. also discussed with them matters relatand for business reasons, and not for ing to rebuilding, the moving of houses on to other blocks, and the resale of the houses back to the original owners. I did not receive one complaint, but during a discussion at a meeting some of the people told me that they had nothing but praise and appreciation, for what the Goaud recognized to be true, that many vernment has done in regard to thatmatte r. Minister said in this House that many white people in Malaya had gone there only to make profit, and had no regard for the native population. I ask the right honourable gentleman whether he is aware that his statement has created bitter resentment in Malaya, and that, as a result, Australia's good name has suffered gravely. Is he aware also that many men to whom his remarks could be regarded as applying fought with us in Malaya? Indeed, men with whom I am personally acquainted voluntarily remained behind with the natives and were returned, and others returned broken in health to continue their work in Malaya. In view of these facts, will the Prime Minister withdraw his statement or otherwise make it clear that he intended' no offence to oiir fellow British subjects in that area? honourable member would read thc statement that I made in connection with this matter. I do not recall having said anything about people in Malaya having no regard for the interests of the natives. gentleman's recollection is at fault. recollection of what I did say on this subject. I said that many people had gone to Malaya for profit and for business reasons. That is true, of course, of many countries. I said also that some of those people had no love for the country, not that they had no regard for tlie interests of natives. I did not mention native interests at all. I think that remember them precisely, that many people had gone to Malaya to make profit love of that country. Therefore, I consider that there is nothing that I should withdraw. The comment was not made with any intention to be either disrespectful to, or to reflect upon any of the people to whom I referred. I think it is true, people go to sueh countries, not because they love them, but because there is more profit to be made there than somewhere else. Accordingly I have nothing to withdraw or apologize for.

Thefrom the United Kingdomi t must be prepared to accept not only f it young men and women, but also a proportion of unfit people, and that Australia must accept mi appropriate share of the British ufi tional debt. The honourable member must finish his question instead of making a speech. I mmigration or the Prime Minister any further statement to make on the important question of migration? Anstralian Government I intimated to I lie British Government last year that mir migration plans provided for the inclusion of u fair cross-section of the British people. We do not want only young and vigorous men and women and those with special technical qualifications. We are prepared also to accept a proportion of old people and those who are past their maximum productive age. We should like families with three or lour children to migrate to this country, as well as single people and married people with only one child. However, those matters are intimately connected with the local housing problem. Any person or organization in Australia which is prepared to nominate relatives nr friends and can provide accommodation for them is assured of the utmost conperation of the l.epartment of Immigration. That offer includes families with five or six children. families with as many as eight or nine children have already arrived, and we have been delighted to welcome them. The principal difficulty confronting us is that the British people are not yet themselves convinced of the desirability of dispersing their industry and population to the four corners of the British Commonwealth. AU political parties in that country are convinced that Great Britain must hold its present population. To us, who view the problem from afar, it seems impossible that 45,000,000 people can continue to exist decently after the loss of the £6,000,000,000 worth of investments which were sacrificed by Great Brit a in during the recent war. It must be borne in mind that before the war the interest on that huge volume of investments flowed into the United Kingdom in the form of goods and services. Now that GreatB r it a in is deprived of that flow of goods and services I think that I am voicing the opinion of most thoughtful Australians when I say that it. would lie a good thing for Great Britain to allow some of its excess population to migrate to the Dominions, which are underH as the Ministerf or populated. However, as I say. no political party in Great Britain is yet prepared to accept that point of view. As I pointed out a. few days ago, any political On behalf of the party which expressed such an opinion would deprive itself of any prospect of victory at the next British general election, which i.? to be held in 1950. The subject of marriage loans is a matter f o consideration by the Prime.Minister, ancl I shall acquaint the right honourable gentleman with the views of the honourable member. I have read the letter which was published in the London Timea to which the honourable member referred. The writer, Mr Hollway, is the Premier of Yictoria, and is visiting the United Kingdom. He 'xj$) no doubt, anxious to express his support for the idea which I propounded, some time ago. The president of the Liberal party, Mr Casey, has spoken in the same strain as that in which Mr Hollway has written.

Debate resumed from the 16th September (vide page 530),.on motion by That the bill lie now read a second time. The purpose of the bill is to provide increases of pensions and to effect other changes forecast in the budget. All lionorable members w ill agree that, by and large, the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act is a f a i r act. However, we eannot allow that legislation to become static It should be amended from time to time to bring repatriation pensions, which I aud other ex-servicemen prefer to eall compensations, into proper relationship with the cost of livin g and the standards of the time. W it h that object in view, I proposc.to move an amendment later to the second reading. I should like honourable members to discuss the whole question of repatriation on a non-party basis. The purpose of my amendment is to provide for occasional, if not almost automatic, adjustments i u connection with which all parties can unite in order to do justice at all times to ex-service personnel. The amendment I move is as follows:That all words after ""That"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:-""The bill be withdrawn and referred to a parliamentary select committee of ex-servicemen appointed to inquire into and report upon the present repatriation pension rates with a view to better adjusting these rates to present living costs "". I shall preface my remarks on the. bill by quoting the official opinion of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia from which body several deputations have waited upon the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) and the Ministerf or Repatriation ( Mr. Barnard). The league has sent me the following communication:You are probably aware that a League deputation met the Prime Minister during the 32nd Annual Congress in October, 1047. The six main points presented by the deputation were(«-) An increase of f l per week in the pension for totally disabled ex-members of the Forces with proportional increases for dependants and percentage pensions, (fi) a minimum pension of £3 10s. per week to all war widows. (c) Pensions for dependent children of war widows to be £ 1 7s. Od. per week for the first child, and £1 per week for each subsequent child. (d) That special consideration be given war widows who because of incapacity or age are unable to earn a living.

Paragraph (a) refers specifically to totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen with whose position I shall deal in detail later. To that communication the association attached the following statement which was made by its federal president in Adelaide recently:The Federal Executive of the RSL. at its meeting in Adelaide yesterday unanimously expressed strong resentment at the callous disregard shown .by the Commonwealth Government in response to repeated represeuta tions for a long overdue and substantial increase in war pensions generally.

67,Mr White (Balaclava) [11.18],"true appreciation of the unanswerable claims of a section of the community apparently forgotten by the Government. . . . The general public will be astounded to learn that a comparison of increases in war pensions with the basic wage shows that whereas in the last 25 years the basic wage has increased by 4li per cent, the pension rate for war disabled ex-servicemen has only increased by 19 per cent. For over twenty (20)years up to 1943 no increase was made to the pension rate, whilst the basic wage has greatly increased. Over the last five years the basic wage has increased by over 20 per cent, but the war pension has remained stationary. It is pointed out that the basic wage is' fixed by a judicial body after a scientific inquiry which considers the purchasing power of the £1. As war pensioners, too, have to bear increased living costs, thc RSL. asserts that increases enjoyed by other sections of the community should likewise, be granted to this most deserving class, to whom the nation owes its very existence. I shall not dilate upon the association's comments, but 1 and my ex-service colleagues can only express sympathy its claims and approve of them. I propose to spend my time mainly in dealing with such quotations made on behalf of the Eeturned Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial of Australia rather than in expressing my own personal ments I have just read represent the opinion of an organization of men whose strength, greater than that of any trade union in this country. not engage in strikes, or sabotage industry. The contribution made by its members towards ensuring the safety and the well-being of the nation is. well known. In two world wars they have preserved our way of life, and in civil life they have endeavoured to ensure that the nation is not sabotaged by traitors to Australia. The association wants to expel Communists from its ranks, but action which it took in that direction recently has been declared by the Equity Court of New South Wales to be ultra vires the constitution of the association because its rules do not make specific provision in that respect. I mention that fact in passing in order to emphasize the loyalty of these .men not only in time of external crises but also of internal crises. history of the British people shows that they have fought tyranny both within and without, and have grown in strength and Mr White. prestige for that reason. When matter? affecting the livelihood of our ex-servicimen and women come under review in the Parliament, the Parliament should ensure that these people who are not articulate and do not have very mucli to say on matters generally, shall receive their f u l l meed of justice. When the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) brought down his budget he made a statement which I hope was not made deliberately with the intention to mislead. I do not think thai it was made with that intention. The right honourable gentleman saidThe Government also proposes increases in war and service pensions. General rate war pensions will be increased by about 10 per cent., which will mean an additional as. » week for pensioners whose incapacity has been assessed as "" total"". An increase of os. » week ia proposed in the present special rate war pension for cases of total and permanent incapacity, the war widow's pension, and the maximum rate pension for a dependent parent, with brother, sister, i c , nf a deceased member of the forces. That, statement led most people to believe from statements that there was to be a minimum increase Sailors, of ail pensions amounting to 10 per cent, LeagueI questioned the Prime Minister on thif subject because I realized that all penviews. The statesioners would not receive the f u l l 10 per cent, increase. The only section of fully assembled, would be the pensioners who are not to receive the f u l l 10 per cent, increase is the one Yet the association does to which I had thought that first consideration would be given. I refer to the totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen, including men who cannot or are not permitted to work. If any of them accept employment, their pensions are reviewed. Honourable member.* were deceived about this proposed increase. A totally and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman receives a pension of £5 ls. a week and a pension of 22s. a week for his wife. TJnder this legislation his pension is to be increased by 5s. a. week, and that payable to hi? wife by 2s. a week. The most elementary arithmetical calculation demonstrate? that the percentage increase proposed tn he made in respect, of the pension of these men is little more than 5 per cent, and The that of their wives less than 10 per cent. In view of that, why wa> the statement made by the Treasurer and published in the press that all pension? were to be increased by 10 per cent.? On the 24th September, I asked the right honourable gentleman the following question:[ preface my question by stating that, although the Prime Minister and Treasurer -fnid in the course of his recent budget speech that pensions, including war pensions, would lie increased by approximately 10 per cent., apparently it is intended to increase by only ""is. a week the pensions payable to totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen, who are physically incapable of supplementing tlieir pension by earning money. Such an increase would represent an effective increase io them of only 5 per cent. Will the Prime Minister examine the legislation which th° Government proposes to introduce so as to unsure that the proportionate increase of the pensions payable to totally and permanently incapacitated cx-servicemen will be at least equal to that made to thc pensions of civilians and other classes of ex-servicemen? The right honourable gentleman repliedIn the budget speech which I delivered some reference was made to an increase of pensions hy approximately 10 per cent., and I believp i hat the Minister for Kepatriation. who is more conversant with the details of the proposed increases than 1 am, has placed before the Housef u l l information about the increases. Whilst, generally speaking, the proposals which arc incorporated in the budget, which is now before honourable members, wil l be implemented in tlieir present form in the legislation which has been introduced, I shall ask my colleague to re-examine the matter in order to ensure that there arc nn extraordinary anomalies. The colleague to whom he referred was rhe Ministei for Eepatriation, who is 1 now in charge of the House. That statement was made more than three weeks ago. Since then the Minister has had ample opportunity to frame an amendment so that the men who have been deceived about the Government's intentions may be given justice. I have received numerous letters and telegrams from incapacitated ex-servicemen protesting in the most bitter terms against this proposal. I could road many of them, but, I' do not intend to take up the time of ihe House in so doing. I content myself with quoting passages from one or two of them. Here is a letter which I liave received from a man who is now over 67. The increase of the pension rate will not mean very much to him, he says, as probably he has not much longer to live. His letter is couched in words that should hum .into the very soul of the Minister for Eepatriation. Writing from Sydney, he saidThe Eepatriation Act was born in a non-political atmosphere. It has since been administered by all parties and my remarks therefore can have no political significance. The framers of the Act had no precedent to work upon but, in general) I suggest it has served its purpose well. . . I respectfully suggest the following alterations to the Act as a reasonable solution to thc problem of T.P.I. menTliat, in the ease of T.L'.I. men from llic recent war whom the Medical Board (alone) decides that they eould possibly earn-o r would bo better for trying to do so(o) A permanent and unrestricted pension be paid at a rate not less than is payable to them now. (ft) That some medium for the teaching of handicrafts, the arts, or occupu' tions tliey are interested in, be made available to them, but without any penalty if they do not choose to t r y . That all pensions paid should increase, or lessen, to the extent, and in unison with, the variations in the cost of living. . . . With such goodwill in framing the Acti t is remarkable that major errors were made with a class of men who, of all returned men, are least able to help themselves. Another letter which I have received from a totally and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman readsAs a. permanently aud totally incapacitated soldier, I would like to point out what to me is a decidedly unfair attitude taken by the Labour caucus-and to be presented to Parliament-to the pensions of T. and P. I . men and their wives. There is no consistency in the proposals because nu old-age pensioner couple can earn £3 per week and be entitled to the old-age pension of £2 2s. fid. making their combined weekly income £7 5s. whereas a T. and P. I . man will receive £5 (Is. weekly and his wife £1 4s. This bill increases the pension rate for a totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servieeman to £5 6s. a week and for his wife to 24s., making a total of £6 10s. as I have shown. By comparison, a couple receiving the age pension, each of whom may earn SOs. a week, are permitted a total income, comprising earnings and pension, amounting to £7 5s. a week. Ex-servicemen incapacitated as the result of war service-the y may be blinded or paralysed or in the last stages of tuberculosis-receiv e less than is granted to an aged couple who qualify for their pensions merely by age. There is not a mere handful of totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen in the community. There are 3,245 totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen from World WarI . , and 857 from World War II . Those incapacitated in World War II . are largely young men who are condemned to spend the rest of their days crippled or blinded, yet they .are treated so inconsiderately by this Government. I quote now from a recent London Daily Graphic the words of SirI a n Fraser, the blind meinber of the British Parliament, whom I know personally. Delicately reading with his finger tips, a set of braille notes, SirI a n Fraser made a passionate and powerful appeal in the House of Commonsf o r bigger pensions for the disabled ex-servicemen. The Daily Graphic report, readsySir Ian said tliat the new miners' pensions scheme would give a blinded miner £1 a week more disability pension than a blinded ex-serviceman. Pensions of 050,000 partially disabled men had gone up by only 124 per cent, in 2!) years, but wages and salaries had risen by 60 to 220 per cent. "" I speak for the Britisli Legion's 1,500,000. for thc large membership of the Royal Air Force Association, for tlie disabled soldiers' organizations and thc smaUer ones which care for the blinded and the maimed. "" I ask all citizens who sympathize with us to join our unofficial union, which will have no less power and influence on thc mind of Parliament and the Government than has the Miners' TJnion "", Sir Ian said. Sir Thomas Moore (Cons., Ayr Burghs) declared: "" We are paying the severely disabled less than we pay to a first-class shorthand tynist in business"". Mr Marquand paid tribute to Hie bravery if men injured in the war. ""They were brave in war, but thcy are showing even greater courage in peace"", he declared. Disability pensions are fixed according to the ex-serviceman's disability. serviceman who has been wounded or is sich does not receive a pension, as some .people seem to think. .granted only after the application been made to the Repatriation ment ancl, if thc ciaim be rejected, after t.he case has been re-considered by one of the entitlement granted may amount to only a few shillings a week or the full depending upon the degree of incapacity in each case. I have had a table prepared showing the relation of the full pension rate to the average basic wage since .1934. In 1934 the full pension rate ; l/r. White. was £2 2s. and the average basic wage was £3 5s. In that year the pension rate represented only 65 per cent, of the basic wage. W it h the permission of the House, I shall have the table incorporated in Eansa,rd because the final figures show that the new 100 per cent, rate of 55s. for incapacitated men who are allowed to do some work, w ill represent only 42 per cent, of the basic wage. Therefore, disabled men were better off in 1934 than they are to-day. . 100 per Pension cent, Average rate aa n Year. pension taslc perccntapi. rate wage. of basii' (weekly). wase. «. d. d. % 1934 . . 42 0 65 0 65 1937 42 0 75 0 56 1939 .. 42 0 79 0 53.1 194] .. 42 0 85 0 49.4 1942 . . 42 0 88 0 47.7 .1944 . . 50 0 96 0 52.1 1946 . . 50 0 97 0 51.2 1947May 50 0 J06 0 47.1 November 50 0 109 0 45.9 1948February 50 0 111 0 45 May 50 0 .114 0 43.8K August 50 0 115 0 43.4* August 50 0 120 0* 41 6 * New Soutb Wales rate. The Minister for Repatriation has frequently been asked by representatives of war widows to improve their benefits.

Dame widows' pension in South Africa is better than our own. Mr .BAKUAM> --No, it is of the Minister's unreliability soon when L quote from reports by various repatriation instrumentalities. However, at the moment I am dealing with specinc adjustments that are necessary. It is up to the Minister to meet the widows' representatives on a friendly basis ancl to call a halt to this wordy warfare with them in the newspapers and by means of interjections claiming that they are treated better than any othei' widows in the world. Mere words do not put right their wrongs. Much more can be done by the Government. Much is already being done by Legacy clubs, the War Widows Graft Guild, the McCaughey Bequest, the Red Cross, and many other organizations. The Goverament should work harmoniously with them in an endeavour to make some restitution for the grievous losses of those, women. Another anomaly which should have been put right, but which is not mentioned in the bill, is the application of a means test to the pensions of dependent parents whose sons were killed on service. I know many cases of hardship amongst .such people and I shall cite a typical example. children of their parents, were killed' on service. They had contributed substantially to the family income, and their allotments were paid to the parents while they were on service. When they were killed, the parents were notined by the Repatriation Commission that they could apply for a pension. The parents did so, but the police constable in the country village where they live then called upon them and asked, "" What are your assets? "" Because a few shillings were coming into the home they were told that they were not eligible for pension. Under this means test they have to prove that they are .'almost, in a state of poverty ""before rheir applications will be considered. The Government should look at these cases, in a much more sympathetic light. Here is a letter from a man. who ought to be receiving a dependent parent's pension^ENID LYONS -The war Another scandalous imposition is the application of the Financial Emergency Act, Section 43, to the Repatriation Act, whereby parents who were partly dependent or wholly dependent on their single sons prior to enlistment I believe that it is. and unfortunately the lads lost their lives on not. service, the parents are deb.irred from receiving the provisions of the Repatriation Act, I shall show something both in regard to the 1914-18 and 1939-45 wars, unless they are without adequate n\eans of support. . . . Ts the Commonwealth in a state of financial emergency? If not then why is this Section 43 still operating? We have heard loud boasts from Ministers and their supporters recently about prosperity and f u l l employment in Australia. We know that our economy is in a buoyant condition because of the effect of the high prices of wool and wheat and other factors. Everything that we produce is wanted in other countries, and., therefore, prices have increased. This condition is reflected in every industry and business, and there are plenty of jobs available. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) is one of the few memhers of this House who were in the Parliament when the economic blizzard swept the world in the 'thirties and thc Labour government of the day had to make certain retrenchments in order to t r y .to balance its budget. It reduced old-age pensions and some service pensions. One of its emergency measures was the application of this means test to applicants for dependent parents' pensions. As the country climbed out of Two young men, the only the trough of the depression, the succeeding anti-socialist Government, the Lyons administration, gradually restored many of the emergency cuts, and granted service pensions to men who were unable to work, even if they had not reached the age necessary to qualify for the old-age pension. I have often advocated the abolition of this means test, and some of the ex-servicemen on the Government side of the House have supported me. The honourable meinber for Parkes( Mr. Haylen), for instance, will recall the debate in -this chamber last year when he strongly pressed for the abolition of the test. This is only a small matter involving comparatively few people but it involves humane considerations. The",24,Australian Soldiers Repatriationbill 1948 Second Reading
72,Mr White,,25,Australian Soldiers Repatriationbill 1948 Second Reading
73,Mr White,"Government could easily have adjusted the anomaly-long ago and done justice to these elderly people, whose numbers are rapidly dwindling now. memories are of young sons who went away never to return. Yet a grateful country gives them no recompense for tlieir bereavement unless they can prove that thcy are paupers. The Minister has had this matter put before him on many occasions, but he is quite unconcerned. Another anomaly is in the fact that lisabled ex-servicemen of ""World WarI . , who married after 193S, cannot obtain pensions for their wives. This provision is another legacy of the nnanciai I'liiergency. In these prosperous times, it, could well be amended, particularly in view of the fact that small incomes have little purchasing value to-day. I now come to something very damaging to the reputation of the Minister for Repatriation that has happened under his administration. Honourable members know that I have asked several times for reports of the Repatriation Commission t.o be laid on the table of this House. The Minister is obliged, under section 122 of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, tp table all reports from the commission, yet he had not tabled one report luring his tenure of office. reports. asked my question the honourable gentlewar man had not tabled even one. I ask him ing any proof in support of his claim. It not to try to mislead the House. A fte r imposes on Repatriation Boards, which conr had pressed for the presentation of sider claims in thc first instance, and on the these reports, the Minister placed one on Repatriation Commission, which determines the table a week ago. It was then about of establishing beyond any doubt; after drawtwo years old. This Aveek, he tabled ing all reasonable inferences in tlie claimant's another one that should have been prefavour, that the claim falls completely outside sented at the end of June. I asked him the provisions of the Act. many times to table the report of the No. 1 Entitlement Appeal Tribunal, and Repatriation Commission to which an exasked whether it reported adversely on serviceman appealed, but in 1943, arising his administration. He replied that we out of an all-party soldiers' committee would know all about it when it was recommendation to the Parliament, it tabled, but that he would not do so u n t il was made to apply to the Repatriation he had received the report of another Boards as well. I take it that honourable tribunal. Yesterday, almost furtively, it members understand what I mean. Yet was placed on the table, dragged out of the report of the No. 1 Tribunal for the the Minister because this debate was imperiod from the 1st July, 1947, to the 29th pending and he feared that our relevaFebruary, 1948, shows that the a p a r t tions might he even more damaging to ment has ienored that provision. The him if the document were not available. The No. 1 Entitlement Appeal Tribunal is set up under statute and is a pension Their tribunal above the Repatriation Commission. A. man who wants a pension makes application to the Repatriation Department. If it approves, well and good, btu if it does not, he appeals to the Repatriation Commission; if it does not approve, he has the right to appeal to the War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal, a body presided over by a chairman, whicli hears the case. I shall read portion of the report of the No. 1 Tribunal for the year ended the 30th June, 1947, which was tahled in the House last yearOmits of P r o of Prior to 1940 the burden of establishing that the incapacity or death of an ex-serviceman came within the provisions of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, was borne by the claimant for a war pension. That is, the man applying for a pension had to prove that he was disabled through war service. It did not rest on the department. An amendment in 1940 imposed on the Be patriation Commission the onus of disproving the claim, but this appl cd only when thc : claimant appealed to a Tribunal. That was unfair to the soldier; thc department which enlisted him should give the reason for his unfitness if he is unfit to-day.

Inseparable from the question of the burden of proof is the matter of representation of parties at the hearing of the appeal. Despite this, and several other suggestions, whichwere made in the report, the Minister has refused to take any action, and has apparently dominated the department. The 1948 report that he tabled yesterday contains this passageOnus of /'roo/ and. Benefit of Doubt (Section 47). In our last annual report we observed that the provisions of section 47 of the Act were not fully appreciated by the Eepatriation Commission aud its officers. We ipointed out also that proper attention by the Eepatriation Commission to those provisions would have resulted in a considerable number of claims being allowed without the necessity for an appeal to this Tribunal. That is the criticism in this year's report. It proves that no notice wns taken. It continuesNot only has no improvement since been discerned but the position has deteriorated and is adversely affecting widows, sick and wounded ex-members of the forces and their dependants. This is a representative super tribunal reporting on the department and the Minister! The provisions of section 47 are then summarized in the 194S report, as follows:(1) The Repatriation Commission, a Repatriation Board and a Tribunal shall(a) Act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case and shall not be bound by technicalities or legal forms or rules of evidence; (6) Give to the claimant the benefit of any doubt; (c) Draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the claimant. (2) It shall not be necessary for thc claimant' to furnish proof to support his claim; (3) Tlie onus of proving the claim to be outside the provisions of the Act shall lie on the Repatriation Board and the Repatriation Commission. In one instance a tribunal had correspondence w i th the department, but the Minister refused to answer letters over a long period. Finally, the claim was submitted to the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), who ruled that the Entitlement Tribunal was right in its view that generally the onus of proof rested on the that when the bill went through. opposite ever appeared before one of these tribunals on behalf of ex-servicemen, they would see how difficult it is for an unlettered man, who may be very sick, to put his case to a body whose members, he may think, are not sympathetic to his claim. He has already received "" knock-backs "" from the board and from the commission. A whole year may elapse before his appeal comes before the tribunal. I have known appeal cases to last much longer than that. Even when it has reached that stage, the decision may be a. long way off despite the trouble and expense he has been caused. The applicant has also been occasioned considerable worry over the period because the department, abetted by the Minister, has not carried out what the 1943 act has laid down shall be done. The department has evaded its responsibilities in the.matter of onus of proof. I ask honourable members to read the 194S report, which was tabled yesterday. This is one oase quoted in that report:The undermentioned case, which has been heard since the submission of the last annual report, is typical of a great number. It serves to illustrate that the provisions of Section 47 are uot heing applied by the Repatriation Comniission.

The next chairman whom he dismissed is a man aged about 3S vears, and a returned soldier of the 1939-45 war. He lost an eye in the fighting. Although he had excellent business prospects, he felt that he had an obligation to the men with whom he had served, and therefore gave np his prospects to accept the appointment on this tribunal. After signing the document that I am quoting from, he was not re-appointed. ber referring to Mr Hickey? wlio was appointed before Mr Hickey, resigned. This tribunal was dismissed by the trick, or device, of not re-appointing the members because they conscientiously did their duty and dared to point out to the Minister that a certain section of the department was not carrying out its duty. It was only yesterday, following all the fuss that I have made over the last few weeks, that the Minister disgorged this report. I now revert to the case I was ahout to quote from it. Excluding the soldier's name, the particulars furnished are as follow:Lieutenant War. (File RX.06328.) This ex-member of the R.A.N.V.R. served vvith distinction for over four years. He was engaged on special duties behind the Japanese lines in New Guinea from April, 1942, to August, 1943, and was evacuated by submarine in an emaciated and starving condition. In December, 1943, he again went into enemyoccupied territory and was evacuated with pneumonia in February, 1944. In November, 1944, he re-entered enemy-occupied territory and organized a guerrilla force, returning to allied territory in May, 1945. He was awarded the British Distinguished Service Cross and the United States Distinguished Service Cross. Is that not a record to be proud of? This man was awarded the British Distinguished Service Cross and the Distinguished Service Cross of the United States of America. The report continuedHe appealed to this Tribunal for Defective Vision, "" loss of teeth "", and stated kis ground* of appeal to beDefective Vision-""that il was aggravated by eye-strain, starvation, privations and nervous strain caused liy work done hy thc allied cause"". Loss of Teeth"" tliat it was due to bad available and should have been obtained by the food, ill health and lack of dental attencommission itself on a. proper investigation tion "". The two members of this Parliament who were prisoners of war in the hands of the Japanese have no doubt seen many cases of blindness among fellow prisoners due to diet deficiencies. This blindness may not be obvious. He may still have some measure of vision, but his sight is not good enough to permit him to read or to carry on his vocation. The report continuesThe tribunal upheld the appeal, for both conditions. So, after finding his tortuous way through departmental channels, the man finally came before the tribunal, and his appeal was upheld. And this is the tribunal that has been dismissed because it dared to clo its job by drawing the attention of the Minister to certain deficiencies. The report further statesThis gallant ex-serviceman was greatly upset by the initial rejection of his claims, whicli on the evidence should have been accepted when he first applied. Xo controversial or difficult questions, either of law or fact, which could justify the original rejection of the claims, arose in any one of those cases. I have mentioned only one case. The report cites quite a numbe r of cases concernin g ex-servicemen from the various services. The y are a l l as obvious as the . D.S.C., R.A.N.V.R -193 9 one to w h i c h I have r e f e r r e d .

The r e p o r t continuesThey were simple and straightforward and. on the evidence before the commission, fell fairly within the entitlement provisions of the act. But they were rejected out of hand by the Repatriation Commission without any reasons being assigned. An intelligent marshalling of the facts, and a proper application of the relevant provisions of the act to those facts in the first instance would have obviated the necessity for an appeal. The provisions of section 47 bind the Repatriation Commission to .probe the merit of every pension claimed before rejecting it . In many cases further evidence could and should have licen obtained by the commission before claims were' ever rejected. Too often the gathering of evidence favorable to a claim is left to the appellant or his representative, usually an ex-scrvicc organization, and it is produced to a tribunal at a tribunal appeal. If this evidence is substantiated the tribunal is then bound to refer the case back to the commission for review (section 64 ( 4 ) ) . In many such cases the Repatriation Commission then accepts the claim on the fresh evidence which wae of the claim in the first instance.",27,Australian Soldiers Repatriationbill 1948 Second Reading

Another man.Then the tribunal deals with the correspondenee that it had with the Minister, and concludes by sayingXo reply has been received to tliis letter. yesterday, but to-day he has tabled the Those men have been endeavouring to induce the commission to do its work fairly. They are conscientious servants, and want the right thing to be done. Their object, I emphasize, was not to minimize their own work. It would have been quite easy for them to travel along quietly. But they wanted the matter to he dealt with in the first instance by the commission, and because they drew attention to the fact that certain ex-servicemen were not being properly treated, and the commission was not accepting the onus of proof, the Minister found a reason for not re-appointing them, and has tried to justify his action by claiming that the chairman resigned. The Minister has adopted cowardly tacrics. He stands indicted for his administration of this matter. Any Minister who endeavours to justify actions of this kind in his department should be forced to resign by the Cabinet. I say that after very much thought. I know the limitations that a Minister suffers. Very often a Minister finds it impossible to secure the agreement of Cabinet to a proposal which he believes to be right, and is forced to swallow his own opinions, but 1 should like to know whether or not this matter was ever brought to the notice of Cabinet. If not, the Minister should not be permitted to retain his post. I have been tolerant with this Minister in the past. I realize that he is not very quick on the uptake, but I thought that at least lie was prepared to do what was right and had. a humanitarian, outlook. I cannot understand how he let that report pass him by in view of the many strictures that it contains. The report says that many men whose applications were rejected did not apply again. They were humbugged so much that they did not apply again. No doubt some of them died in the interim; but apparently that did not worry anybody or induce the Minister to lay the report on the table. I regret that I have had to raise these matters in this way. I should have preferred the Minister to tell the House about them. Having failed to do so, he has been, i consider, recreant to his trust. and should be suspended while this matter is being investigated by the Government. At least, that was my strong feeling report. Honourable members may now read it and judge whether or not I am right. I have received many bitter letters and telegrams, but I have read only a few of them. I have cited the case of an ex-naval man who was shamefully treated. I hope, therefore, that this will be a lesson to. the Minister, and that he will ensure in future that such cases shall receive better consideration. Instead of continuing the present haphazard method of handing out a few more shillings to pensioners the entire matter should be placed on a non-party basis. It is to that end that I have moved my amendment. I hope that it will be accepted by the Government. have listened with great attention to the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr ""White), whose interest in ex-servicemen has been long aud continuous. I was surprised, however, that having outlined what appeared to be a reasonable complaint, he launched into a vicious attack on the Minister on matters which, in my view, can be explained reasonably. Some of them are not of a serious consequence, and others are highly debatable. I believe that the question of pensions, particularly repatriation pensions, should be discussed in a more sober atmosphere. The honourable member has moved for the appointment of another select committee to examine once again the repercussions and ramifications of the Australian Soldiers' Bepatriation Act. I believe that the Minister for Bepatriation ( Mr Barnard) has done a very good job. I resent the perfervid criticism of him, particularly the nonsensical use of the phrase "" semi-furtively"", in connection with the Minister's action in presenting the report of the Entitlement Tribunal. The honourable member ha? made an outrageous attack, and his ridiculous statements are not part of his general attitude towards these matters. His sincerity cannot be doubted, but he spoiled his case by his overbearing manner towards the end of his speech. With regard to the papers that he mentioned, one is dated the 8th October, so",28,Australian Soldiers Repatriationbill 1948 Second Reading
83,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [12.2],"1his long-winded story about dreary weeks -of waiting is all nonsense. Then he read -extracts from cases which had beeu unsuccessfully represented. That sort of thing has been going on for a long time. All honourable members have had experience of cases which, on the surface, appear to warrant better treatment. In many instances, there have been long-fought battles based on ex parte statements. Even some of the statements contained in the reference read by the Minister show only one side of the story. Perhaps the Minister helped him There are other cac.es that could be adduced in defence of the Repatriation Department, the policy and work of which continue no matter what government is in office. There is no doubt that some of the claims made are overstated, but in the anxiety of honourable members to give at least a reasonable and fair "" go"" to the ex-servicemen, some cases which have no very good basis are enthusiastically canvassed. I have canvassed them myself and shall continue to do so until I find that I am wrong. There are some cases that have been fought out with the department over a long period. There was an instance of one such fight which began immediately after the end of the last war. The man concerned is now receiving a special pension, but I admit that the rebuttals by the tribunal of some of the evidence that f produced were valid. That case finally reached the stage where the decision of the tribunal was investigated. I refer to the Farrell case, in which the Minister made a common sacrifice and shared comdecided that the applicant had a sufficient mon hardships during the war, their case and awarded him an adequate pension. During the whole of the correspondence in that case, which reached the proportion of a foot-high file, various facts had to be brought out and examined before a final decision could be reached. In many instances a most thorough investigation has to be made before it can be decided whether an ex-serviceman is eligible for a pension or not. It is rather strange that the honourable Australia had never engaged in a war of member for Balaclava ( Mr White), who is familiar with the work of the Repatriabusiness of repatriation as we went along. tion Department should begin with an assault on the Minister, and then should discover some glorious qualities in the tribunal. I believe that the greatest Mr Haylen. lack of all in the system is to be found in the tribunal, but the commission gets the blame for ihe rather haphazard procedure followed. I consider that the Minister, in his executive capacity, is entitled to decide what he intends to do with the tribunals, or to come to some decision regarding their utility, and I do not consider that he should be questioned about his decision as though he had committed a serious breach by seeking efficiency. Some mention was made of the chairman getting another job. to get it. I do not know. Such matters are well away from the subject that the House should be discussing to-day. The pensions provided in the bill do not mean that any great amount of money is being given to the ex-servicemen, but I believe that what they are to receive is fair, and at a just level in the financial circumstances. The increases of war pensions will cost in a full year, £1,764,000. and certain of the facts that were given by the Minister appear to give him a valid reason for saying that the increases constitute a step forward. I turn now to the sustenance for ex-servicemen in hospital. There are so many things that run tandem with pension increases that we should be grateful when subsidiary items are adjusted. The Government has found great difficulty, when dealing with the problems, of ex-servicemen, in correcting certain anomalies. Although the ex-servicemen problems are by no means common to all. Indeed, they are very individual. Some of the claims made by ex-servicemen are backed up by high advocacy but would not bear full investigation. In other cases, the department has to contend with a legacy of past mismanagement. That mismanagement grew-up because the first repatriation act and the first Repatriation Department were both entirely new to Australia. Prior to World WarI . such dimensions. We had to learn the I think that all honourable members will agree that despite some anomalies the Government is endeavouring to be as fair as possible to iix-servicemen. pect which I must again mention, hecause it is one that crops up frequently in the correspondenee of most honourable members, is the question of sustenance for soldiers in hospital. I believe that I am correct in saying that there will be a consequential increase in sustenance allowances because of the increases of pensions. Minister is examining the position of ex-servicemen who enter repatriation hospitals and do not receive pay while they a re there. The Minister is seeking a plan which will remove that anomaly, which is ;i serious and hurtful one for the individuals concerned. It is bad enough to he sick, but to be sick and worried is doubly tragic, and I am sure that all honourable members will be pleased if a sensible and workable plan can be established. All honourable members will agree that the Government has made a definite move forward in the rate of sustenance payments for ex-servicemen in hospitals. Tliere is to he an increase of service penyears right through to completion of training sions consequential on the increase of age and invalid pensions. An ex-serviceman, because he is "" burnt out"" as a result of his war service, is entitled to receive his pass through several distinct phases of pension earlier in life than other pensioners. The all-round 5s. increase of pensions seems to have been accepted despite the plea, of the Returned Sailors, -Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia and kindred organizations for a much higher rate for ex-servicemen. They may have accepted it reluctantly, hut I believe that they have done so because the increase in service pensions is on the same rate as that of other pensions. The only protests I have received relative to the increase have been from ex-servicemen who receive special pensions. It was stated in a speech by either obtain high-level employment, and so the Minister himself or the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) that a 10 per cent, increase had been promised and in most cases would amount to 5s. Many men receiving the higher special rate of pension, who are dealt with separately in respect of the increases, contend that the 10 per cent, rate should apply to them One important asan'd that they should receive a 10s. instead of a 5s. increase. I am referring to totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners. That position has been strenuously contested in many of the branches of ex-servicemen's organizations in my electorate. I have had a number of representations regarding it, in view of whicli 1 would like the Minister to make the position clear. While not satisfied that we are giving ex-servicemen all that tliey deserve, I consider that, within the capacity of the budget, the Government has tried to be as fair as possible to them and extend privileges over the greatest area, so that a "" blanket"" increase can apply. The Minister's remarks concerning repatriation generally were interesting and among them was a particularly interesting reference to the soldiers' children education scheme. The Minister stated in his second-reading speechThe third general benefit is the soldiers' children education scheme, which covers assistance for the education and training of children of deceased, blinded, and totally and permanently incapacitated members. The general plan is supervision and guidance from about the age of ten years, and assistance by way of allowances from thc age of thirteen with an employer, or to graduation at a university. Honourable members realize that children education, and the rate of the allowances is graduated accordingly. I urge the Minister to take a special and paternal interest in this phase of repatriation. A l though many of the disablements suffered by servicemen are irreparable, wo can go a long way towards compensating such service men by making special provisions for tlieir children. If they are the children of men killed in action we can help to make them worthy of their splendid parents. By providing special educational facilities for the children we can make it possible for those children to compensate indirectly, but effectively, the disabled servicemen who suffered so much for their country. Nothing is so heart breaking or so shattering to a young wife and children as the loss of her husband and their father. From that day forward the living standards of the widow and her children are, in almost every instance.",29,Australian Soldiers Repatriationbill 1948 Second Reading

Whilst the Government mid the Minister have already done a great deal to assist' the dependants of deceased, blinded and totally and permanently incapacitated servicemen, I believe that it may be possible to do even more for those dependants. From my knowledge of the Minister, I know that he will do everything possible to expand the scheme, but in fairness to those families which have been called upon to make -uch great sacrifices, even the most strenuous efforts of the Minister will not !*> enough. In the administration of any such scheme, the Government should guard against any tendency towards niggardliness.

Indeed, they tell remarkable stories of almost miraculous achievements by young boys and girls. I note with approval the useful work done by the Repatriation Commission in making loans to ex-servicemen to establish them in business and professions. An amount of £4,200,000 has been expended in that way. Tools of trade have been provided, by way of gift, to the value of £1,610,000, and by way of loans to a value of £204,000. I understand that, in addition, tools of trade are to be provided for the ex-servicemen amongst the stream of migrants from Great Britain. We hope that in a few years that 3tream will become a flood. I have no doubt that our generosity will be repaid in material results, because it will enable us to utilize the services of many .thousands of British tradesmen to assist us to solve the greatest problem which confronts us at present, namely, the scarcity of housing accommodation. I pause here to pay a compliment to the Sydney staff of the Repatriation Commission, for whom I have nothing but the highest praise.

The Government cannot deny the fact that thebasis of pensions for ex-servicemenis being altered under this measure which places the ex-service pensioner on the same footing as invalid and age pensioners so far as the property bar is concerned. The measure provides that an ex-service pensioner who possesses property in excess of a certain value will not receive any service pension whatsoever. and the general pension are altogether different. honourable member call the general pension ? granted in respect of a war-caused disability, whereas a service pension is paid to a burnt-out serviceman who is not suffering from a war-caused disability. pension? the age pension given to an ex-serviceman five years before he reaches the age of 65 years. That pension was instituted by the Lyons Government. out what I have been saying. The service pension is not being treated as an entitlement at all. Actions speak louder than words, and such action makes worthless all the Minister's talk last week about pensions being made available as a right and not as a charity. Under this measure, the Government does not recognize the right of certain classes of exday evening it rejected an amendment proposed by the honourable memher for Swan( Mr Hamilton) to exclude war pensions from the application of the pensions on the ground that the service pension was an economic pension andnot an entitlement due to an ex-serviceman because of incapacity resulting from his war service.

That practice was adopted in connection with an amendment proposed by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) to a bill similar to that now before us. After the amendment had been rejected by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr a certain age all ex-servicemen became Dedman), it found its way into the legislation ""Clark) -The honourable member may not refer to what has occurred in respect of some other legislation. of a similar kind to that now before us and accordingly my remarks are pertinent to the subject before the Chair. We do uot mind if that practice be continued in this instance as long as the ex-serviceman will get the benefit to which we believe he is entitled. I should like the Minister to explain the reason for the insertion in the bill of sub-clause 2 of clause 4 which readsA member of tbe Forces who is permanently unemployable and who would, but for the fact that he is receiving an age or invalid pension, under the Social Services Consolidation Act 1947-1948, be eligible for a service pension, may surrender the age or invalid pension, and, thereupon, a service pension may be granted to him from, the date of the surrender, and service undoubtedly have something to say to pensions may be granted to the wife and children of that member as from the date of his application for a service pension. Is this clause intended .to cover burntont cx-servicemen? that it relates to burnt-out ex-servicemen who are unemployable as the result of war service. Surely such men are entitled to pensions, not because of their age, but because of their incapacity. When they reach a certain age they should also he entitled to receive the age pension. Mi*. BABNABD -There is no innovation in this proposal. Government propose to amend the Principal Act in this way? I object to the whole of the altered basis upon which eligibility for pensions is to be determined. I have no desire to weary honourable members on this subject, hut only by repetition can I hope to drive home to the Government the anomaly which it is creating by this legislation. Since World WarI . disabled ex-servicemen have received war pensions even if they are in receipt of £4,000 or £10,000 a year.

I criticism of this measure but I shall not allow the Minister to ."" put it over "" me that a burnt-out ex-serviceman does not. suffer from a disability due to his war service.

After the next election I shall the successor of this Government, and I shall say it to that Government just a9 vehemently as I do to the Government now in office. The Minister for Repatriation is well aware that the pensions paid to war widows represent a mere pittance. Much has been made by honourable memhers opposite of what the Government proposes to pay to war widows with four, five, six or seven children. They have endeavoured to create the impression that that is the criterion by which the plight of a war widow should he judged. war widows in Australia are the highest in the world. the pension paid in other countries must be exceedingly low.

119,Mr Bowden,"If that be so, thenthis matter, has stated that even after they receive the 5s. increase in their pensions war widows will be worse off than they were years ago. I agree that if a war widow receives £7 or £8 a week she has not much to complain about. Let us rather consider the plight of a widow with oue child who receives a pension of £2 7s. 6d. a week.

No meanttest is applied in connection with war widows' pensions. The honourable member is confusing the '-ivii pension paid to ordinary widows with that paid to war widows. made a mistake and apologize to the Minister for confusing civil pensions with those paid to war widows. The civil pension paid to a widow with one child is 47s. 6d. a week and the permissible income is fixed at a maximum of '!0s. a week. If a widow is unable to earn that amount she may well starve. A war widow with one child receives a pension <>f £3 17s. 6d., which is equal to the total amount an ordinary widow may derive from, both pension and earnings. Having regard to the existing scale of rents and the high cost of feeding and clothing herself and her child, such a widow would not enjoy a very handsome standard of living. -he could. better than that paid after World War I. when governments formed by the Opposition parties were in office. ihat the sole contribution some honourable members can make to a debate is to refer to what may have happened after World WarI .

I have already said that 5s. in those days had a purchasing power equal to that of 15s. to-day. Yet supporters of the Government compare pension rates in actual units of money instead of on the basis of value. The Minister would be well advised to accept the guidance of the War Widows Craft Guild, a body which is capable of giving him all the data he requires to formulate a scheme that will at least give some satisfaction to everybody instead of a little satisfaction to a few. The Minister received a deputation of war widows, and I believe he was rather nonplussed. I can understand that, because I have heard Mrs. Vasey speak.
