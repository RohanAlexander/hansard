This conflict has taken the lives of over 70,000 people and displaced some 400,000 people, who are now living in refugee camps. The coalition welcomes any welltargeted measures that extend humanitarian assistance to those innocent victims of this conflict and helps facilitate both parties following the path of a sustainable peace agreement.

221,Mr Robb (Goldstein) (5.28 Pm),"I rise possible for the sake of all the citizens of SriThursday, 5 February 2009 ----Mackellar Electorate: Judy Dubois important member of our community in my seat of Mackellar, one Judy Dubois. Judy is a person who has a history of involvement in community groups and of giving of herself selflessly, but she is also a vital member of the Liberal Party. Judy is the epitome of the sort of people we love to have within our membership-people who are vitally involved in the community and who also serve in a political party and, therefore, bring knowledge of what is happening among our people to the attention of the local member and the party as a whole. Judy volunteered 34 years ago as an instructor for the learn-to-swim program at Narrabeen pool and she has only just retired after 34 years of service. This is a community based organisation that provides free swimming lessons for children, which are so vital on our northern beaches where we have such vast, beautiful beaches as well as pools. The appalling tragedies that have been reported of children who have drowned because they were unable to swim just make the work that Judy did over those 34 years all the more important. Judy also spent 10 years working for Meals on Wheels, visiting people who either had disabilities or were aged and unable to leave their home as much as they would have liked. Judy is a warm person who came in and was part of their lives. Judy is also someone who carried the Olympic torch as one of the volunteers and I am proud to have hanging in my office a wonderful photograph of her holding it high as she was recognised for her involvement in the community. For the past 30 years Judy has served as branch secretary of the North Narrabeen-Elanora Heights branch, but she has now been elected the vice-president, which is a good and just reward, I think, as 30 years of her being the secretary meant that that branch was always well run with good agendas, orderly meetings and good records. Judy has also been a strong campaigner. She has been the manager of the prepolling booths. She has been involved in all of my campaigns since the by-election and every election since, as she is for our state members as well. Judy is a valued member of our community. She is someone who has the great affection of many people within the community. Judy is also a member of the Motor Neurone Disease Association of New South Wales and understands what a dreadful disease that is. Judy is someone who, I would like to put on the record, has given of herself and is loved by many. (Time expired) Franklin Electorate: Egg Islands Reserve Ms COLLINS (Franklin) (10.33 am)-I rise this morning to talk about a recent visit to my electorate by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I was fortunate to be involved in a visit with the minister to a small town south of Hobart-called Franklin, strangely enough. We were there to announce the Egg Islands reserve as part of Australia’s National Reserve System. We were privileged to be able to go in a small rowboat-an old MAIN COMMITTEE",115,Ministerial Statements

223,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar) (10.30 Am),"I rise to speak this morning about anwooden boat built in the Franklin area. The Franklin area in my electorate is renowned for its wooden-boat-building skills and the museum down there. We got to row out to have a look at the Egg Islands reserve that we are announcing. It was quite special. These islands are very low-lying islands. They have some of Australia’s unique flora and fauna on them. As I said, they were announced as part of the National Reserve System. The Australian government provided $200,000 to help establish this Egg Islands reserveit is a national reserve-together with the Tasmanian Land Conservancy, which is a not-forprofit organisation that raises funds and donations to purchase land to have it reserved for its natural values so that future generations can appreciate its beauty. It really was interesting to see the cooperation between the local community, the Australian government and this not-forprofit organisation in working together to get these islands protected. This is 125 hectares of bushland that we have now protected forever. There is a whole range of birds, mammals and reptiles-including short-beaked echidnas and pademelons-on this newly created reserve. But it also has international and national significance as a wetland habitat that accommodates the endangered black gum forest. The islands are just spectacular. I am really passionate about protecting these islands and I was really pleased that we were part of that announcement. It really is about conserving and protecting this unique environment. The Rudd government plans to increase Australia’s National Reserve System by 25 per cent to 125 million hectares by 2013, and we have dedicated $180 million to the Caring for Our Country program to assist with this. This means that we will continue preserving environmentally important sites around Australia so that our children and the generations to come can enjoy the sights and sounds. I was a bit concerned when I arrived to go to these Egg Islands as the locals call them the snake islands. Needless to say, I did not get out of the boat, and nor did the minister. But it was fantastic to see them. I would like to also put on record my appreciation for what the Tasmanian Land Conservancy is doing. It is a large organisation and it is doing some fantastic work. (Time expired) Hinkler Electorate: Telecommunications been fielding complaints about telecommunications services and infrastructure-or, more precisely, the lack of services and infrastructure-for weeks on end. Every day, serious complaints about phone lines dropping out, services being disconnected without reason, lengthy breakdowns in email services and a failure to have existing accounts switched over to new providers have flooded in. Telstra, Optus-all the major telecommunications players-need to stop clowning around with their customers. I am not criticising employees working at the coalface-the techs et cetera. I save my comments for those further up the organisational chain of command in those companies. Telstra has been by far the most common target of complaint. Let me quote from one constituent who outlined his problems in a recent letter to the editor: On January 12 I rang Telstra about the sudden increase in my broadband bill, and after about three hours on the phone, that little problem was sorted out … Lo and behold, some bright spark decided to disconnect my phone line on the same day … for the next nine days, I spent over 30 hours talking to people and still not getting the problem fixed. MAIN COMMITTEE",116,Constituency Statements
224,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (10.36 Am),"I am not exaggerating when I say that my office hasJust this week my office was informed of a situation where for two months a customer had been without a phone because Optus failed to ‘port across’-that is the expression-a number to Telstra. The gentleman who rang for help simply wanted to change providers-to go from Optus to Telstra-and made his original request at the beginning of December. For two months he waited with no home phone and operated a home business from his mobile phone. It was not until he contacted my office in January that things started to happen for him and I am hopeful that the problem will now be resolved. If it is not, I will be making a ‘please explain’ request to Telstra on his behalf. It is galling enough when a home phone or internet service fails, but even worse when your business depends on it. Without exaggerating, there are local businesses in my electorate which have lost thousands of dollars worth of potential business because their phone lines have not been working. Small business is copping it tough right now and, if service providers cannot get their act together for both business and residential customers, things are only going to get worse. In these tough times, that sort of conduct is inexcusable. Deakin Electorate: Rainwater Tanks ment’s National Rainwater and Greywater Initiative. This is a $250 million program that delivers on our election commitment to deliver rebates for water tanks. My electorate of Deakin stands to benefit substantially from this program. Many constituents contact me about watersaving programs and it is certainly good news that we can deliver this through a Commonwealth program in support of the existing state rebate programs. Rebates are provided to the owner of the dwelling under this initiative for the purchase and installation of a new rainwater tank, which is connected for internal re-use of the water for the toilet and/or the laundry. Alternatively, rebates are paid for the purchase and installation of a permanently plumbed-in greywater treatment system. In both situations the installation must be done by a licensed plumber to attract the rebate. For rainwater tanks from 3,999 litres to 2,000 litres there is a $400 rebate, and for those over 4,000 litres there is a $500 rebate. These rebates are available for tanks or systems purchased after 30 January 2009 and are not subject to means testing. The good news is that these rebates apply on top of the Victorian state government’s rebate for water tanks. The state government rebate can be up to $1,000 for a tank of 5,000 litres or greater. When added to the Commonwealth rebate, a total of $1,500 can be claimed as a rebate from the two levels of government. For example, a typical 5,000-litre polyethylene tank can be purchased and delivered in Deakin for under $1,500. Added to this cost is around $1,500 for installation, which includes piping and a basic pump unit. This is a total of under $3,000 for a 5,000-litre tank system. When the $1,500 worth of rebates is factored in, the total cost of the rainwater tank and its installation drops to under $1,500. Whilst many community facilities and schools in Deakin have rainwater collection tanks, the take-up rate for households is much lower. Figures show that rainwater tanks are currently used by only a small percentage of urban Australian households-an average of less than 10 per cent for capital cities other than Adelaide. In Melbourne in January this year, the recorded rainfall was only 0.8 millimetres and a heatwave of record temperatures was recorded over many days. As unpleasant as extremes of MAIN COMMITTEE",117,Constituency Statements
225,Mr Symon (Deakin) (10.39 Am),"TodayI would like to talk about the Rudd governweather such as this can be, there is a side effect-that is, an increased interest in the installation of home rainwater tanks. With greater rebates available, there has been no better time to invest in a rainwater tank system. I commend this initiative and urge the householders of Deakin and the rest of Australia to seriously consider doing their bit to save water and reduce their annual water bills. Mayo Electorate: Lower Lakes from the member for Deakin. However, I speak of the greatest environmental disaster our country faces, which is in my electorate, the Lower Lakes, at the end of Murray-Darling Basin system. This week we acknowledge the contribution of Peter Howson, who was the first environment minister from this side of politics back in 1971. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Higgins spoke eloquently in the House of Representatives about his contribution. It reminds us of the importance of that portfolio. I think we on this side of parliament have a proud record in that regard. The original focus on the environment was by Theodore Roosevelt, a former United States President, who came from our side of politics as well. Two years ago, the Leader of the Opposition and the then Prime Minister announced a groundbreaking plan for the Murray-Darling Basin system. Unfortunately, since that time nothing really genuine has happened. Now the Lower Lakes in my electorate is an absolute disaster. Yesterday, there was a report released which stated that by April just near Clayton on the Lower Lakes in my electorate you will be able to walk across the Goolwa Channel. That is quite an extraordinary thing. I urge all members to have a look at this report. If they do, they will see how large a mass of land that actually is and how little water there is in that system. The state government tells us that as the water recedes acid sulphate soil is developing. I have no reason to question their science. Their scientists seem quite convinced by this. When we have windy, hot days we get dust storms in Goolwa, Clayton and other places. These dust storms are whipping up this acid sulphate soil, which is having significant health effects on my constituents in that area. I am very concerned about this issue. I have written to the state health minister. I am hoping he will hold a full inquiry into this. Quite a lot of my constituents are contacting my office with concerns about their health and well-being. There is some evidence that this is having an effect. This highlights the urgent need for some action and some genuine leadership on this issue. We are far beyond the point of talking. We need some action on this issue. We need some water in the system. We need the lakes to be fixed. Rather than talk about it, I urge the government to start to take some action. The dust storms are another side effect of a bigger problem. We have to do something in the short term. We are far beyond talking about this anymore. Melbourne Ports Electorate: Child Care be built in Port Melbourne, the second of the two childcare centres promised by the government at the election. Victoria and the City of Port Phillip are experiencing a once-in-ageneration baby boom, with 1,287 babies born in the City of Port Phillip in 2007-a 28 per cent increase in births over the previous five-year period. During the 2007 election campaign, Labor promised to establish up to 260 early learning and childcare centres to address unmet demand around the country. We are fulfilling that MAIN COMMITTEE",118,Constituency Statements
226,Mr Briggs (Mayo) (10.42 Am),"I, too, rise to speak on the issue of water, following on",119,Constituency Statements
227,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (10.45 Am),"An early learning and childcare centre willpromise. Port Melbourne is lucky to be nominated as one of the 38 priority sites in the first round of funding. A $4 million centre will be built in Liardet Street. There will be long day care places and access to maternal and child health services. This joint government initiative demonstrates the positive outcomes that governments can achieve when they work together. Funding for the centre has been provided by the Australian government, $1.6 million; the Victoria government, $1.2 million; and the Port Phillip council, $1.7 million. It is wonderful. But now many in Melbourne Ports are rightfully worried about the fate of the two ABC Learning Centres in South Melbourne and East St Kilda. Despite having an occupancy rate of 75 per cent, due to the mismanagement of ABC Learning they are both considered by those people who have looked at them to be unviable. A report in Australian this week gives an account of the scandalous way in which the nation’s now defunct largest childcare provider ran its business. The article says that many of the 241 ABC Learning Centres classified as unviable have rents that are far too high. One centre on the outskirts of Brisbane catering for 150 children was paying $700,000 a year in rent. One of the bidders for the Brisbane centre said that some of the rents are nonsensical. Some of them have 100 per cent occupancy but they are not running at profit. About 80 of the 241 failing ABC centres are owned by the Australian Education Trust, which is in turn owned by Austock-a company in which ABC founder Eddy Groves has a four per cent stake. The chairman of Austock is Bill Bessemer, a founder director of ABC Learning. ABC Learning paid Austock a total of $48.3 million in commissions, corporate services and management fees between ABC’s float in 2001 and 2006. ABC Learning, Mr Groves and Austock have a lot to answer for. Their mismanagement and, I dare say, greed are likely to leave thousands of children in my electorate and in other electorates without care. I call on the liquidator to make these centres with large occupancies viable. All members, whether they are in opposition or in government, should put pressure on the liquidator and the owners to do this-lower the rents so these failing centres can continue to exist and provide child care to children right across the country. Nation Building and Jobs Plan the stimulus package unintended consequences of that package. I questioned whether the package was an optimal solution. I certainly questioned the fact that we had to take the Prime Minister on trust that the package being put forward by this government was in fact optimal. The Prime Minister has form on unintended consequences because of policies that have not been properly thought through. Last night in my contribution, I brought to the attention of the House one such unintended consequence in relation to the sale of second-hand trucks. I would like to expand on that this morning in this chamber. A business in my electorate, Mid Coast Trucks, a substantial employer in the town of Macksville, where unemployment is high and where jobs are highly valued, is being adversely affected by a poorly thought through policy. The fact is that if you purchase a new truck you will be eligible for the tax rebate under the stimulus package. If you purchase a second-hand truck you will not be eligible. We questioned the Treasurer’s office on this. We asked for clarification. Is this true? Are second-hand trucks not going to be the subject of the rebate? They said that is correct. They felt that more jobs would be created if the MAIN COMMITTEE",119,Constituency Statements
228,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (10.48 Am),"I raised in my contribution to the debate onrebate went to new trucks. But nothing is further from the truth. For a start, many new trucks are imported. In the case of the sale of second-hand trucks they are, in many cases, substantially reconditioned. That reconditioning can include work on the engine, work on the chassis, new windscreens and new tyres. A lot of work goes into the reconditioning of a second-hand truck, and that work could be done locally in the community by local tradesmen. In the case of the purchase of a new truck, which is just shipped in from overseas and virtually sent straight to the purchaser of that truck, there is little local input going into it. Here we have a consequence where there is a tax break at a cost of $2.7 billion to the taxpayer-that is, a 30 per cent rebate available for the purchase of a new truck, which is imported and which supports workers in Japan or another overseas country. When it comes to a local worker in the town of Macksville whose job is dependent on reconditioned trucks, purchasers of trucks are being encouraged through this tax break to move from the purchase of a used truck with a high local labour content to perhaps a new truck, which is fully imported with very little local labour content. This just highlights the fact that this package has not been fully thought through. We have a $2.7 billion cost to revenue-a cost to revenue that is actually potentially detracting from local jobs and detracting from the ability of young people to get an apprenticeship in the field of truck repair and maintenance, and it is quite clearly of concern. Holt Electorate: Australia Day Awards tralia Day this year, on a magnificent summer’s day, I had the honour on behalf of the Holt electorate to celebrate and publicly recognise unsung heroes in our community by presenting the Holt Australia Day awards to over 20 special people and organisations. It is a great Australian quality that many individuals in this great country give their time and effort in a typically understated way to help improve the lives of others. They ask for no recognition for their work. In fact, they are often embarrassed when their contributions are recognised, but I feel that they should be recognised because they are great role models for our young people and because of the hope that they offer to many. SoI take this opportunity-and I hope that I do not run out of time-to mention the special individuals and organisations that were honoured at the Holt Australia Day Community Spirit Awards. On behalf of all of us here in this federal parliament, I want to thank them for their selfless service and contribution to our community. This year’s recipients were: Anne Atkin of Painting with Parkinson’s; Robina Bell of the Warren Opportunity Shop; Les Boyes of Neighbourhood Renewal; Brenda Chessum of the Warren Opportunity Shop; Judaline Fonseca of Helping Hands of St Joseph; Gamini Fonseka of the Springvale Neighbourhood House; Chou Gai for his wonderful efforts in working with the Sudanese community; Michele Halsall of the Hampton Park Community Renewal Committee and Southern Cross Kids Camp; Allison Harvey of the Warren Opportunity Shop; Lady Uppity Crust, a wonderful community-minded local resident renowned for her quick smile and keen dress sense; Patrick Merrett, an outstanding member of the Doveton and Hallam country fire authority brigades for nearly half a century; Wendy Murphy, Secretary of the Hampton Park Networking Group; Anton Nadarajah for his long standing work with the Migrant Resource Centre; Brian Neave of the Warren Opportunity Shop; Brett Owen, our local police youth resource officer-a young man building vital bridges with many young people in our region; Sankara Subramanian and Kumararuban Vairananthan of the Victorian Tamil CulMAIN COMMITTEE",120,Constituency Statements

All of those people that I have mentioned here today in this place, through the threads of their many stories of their contribution to the community, sum up to me-and I am sure to other members-what it means to be Australian. Ms Pauline Talty circumstances of a courageous young woman who this morning is lying in a Sydney hospital bed wondering whether this time next year she will still be alive. That hospital bed has been her home now for almost 12 months. Thirty-six-year-old Pauline Talty has had a difficult life to say the least. She was stricken with cancer as a two-year-old. Unfortunately, the radiation therapy that saved her life then permanently damaged her bowel. In her 20s she battled and survived cervical cancer. Despite all of these setbacks, Pauline fought to live as normal a life as possible, studying at university and working in several careers. She married and bought a home-just normal, everyday aspirations but perhaps remarkable achievements given all that this young woman has been through. Now Pauline Talty is fighting again. Four years ago her bowel collapsed and her health steadily deteriorated, and certainly has deteriorated since. Today medical experts all seem to agree on one thing-that is, she needs a small bowel transplant. In October last year Pauline Talty applied under the Medical Treatment Overseas Program for funding to be sent to a specialist bowel transplant unit at Pittsburgh in the United States. In January the Department of Health and Ageing informed her that she did not qualify for MTOP assistance, failing to meet one of four criteria which states that: … an effective alternative treatment must not be available in Australia in time to benefit the patient. The department’s position is that Austin Hospital in Melbourne can provide that alternative. Austin is of course a renowned medical institution, but it is my understanding that the Austin has never carried out a small bowel transplant. Three senior medical specialists-Dr David Storey of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Professor Ross Smith of the Royal North Shore Hospital and Dr Michael Crawford as Surgical Director of the National Liver Transplant Unit-have all supported Pauline’s application to travel to Pittsburgh for treatment. All declare that they do not believe that the Austin Hospital can successfully treat her, yet the department of health has now asked her to travel to Melbourne to again be assessed by staff at the Austin Hospital. I am not a medical expert, but I have taken advice from medical experts and, in addition to that, I can only rely on what specialist surgeons who are treating Pauline say-those who know her medical condition best. It is clear that their opinion is that they see in Pauline a MAIN COMMITTEE",121,Constituency Statements

I have written to the minister for health asking for her department to break through the bureaucratic red tape that is surrounding this particular arrangement and to arrive at a decision, and to do it expeditiously. The government needs to reverse its decision. If the minister for health is not able to haul her department into line, then the Prime Minister needs to become involved. Time is clearly of the essence for this young woman. All Australians should get behind Pauline Talty’s case. Shortland Electorate: Meals on Wheels Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.57 am)-On 19 January, I assisted one of the drivers for Charleston Meals on Wheels to deliver meals. Over the years I have been out with a number of Meals on Wheels organisations within the Shortland electorate. All members in this House recognise the fine work that Meals on Wheels do and know that the contact they have with the people they deliver meals to is more than just the fact that they provide nutritional food to those people who receive the meals; rather, it is quite often the only contact that those people have with the outside world. Charlestown Meals on Wheels is an outstanding organisation and I must say that it is a showpiece as far as Meals on Wheels organisations are concerned. It has had a long history of obtaining support from the community and it delivers meals to Adamstown, Adamstown Heights, Kotara, Valentine, Windale, Charlestown, Dudley, Whitebridge, Garden Suburb, Kahibah and Gateshead areas. The coordinator is Cynthia Moore and the administration officer is Alana Ditroi. I assisted the Meals on Wheels run that goes to Kahibah and the driver whom I accompanied was Kevin Wilson. I thank him very much for allowing me to assist him on that day. I very much appreciated the fact that I could go and meet people who received the meals in order to understand some of the issues that are so important to them. Charlestown Meals on Wheels delivers approximately 250 meals every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The number of volunteers varies enormously between 60 and 90 people a day. Sixty people are needed to deliver the meals on any one day to all of the areas that I just mentioned. There is also a crew that works in the kitchen. They are a really good team who all work together. I have been to a number of functions that Charlestown Meals on Wheels have run and I know the dedication of all of those volunteers who are involved with that organisation. I congratulate each and every one of them and thank Charlestown Meals on Wheels for allowing me to deliver meals on 19 January. time for members’ constituency statements has concluded.

232,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Leader of the Nationals) (11.01 am)-I would like to begin mydeal to bring Australians closer to the world beyond our shores and to provide much-needed services, especially in regional Australia. Some of these great pioneers have been commemorated in the names of electorates of members of parliament. It recognises something of our proud aviation history. TodayI would like particularly to pay tribute to one of our remarkable aviation pioneers, Nancy Bird Walton, who passed away last month. Nancy was an extraordinary woman, an extraordinary pilot, an adventurer, a businesswoman and a humanitarian, and the nation is certainly the poorer for her passing. In her autobiography she writes that when she was 17 she had saved up £200 and told her father that she wanted to start flying lessons at Mascot. He disapproved very strongly, saying that he could not afford to waste money keeping a crippled daughter and that her mother would be very upset if she were to be injured. Nancy Bird Walton wrote: ‘BecauseI was one of six children I thought my parents could well afford to take the risk with one.’ Despite continuing arguments she held firm to her decision and, of course, she was taught by the legendary Charles Kingsford-Smith and created her own legend in becoming the youngest woman to gain a pilots licence and the first woman to have a commercial pilots licence. She obtained that commercial pilots licence essentially to set up a flying medical service. She was a pilot for the Royal Far West Children’s Health Scheme for a number of years and certainly brought health care to people in the outback where otherwise it would not have been provided. She was successful in air races, trained other women pilots and was involved in charity work. It was fitting that in 1997 she was named an Australian National Treasure. She was a champion for Australian aviation and particularly for Qantas. She had very strong views on most issues and gave no quarter. She forcefully put those views whenever the opportunity arose. She regarded it as unthinkable that any Australian government would allow competition to Qantas-she had a great love of Qantas-and in particular held the view that there should be no competition for Qantas on international routes such as across the Pacific. As a new transport minister I attended her 90th birthday party at Sydney airport. During a long and riveting speech she declared that there had never been a decent aviation minister in the history of Australia. I told her that I thought that was a pretty harsh judgment since I had been in the job for only two months. With all due respect to me and my successors as transport minister, I think she died with the same view. I was delighted to be present when Qantas named its first A380 aircraft in her honour and to fly with her on its naming flight. She was rightly very proud of the honour that Qantas had bestowed upon her and said publicly that when she learned of Qantas’s decision she was determined to stay alive long enough for this naming ceremony to occur. It is entirely appropriate that her name should adorn the biggest passenger aircraft flying the Australian flag. Nancy Bird Walton founded the Australian Women Pilots Association in 1950 and was its president and patroness for decades. She took great pride in seeing the success and acceptance of women in aviation. Indeed, her biography is as much a chronicle of the history of the success of women in aviation as anything else. She was very proud of the achievements of women and the acceptance of women right through the full range of aviation careers, which takes me back to the title that she chose for her autobiography: My God, It’s a Woman. Those were the words of a well-known Queensland grazier, Charlie Russell, who made that exclaMAIN COMMITTEE mation when he discovered that the pilot who had been chartered to rescue him from floodwaters on a marooned property was, in fact, a female. Indeed it was a woman, a remarkable woman, a great Australian. The aviation sector is the less for losing this wonderful woman, who was really a pioneer for women in aviation in Australia. I wrote to John Walton, Nancy’s son, at the time of her funeral. He wrote back to me and said: … so many of the public in the streets, that stood and applauded and waved… we are a wonderful country, that love so much, that there are people like this, I think there is just no way to thank them all, possibly in a statement from you, in your situation you can use this. SoI take this opportunity today to acknowledge Nancy Bird Walton, her contribution to aviation and her family, who stood beside her and knew her as quite a remarkable woman. I mentioned that I was at her 90th birthday party. I am told, although I cannot verify it, that after the party she spent the rest of the night at the nightclubs of Sydney. She was quite a remarkable woman. She gave me this copy of her autobiography when she came to my electorate to open a show. The early parts of her career were spent barnstorming around little country towns. Even though she was a city girl, she was very familiar with life in the most remote parts of Australia. Since the early years of these aviation pioneers first flying beyond our shores, aviation has come to play an increasingly important role in bringing the world to Australia and bringing Australia to the world. Being an island, Australia is uniquely dependent upon aviation to maintain our transport links to the outside world. A century ago, the only way to arrive in Australia was by boat. How things have changed. In 2007-08 Australian airports saw international passenger traffic of over 23 million people. This represents a gain of five per cent over the previous years. A significant proportion of these passengers are international tourists. The over 5.6 million short-term international visitors represented a valuable contribution to the overall economy through the tourism sector. Additionally, the air cargo industry plays an important role in the economy. In 2007-08 international air freight traffic totalled over 780,000 tonnes. Both inbound and outbound air traffic have shown increases in recent years. Overall, aviation contributed over $6.3 billion to the Australian economy in 2007 and employed nearly 50,000 people directly. A significant proportion of that was in the regions. With the challenging economic times confronting us, the aviation industry will find it difficult over the years ahead. In fact, it is one of the first to feel the impact of a downturn internationally. We can expect to see, and we are already noticing, a downturn in the arrivals of passengers, therefore reductions in flights and, inevitably, loss of employment in the industry. Ours is a big country with such long distances to cover and so few people that aviation fills a critical gap in places where road or rail transport is not available or the distances are too great. It would be impossible for this parliament to function as effectively as it does in this age without aviation-without the capacity of members to fly quickly and conveniently in and out of Canberra or wherever else we may need to be. The aviation sector also makes a significant contribution to other industries, particularly in rural and regional areas. The tyranny of distance poses very significant and very real challenges that are not faced by those who live in the cities. Often the only way to get in and out of a country town or to make contact with the rest of the world or to travel for medical purMAIN COMMITTEE poses is through the use of aviation. There are three million passenger movements and millions of shipments made by the air cargo industry in and out of the bush. Aside from its role in supporting economic development in the regions, the aviation sector also plays an important role in delivering essential services in remote areas-services like the Royal Flying Doctor Service, which is a vital public good ensuring that communities most in need of medical services are not forgotten. In this day and age when country hospitals have been downgraded or closed to such an extent, we find that the most important facility in even the quite large regional hospitals is the helipad to fly people who are really sick to the nearest larger hospital or capital city. Aviation plays a vital role there. The RFDS performed nearly 36,000 aeromedical evacuations, attended to over 260,000 patients and flew over 23 million kilometres in the year to June 2008. Other aeromedical services like NRMA’s CareFlight, Angel Flight and others provide vital access to critical medical services for people, especially those in remote areas. So a robust aviation sector is vital to overcome the isolation felt in regional areas and to ensure a good quality of life in the bush. Many regional communities are dependent upon air services to help their local economies and to relieve the pressures that geographic isolation can bring. Unfortunately, the aviation sector, particularly in regional areas, is now facing many challenges and that has become especially evident over recent weeks. Some communities have experienced a total loss of air services. Recently MacAir, a major supplier of services in regional Queensland, went into voluntary receivership, stranding passengers in particularly western Queensland and the Gulf of Carpentaria. Similarly, Rex Aviation recently announced that it would terminate smaller routes linking Dubbo to Bourke, Cobar, Coonamble, Lightning Ridge and Walgett and also the Mudgee to Sydney run, citing spiralling costs and ever-increasing regulatory requirements and also the government’s decision to terminate the en route navigation subsidy scheme. As a result, the short flight from Dubbo and Lightning Ridge is now a four-hour drive. If road links were cut into a town, you could be assured that governments-state, federal and local-would take action to make sure they were kept open. For some isolated communities, air links are just as critical. In some states, such as Queensland, the state government does provide some subsidies to enable air services to be provided in remote communities. The federal government provides some support to enable mail services to go to remote areas, such as the Gulf of Carpentaria and Aboriginal communities. These services simply could not operate without that kind of support. Other state governments do nothing at all. There is no support to provide air services to these remote communities. I think it ought to be seen as an essential community service that there is some kind of basic capacity for people to travel from little remote towns to their cities for medical, education or other purposes. SoI appeal to the federal government and to the state governments to do what they can to make sure that the little country towns of Australia-which are sometimes 400, 500, 600, 1,000 or 2,000 kilometres from their capital cities-have some way of connecting promptly and efficiently with the rest of the world at a reasonable cost. It is important for us to ensure that the aviation sector can continue to contribute to the economic base of regional communities and reduce the isolation that those people face. Since coming to office, the new government has imposed higher costs and cost burdens on the aviation sector and those who use its services. In his first budget, the Treasurer increased the passenger movement charge from $38 to $47 and at first went so far as to apply this tax MAIN COMMITTEE hike retrospectively to tickets that had already been sold. That is an extra cost to airlines, travel agents, tourism operators and the flying public, and it hits the aviation industry at a time when it is already struggling with rising costs and an uncertain environment. Now there is the looming threat of a strike by air traffic controllers. I certainly hope that nobody in this House wants to see the disruption and chaos that that sort of industrial action brings. The union that controls the workers in the air traffic control system is currently conducting a ballot on industrial action. It is demanding huge pay increases. Everybody knows that they have a responsible position and we expect them to be well paid and for their conditions to be reasonable, but some of the demands that are being made are way beyond what can be tolerated even in good economic times. They are certainly beyond the capacity of the sector to bear during difficult circumstances. Yet air traffic controllers are threatening to disrupt the aviation industry, perhaps as soon as a week or two away. I would be happy to support any initiative by the minister if he has a sensible plan to avert the potential crisis facing the Australian aviation sector if it is essentially grounded as a result of this industrial action. In particular I urge him not to forget the plight of regional communities that depend so heavily upon the sector when he seeks to resolve the situation. If the Flying Doctor and other essential services are not able to access the capital cities, that will place a serious burden on the health services of the nation but it will also disrupt our economy. The government is spending billions of dollars in stimulus packages, but I can tell you that a nationwide air strike would be a serious deflation to our economy and would reduce its capacity to sustain itself or to recover. I appeal therefore to the workers in that sector to behave reasonably and for everybody involved to negotiate on a reasonable package. We need to ensure that there are no unnecessary interruptions to aviation services. It is incumbent upon all of us also to ensure that the regulatory regime under which the sector operates is as effective and efficient as possible. There are things that can be done to make the industry work well. Sometimes it is difficult to make judgments about how much additional regulation needs to be imposed to ensure the safety and security of passengers who are using the system. One of the great attributes of Australian aviation is its safety record, particularly in the commercial passenger fleet. We want to ensure that continues because that is why people have confidence when flying around Australia. So it is absolutely essential that we maintain and hold on to that enviable safety and security record. It will be a difficult judgment as to how much extra cost is imposed to pick up that last element of additional safety. No-one wants to compromise on safety. It is impossible to mount an argument in favour of any kinds of compromises on safety issues, but on the other hand we also have to keep our aviation system economically sustainable. Sometimes if you impose additional costs, it leads to shortcuts elsewhere and that compromises safety in different places. So we need to manage the safety regime in Australia vigorously, we need to be certain that our operators have a culture of safety, but we also need to work cooperatively with them to achieve this vision that Australian aviation will operate without incident day in, day out, year after year, so that passengers are able to reach their destination safely and on time. With these kinds of general views in mind, I am more than happy to lend the support of the opposition to the Aviation Legislation Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008. It contains a number of initiatives and the opposition is happy to support them all. Following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the coalition in government undertook major new iniMAIN COMMITTEE tiatives to improve aviation security in Australia. The Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 involved the aviation industry participants in maintaining aviation security and required them to develop and comply with a transport security program. This legislation also strengthened the regulatory framework surrounding aviation security and provided the flexibility necessary to respond to a rapidly changing air security environment. Additionally, the coalition introduced the Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003 which required incidents related to transport safety to be reported and laid out a framework for the lodging of reports and the investigation of transport safety incidents. Over the years, a wide array of actions by the previous government expanded the aviation security apparatus in Australia. Since September 2001 at least $1.2 billion has been spent to enhance aviation security. We expanded the screening of passengers and checked baggage to ensure consistent security screening treatment of all passengers and baggage carried on jet aircraft departing from anywhere in Australia. Additional funding was provided to improve security in the air cargo industry. The coalition also created the Air Security Officer Program in December 2001, which placed so-called ‘sky marshals’ on selected domestic and international flights. There is growing concern that the new government is winding back the sky marshals program. When I asked about this in February last year, Labor refused to provide any assurances that funding for this program would be maintained. Indeed, one government minister has been quoted as saying that the number of sky marshals is to be cut by one-third. The sky marshals program is a valuable program and it is worth fully supporting. I call on the government to stop playing fast and loose with the lives of the flying public to save a few dollars in the name of economies. The reality is that this is a program about which not great details are known. I respect the fact that its capacity to work effectively is enhanced because passengers do not actually know for certain whether or not a sky marshal is on their plane. But any measures that the government is taking to reduce this program and to cut the number of operators I would view with grave alarm. I call on the government to make a public commitment to this program and to guarantee that there has been no winding back and that there will be no winding back of the number of sky marshals supporting the Australian aviation sector. Australian skies are undoubtedly much safer than they have ever been. This bill will continue the work that was started by those on this side of the House to ensure that we have a secure aviation sector in the years ahead. Amending the Aviation Transport Security Act to expand the range of information that the government department is able to collect is a reasonable next step in ensuring that aviation security is as effective and efficient as possible for all parties. In addition to monitoring compliance with the act, the department will be able to gather information that would enable them to make more informed decisions on security matters. As the challenges facing aviation security change, it is important that our response adapts and that we have the database and the information necessary to make informed decisions. Ensuring that the measures taken to ensure the safety of Australian skies are as effective as possible and do not impose undue costs on industry players is of paramount importance. Those on this side of the House are happy to do what we can to facilitate this course. The key to these new powers, however, will be the scope of the information to be collected. The government has given an assurance that it will consult effectively with aviation industry participants before the supporting regulations are in fact promulgated. I want to assure the MAIN COMMITTEE industry participants that we will also be subjecting these regulations to intense scrutiny to ensure that they are fair and reasonable. The amendment permitting the secretary to the department to delegate his authority is also a sensible step towards ensuring that the government is able to respond to emergencies in a timely fashion. Thankfully Australia has had a relatively peaceful record when it comes to aviation security. This is due in no small part to the vigilance of those charged with ensuring a secure environment in the skies and the actions of past governments from both sides of politics over the years. Still, it would be imprudent to discount the possibility of an emergency situation arising in the future. If such an emergency were to occur, the demands on the secretary would be immense and, in a rapidly developing situation, action may be required without delay. Current legislation allows the secretary to delegate his authority under the act to another officer within the department. This legislation would enable the secretary to delegate his authority to an officer in another department with national security responsibilities. Of course such a delegation would not be taken lightly. The secretary would still retain overall authority under the proposed legislation and could set restrictions on the delegation or withdraw it when the emergency passed. These amendments would ensure that if Australian skies faced a prolonged emergency, whether it were a preplanned situation or not, our aviation security apparatus would not be left in a position where decisions vital to the national economy and security could not be made. The amendments allowing the copying of cockpit voice recorder information for testing and maintenance purposes are another move that will receive bipartisan support. This proposal is the result of a recommendation from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau investigation into the tragic Lockhart River air crash in 2005. The cockpit voice recorder on that crashed aircraft was found to be faulty. As a result, no audio recovered from the recorder could be confirmed as having been recorded during the accident flight. The bill will clear up any doubt that the copying of cockpit voice recorder information for maintenance is permissible and enable these kinds of faults to be discovered and dealt with more easily. It is quite an interesting case study. Everyone believes it is important that the privacy of personal information on the cockpit voice recorders should be respected. But I think it was always taking the intent of the legislation too far to suggest that that meant it could not be copied for maintenance and other such purposes. It seems as though that excuse was being used and this legislation will ensure that that will not happen in the future. Finally, the changes proposed to the reporting of aviation incidents and the penalties associated with the failure to report such incidents is another idea that we will support. Allowing the executive director of transport safety investigation to require further information after receiving a report on an immediately reportable matter or a routine reportable matter will ensure that the accident and incident database contains accurate and sufficient information on each IRM and RRM. The penalty for failing to report an IRM will be raised to 12 months imprisonment and as a result will bypass the statute of limitations and mean there is no limit to when a prosecution can be instigated. Currently under the Crimes Act prosecutions must occur within one year. It can take many years for unreported incidents to be discovered and as a result these breaches cannot be prosecuted. Additionally under the proposed legislation, failing to provide a full written report of an IRM or an RRM will attract a penalty of six months imMAIN COMMITTEE prisonment and prosecution could begin at any time within six years of the offence. In the case of the Lockhart River air crash in 2005, the failure to report RRMs was not discovered until many years after the alleged commission of the offences. Failing to report IRMs and RRMs can be indicative of a culture that gives safety a low priority and it is important to deter such a culture. Increasing penalties for failing to report or provide full details regarding aviation incidents will maintain this deterrence. Since 11 September 2001, aviation security in Australia has gone through drastic changes in a short time. These changes were necessary in order to secure Australian skies. Given Australia’s record in aviation security, we may conclude that the changes we made have been effective. I do appreciate that the legitimate demands of aviation security have at times imposed cost and inconvenience on both the industry and the flying public. We appreciate the understanding and cooperation that there has been. The legislation will build on the strong foundations left by the previous government and enables us to maintain a solid aviation security apparatus in an efficient and effective way. place to speak in support of the Aviation Legislation Amendment (2008 Measures No. 2) Bill 2008. I would like to make a few comments in support of the government’s bill as it has direct relevance to the residents in the electorate that I represent, the electorate of Hindmarsh, in Adelaide. Within the electorate of Hindmarsh we have Adelaide Airport, which operates multiple perpendicular runways. The airport caters largely for the larger passenger jets, but it does service smaller passenger and transport courier aircraft. Some distance away in the seat of Makin-it borders Makin and Port Adelaide-is Parafield Airport, which I would say has the bulk of the light aircraft traffic and training in Adelaide. Both of these airports receive smallto medium-sized aircraft that necessarily approach over built-up suburban Adelaide. In the case of Adelaide Airport, aircraft fly over the suburbs of West Beach, Brooklyn Park, Glenelg North, Lockleys, West Richmond, Richmond, Cowandilla, Mile End, Henley Beach and Torrensville-and that is just to name a few. So you can see that Adelaide Airport and anything to do with aviation have a direct effect not only on the aircraft that fly in the skies but also on the residents who live below the air routes. As I said, it is not only the crew of and passengers on the aircraft who are the intended beneficiaries of this bill. It is potentially those who live and work under the flight pathfamilies, schools, businesses, aged-care facility residents and the general community who populate the suburbs which I mentioned and many other similarly exposed suburbs. Approximately 25,000 people reside around the Adelaide Airport. It is in a built-up residential area, apart from a small stretch over West Beach on the western side. So you can see that it is a very populated area. Any tragedy that occurred in the sky would have an enormous effect on those residents below. The Aviation Legislation Amendment (2008 Measures No. 2) Bill 2008 has safety as its main focus. It aims to improve the safety of all concerned and of all stakeholders in a number of very different scenarios. I would like to concentrate on the ordinary day-by-day safety element that could potentially affect any of us any month of the year as passengers or as people who live in close proximity to a flight path. I would like to do this by focusing on the tragic incident that has been used as a prime example by the speaker before me of why legislative MAIN COMMITTEE",123,Aviation Legislation Amendment 2008 Measures No 2 Bill 2008
233,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (11.30 Am),"It gives me great pleasure to rise in thischange is required. It is an incident that has been described within the media as one of Australia’s worse air traffic disasters: the crash at Lockhart River. On7 May 2005 a Metro aircraft containing two pilots and 13 passengers was flying a regular public transport service from Bamaga to Cairns, Queensland, with an intermediate stop at Lockhart River. Approaching Lockhart River aerodrome, the aircraft proceeded to flyalmost certainly still in an airworthy condition-into the Iron Range National Park, where it impacted a heavily timbered ridge. The aircraft was destroyed by both the impact and the subsequent intense fuel-fed fire. All 13 passengers were killed. Neither of the crew members survived. The coroner investigating the crash released his findings on 17 August 2007-in excess of two years after the event. The coroner was critical of pilot performance and the company’s safety management systems and training practices. CASA, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, was included in the coroner’s deliberations, given its supervisory role with small operators and such companies’ practices. It goes without saying that all of us continue to encourage CASA in the fulfilment of its critical supervisory and safety role. I understand that it became apparent that the company itself, or its parent company, had failed to meet its obligations in reporting 25 safety incidents. It may seem that the company was creating evidence of itself being a risk or an unacceptably high risk for the safety of passengers and its staff, and yet, unreported, the risk was unable to be identified and mitigated by the authorities. Where a company fails to meet its obligations, there must be appropriate and sufficient recourse for authorities. Without consequence, one can expect compliance to decrease. After the event and after investigations, there was speculation as to whether the Director of Public Prosecutions would become involved and lay charges for non-compliance within its aviation responsibilities. This ended up being a moot point. The current 12-month statute of limitation on prosecutions limited potential DPP action. Whereas prosecution by the DPP may have been a formality, none was possible. The federal minister stated his opinion that the 12-month statute of limitation is far too short a time to conduct proper investigations and have the option of pursuing further action. The then Premier of Queensland would have agreed with him. I am sure that all of us in this place also agree that the statute of limitation needs to be increased from 12 months to give CASA, the Executive Director of Transport Safety Investigation and any responsible party including the DPP sufficient powers to request safety information, sufficient time to investigate events and sufficient time to prosecute those who put the safety of members of their own workforce, the public and customers at such high risk. I am sure all of us support this. I would fully expect the industry itself to support this amendment, be it passenger carriers or freight transport couriers. It seems that within my electorate and perhaps elsewhere those interested in freight issues are somewhat at odds with the minister for transport and certainly me. Recently articles appeared in the media from different industry groups of aviation transport calling for the airport curfew in Adelaide to be dropped. There seems to be a campaign by the industry to convince itself that airport curfews are going to be watered down and ultimately made useless or unworkable. A constituent phoned my office saying that the freight company he works for and employees have stated quite categorically that the Adelaide Airport curfew will be scrapped. This is the rumour that is going around in the industry as a result of the industry’s plan to MAIN COMMITTEE carry cargo on large passenger jets and presumably a subsequent campaign to focus on invented inconsistencies in curfew arrangements. As I said, I fully expect the freight industry to support the bill currently before the House, but I really regret its lack of support for the Adelaide Airport curfew. I regret the disregard for the public who sleep under or in close proximity to Adelaide Airport’s flight path. I have been a resident of Mile End under the flight path all my life. WhereI live, and in those other suburbs that I named, you can stand on the roof of your house and tickle the bellies of the planes as they go over. We know the pilots not by their names but by their faces because we look up and we can see them, and we wave to them. That is how close they are. When you have an airport smack-bang near the CBD in a populated residential area, I think that is the price that you pay. The price that airports, transport companies, couriers and aircraft carriers pay is that they have a curfew. You need to have a good balance between the residents and business. While I expect that we and the industry agree on matters of aviation safety and the need for this bill to pass, we clearly disagree on matters of public interest-the public’s highly reasonable expectation of being able to sleep at night. This is not something that I take lightly, so I decided to write to the minister to clarify what the position is. I will quote from the minister, who wrote to me last year after this rumour began. In his letter to me the minister stated: I believe the current curfew arrangements at Adelaide Airport are working well and I will continue to oppose any changes to the current arrangements. That message has brought considerable confidence to residents with homes under Adelaide Airport’s flight path. Let me say here and now that there are no moves to water down the Adelaide Airport curfew. The minister opposes it and so do I. Things are in the process of changing, though, in and around the aviation industry. Last year’s aviation white paper advances the concept of consultative committees with expertise useful in assisting the minister’s assessment of airports and draft master plans and consultative committees made up of airports and stakeholders, incorporating members of the community, carriers, state government departments and the airport itself-similar to the consultative committees in operation in Sydney and Adelaide. Both Sydney and Adelaide airports have had consultative committees in operations for years, and they have proven to offer great potential for frank communication and even collaborative effort. The Adelaide experience has been a forum for people to voice their concerns and ask questions of the department, Airservices Australia and managerial units within the airport leaseholder itself. Such advances are to be encouraged wherever possible, as are those advances in the bill currently before the House. I encourage all members to support this bill. Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (11.41 am)-As we are debating the Aviation Legislation Amendment (2008 Measures No. 2) Bill 2008, I thought it would be opportune, given the events of yesterday and last night, to give some idea of what $42 billion means in aviation terms. In aviation terms, $42 billion could have funded the entire A380 program twice over. We could have gone from the initial design phase right through to the first flight of an aircraft for half the amount of money contained in the package put up last night. Having said that, this bill relates specifically to aviation security. As is said, the price of security is eternal vigilance. We are all familiar with that saying, although its origins are subject MAIN COMMITTEE to dispute. However, this message has stood the test of time, and it is on that basis that I commend this bill, which builds on the work that we did when in government to make Australia a safer and more secure country. Central to this amendment bill is the extension of the authority to delegate powers from the Secretary to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government to senior officials in his office and to heads of other agencies, who, in turn, may delegate to senior subordinates. I applaud this measure, which should ensure that Australia is never caught short of responsible decision makers to deal with any crisis in our skies. Key among these powers is the authority to order a plane to land at a specific airport with the objective of determining whether the aircraft remains under civil control or in fact has been hijacked. There should be none among us today who cannot recall with chilling clarity the events of September 11 2001. Indeed, the fear of terrorists looms large over all air travellers. We have been fortunate in Australia not to fall victim to such cowardly attacks. Whether this has been by chance, by effective security measures or by a combination of both, we certainly cannot ever afford to become complacent. Several recent court cases have demonstrated that there are still some in our midst who would wish us harm and, given the opportunity, no doubt would like to mimic the savagery of the loathsome September 11 murderers. We should hold our security forces in the highest regard for their success in safeguarding Australia, but we must also accept that there will always be elements in our society who, like wild dogs, will seek to turn on us for reasons comprehended only by their diseased minds. Our government under John Howard made great strides in establishing systems and procedures to boost aviation security in Australia, and it is heartening to see the current government adopting so many of our initiatives. I trust that it will not stop at such protective measures and will instead step up the fight against the enemies of Australian democracy, whether within or outside our borders. The al-Qaeda breeding grounds of Pakistan and Afghanistan are still churning out militants, and the West’s military action there needs to be stepped up in the absence of a strong-willed regime in Kabul. Tension still simmers in the Middle East, and we would be derelict in our duties if we assumed that the relative calm in Iraq is necessarily here to stay. And, of course, there is always potential for home-grown malcontents to launch strikes against Australia, with aviation always being a prime target. While we must keep in mind the rights and freedoms of our citizens, it is essential that we never give an inch to our enemies and that we prepare for all possible scenarios. This bill is a step in ensuring that state of readiness is in place. The bill also raises sensible measures to protect air passengers in other ways. State access to anonymous security-screening information from airlines for the purposes of planning and assessment is perfectly sensible. The key word here is ‘anonymous’. Security measures taken by airlines, both at airports and in the sky, are intended to protect us all. In fact, if we think the measures that we have in place in Australia are somewhat inconvenient, I am certainly reminded of a flight that I took with El Al to Israel and the security-screening procedures that they had in place. They have obviously learned from bitter experience just how vulnerable air transport can be. Certainly, I remember sitting there waiting for the security screening when one lady was called by one of the security people, who was pulling on the rubber gloves. That is the extent to which El Al goes in terms of security screening. I am not advocating that we MAIN COMMITTEE go to that extent in Australia, but it is indicative of when circumstances are such that that level of security is necessary. That certainly does provide that security, particularly when one looks at the record of El Al since the events of the 1970s which necessitated those very stringent security procedures. Basically, they have had no incidents since then. As I have said, certainly the screening can be inconvenient, but most accept that this price is worth paying for some peace of mind. We would not be so accommodating if such measures were used to collate data about individuals for use by government. I trust the airlines also see that this is in the best interests of all concerned. Similarly, the measure in this bill to allow the copying of recordings and the examination of cockpit voice recorders, primarily to ensure they are functioning effectively, makes complete sense. Indeed, the current practice is that the cockpit voice recorder has to be removed from the aircraft, taken to another facility, tested to see if it is working and then put back in the aircraft. This clearly is inefficient when it would be very easy simply to record the cockpit voice recorder to see whether the recording is, in fact, working. One wonders why the issue of recording of the cockpit voice recorder should even be an issue. When pilots and other crew are on duty, we would hope that they are concentrating on the job at hand rather than worrying about conversations that they might have had that might embarrass them later on. Bus drivers and taxi drivers are subject to public scrutiny in the execution of their duties. There is no reason pilots should be treated differently, and perhaps every reason they should not. After all, we place our lives in their hands. Indeed, having worked in the air traffic control system in the early 1980s, I know that certainly everything that was said on air was recorded. The last point about placing our lives in pilots’ hands gets to the very point of this bill-that by its very nature the aviation sector assumes great responsibility and so must accept a high degree of accountability. As with terrorism, Australia has never had a major jet disaster. Again, this could be due to luck, good safety procedures, maintenance and training or a combination of these factors. The latter seems most likely. It is in the interests of all parties, not least the travelling public, that this fine record continue. The bill makes provision for penalties for airlines and airline staff who fail to provide information, particularly regarding accidents or other safety incidentsand quite rightly so. When Australians step onto a plane, as tens of millions do every year, they deserve to know that it has not been damaged, that it has been properly maintained and that the airline and regulatory authorities are confident it is safe to fly. In fact, the provision of jail terms for those who fail to provide such information would almost seem too light. The restriction on charges being brought within 12 months for lesser offences appears too short given the stated admission by the government that it can take years for evidence of failure to comply with regulations to emerge. The standard of six years to bring charges which would apply to more serious offences attracting jail terms of more than six months seems far more appropriate for all such breaches. None of this is intended to malign airlines, pilots or any other employees involved in the maintenance or operation of aircraft. They, and particularly pilots, enjoy a position of great respect in our society. As with other positions commanding respect, they also enjoy our trust. There is no harm in returning the favour to the society which holds them in such esteem by operating transparently, if only to assuage the fears that are held about air travel. MAIN COMMITTEE Cooperation with regulatory authorities in this regard will also allow greater preparedness to deal with safety issues in the future and help maintain that fine safety record. In the 200607 financial year there were 67.4 million air passengers in Australia-22.1 million on international flights and 45.3 million on domestic routes including regional connections. These numbers are forecast to continue, particularly given the appearance of an increasing number of budget carriers and despite the financial crisis. Last October set a new monthly record, with more than two million international passengers-up 1.3 per cent from the same month the previous year. It should also be noted that in the same period there was a decline in passenger loads, with planes flying with an average of 76.9 per cent load factor from 79.5 per cent in October 2007. This has been attributed to the increasing number of airlines operating in Australia, leading to stiff competition and increased pressure on profit margins. In 2006-07 there were more than a million passenger flights in Australia, more than 130,000 of them on international routes. As the skies become more crowded in our vast country it is inevitable there will be aviation safety and security issues. This bill will help minimise such incidents and maintain a system designed to address problems and prevent their recurrence when they do occur. It is a step in the right direction and we must all remain vigilant for the sake of ourselves and our fellow citizens. Amendment (2008 Measures No. 2) Bill 2008. The bill, if passed, will amend the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004, the Civil Aviation Act 1988 and the Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003. The aviation industry is utterly critical to our nation and our nation’s economy. The Australian Bureau of Statistics records that the air and space industry in Australia employs 50,000 people. The value of the air and space industry to our country annually is $6.3 billion. If you include aviation support in that, you can probably double those numbers; indeed, Qantas alone employs 37,000 Australians. Of course, jobs are very important at any point in time but, given the issues that we are dealing with at the moment and have been discussing in this parliament over the last few days, there is a certain national urgency about jobs and making sure that we who are involved in public policy have a focus on them. In my electorate of Corio we have Avalon Airport, which is rapidly becoming the second gateway to Melbourne and the greater Port Phillip Bay area. The passenger traffic at Avalon Airport has built up to almost a million passengers in a year. There are well over 1,000 people currently employed at Avalon. Jetstar flies there as one of its two Melbourne destinations. It is home to a significant amount of Qantas maintenance work. Next month, Airshows Downunder, the single biggest air show in Australia and one of the biggest in the Southern Hemisphere, will be occurring at Avalon Airport. This will be an event that is attended by Australians in their hundreds of thousands. I have spoken on a number of occasions in this place about the aspiration of Avalon Airport to become an international airport. With its new general manager, Justin Giddings, a lot of work is being done with the department of transport to ensure that all the regulatory hurdles MAIN COMMITTEE",130,Aviation Legislation Amendment 2008 Measures No 2 Bill 2008
234,Mr Marles (Corio) (11.54 Am),"I rise to speak in support of the Aviation Legislationare overcome so that Avalon Airport, in the not-too-distant future, can be an airport that deals with international traffic as well. The growth of Avalon Airport perhaps represents the greatest potential for jobs growth in the Geelong region. Certainly, in a broader context of Geelong being a transport and logistics hub, not only for Victoria but nationally, with that all occurring around the northern side of Geelong where Avalon is located, the strategic importance for the Geelong economy and for Geelong employment is absolutely paramount. I think you can say more generally that airports in cities and particularly in regional communities are job centres. They are places of economic activity. Ensuring that they are supported and protected by legislative framework is a very important job that we in this place must do. Core to airports being economic centres and job centres-and therefore core to Avalon being those-is public confidence in aviation. The bedrock of that is a fundamental belief by the public that it is safe to fly. Indeed, the tremendous expansion of the aviation industry over the 20th century has been founded on a fundamental premise that it is safe to fly. That is why the bills before the House are so important. They go to the very issue of security and safety in aviation, which is the bedrock of an industry that is providing so much employment and economic activity in our nation at a time when we need every bit of that that we can possibly find. These bills provide additional safety and security measures for our aviation system in four ways. The first measure is to amend the Aviation Transport Security Act to increase the amount of aviation security information that can be collected by the secretary to the department of transport. Currently, the definition of aviation security information in the Aviation Transport Security Act is quite narrow, which means that the kind of information that can be collected by the secretary to the department of transport is correspondingly narrow. It is defined as being security compliance information-that is, information relevant to a person or a body complying with the Aviation Transport Security Act. But there is quite a lot of information out there which may not be directly relevant to a strict compliance with the act but which may be very relevant to security and safety within the aviation industry. It is that kind of information which this amendment will allow to be collected by the secretary of the department of transport. An often quoted example of that is statistics around the screening of baggage or passengers. The second measure contained in this bill is an amendment to the Aviation Transport Security Act in relation to widening the delegation of functions and responsibilities held by the secretary of the department of transport under the Aviation Transport Security Act. Currently, those functions and responsibilities can be delegated within the department of transport. But in an emergency there may because for the powers that are normally exercised by the secretary of the department of transport to be exercised by someone else. An example which is often quoted in relation to this is the power to direct a plane to land. In an emergency situation, it is utterly essential that there is somebody on deck who has the legal authority to exercise that power and carry out those responsibilities. In a circumstance where the secretary to the department of transport finds himself or herself unable to exercise those functions and responsibilities and there is no-one within the department of transport who would be in a position to exercise those functions and responsibilities, then a situation MAIN COMMITTEE may arise where an emergency occurs and there is actually nobody who is in a position to exercise the powers that need to be exercised. To deal with that contingency, this measure will widen the pool of people who can receive a delegation from the secretary to the department of transport in relation to those functions and responsibilities. That pool is widened to secretaries to other departments that are involved in national security and, indeed, other agencies with heads of like standing to the secretary to a department. That in effect widens the pool of potential delegates in an emergency situation so that if there is an emergency and there are a number of people, for one reason or another, not in a position to exercise those powers, a person can ultimately be found who can exercise the powers under the act-an important contingency to be provided through this amendment to the act. The third measure is an amendment to the Civil Aviation Act in relation to information contained on cockpit voice recorders. Information contained on cockpit voice recorders is strictly confidential. It is appropriate that it be strictly confidential. The people who are engaging in the conversations which form the recordings on cockpit voice recorders need to be able to have whatever conversations they have to have in the complete knowledge that they are acting in a confidential environment. Cockpit voice recorders, like every other piece of equipment, need to be tested and maintained. That obviously means that information may need to be copied or to the person who is doing the testing and the maintenance. This amendment to the Civil Aviation Act provides for an exception to that confidentiality rule within the act to allow for the proper and regular maintenance and testing of cockpit voice recorders. That may seem like a very detailed and small issue, but in May 2005, after the very tragic air accident that occurred at Lockhart River, with the resultant deaths of 15 people, the cockpit voice recorder that was recovered from that plane in fact had no usable data. This added to the tragedy of that event because it meant the investigation into what occurred was necessarily limited by the absence of that information. So, as detailed and specific as this provision may appear, it is indeed very important. The final measure contained in this bill is an amendment to the Transport Safety Investigation Act. Firstly, the amendment to this act will stiffen the reporting requirements on accidents and incidents and will also increase the ability of the executive director of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to gather more information around incidents and accidents, which in turn is important to enable the proper research and analysis of those incidents and accidents. This measure will also seek to stiffen the penalty regime for failing to report incidents and accidents and failing to provide information being sought by the executive director of the ATSB. Currently there is a statute of limitations contained in the act for prosecutions by the ATSB for failure to provide information. In some cases that statute of limitations is as short as 12 months. There may well be circumstances where it would be impossible to properly carry out a prosecution within that period of time and so prosecutions are not occurring. This amendment will provide that for serious offences-that is, offences which carry a custodial term of more than six months-there will be no statute of limitations, as indeed there is not in other criminal prosecutions, and for smaller offences there will be a statute of limitations of six years. Each of these measures seeks to improve the safety and security of our aviation industry. Our aviation industry, as I said, is very critical to our economy. In a nation which Geoffrey MAIN COMMITTEE Blainey once described as being characterised by the tyranny of distance, aviation is fundamental to the way Australia works. It is fundamental to our way of life. Everybody in this chamber and in this parliament absolutely understands that by virtue of the number of hours that we spend on planes. The aviation industry has, in fact, gone a very long way to overcoming the tyranny of distance which characterised Australia in the past. It is very important to our economy. It is very important to our jobs base. At the heart of our aviation industry is safety. There needs to be public confidence in the industry and people need to know that they can get to where they are going safely. At the heart of this bill is making the security and safety regime of our industry more robust. For that reason I support the bill. Ms MARINO (Forrest) (12.06 pm)-I rise to speak on the Aviation Legislation Amendment (2008 Measures No. 2) Bill 2008, introduced during the last week of parliamentary sittings in December 2008. I have every confidence that Australian aviation safety and security are and should be of the utmost priority for both sides of government and should always be the subject of continual review to implement industry improvements. This was certainly brought fairly and squarely into focus for us all following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The coalition took action to improve aviation security in Australia to protect Australian and international travellers and our Australian skies. The Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 involved aviation industry participants in maintaining aviation security and required the development of and compliance with a transport security program. This legislation also strengthened the regulatory framework surrounding aviation security and provided the flexibility necessary to respond to a rapidly changing air security environment. Additionally, the coalition introduced the Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003, which required incidents related to transport safety to be reported. It also laid out a framework for the lodging of reports on the investigation of transport safety incidents. As the challenges facing aviation security change, it is important that our response adjusts to this change. Since September 11, aviation security in Australia, by absolute necessity, has gone through drastic changes in a very short time. These changes were necessary in order to manage the terrorist threat and ensure air travel safety, with $1.2 billion spent to improve security, which, of course, included sky marshals. Given Australia’s record in aviation security, we may conclude that the changes we made have been effective because of the diligence and vigilance of those charged with ensuring this secure environment in the skies. Because we cannot take this security for granted, I ask the government to support continued aviation security, including sky marshals. With this bill the government has identified four amendments that aim to further strengthen aviation transport security and safety by amending the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004, the Civil Aviation Act 1988 and the Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003. I note that part 2 of schedule 1, relating to the proposed amendment to allow copying and disclosure of aircraft cockpit voice recorder information for maintenance purposes, and part 3, relating to the amendment to the Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003 to change penalties for offences and allow the gathering of information, are proposed to commence on 1 July 2009. The proposed amendment widens the scope of information that can be requested by the secretary to the department under the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004, allowing the secretary the power to collect other information which currently falls outside the scope of that definition and not limiting the kinds of information that may be prescribed by regulation to be MAIN COMMITTEE collected. Such information would include the screening of passengers, baggage, cargo or airport zones. This will provide greater transparency in the effectiveness and efficiency of screening and security procedures as the challenges to aviation security change and the sophistication of the threat changes as well. However, by adding the words ‘and aviation security information’ after the words ‘security compliance information’ it certainly broadens the scope of information able to be collected and disclosed. It would not only be information relating to the screening statistics of passengers and baggage, clearance activities and different security zones but it could also encompass the collection and disclosure of personal information on airline passengers. As the broader collection of information may well allow for personal information and individuals to be reported, I strongly believe the regulation must contain the same set of privacy principles set out in the Privacy Act 1988, which all Commonwealth agencies as well as private industry must comply with when collecting personal information from or about individuals. As stated in the bill, the government intends that the department will consult widely on the scope of aviation security information that may be collected and disclosed before the regulations are finalised. This consultation needs to be thorough and deal with the issue I have raised. However, as regulations are not subject to full parliamentary debate, I will be very interested in the results of the consultative process. Part2 of the bill proposes amendments to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 to allow for the copying and disclosure of aircraft cockpit voice recorder information for the purpose of testing its functioning and reliability. And, as the previous member said, we know that is why that is so important. This bill will clear any doubt that the copying of cockpit voice recorder information for maintenance is permissible and enable those kinds of faults to be discovered and dealt with more easily. These amendments were first proposed when the coalition was in government and we certainly support them now. I believe this is a logical amendment, as the current confidentiality requirements could be interpreted as making it unlawful to copy or disclose cockpit voice recorder information for legitimate maintenance purposes and will continue to ensure the availability of voice recorder information in the future for accident investigations. This amendment can only enhance the safety of regular public transport aircraft. As stated in the government’s national aviation policy green paper on page 23: The aviation industry is a key driver of broader economic prosperity and a strategic approach … is required to secure the industry’s future and promote the best interests of the travelling public and businesses that rely on the aviation sector. Declining regional populations was identified as a key challenge facing the aviation industry. I note that in an article in the Australian on 30 January the Regional Aviation Association of Australia was quoted as saying: The RAAA is unhappy that the green paper was ‘virtually silent’ about a strategy for regional Australia. RAAA chief executive, Paul Tyrrell, is quoted as saying: There was a ‘fair bit of passion’ among RAAA members about increasing growth from the regional ports to the main cities and re-establishing routes between regional centres. ‘If we look on aviation the same as education, health and telecommunications, these are the services that build regional Australia,’ he said. ‘We’d like the government, state and federal but federal particularly, to see aviation as one of those essential services.’ The article also said: MAIN COMMITTEE The RAAA also believes the Government should look more closely at areas such as research and development as well as aircraft and component manufacturing in regional areas. I would support this view, given the growth and opportunity for aviation in my electorate of Forrest. With the population growth in the south-west of Western Australia, the anticipated increase in demand for air travel to service our fly-in, fly-out workers, tourism and the plans to attract more short, long stay and potentially international visitors and tourists to the region, as well as physically connecting the localities of Bunbury, Collie, Busselton, Augusta, Nannup, Margaret River and Manjimup with Perth and potentially in the future with interstate or overseas airports, has been a strategy that the relevant shire and city councils have been working on. There are many private charter aircraft and aviation enthusiasts operating within the region. Of course any expansion of aviation legislation and improvement to security and safety will only benefit the forward planning that shires or the Bunbury City Council have in place for the development of their own regional airports, aerodromes and airstrips. Currently, checked baggage and passenger screening is only required for jet aircraft but not for turboprop driven aircraft providing regular public transport services. Requirements for hardened cockpit doors only apply to 30-seat and above aircraft used for regular public transport and not to cargo aircraft. Security at regional airports and local airstrips has expanded over recent years to implement parking restrictions on aprons, tie-down areas and yoke yards. However, funding for the development, expansion and construction of regional airport infrastructure in my electorate of Forrest cannot go ahead without assistance from the Australian government as well as state and local governments, in much the same way as the Australian and state governments collaboratively assist with funding for regional roads, rail and ports. Future increased security measures at expanded regional airports in Forrest will require government funding as the costs would be spread over a lower regional passenger base compared with Perth and other city airports. The Australian government’s confirmation to continue with flexible support for local governments through untied financial assistance grants and through the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program is required for the upgrading and expansion of airports in the south-west. Investment from federal, state and local governments will ensure a coordinated approach to improving airport safety, and I anticipate that this will extend to regional airports and not just remote airstrips. The WA government has its own Regional Airports Development Scheme that has played a significant role in helping develop airport infrastructure in regional Western Australia. WA was the first state to provide funding for airport infrastructure in regional areas and it works in partnership with airport owners to meet access needs and contributes to regional economic growth. Following the 2007-08 funding round allocation, the program has injected approximately $12.3 million to approximately 137 projects since 2001 including recipients in my electorate in Busselton and Manjimup. In addition to this, the funds spent on projects in regional airports in Forrest under the Regional Airports Development Scheme amounted to over $7 million. Augusta, the City of Bunbury, Busselton, Manjimup, Collie, Margaret River and Nannup all received funding. It is estimated that the average number of aircraft using the Busselton Regional Airport on a daily basis is between seven and 10 aircraft, resulting in between 15 and 20 daily aircraft MAIN COMMITTEE movements-often charter flights for fly-in, fly-out mining operational staff but also tourism flights. Currently the shires of Busselton and Augusta-Margaret River, in association with the department of tourism, are conducting a feasibility study on the possible benefits of establishing a regular passenger service to the south-west cape region. The population of the Shire of Busselton increased by over 7,000 people from 17,419 in 1996 to 25,000 in 2006-an increase of 43 per cent. Over the same period the state population grew by 15 per cent. That highlights the rapid population growth the Shire of Busselton has experienced over the past decade. Its urban growth strategy has prepared a growth plan to cater for an additional 11,000 to 12,000 people over the next 15 to 20 years. Therefore the need to consider expanding airport operations and services is a relatively urgent one for the area, and all matters of security; safety; noise abatement; airport services such as hangers, refuelling, firefighting, air traffic control; as well as bird hazards, access roads, water and power supply, sewerage and terminal facilities are diligently being investigated and plans developed to expand airport facilities to cater for that expected growth. Margaret River, the wine region that I am sure members all know about, has terminal facilities of a transfer station available to the essential Flying Doctor service patients only. There is no aircraft refuelling service and no air traffic control. The Shire of Augusta-Margaret River put together its aerodrome plan in June 2007 to develop the airport infrastructure in preparation for increased demand for regular public transport and charter services driven by population and business growth. The Bunbury City Council has also undertaken an analysis study on its airport to ascertain best use of the current location with upgrades to expand its infrastructure for future growth and in fact investigated the possibility of relocating the airport to an alternative site. I applaud the foresight of the shires and city councils in Forrest in recognising the need to upgrade infrastructure to cater for the demands that future growth in the region will bring. My other concern with the government’s green paper in relation to domestic aviation and the carbon pollution reduction scheme is that the government intends to achieve set targets through this economy-wide scheme for capping and trading emissions to be implemented in 2010. The aviation sector will be included with the whole-of-government approach to climate change. With the expanding capacity at regional airports, this may make it harder for new competition to enter the industry to establish regular public transport domestic air services if the scheme is being capped and the cost and availability of permits are beyond the reach of these new, emerging regional airport operations. Other amendments proposed in this bill will amend the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to enable the secretary of the department to delegate his authority under the Aviation Transport Security Act to other agencies. The secretary would still retain overall authority and could set restrictions on the kinds of actions the delegate could take or withdraw the delegation, as the situation warranted. This change will ensure that the government could act in preplanned or prolonged situations where time is critical and resources are limited, or the secretary is unavailable. Finally, the bill amends the Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003 to strengthen the powers of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to require further information after a report on an aviation incident, to increase penalties and to allow the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to prosecute for failure to report an aviation incident up to six years after the commission of the offence. This would replace the current 12-month limit on prosecutions, as it can someMAIN COMMITTEE times take years for such an offence to be discovered. This legislation will build on the existing legislation, enabling us to maintain solid aviation security in an efficient and effective way. Overall, the legislation seeks to strengthen the security regime created by the coalition to make Australia’s skies safer. I support the bill, but I assure the House and the aviation industry that I will scrutinise the supporting regulations. (2008 Measures No. 2) Bill 2008. With the time limited today I will not talk at length about the amendments and what they mean, but I want to bring to the attention of this chamber a significant event that happened in the electorate of Forde in 1937. It was one of the very earliest aviation crashes or disasters and is better known as the Stinson crash, which gained worldwide notoriety because of the actions that led up to that crash. This happened just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, so aviation as an industry and Australia’s role in aviation were more limited than what they became as part of our war effort. The Stinson crash was well known for a range of reasons. Certainly it was a significant air crash and there was the fact that it just went missing. The coronial inquiry and the inquest raised a number of points, and I am going to read the final outcome of that coronial inquiry and the suggestions that came out of that particular document-points not unlike, in a modern form, some of the discussion we have had today about the amendments to try to improve not only security but also safety measures in terms of airline travel, aircraft and the aviation industry generally. In those days the Stinson aircraft was on a regular air route between Brisbane and Sydney, and of course it was fairly expensive to travel at that time. The coroner’s outcome talks about the modern form of travel, given that the airline industry globally was probably only around 30 years old. At that time major advances had occurred in terms of the comfort and design of the aircraft. In terms of safety, the aviation industry has always been very safe, especially because of incidences like this that occurred in 1937. The story is that the plane disappeared somewhere between Brisbane and Sydney, and eyewitnesses on the ground during a rain event-a storm-heard the plane, as they did on many occasions. In fact, they used to almost set their watches by the sound of the aircraft coming over. These days we hear aircraft or see aircraft and it does not take much of our attention, but in 1937 something like an aircraft flying over was quite an event. For the farmers in the Beaudesert district towards the border ranges, in that rural part of my electorate, it became a regular event. On this particular day the plane engines were heard in one locality but certainly not further south and it was believed that this crash had occurred somewhere in the McPherson-the border-Ranges. If members know the story, for about nine days there was no knowledge of what had happened to this aircraft. However, one man thought he knew-that is, Bernard O’Reilly from the now famous O’Reilly’s guesthouse on Green Mountain. The O’Reilly family were an Irish migrant family of dairy farmers farming the area-and one has to wonder why anyone would farm on top of a mountain with all of the difficulties that that would pose. Today, the famous O’Reilly’s guesthouse is a place that people regularly attend. Being a good mountaineer, Bernard O’Reilly believed that he knew what had happened to the Stinson and went off in search of it. From the top of one mountain he looked across into the valley and saw a small burnt-out patch and realised that that was probably where the aircraft was located. As I said, it was a world event; it made world news. Of course, everyone converged on the area, with Beaudesert set up as the site from where they would go to find out what had happened to the aircraft. MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Aviation Legislation Amendment 2008 Measures No 2 Bill 2008
235,Mr Raguse (Forde) (12.23 Pm),"I rise to speak on the Aviation Legislation AmendmentUltimately, Bernard O’Reilly climbed up to the crash site and came across the only two survivors out of the seven on board. They informed him that a fellow called James Westray had gone seeking help. He was a mountaineer from Scotland who decided to very cleverly travel down to the bottom of the valley and along the river. However, he had not come out the other side so Bernard O’Reilly went looking for Westray and found him dead on the side of the river. He had had a fall, broken his ankle and must have had other internal injuries. It was a sad tragedy which resulted in a better understanding of the need for more safety controls in aircraft. It was a major catalyst, in fact, in getting proper radio control within aircraft. In closing, I want to very briefly read from the coroner’s final report: The inquest is closed. The Coroners Act does not empower me to make any findings. I think, however, that this inquest, the importance of which is emphasised by the serious loss of life which created the need for holding it, can scarcely be allowed to end on such a formal decision. Without, I hope, exceeding the bounds of my coronial limitations, I express the opinion that the evidence which has been given in open court-if studied by the authorities closely concerned with ensuring the safety of aerial passenger traffic and by the public, or perhaps, to be exact, by that section of it interested in such means of modern transport-will be found to furnish material from which it should be possible to draw sound and base conclusions pointing to the pressing need for improved methods of ground organisation, centralised control and supervision at the aerodrome of pilots and their duties, the supply of up-to-minute weather reports on air routes, the establishment of reporting stations and the utilisation to the fullest extent of radio aids. Tragic fatalities should not be awaited to provide generating reasons for the institution of improvements to the safeguard of human life. Incidentally, it is just that I should mention that evidence tendered in summary of the achievement of the company which carries on the service in which the crash occurred indicates that, under existing flying conditions, it has a very good, comforting record. That is signed on 16 April 1937 by the coroner. That is a very interesting document, and the evidence that was collected through that inquiry is largely why today we have safety measures in place and why we as a government are now making amendments to ensure that we continually look after the aviation industry. Debate (on motion by Mr Melham) adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. National Student Leadership Forum the Shoalhaven participated in the National Student Leadership Forum. I would like to read a condensed version of her comments onto the record, as only she can best describe her own feelings that the forum generated. This is what she wrote: Leading up to the ForumI was excited but scared at the same time. Walking into a room of 300 strangers was the most daunting situation I’ve ever experienced. As an aside, I have to say that Emily is an amateur entertainer, so the occasion must have been exceptionally daunting. She continued: Over the next 4 days I knew I would make some friends but at this moment I was completely out of my comfort zone. I have never been inside Parliament House before and it was an incredible building, although we did arrive at 2pm and didn’t leave until 10.30 pm, so it was an extremely long day.

237,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (12.31 Pm),"Last year in September, 19-year-old Emily Nye fromAfter going through security twice, where you weren’t allowed to take in any electrical devices, watches, water bottles and other ridiculous items, we went into Question Time and to be completely honest, it was like watching a group of children. I remember thinking, ‘these are the people looking after this country’? This seemed to be the general opinion of everyone in my group. It was a very surreal experience, sitting above, looking down at the Prime Minister and other Members of Parliament and actually knowing they were only metres away. We had an introduction with the organizers of the Forum and then we had a meet and greet with the Opposition leader, Malcolm Turnbull. Over the very first day we had many meet and greets with other Members of Parliament. I found listening to all the different Parliamentarians one on one, that my attitude toward them changed very quickly. They were just ordinary people and nothing like the people you see in Question Time or on the news. We had dinner in the Great Hall and my group was a little late in attending. One of the members in my group actually worked for one of the Members of the Labor Party, therefore he had access to areas others didn’t, so we took a detour by the Prime Minister’s office, more like a wing, on our way to dinner. Over dinner we were addressed by Mr David Moffatt, the CEO of Telstra and enjoyed a performance from the Australian of the Year, Mr Lee Kernaghan, who incidentally broke his G-string whilst playing his guitar. I appreciate the double entendre here. She continued: Back at the hotel it was a struggle to find my room but I eventually did after getting lost down many corridors. The next day we took the bus to the Australian War Memorial where we listened to an inspirational speech about servant leadership, standing around the reflective pool. We then made our way back to Parliament House to attend political seminars. At the political seminars, you would listen to a politician speaking of their experiences and challenges they’ve overcome to be where they are today. We then attended a meet and greet with the Prime Minister before having small group time over lunch. Following sport in the afternoon another small group time after dinner at 8.30 which ran until the early hours of the morning. Over this small group time we all got to know each other and I truly believe this was the most honest any of us had ever been. Being complete strangers, I would never have thought that everyone would open up and discuss their ideas for the future, their issues and problems they’ve had in the past and insecurities they were facing. It was amazing to sit and listen to everyone’s stories and learn that everyone had the same insecurities and ideas as I did. Getting to know everyone on this personal level really bonded the group and I can truly say that I left Canberra with 8 best friends who I completely trusted and cherished. Saturday we had community seminars covering a wide range of topics such as racism, community spirit and youths at risk just to name a few. We then had a community service project in Queanbeyan. My group had a gardening activity at a private home where we had fun feeding the chickens and getting our faces painted by the 3 little girls living there. That night we had a Bollywood Dinner Dance which was a fantastic night out. We got to learn Bollywood dancing and have competitions. It was also a great time to sit down and discuss what we had learnt over the last 3 days. I remember getting back to the Hotel and I was crying on the phone to mum because I really didn’t want to come home. Sunday morning arrived and everyone in my group was quiet during breakfast. I kept looking around at everyone and I was getting really emotional knowing that I would have to say goodbye to my new family. We went outside for the final Small Group time and relived the last 3 days we had together. We finally had to say goodbye and I just couldn’t stop crying, which then led to my Group leader crying as well. MAIN COMMITTEE I said goodbye to everyone, got numbers, emails etc. We also received a Yearbook so we can keep in touch with everyone and I think we were all very thankful to Facebook where we can catch up on a regular basis. I had the most amazing time in Canberra and I am so thankful to have been invited and chosen to attend the National Student Leadership Forum 2008. Although daunting at the time, being pushed out of my comfort zone was the most extraordinary thing for me to experience and I’ll always cherish the time spent at the Forum, even though it meant me crying the entire way home over the following 2 days. Bush For Life Trees For Life, a non-profit community organisation that works to protect, maintain and renew the native vegetation of South Australia. Bush For Life concentrates on weed management, with a philosophy of minimum disturbance, biodiversity and ongoing commitment. Bush For Life is apolitical; in spite of the name, there are no links to recently disappointed American Republicans. Instead, they work together with landowners and councils, selecting sites with high conservation value for ongoing care. An important aspect of this is to prioritise the areas with the least weed infestation, as this prevents further spread and encourages lasting renewal. Volunteers then receive training in bush regeneration techniques, plant identification and bush management, as well as the continuing support and advice of regional coordinators and staff. One of my constituents, Kevin McCormack, invited me to visit the Bush For Life site that he works on. Together with fellow site volunteers Michael Vaughan and Graham Greaves and Bush For Life manager Mark Ellis, we braved the 40 degree plus heat to view the thankfully roadside site. It was a good education. Whilst in a cultivated garden, weeds are merely a source of sore backs; in the bush they are a deadly threat to a delicate ecology. At this Bush For Life site, the volunteers’ three main adversaries are boneseed, bridle creeper and blackberry-all introduced species that have been identified as weeds of national significance. Like a ‘most wanted’ list for criminals, the weeds of national significance are 20 weeds in Australia judged to pose the greatest threat due to the damage they inflict, dangerous potential and aggressive spread. Boneseed, for example, has a competitive edge, with its ability to regenerate quickly after fire and clearances, as well as having a shallow root system that absorbs the moisture from light showers before more deep-rooted plants have a chance. Apparently named for the colour of their prolific seeds, their hard shell and indigestibility make their name equally apt and ensure wide dispersal. The bridal creeper’s climbing vegetation smothers the natives above ground, whilst its thick mat of tubers strangle their root systems below. Blackberries use fruit to bribe the fauna into spreading their seed, whilst also reproducing from their canes and roots. Any trip through the Adelaide Hills can show you the success of their multilayered reproductive technique and the impenetrable thickets that result. All these weeds steal the native plants’ space, nutrients and water-vital for their existence. As introduced species they take nature by surprise, with no natural predators to contain their spread and ensure biodiversity and balance. As our native bush plants are driven from the land, so too are our native insects, birds and animals that rely on them for their own survival. For 15 years, Kevin and his fellow volunteers have worked on their site, and the difference to the adjoining bushland is evident, even to an untrained eye such as mine. Nature is amazMAIN COMMITTEE",143,Adjournment
238,Mr Butler (Port Adelaide) (12.35 Pm),"Bush For Life is one of the programs run byingly resilient, but it needs a chance to breathe. The Bush For Life program gives it just that. The native plants the volunteers try to introduce to the site generally refuse to thrive. Instead, the land followed its own initiative, with golden wattle in particular returning in large numbers. However, without ongoing maintenance, in five years our national floral symbol will once again have been trampled beneath the aggressive march of introduced species. Continuity is vital. In South Australia, we have just endured a record-breaking heatwave and face the prospect of climate change bringing hotter and hotter temperatures with less and less rainfall. We are suffering through a drought that has seen our rivers turned into algae infested swamps and our soil turned barren. Our environment is under serious threat. As Kevin told me, the work he does through Bush For Life helps him cope with the sense of tragedy, fear and powerlessness that climate change can engender. Taking positive action through a well-organised community program such as Bush For Life helps the environment while also empowering the individual and strengthening the community. With the training and support of the program, volunteers not only gain knowledge and appreciation of the extraordinary and beautiful native environment in which we live but through their action and commitment also give us and our bushland hope for the future. Bush For Life currently manages over 300 sites in South Australia, with more than 4,000 hectares getting dedicated assistance from nearly 700 volunteers. It is a community program that does South Australia proud and deserves our support. Hopman Cup of Swan the Burswood Dome has hosted the Hopman Cup international tennis tournament. The cup is Western Australia’s premier tennis event and serves as an important warm-up fixture prior to the Australian Open. I was fortunate enough to attend a couple of matches this year and I acknowledge the great work done by the tournament staff. I met with Paul McNamee and had a very informative discussion with him. I know that the work done by Annette Livesay is second to none, and her expertise in the event organisation is well known in Perth. The support of all the sponsors, including Eventscorp, is vital for the continuation of this unique event. The tournament has a unique format of being a knockout mixed doubles event over the best of three rubbers. Over time, this enterprising innovation has been rewarded with the participation of 21 of the No. 1 world players. Roger Federer and Martina Hingis, two legends of the game, won the 2000 tournament for Switzerland. Most members in this room would have at some point watched the competition on TV, courtesy of the first-class and very professional coverage provided by the ABC national broadcaster. Unfortunately, it has recently come to my attention that the ABC is considering ending its coverage of the tournament when its contract expires this year. I fear this would mark the beginning of the end for the Hopman Cup. Fifteen years of ABC coverage has helped ensure strong national and international exposure and a focus on Perth. Exposure is important in a number of respects. Firstly, good exposure can help attract a good attendance. The people of my electorate have been strong supporters of this tournament over the years. This year, attendance at the dome was 72,171-an increase on last year’s figMAIN COMMITTEE",145,Adjournment
239,Mr Irons (Swan) (12.40 Pm),"Every January or December since 1988 in my electorateure. Secondly, good exposure is a component in attracting the highest-quality players. The 21 No. 1 world players hosted since 1988 is a testament to that. Thirdly, good exposure leads to international legitimacy. Each successful year helps the event to cement its position on the international tennis calendar. However, potentially the most destructive result of reducing exposure would be the possible variation and/or renegotiation of sponsorship contracts. Contracts with the Hopman Cup require a minimum of 25 hours of free-to-air television coverage to be valid. Currently, the ABC broadcasts 42 hours. If ABC coverage ended, contracts would have to be varied and the lack of exposure to a national audience would surely mean a dramatic fall in sponsorship for the Hopman Cup. A decline in sponsorship revenue would reduce the ability of the tournament to attract the best players. The ABC pulling out of the cup would be disastrous for WA tennis. It would likely see further centralisation of international tennis on the east coast. This must not be allowed to happen. I understand the key motivation for the ABC to concentrate more on women’s and regional sport. I point out that the feedback I have received from regional Australia about the Hopman Cup coverage has been extremely positive. People as far away as Far North Queensland have commented on how much they enjoy the broadcast. It is interesting to note also that the ABC threatened to withdraw its coverage of the Women’s National Basketball League last year, but a furore from the community erupted and it changed its mind. Hopefully, this will happen with the Hopman Cup as well. It is also important to remember that tennis is one of the biggest women’s participation sports in Australia and that half the competitors at the Hopman Cup are women. I have written to the ABC director of sport asking the ABC to consider its review of the contract for next season. If anything, the ABC should perhaps be considering extending its coverage to the legendary night sessions. A comment on the ABC websites states: My husband and I look forward to this each year and am disappointed that ABC Free to Air do not have the complete coverage. We will miss tonights match and every night as we do not have pay tv and cannot afford. Please ABC free to air, can you please get the night matches as well. Perth is a fantastic city that deserves to host important events. The Hopman Cup organisers deal with the players, coaches, officials, VIPs, the army of volunteers and other staff with consummate professionalism. I hope the ABC will recognise that, acknowledge the local and international support for the cup and continue to provide its fantastic coverage in the years to come. The local community supports this event through all the children who are ball boys and ball girls who come from the various tennis clubs all around the district of Perth to support the Hopman Cup. SoI will fight and continue to fight to save this important event in my electorate of Swan. Longman Electorate: Nation Building and Jobs Plan like to support him in his call for the continued television coverage of the Hopman Cup. It is an excellent tournament and a wonderful format in which to give some prominence to women in the game, although they are achieving that of their own volition more latterly. Particularly, we could mention the wonderful result for Jelena Dokic in the Australian hardcourt championships recently. MAIN COMMITTEE",146,Adjournment
240,Mr Sullivan (Longman) (12.45 Pm),"CanI say to the member for Swan that I wouldI rise today to express my absolute astonishment at the fact that the members of the opposition in this place are seeking to block the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. The media comment that I have been able to see in the short time that I have had to review the media this morning seems to be suggesting that the media thinks this is a courageous act by the opposition in the Sir Humphrey mould. People contacting my office are overwhelmingly supporting it-but not, I should say, 100 per cent. There are some people who have contacted my office thinking that we have gone a step too far, but overwhelmingly, they are supporting it. Just a moment ago I received an email from somebody wanting to find out the details of the tax breaks for capital purchases for business. He obviously wants to take advantage of that to help his business. I thought I would have a look to see what this package provides for the people of Longman, the electorate that I represent here. In this package, 13,638 children will receive the back-to-school bonus. That is about $12.9 million, which will be paid in the week commencing 11 March. The single-income family bonus for those on family tax benefit part B will go to 12,879 people-another $12.2 million. That is $25.1 million going to people in my electorate who have a propensity to spend it in the week beginning 11 March. That has to do great things for the retail businesses in my electorate. The point of this household stimulus package is to put money into circulation now and, by giving it to people who are most likely to spend it, it will circulate more than just the once. On top of that, 4,139 people will be eligible for the training and learning bonus-another $4 million. The largest percentage of taxpayers in my electorate will receive the maximum of the tax bonus for working Australians. There will be $25-plus million in March and easily that much more between April and August cascading through. This is good for businesses in my electorate and it is good for jobs in my electorate, as people would understand if they had taken a moment to actually look at the retail figures for December that were released yesterday. The infrastructure stimulus of $23 billion makes up the greatest part of this package-not the money that goes into the pockets of people. In my electorate there are 40 schools: 26 primary, four combined primary and secondary schools and 10 secondary schools. All of these schools will receive money out of this package-money that they need to give our kids the best opportunity to receive a decent 21st century education or for those niggly refurbishments that need to be done. Public housing will receive $6.6 billion. My electorate is one where there is a long waiting list for public housing. This will help our people. There is additional money for the community infrastructure fund. I know that our mayor is in this building today. In round 1 of that program, my council submitted an application for $6 million as part of a $10 million project to build an equestrian centre. There is funding for boom gates at rail crossings and black spot programs. By not producing the money for these, we are putting the lives of Australian motorists at risk. I think the opposition ought to have another think about what it is doing in relation to this program. Economy Dr STONE (Murray) (12.50 pm)-I rise to condemn the Rudd Labor government for failing to properly manage Australia through the global financial difficulties that have the potential to beggar the robust Australian economy and certainly to indebt generations to come. We MAIN COMMITTEE have, of course, had a long record-it is almost a pattern of behaviour-of Labor governments putting the country into debt, and coalitions, or Liberal governments, bringing us out of debt. But it can take 10 years. It did the last time, with the $96 billion we inherited from Keating and Hawke. It looks like, with the new open cheque of $200 billion potentially, it is going to take the next coalition government even longer to bring the country back into order. Sadly, that will be at a huge price to the capacity of the country to invest in infrastructure, important services, to help those most needy and to stop the continued emergence of two different Australias: those in rural and regional Australia and those in the cities. In particular, on behalf of rural Australia. I want to express my extreme disappointment-I guess my disgust, too-at the attention given to the rural sector in this just-announced so called Nation Building and Jobs Plan. Let me remind members that in this plan we were told that there would be a farmers hardship bonus. Some 21,500 would be eligible for this farmers hardship bonus of about $950. Only those on exceptional circumstances would be eligible to receive this amount. That is only 14 per cent of Australia’s farmers. Across the nation we have other farmers in distress due to not only drought but also flood. Some are coming through extraordinary times with low prices and high input costs so that it is very hard to make ends meet, but only 14 per cent of Australian farmers will be eligible for the farmers hardship bonus. Meanwhile the same package gives an un-means-tested thousand-dollar grant to anyone who wants to have insulation in their ceiling. How can you equate those two measures in terms of justice, equity or just plain decency? The 86 per cent of farmers across Australia who have equally serious problems in terms of the global economic impact-in particular, it has affected producers of beef, dairy, wine, fruit et cetera-are not eligible for the farmers hardship bonus. I guess they can take some consolation in getting a thousand dollars worth of insulation! I can assure you that it will not be a compensation for them. All it does is rub salt into their wounds as once again they are overlooked. Primary producers are just that: they are employers; they are producers. They go out into the export markets of the world and compete against subsidised product. They have world-best product in so many cases. We have just heard how the European Union-and, soon to follow, the United States-is throwing subsidies back into the global dairy markets, which will make the recovery for our dairy industry even harder. I want to put on record the problems of the export dairying sector, in particular those who produce market milk. They employ across the board a significant proportion of the 40,000 people in the dairy sector. At the farm gate they have something like $11.5 billion annual value. This is the wholesale value of their product. They are now being offered prices below the cost of production, particularly in northern Victoria. They are a sector of the rural economy that has had drought for 10 years. We have just had a talk from Fonterra, one of the major manufacturers from northern Victoria-though this is also occurring in other parts of Australia such as Tasmania and Western Australia-which has acknowledged that the prices it is offering in northern Victoria are below the cost of production. It cannot see how even its best producers will be able to survive with that. Is there a mention of dairy farming or the dairy industry in this so-called stimulus package? Of course there is not a word. Dairy farmers are supposed to line up-some 14 per cent of them-for the farmers hardship bonus of $900-odd. That would not pay their fodder bills for a MAIN COMMITTEE week. This package from the Rudd Labor government is an insult. It reinforces a notion that the rural and regional sections of Australia are out of sight and out of mind-that because Labor does not represent them in this place it does not have to care. Thank heavens we have the coalition-in particular, the Liberal and National Party representatives, including my friend here-who will continue to fight for the rights of rural and regional Australians. They just have to look at what is in this package to see that, with only 14 per cent being addressed, there is a real problem. (Time expired) Mr Jack Pompei man who touched many lives and helped shape our local community. Jack was born in Italy and came to Australia with his family at a very young age. They settled in Mordialloc in the 1920s and Jack never left the town until his death on 30 December last year. I feel it is important to talk about Jack today in this place for two reasons: to recognise his hard work in making our area a better place and to discuss why it is important that the campaign to rename Mordialloc Bridge in his honour is successful. It would surprise no-one who knew Jack that hundreds of people lined the streets of Mordialloc to farewell him. Jack was best known for building boats, many of which still sail the waters of Port Phillip Bay. His creations are dotted all around the globe. Boating must be in the Pompei blood, because Jack’s father was a sailor and fisherman and taught both Jack and his brother Joe how to build boats. Jack and Joe became famous locally for their boats. The Pompei Boat Shed, located on Mordialloc Creek, is a local landmark. The landing on the creek near the boatshed had already been named ‘Pompei’s Landing’ before he passed awayan honour I know he was very proud of. Another honour Jack received was the Medal of the Order of Australia back in 1987 for his phenomenal work in marine search and rescue in Port Phillip Bay. It is estimated that he rescued more than 600 people over the years; some believe it was more than 1,000. Regardless of the number, it was a remarkable effort to head out into the bay, day or night, no matter what the weather, and pick up distressed people who had fallen foul of the sea. Jack was a local activist to whom the phrase ‘the personal is political’ could well be applied. He was a determined defender of Mordialloc Creek, harassing the state government to fix up the dying creek and constantly meeting with the Environment Protection Authority and local politicians to do more for one of Mordialloc’s defining features. Jack once said, ‘Take the creek out of Mordialloc and there would be nothing here.’ I was lucky enough to meet with Jack last year, at his boatshed where he explained to me what needed to be done to improve Mordialloc Creek and how it could be done. It was a privilege to spend time with him, and I came away with a more resolute belief that a lot more needs to be done in restoring Mordialloc Creek. The Kingston City Council and state authorities are looking at a proposal to do just that: to restore Mordialloc Creek. I am sorry that Jack will not be with us to share in the effort-one that I hope the whole community will be a part of-that will improve what, in a sense, has become a degraded environment. I am sure that Jack’s family has been touched by the outpouring of support following his passing, but I doubt that they would be surprised by the amount of it. It was no surprise to see MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Adjournment
241,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (12.55 Pm),"I rise today to speak about Jack Pompei OAM-athe local police stopping traffic on the Nepean Highway at the time of his funeral, and it was no surprise to see the many hundreds of people who turned out for the funeral. Jack used to be called ‘ Mr Mordialloc’, and I can think of no better honour for Jack than that the newly renovated Mordialloc Bridge be renamed ‘Pompei’s Bridge’. The City of Kingston and state parliamentarians Janice Munt, the member for Mordialloc, and Jenny Lindell, the member for Carrum, support this idea. I sincerely hope that the state Minister for Roads and Ports, the Hon. Tim Pallas, to whom I have written, can make this happen. Many words of condolence and appreciation have been said about Jack Pompei over the past month, and it has been moving to see our local community remember someone specialsomeone who was one of their own. I would like to join them. Our community thanks you, Jack, and may you rest in peace. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 12.59 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Defence Land: Moorebank (Question No. 176) Mrs Vale asked the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in writing, on 25 June 2008: Does the Government intend to secure the current School of Military Engineering site for an intermodal terminal development at Moorebank; if so, does it guarantee: (a) a full and transparent public consultation process; (b) that a full Environmental Impact Study will be undertaken; and (c) to establish an appropriate local authority that local residents can contact to have their concerns addressed. The Government has announced a commitment of $300 million towards the development of an intermodal terminal at the Moorebank site. Proper planning and environmental processes will be undertaken. Community Development Employment Projects (Question No. 355) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 13 October 2008: In respect of her response to question No.119 (Hansard, 26 August 2008, page 6259) concerning reinstatement of Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) in some Northern Territory communities: given CDEP income cannot currently be quarantined, how does the Government propose to ensure that people in the communities where CDEP will be reinstated will continue to spend at least 50 per sent of their Government-provided income on the necessities of life. Ms Macklin-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The government is committed to strengthening community safety and improving the protection of children and has introduced income management in the Northern Territory to ensure payments intended to benefit children are used exactly for that purpose. Income management only applies to certain welfare and family payments, as specified under Part 3B of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. Payments from Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) are not relevant payments under Part 3B, so under current legislation, income management does not apply to CDEP wages. However, under the proposed CDEP program reform model, new CDEP participants from 1 July 2009 would access CDEP while on income support, and would therefore be subject to income management where appropriate. Participants on CDEP at 30 June 2009 would continue to receive CDEP wages, subject to CDEP continuing and to participants remaining eligible for the program and not having a break from CDEP for more that two consecutive weeks after 1 July 2009. CDEP wages would continue to be available until 30 June 2011 with participants being transitioned off CDEP wages over the three months after that date. As currently proposed, CDEP would only be offered in remote regions-that is in areas where there is not an established economy. Participants in areas where CDEP would cease would be transitioned to income support, subject to eligibility, and so would receive intensive assistance through the new Employment Services to help them to get and keep jobs.",150,Adjournment
242,Mr Albanese,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Welfare Reform (Question No. 356) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 13 October 2008: (1) Has the Government yet established protocols with any State or Territory covering the transfer of school attendance data to Centrelink for the purpose of suspending welfare payments to parents whose children do not attend school. (2) Has the Government sought advice on whether the transfer of such data would breach privacy law. (3) What is the Government’s timeframe for the establishment of these protocols. (4) Will Centrelink be required to advise schools of pupils whose parents receive welfare payments so that their attendance records can be provided. (5) How will Centrelink approach determining whether school age children of existing welfare recipients are enrolled. (6) How many parents does the Government estimate could lose welfare payments as a result of the antitruancy initiative. Ms Macklin-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) In preparation for implementation of the Improving School Enrolment and Attendance through Welfare Reform Measure, the Government is currently negotiating protocols with representatives from the Northern Territory and Western Australian trial jurisdictions for the provision of information to Centrelink in relation to those children who are failing to attend school and whose parents are failing to take reasonable steps to ensure their children are attending school. (2) The Social Security and Veterans’ Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Schooling Requirements) Bill 2008 provides that a state or territory or a non-government school authority or any other person who is responsible for the operation of one or more schools may give the Commonwealth information about the enrolment/non-enrolment or attendance/non-attendance of children at school. Under the relevant section of the legislation, information about schooling can be provided despite any law (whether written or unwritten) in force in a state or territory. (3) Negotiations are currently underway with trial jurisdictions to establish bilateral agreements for implementation of the measure from the beginning of the 2009 school year. (4) Centrelink will not be providing wholesale data to schools about parents who are in receipt of income support. Where they perceive it to be appropriate, schools or education authorities will liaise with Centrelink on specific children who are not attending school to the satisfaction of the school or education authority and whose parent(s) are not taking reasonable steps to ensure their children attend school. Centrelink will advise whether the parent receives income support and is therefore subject to the measure. (5) Under the measure, parents receiving a variety of Commonwealth income support payments who live in a trial location and have children of compulsory school age will be contacted by Centrelink and required to provide enrolment information. This information can be provided by phone, in person or by completing a form. Those parents who fail to provide enrolment information to Centrelink without a reasonable excuse will be required to engage with Centrelink and will be offered social worker assistance. (6) The measure provides for the temporary withholding of a parent’s income support payment if the parent has failed to meet their requirements; despite repeated attempts by Centrelink and education authorities to assist the parent and in the absence of any reasonable excuse or special circumstance. Once parents meet their requirements within a 13 week period, their payments will be restored with full back pay. It is only after a minimum of 13 weeks of suspended payments that a parent may have their payments cancelled, and thus “lose payments”. The measure provides for multiple contacts by Centrelink staff and Centrelink social workers with parents to offer them support; with the aim of enabling parents to meet their requirements and thereby avoid any suspension of payments. It is expected that very few parents will have their payment cancelled. Welfare Reform (Question No. 363) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 20 October 2008: Further to her answer to question No. 213 (Hansard, 13 October 2008, page 121) concerning the Improving School Enrolment and Attendance through Welfare Reform Measure: (a) what are current school attendance rates at the eight locations where the program will be trialled; (b) what will constitute ‘regular’ attendance for the purposes of this program; and (c) will these schools be required to inform Centrelink if a child is not attending regularly. Ms Macklin-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) The Improving School Enrolment and Attendance through Welfare Reform Measure is being trialled in six sites in the Northern Territory (NT) – Katherine, Katherine Town Camps, Wadeye, Hermannsburg, Wallace Rockhole and the Tiwi Islands– an area in Cannington, Western Australia (WA) and one other metropolitan location yet to be announced. Attendance rates for government schools are available on the NT and WA Departments of Education and Training websites. Attendance data for non-government schools is not publicly available. The tables below provide 2008 attendance information about government schools in the NT and WA trial locations: NT School Area Attendance Rate% Ntaria Hermannsburg 69 Wallace Rockhole Wallace Rockhole 71 Milikapiti Tiwi Islands 76 Pularumpi Tiwi Islands 80 Casuarina St Primary Katherine 91 Katherine High Katherine 83 Katherine South Primary Katherine 88 MacFarlane Primary Katherine 74 Clyde Fenton Primary Katherine 80 WA School Suburb Attendance Rate% Beckenham Primary School Beckenham 93 Cannington Community Education Support Centre Cannington 87 Cannington Community College Cannington 92 Sevenoaks Senior College Cannington 77 Gibbs Street Primary East Cannington 94 East Kenwick Primary Kenwick 92 WA School Suburb Attendance Rate% Kenwick School Kenwick 89 Queens Park Primary Queens Park 89 Wattle Grove Primary Wattle Grove 94 Wilson Primary Wilson 93 (b) The monitoring of attendance falls under the responsibility of state/territory education authorities. Under the measure, state/territory education authorities can ask Centrelink for assistance where the education authority believes that a child is failing to attend school to the satisfaction of that state or territory as required by the law of that state or territory. (c) Under existing arrangements, education authorities are responsible for monitoring children’s attendance at school. Where an attendance issue is identified, it is anticipated that the education authority will draw on existing practices to attempt to resolve the issue. If the attempts to resolve the issue are unsuccessful, the education authority could consider whether a referral to Centrelink under the measure would be helpful. Family Payments (Question No. 367) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 20 October 2008: Is he aware of concern among relatives or associates of persons suffering from serious drug addiction, that the full cash payments scheduled to be made on 8 December 2008 under the Government’s Family Payments Program could lead to drug overdose of eligible recipients with drug addictions. Ms Macklin-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Economic Security Strategy (ESS) Payment announced by the Government on 14 October 2008 provided $3.9 billion in support payments to low and middle income families. In order to ensure that payments were made before Christmas in most cases, eligible families received their payments in line with existing payment arrangements. In all, around 3.9 million Australian children benefited from the $1,000 ESS payment. A further $4.8 billion was paid to Australia’s 4 million pensioners, carers and seniors providing them with immediate financial help in the lead up to comprehensive reform of the pension system. The Government helps to support and strengthen families through the provision of early intervention services to enhance family relationships, assist in problem solving, prevent family breakdown and resolve conflict around separation, provide support to families of drug users and reduce family violence, particularly in indigenous communities. The Government is committed to protecting the health and safety of children and that is why those customers in our communities who are subject to income management have their ESS payment income managed at 100%. This is consistent with current arrangements for lump sum payments under income management. People will be able to discuss with Centrelink as to how they want to allocate the funding towards meeting priority needs and other non-prohibited expenditures. Income management of these payments will help prevent a sudden flow of cash towards prohibited items such as alcohol, drugs, tobacco, gambling and pornography. Iraq (Question No. 370) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 10 November 2008: (1) Will he confirm that on 24 September 2008 Iraq’s Parliament approved the Provincial Election Law allowing elections to occur in 2009, but dropped a key clause (Article 50) that guaranteed a specific number of seats for minorities on provincial councils. (2) Will he confirm that Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Iraq, has called on the country’s legislature to reinstate Article 50 because he believes it provides a strong indication that Iraq is a nation ready to protect the political rights of minorities, as founded in Iraq’s Constitution. (3) Will he confirm that thousands of Iraqi Christians participated in demonstrations demanding the return of Article 50. (4) Will he confirm that President Jalal Talabani (a Kurd) and Vice Presidents Tareq al-Hashemi (A Sunni Arab) and Adel Abdul-Mahdi (a Shia Arab) have appealed to the Iraq Parliament to reinstate guaranteed minority seats on provincial councils. (5) Will he confirm that Iraq Parliament’s decision to drop Article 50 was followed by a dozen murders of Christians in Mosul, resulting in thousands of Christians fleeing the city. (6) Will he confirm that leaflets were distributed in several predominantly Christian neighbourhoods of Mosul, threatening families to either convert to Islam, pay the jizyah, leave the city or face death. (7) What is the Australian Government’s position on the re-instatement of Article 50. (8) Is he aware that the Assyrian Christian population of Iraq fell from 1.3 million in 1990, to 800,000 in 2003, and is estimated at only 400,000 in 2008. (9) What action is the Australian Government taking to help protect the lives and rights of minorities in Iraq. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Iraq, recommended on 2 October 2008, that twelve seats be guaranteed for minority groups in Iraqi provincial elections. The Government of Iraq recently announced it would guarantee six seats in provincial governments for Christian and other minorities. (3) There have been media reports that Iraqi Christians have demonstrated. (4) The Government of Iraq announced on 8 November that it would guarantee six seats in provincial governments for Christian and other minorities, in the provinces of Baghdad, Ninewa and Basra, which would be contested in the provincial elections to be held on 31 January 2009. (5) The Australian Government is aware of media reports of violence towards Christian groups in Mosul, but is not aware of information linking attacks against minorities to the removal of Article 50. (6) The Australian Government does not have information on this. (7) Electoral arrangements in Iraq are a matter for the democratically elected Government of Iraq to determine. Australia continues to urge the Iraqi Government to do all it can to protect the human rights of all Iraqis. I raised Australia’s concerns about the protection of human rights of minority groups, including Christians, in Iraq when I met Iraq’s Deputy Prime Minister, Barham Salih, in Baghdad on 10 June 2008. The Government continues to monitor developments in human rights in Iraq and has instructed the Australian Embassy in Baghdad to take all appropriate opportunities to raise our concerns about violence against minorities. As part of ongoing efforts, on 18 November 2008 the Australian Ambassador called on the Minister of Human Rights, Wydan Mikha’il Salim, to express Australia’s concerns regarding the security of Iraq’s minority groups. (8) There are no definitive, reliable figures on the size of the Christian population in Iraq. Assyrian Christians in Iraq have suffered significantly over recent years, including through major displacement from their homes, as have other minority communities in Iraq. (9) The Australian Government remains concerned about violence in Iraq and persecution of minority groups. The Iraqi Constitution describes rights and protections for Iraq’s minorities. Despite this, extremist groups in Iraq have continued attacks on minorities. As I said in response to question seven, Australia continues to urge the Iraqi Government to do all it can to protect the human rights of all Iraqis. I raised Australia’s concerns about the protection of human rights of minority groups, including Christians, in Iraq when I met Iraq’s Deputy Prime Minister, Barham Salih, in Baghdad on 10 June 2008. The Government continues to monitor developments in human rights in Iraq and has instructed the Australian Embassy in Baghdad to take all appropriate opportunities to raise our concerns about violence against minorities. As part of ongoing efforts, on 18 November 2008 the Australian Ambassador called on the Minister of Human Rights, Wydan Mikha’il Salim, to express Australia’s concerns regarding the security of Iraq’s minority groups. The Australian Government remains committed to supporting Iraqis in need, including minorities. On 19 December 2008 I announced the Australian Government would provide $1 million to assist Christian and other minority groups in Ninewa Province, Northern Iraq, who had been the victims of recent outbreaks of sectarian violence. That assistance will be provided through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Medical Corps (IMC). It will fund emergency provisions, medical support, reconstruction efforts and the tracking of families who have fled into neighbouring countries. This funding brings the total humanitarian assistance provided by the Australian Government to Ninewa Province to $3 million. Australia is already providing $2 million through the IMC to assist Iraqis in Ninewa Province who have suffered from violence. This funding is going towards emergency medical training, women’s centres and mental health services for primary school age children. The Government is providing an additional $10 million to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship’s Displaced Persons Program to assist Iraqis in neighbouring and transit countries. This funding will assist international organisations and NGOs to maintain protection space (i.e. access to asylum, humanitarian assistance and protection) and enable Iraqis outside Iraq to settle with security and dignity pending long term resolution. This is part of Australia’s overall assistance program to Iraq, worth $165 million over the next three years. Australia is also assisting Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) through its immigration program. The Government has increased the size of the 2008-2009 Humanitarian Program by 500 places, specifically for Iraqis. Iraqis are likely to be the single largest national group of entrants under the Humanitarian Program during 2008-09. Indigenous Communities (Question No. 379) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 10 November 2008: (1) Has the Government considered the potential impact of the Christmas bonus payments for pensioners (made as part of the Government’s $10 billion fiscal package) on remote indigenous communities; if so, on what date did she first receive specific advice on this issue, and what was the advice. (2) Has the Government considered making these payments in instalments in places such as Cape York and the Kimberley, as will be done in the Northern Territory under existing rules. (3) Why has the Government decided to pay these bonuses as lump sums when the Baby Bonus is now paid in instalments. Ms Macklin-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Government considered the impact of the Economic Security Strategy payments on remote indigenous communities. In communities where income management was in place payments were managed through that process. That is, 100% of the lump sum was income managed. Income management covered both income support and family payments for those who met the relevant eligibility criteria. The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs worked at a state and local level to ensure service providers and government agencies working in communities were aware of the payments and made arrangements appropriate to that community. (2)The Government has managed the Economic Security Strategy payments through income management rather than instalment. People eligible for the Economic Security Strategy payments that were subject to income management in the Northern Territory, and the Cape York and the Western Australia Child Protection initiative, at the time of payment, have had their Economic Security Strategy payments income managed. People who were income managed negotiated with Centrelink as to how they wanted to allocate the funding towards meeting priority needs and other non-prohibited expenditures. (3) The purpose of the Economic Security Strategy is to boost the Australian economy. The Government made a decision to achieve this through targeted lump sum payments. Governor General (Question No. 390) Mr Melham asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 12 November 2008: Does the Governor General: (a) remain on the standard distribution list for all written assessments by the Office of National Assessments; and (b) receive assessments or briefings from any other Australian intelligence and security agencies; if so, which agencies. lows: (a) The Governor General is included in the regular distribution of Office of National Assessments reports; and (b) I have agreed to the Governor General being briefed by the other Australian intelligence and security agencies, as were her predecessors, so that, in appropriate circumstances, she may receive relevant material necessary for her to discharge her official responsibilities. Federal Executive Council (Question No. 391) Mr Melham asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 12 November 2008: (1) For: (a) 2006-07; and (b) 2007-08, how many meetings of the Federal Executive Council were presided over by (i) the Governor General, (ii) an Administrator of the Commonwealth, and (iii) the Vice-President of the Executive Council.",152,Questions In Writing

244,Mr Rudd,"I am advised that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator the Hon Chris Evans, received a request to intervene in the case of Dr Bernhard Moeller and his family on 26 November 2008. In response to this request, Senator Evans granted permanent visas to Dr Moeller and his family. (2) As above. Global Temperatures (Question No. 406) Dr Jensen asked the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Water, in writing, on 24 November 2008: (1) What are the four sources of global temperature records. (2) What temperature trend and absolute difference do they provide for the period: (a) December 1998 to the present; and (b) December 2001 to the present. (3) Which of the four: (a) uses (i) satellites, and (ii) land thermometers; and (b) are affected by the urban heat island effect. (4) What are the drawbacks of using land thermometers. (5) What are the advantages of using satellites. (6) What were temperature projections for the period: (a) December 1998 to the present; and (b) December 2001 to the present, in the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change’s third and fourth assessment reports (TAR and AR4, respectively). to the honourable member’s question: (1) A number of organisations produce records of global average surface temperatures. The most prominent data sets are HadCRUT3, produced by the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia and the Hadley Centre in the UK Meteorological Office; NASA-GISS, produced by NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies; and NOAA-NCDC, produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Climatic Data Centre (USA). Temperature estimates of layers of the atmosphere are also produced by several organisations. These include the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) temperature estimates produced by Remote Sensing Systems with support from NASA and the University of Alabama, USA. Weather balloonbased temperature analyses are produced by the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia and the Hadley Centre in the UK Meteorological Office as well as by NOAA-NCDC. (2) These primary records show sustained warming trends from the surface to the lower layer of the atmosphere (troposphere) with cooling above. (a) In two of the data sets of global average surface temperatures, HadCRUT3 and NASA-GISS, the linear trend over the interval 1998-2008 is one of warming.

245,Mr Rudd,I am advised that the answer to the honourable member's question is as fol,160,Questions In Writing
246,Mr Swan,"The Minister for Climate Change and Water has provided the following answerthe temperatures in the specific years 1998 and 2008 for the HadCRUT3 and NASA-GISS data sets are -0.202 and -0.150 oC, respectively. The NOAA-NCDC data set has not yet been updated to include 2008, but the interval 19982007 displays a warming trend. The absolute difference between temperatures in the specific years 1998 and 2007 is -0.027 oC. (b) For the NASA-GISS data set, the linear trend for the period 2001-2008 is one of warming, whereas HadCRUT3 shows cooling over this period. Absolute differences between 2001 and 2008 for the HadCRUT3 and NASA-GISS data sets are -0.087 and 0.000 oC, respectively. The NOAA-NCDC data set displays a warming trend for the period 2001-2007. The absolute difference between temperatures in 2001 and 2007 is +0.056 oC. The variation in trends is primarily due to the differences in spatial averaging techniques used to calculate the global average temperature. Trends seen in global surface temperature over short periods, such as from 1998 to the present, are not good indicators of longer term climate change. At short time scales, trends are strongly affected by year-to-year variability and by the start and end of times chosen. In 1998 and 2002, the Earth’s temperature was exceptionally hot because of El Niño events, and a La Niña event caused colder temperatures in 2000 and 2007. It is more robust to analyse data over many decades and climate scientists often use an 11-year moving average to remove short term variability from the record so that long term trends can be observed. (3) (a) (i) HadCRUT3, NOAA-NCDC and NASA-GISS all use land thermometer measurements. Sea surface temperature measurements are made on ships and buoys. (ii) There are versions of these data sets that also incorporate satellite measurements, but the the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fourth Assessment Report avoided using these data sets, since there is not a long history of satellite measurements, ie no measurements prior to 1979. (b) Urban heat island effects are real but localised, and have not biased large scale trends in the global surface temperature. The effect of urbanisation on the land-based temperature record is neglible because the local effects are avoided or accounted for in the data sets used. Over the oceans there is clearly no urban heat island effect. Hence, the potential for urban heat islands to affect global surface temperature estimates is very limited. (4) Advantages of using land thermometers: thermometers measure temperature directly; and there is a long history (around 150 years) of reliable thermometer measurements, which can be compared to detect long term trends. Disadvantages of using land thermometers: some measurements in large cities must be adjusted to correct for urban heat island effects; and there is limited data available from thermometers in the polar regions. (5) Advantages of using satellites: satellites can provide temperature information for the ocean surface, which may supplement data from thermometers on ships and buoys; satellites also provide information about changes in the temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere; and satellites provide almost global information rapidly. Disadvantages of using satellites: Satellites record data on radiation, which is an indirect measure of temperature; Disparities remain among different tropospheric (lower atmosphere) temperature trends estimated from satellites since 1979, and are still likely to contain residual errors, although estimates have been substantially improved through adjustments for issues such as changing satellites and orbits; and The vertical resolution of historical satellite data is poor, meaning that it is not possible to fully isolate cooling of the stratosphere from warming in the troposphere. (6) The temperature projections in the third and fourth assessment reports of the IPCC are, by their nature, multi-decadal projections in which the effects of internal climate variability on the decadal timescale are averaged out. It is therefore not meaningful to infer ‘projections’ over short time periods, such as December 1998 to the present or December 2001 to the present, from the published IPCC material. Overseas Students (Question No. 433) Dr Stone asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 27 November 2008: In respect of overseas students: (a) how many are currently in Australia; (b) what is the breakdown by (i) nationality; (ii) course; and (iii) state; (c) how many overseas student deaths have been reported since November 2007; and (d) what was the cause of these deaths. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (a) As at 30 September 2008, there are 363 560 persons on student visas, including student dependants, in Australia.

Tertiary Education (Question No. 546) Mr Katter asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 4 December 2008: (1) Is she aware (a) that the tertiary participation rate of persons aged 17-22 years in metropolitan electorates is nearly double that of those in rural electorates; and (b) of the economic challenges that bring about this disparity.(2) As part of her ‘education revolution’, what extra incentives will be offered to help ease the economic burden and reduce the consequent disadvantage for country based students.(3) Would she consider implementing a ‘Tertiary Access Allowance’ as financial assistance to rural and remote students who must live away from home, to enable them to access tertiary education; if so, could it involve, on proof of initial enrolment, an annual non means tested allowance of $6000 a year(indexed to Consumer Price Index) that would not jeopardise their eligibility for existing support payments (i.e. Youth Allowance and ABSTUDY) for the duration of their full time course. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) (a) Yes. HoweverI am uncertain of Mr Katter’s source. There is a strong relationship between rural or regional location and participation in higher education, as shown in Table 1. The relationship for vocational education and training is less marked. Table 1: Participation of 15-24 Year Olds in Non-school Education by Remoteness Areas*, Australia, 2006 Mainland Major Large ProSmall Inner Outer Remote Very Australia State Urban vincial City Provincial ProvinProvincial Area Remote Capital District District City cial Area Area Area District Higher Males 27.3% 24.5% 21.5% 16.4% 17.3% 11.7% 8.8% 8.5% 25.6% Education Females 33.5% 31.9% 33.2% 29.1% 27.6% 22.9% 18.6% 18.0% 32.6% VET Males 29.2% 28.4% 26.8% 26.0% 26.2% 22.7% 22.9% 19.4% 28.1% Females 20.5% 20.7% 20.6% 20.4% 18.1% 17.2% 17.0% 17.0% 20.1% Source: ABS, Census of Population and Housing, 2006. *Due to methodological issues there may be differences between this data and total State and Australia data reported by the ABS (b) Yes. Economic factors are but some of the influences on higher education participation, and do not operate the same way in all locations. As important are local business and industry, family and student aspirations, job opportunities and lifestyle choices. (2) Several Australian Government programs are in place that assist rural and regional students. These include Youth Allowance and Austudy, deferred payment arrangements for tuition costs through the Higher Education Loan Programme (HELP) and funding for Commonwealth Scholarships. The doubling of Commonwealth Scholarships from 44,000 to 88,000 by 2012, is directly focused on helping disadvantaged students, including those living in regional and remote areas, in better accessing higher education. (3) I will not comment on specific proposals at this stage. Income support for students has been identified as a key issue in the Bradley Review of Australian Higher Education. The report from the Review was released recently by the Australian Government on 17 December 2008. The Australian Government will consider the findings of the Review and respond in due course.
