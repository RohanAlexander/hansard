31,Mr Hedges (Fremantle) [10.47],"I,amendment, if made, will help a freeholder who has poor land, as against a leaseholder who holds tracts of equal, perhaps better, quality at a nominal rate. I know of instances where land which was purchased years ago ""is not worth the purchase money, including the value of the improvements, so that there can be no hardship in what I propose. In regard to the exemption of the money first paid for town lots, the amount would be so trivial that it is hardly worth consideration. in the case of country lands it is worth consideration. Whereas on town blocks, perhaps, it would not amount to a few shillings, on country land it would amount to so much per acre. In many instances the money which was paid by the early settlers has gone to the improvement of towns, the building of roads round cities, and the improvement of public parks and recreation reserves, and all that sort of thing. After thirty or forty years of settlement, roads have not even been formed through the properties, so that the settlers have received very little in return for the money which they paid for the feesimple of their lands. I claim that, in accepting my proposal, the Government would only be treating those persons with fairness. There is another phase of this subject which should be considered, because the time will come when the ,£5,000 exemption will be lowered. It would not come with a very good grace to make this proposal when we were asked to lower the r exemption. It is better to lay the foundation now, so that in after years the principle can apply with fairness to smaller areas. I think honourable meml«rs will see that the wrong which would otherwise be done to persons in (he back blocks, who have paid even more thantheir land was worth, would lie to some extent averted by what I propose. In fact, when the money was taken from these persons, many others considered that they had. paid too much for their lands, and many of them did. I think that if the actual amount which was paid for the land were exempted from the tax, the exemption would be well received throughout Australia, and persons would look upon this Parliament as trying to act fairly, instead of penalizing them. There is no doubt that many honourable members on the Ministerial side will see the fairness of my proposition. Let us look at the increment on the money paid for the land. The value of ,£20,000, paid in twenty annual instalments, w ould, at 5 per cent., ; be over ,£200,000. No doubt the buyers have had the use of the land in the meantime, but the Government have had the use of the money, so that it is really fair not to tax men on the money which was paid. I hope that the Minister will agree to amend this portion of the clause in the manner I propose. But General) [10.57] -This amendment tc exempt the price paid to the Crown is not one which can be accepted by the Government. The argument which is mostly used, in the press and elsewhere, in favour of the acceptance of this principle presumes that the justification, ethical and economic, for the tax is the right of the community to the unearned increment, and that as the Crown has been paid for the land it has no right to demand the amount again. If this tax were based on that, the argument would have weight, but its justification is not dependent upon the right of the people to the unearned increment. No graduated land tax can be, because the unearned increment is, so to speak, the layer of value whicli is added to all lands uniformly-that is, uniformly so far as the size of the holding is concerned. Quite irrespective of whether a man owns £ 1 0 0 or £100,000'. worth of land, the unearned increment attaches to every pound's worth of value uniformly. But the principle of this Bill is quite opposed to that. It does not take off or attempt to take off a uniform skiming of value, but it becomes more intense in the ratio of the aggregation of the individual holdings. The principle underlying the Bill, therefore, is not the right of the people to the unearned increment, although that, of course, is clearly established, but the right of the people to have access to the land itself and the danger to the community of allowing large aggregations of land in the hands of individuals. It is quite immaterial whether a man bought his land from the Crown or from somebody else, whether he paid £ 1 or £100,000 an acre, the fact remains that if one man owned this country he would have the right to determine the conditions under which the whole community could live. It is for that reason that a graduated land tax is finding favour in countries where the aggregation of lands in the hands of private individuals is becoming greater as time goes on.

W;hy did men pay £ i per acre for their land? Simply because of the inhabitants who were here. Ample allowance is made in this Bill for the money which was originally paid for the purchase of land. The honourable member for Fawkner has pointed out that a nnancial institution may hold a mortgage over land to the extent of half its value. But I would remind him that any man who holds decent land makes a good deal more than 5 per cent, out of it. As a matter of fact, he should be making 100 per cent. ber has not had experience of farming. chased land for £ 1 per acre, and who are making £ 2 and £ 3 per acre out of it.

If such cases as the honourable member for Fawkner has mentioned really exist, I say that the men who are holding those lands are not putting them to their best use, and it is time they made way for better men. [11.21] -A t first sight the amendment appears to be based upon a fair principle, but in reality, there is room for considerable doubt on the point. Judge Blackstone, in his Commentaries on English Law, points out that an estate which is held in fee-simple is really an estate which is held in tenancy at the will of the Crown-that the Crown is the ultimate owner of all land. In other words, when it sells land the Crown does not part with its right to tax that land up to the last pennyworth of its value. Now, let me take the case of a municipal council. I happen to know an instance in which a municipality proposes to sell certain lands which are in its possession, and upon which a town hall was built some years ago. That building is no longer adequate for the purpose for which it was originally erected, and the council has purchased some more land upon which it proposes to erect a more suitable building. If the principle which is embodied in this amendment is recognised in the case of Crown lands, it must also be recognised in the case of municipal lands. But would anybody contend for a moment that the sale of the land upon which the building to which I have referred now stands, ought to exempt the purchaser from municipal taxation? -not applicable in both cases, because a municipality gives something in exchange all the time. destination of the purchase money makes volved. The principle remains the same, irrespective of whether that money finds its way into the Treasury or into the pockets of private individuals. And the purchaser from the Crown has not only the land for his use and profit, but all the advantages of railway construction, protection of his life and property, road and bridge construction, but many other advantages also beyond the power of a municipality to confer. The Crown does not part with its right to tax land whenever the public needs demand it.

Whether it is expedient or not to exempt the amount originally paid, is a point I am not discussing, and the whole point is whether it is right or just to do so. addition to the points which were made by the honourable member for Macquarie, I wish to remind the Committee that a very considerable return has been derived from the State by those who have purchased land. Undoubtedly the money which they paid in the first instance was a source of revenue to the Government. But it was expended in providing public utilities in the form of railways, &c. So that the purchasers have already had a very considerable return. that return. point out to the honourable member that there are cases in which the construction of railways has had the effect of enhancing the value of land by ,£2 per acre. In submitting his amendment, the honourable member for Fremantle did not mention quite a number of factors which are worthy of consideration. We all know that some persons have purchased from the Government land at ,£1 per acre which was worth £ 4 per acre, whilst others have paid _£i per acre for land which was not worth 5s. per acre. But these are extreme cases. When the honourable member for Fremantle reminded us that it was not worth our while to consider city lands, it . at once occurred to me that a block between Elizabeth-street and Swanston-street, which was originally sold for .£3,000, was valued fifty years afterwards at £19,000,000. In the Western District of Victoria, large estates were purchased for which .£5, ,£6, and ,£7 per acre was paid. land. tended that its present holders should get that land. They secured it by means of dummying under the Act of 1863. It was deliberately cut up into blocks for farmers. The largest area of the blocks was 640 acres, and they were smaller according to quality. The farmers did not procure a bit of that land. It was all secured by the original squatter-the man who held previously under lease-althoug h it was never the intention that he should secure it. In some cases the average that he paid for areas of something like 170,000 acres was just a few pence under ' £ 2 an acre. The honourable member quotes cases of land sold at ,£i an acre, which is perhaps worth less now j but he does not quote the cases I am speaking of. The honourable member is probably unaware of them, but if he wants to ascertain some of the facts he will find them in the very interesting History of Land Tenure in Victoria, written by the honourable member for Bendigo. He will see there that men secured areas of 25,000 acres, 11,000 acres, and so on. The very principle of this Bill is to make it unprofitable for the big holders to continue to hold that agricultural land which is now being used for grazing. Before we could adopt the honourable member's proposal we should have to reconstruct the had measure, and put it on an altogether different basis. If we carry out the principles that the Government have adopted, and wish to strike a ""straight-out blow at the big estates, and make it unprofitable to hold them, the amendment cannot be accepted, because it would release from any sort of tax that would have any effect upon them some of the very estates that it is most desirable should be restored to the uses which the Government of Victoria originally had in view when they framed a Bill to cut them up. That purpose was. defeated by systems which I do not want to dwell upon now, but they were aided very much in the drafting of the measure by a little word slipping in at the instance of their friends in the Victorian Legislative Council, and opening the door practically for dummying. The honourable member now proposes that those people should be allowed exemption on the money that they paid; but that would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill. quire their land in the manner to which the honourable member refers. that all sorts of prices were paid. Some secured at £ 1 an acre-the peculiar old idea of £ 1 an acre came originally from South Australia-lan d which was worth ,£4 an acre when they bought it, and which is worth a very big sum now. honestly. other cases, ,£ i an acre was paid to the Crown for land that is not worth it to-day.",20,Wynne Th E Farmers At No Difference Whatever To The Principle In

74,Mr Spence,"Yes, in those cases. InThere is such a wide difference between 'the different cases that the honourable member's proposal could not be applied with any fairness. look at it, there appears an element of fairceptional case where a man is growing some ness about the .proposition, but when one goes into it in detail, he realizes that the circumstances and conditions are so varied that the principle cannot be applied without raising many other difficulties. To my mind the Bill all through aims at putting a stop to the accumulation of large estates by making it unprofitable to hold them when they exceed a certain area. There is also the big exemption of £5,000 worth of unimproved value. All these things have to be recognised. We could make allowances in different ways if the Bill was entirely different. If , for inonions have not paid for digging, and have stance, the Bill was purely a taxation Bill without any exemption, these points might be considered; but, viewing the. principle which the measure has been framed to accomplish, I do not see how it is possible for the Government to accept the amendment. They have already stated that they cannot accept it, and I think they are doing right. [11.35] I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Macquarie talk about the wonderful returns from land. I lived for-many vears in the Ballarat district, where the best potato-growing land is fo be found. would be very pleased to get anything like the returns mentioned by the honourable member. The holdings there are not big. They run from 20 to 300 acres,, the latter being a very big property in that district, and the farmers do very' well if they get more than 5 per cent, 'on the present value of the land. There is very little land in Victoria, that will pay more than 5 or 6 per cent, on' its present value. It is very good land, indeed, that will return for wheat an average of 30s. an acre, year in and year out. By very intense cultivation, in the case of a man working a market garden near a city with his own family, a return of £ 3 0 an acre may be got, but you cannot make farming land pay if you have to cart your produce any distance. If you are further than sixteen miles at the outside from the railway, farming will not pay. off land, would the honourable member say it was worth ;£6oo an acre? a man could get £ 3 0 an acre regularly off land, nor do I think any of such land is I admit that, on the first worth £600 per acre. There may be an exspecial class of fruit, or tomatoes, or asparagus, or, perhaps, flower seed. From an exceptional block you may get a fairly big return in those ways, but I am satisfied that no man can get £.30 an acre per annum off land by farming. £60 an acre for onions in the south-east of South Australia, and ,£40 an acre from potatoes near Ballarat. in and year out. I have known times when seen in the Ballarat district thousands of tons of potatoes that it did not pay to dig out of the ground. It is not fair to quote exceptional cases as giving the average over a long term of years. If any man gets a return of 6 per cent, off his land year in and year out, he is very lucky. 'The honourable member for Darling told the Committee just now that a block of land in Melbourne, sold in 1837 for £3,000, is now worth £19,000,000. What is this tax going to realize if one block of land in the city of Melbourne is worth £1.9,000,000? Assuming that half of that is the unimproved value, what an enormous return the Government will get. Many of the farmers there The tax, instead of bringing in £1,000,000 per annum, will bring in nearer £10,000,000 at that rate. I do not know whether the honourable member's figures are correct, but it was rather an eye-opener to me to hear there were blocks worth such an enormous sum. During the whole of this debate the members on the Government side have been preaching that they want to do justice and give fair play. The lands in the western district of New South -Wales cannot pay interest if there is a mortgage on them, and also pay the land tax, and give the owner anything. The owner is going to be absolutely starved out. I am not interested in any way in that land myself. I saw a balance-sheet yesterday of a syndicate of Victorian people, who had invested money in New South Wales, and who held their interest in small snares. They had bought a property with the idea of subdividing, but it is too far away from a railway, and therefore it has to be carried on as a grazing proposition. They put £^72,000 into it, and they owe £80,000,",21,Wynne Th E Farmers At No Difference Whatever To The Principle In

I hope the Attorney-General is not going to be adamant in regard to this amendment. If there be any justification for his refusal to accept the amendment, I , as one who wishes to do the fair thing between those who have land and those who have not, would be glad to hear it. I remind ' the Attorney-General again that the object of the Bill is to throw open lands for settlement, and not merely to raise revenue. I remind him also that that is the policy of the party of which he is a member, ancl that when a land-tax scheme was adopted at the Brisbane Conference in 1908, at which I was present, not a word was said about taxing the value represented by the amount originally paid to the Crown. There never was, in any man's mind at that Conference, any idea that such a proposal would ever be made to Parliament. exemption. heard a proposal for an exemption of ,£5,000, which I resented. AndI apprehend that the honourable member will be in a difficulty to find an effective answer to the settlement, we see that great injustice must charge that an exemption of a class makes a measure of this sort class legislation. on the class best able to pay it. that is true. Very often the owner of between £1,000 and £5,000 worth of unimproved value may be in a better position to pay a tax than is the man who holds more land. to adjust the balance of taxation. not going into .these refinements. I point out that a large section of the Labour party oppose all exemptions in land taxation, and that, in Western Australia, Labour Conferences have repeatedly pronounced against exemptions. The amendment of the honourable member for Fremantle is strictly and absolutely just, and ought to be adopted if we mean to adhere to the original purposes of this measure, which are solely to promote settlement and appropriate the unearned increment for the community. It is somewhat difficult to find out what is really in the mind of the Attorney-General. At one time we were led to believe that this was a measure for bursting up large estates, at another time, that it was for the purposes of revenue, and to-day the proposal is based on some other more abstract ground. Whatever is in the honourable gentleman's mind, I am certain that what was in the mind of a great number of honourable members opposite, and of the public, was that we were going to tax, not so much the unimproved value as the unearned increment. If that be admitted, as it ought to be, between man and man, we shall arrive at what the mandate really was. Australians are a fair-minded people, and do not desire to tax a man who in the way-back districts is making nothing to speak of out of his land. There is no wish to tax people who hold land in the Western Riverina, and who are actually prepared to sell for less than they originally paid; a bursting-up tax in regard to such holders was never contemplated. The honourable member for Lang said that, of course, all kinds of property, or, at any rate, all kinds of land are subject to taxation, and to ordinary taxation no one objects. But when an avowedly bursting-up tax is imposed on people who cannot burst up their estates, because no one will take up small areas away from railways and be done. We have had difficulty in bringing names before honourable members, but Mr Alexander T. Creswick, of Western Riverina, published a letter in the Argus of the 24th September, putting the position very plainly; and I ""should like honourable members to hear what he says in regard to land there which has not at all increased in value. Mr ""Creswick saidIn this district half the runs were resumed 2» years ago, and allotted, in blocks of 10,24s acres, to settlers. Very few of these now remain, whilst those who remain have holdings of from 40,000 to 50,000 acres. Many honourable members seem to regard all land as if it were like that to be found on the rich Hunter River flats, or about Warrnambool.",25,Wynne Th E Farmers At No Difference Whatever To The Principle In

If the Crown possesses the £ 1 per acre which was paid, and the land is now only worth 8s. 6d., as was the case with land sold only the other day, is the proposed tax fair?

The argument is that if a man does not like to pay the tax he ""may sell his land, but, as I have pointed out, these people cannot sell. the value. these cases will take the whole of the yearly value. honourable member that .it will do so.

Now the Eederal Government propose to tax the purchaser of that land (who cannot get what he originally paid for it) 23 per cent, on the capital invested, so that the return of the money so invested i ; pnly 1^ per cent., instead of 4 per cent.

He further fails to remember that the Bill now before the Committee is in every essential particular precisely the same as the Bill laid on the table of this House by the first Fisher Government, of which he was a member. Whatever may be properly said by honourable members returned to this Parliament pledged to oppose this measure, it does not lie in the mouth of those returned to support it to dissent from the basic principle on which it rests. The ,£5,000 exemption is certainly one of the principles upon which this party was returned to power.

Sincei t is clearly the general and uniform practice in New Zealand, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, and South Australia, where land taxation That might be a has been imposed, not to exempt the value paid to the Crown for land, it rests with the honourable member for Coolgardie to show that the people were led to believe that the Federal tax would differ fundamentally from the State land taxes in this particular, and that there is some violation of justice and some departure from the clear mandate of the people in the proposal made in country to be suffering from. this Bill. l submit that his position is quite untenable. The amount paid to the Crown is taxed in every tax, State and municipal. If there is a violation of justice by the Bill, there is also a similar violation by the Acts of Western Australia, This measure, in all essential particulars, conforms to the published platform of the Labour party, and to the statements made from the public platforms, and strictly conforms to the mandate deliberately given to us by the people on 13th April, after they had heard every conceivable argument from the other side. The Prime Minister and the Attorney General would have us believe that the Government does not wish to inflict injustice or undue hardship on any land-holder in Australia. But unless some such amendment as has been proposed is made, great injustice will be done to a good many persons. It is nonsense to say that the measure is in strict conformity with the policy advocated by the Labour party at the elections.

The honourable member must be aware that western Riverina contains many large holdings bought from the Crown, and heavily mortgaged, and that their owners will be ruined if the Bill is passed as it stands, beby a generation which has passed away, no cause their returns will not enable them to pay interest on their mortgages and a tax on the unimproved value of the land, including the price at which they bought from the Crown. In that district estates are being offered to-day with all their improvements for the price paid to the Crown for the land in its unimproved state. Mortgagees are offering the land totday in the open market, and cannot get JQI an acre for it. There must be persons similarly situated in the other States. member exempt the Van Diemen's Land Company? exempt any company or person, but I wish to prevent injustice. Honourable members opposite seem to think that because a man holds a large area of land he must be wealthy, and must be preventing settlement; hut in western Riverina there are many holdings on which closer settlement would be impossible, and if the present owners were dispossessed, the land would fall out of use. It now produces a certain quantity of wool, but were it to fall out of use our wool clip would be less, and wool still represents a very large part of the wealth annually produced in Australia. Thc people who are struggling on this land to-day are using it to the best advantage, considering its conditions. They are some of the most capable managers of grazing areas that we have. If the land could be put to better use, or sold to advantage, they-would not continue to use it only for grazing. Is it likely that they would stand in the way of bettering themselves? In Tasmania there has been a great outcry against certain owners for not selling their land, but I know that they would gladly sell at reasonable prices, if they could get them. Many of the Riverina land-owners cannot get even what they originaly paid to the Crown. The Attorney-General supports his opposition to the amendment with just the sort of arguments which I anticipated he would use. They are not altogether unfamiliar, and therefore one is able on the spur of the moment to subject them to a short analysis. He told us that had the present generation received the money paid to the Crown, it might be equitable ""to exempt the holders from taxation in respect of the sums so paid, but that the land having been bought such exemption can be allowed. In other words, he would exempt payments for land made by a man three years ago, but would not make an exemption in respect of payments for land made by his father. He reminded us that land has an undiminishing use, but forgot to add that so has Government stock, and so has every other form of investment in which the original purchase money or its equivalent value remains intact. If , forty years ago, one man had paid £1,000 for land, and another the same sum for Government stock, while the first would have had the continuous use of his land ever since, the other would have been in the regular receipt of interest from his investment. any unearned increment. the taxation of the unearned increment; I am speaking of the taxation of the sums paid to the Crown for the purchase of land. The honourable member will see that we are now singling out for special taxation the money originally invested in land, while allowing the money originally invested in Government stock to go scot free. That seems to me an utterly indefensible proceeding. It is absurd for any one who knows the history of Australia to say that because the generation which has gone received the money paid to the Crown for the land, this generation does not benefit by it. To what purpose has the land revenue of the States been applied? Has it not been devoted to the construction of railways, the building of bridges, the making of roads, and the carrying out of other public works, whereby the present generation benefits? It is nonsense for the Attorney-General to contend that this generation has received no benefit from the expenditure of the money which was received during the time of a former generation! The bulk of this money has been expended on what may be called national improvements. alone get a benefit. objecting tb the taxation of the unearned increment.",29,Wynne Th E Farmers At No Difference Whatever To The Principle In

Their obparently. am adhering to the proper principle; that is the taxation of the community-created value. I do oppose taxation of the money which owners honestly paid to the Government, and which, had it been invested in Government stock, or anything else, would be free from taxation under this measure. The honourable gentleman undertook to inform me as to the proper interpretation of the Labour platform, but I decline to accept him as the sole interpreter of it. He may be very astute, but I was present at the Brisbane Labour Conference, and know what was in the minds of its members a little better than he does, since he was not there. He complained that the Bill is identical with that of the Fisher Government, of which I was a member. skeleton of the measure brought down by the Government, but we have also sheaves of this Government's amendments which leave little resemblance between the two Bills. And let me remind him that the basic principles of the measure brought in by the Government of which I was a member, are set out clearly in a memorandum attached to the Bill itself. randum shows that the Bill was designed to burst up land monopoly, to promote settlement, and to obtain for the community some of the land values created by communal expenditure. It contains no hint or suggestion of a proposal to tax the value represented by the purchase money paid to the Crown by the possessors of land. us that the taxation of the amount paid to the Crown was to be taken for granted. I for one never took such an unfair proposal for granted; and I say now that nobody, on reading the Bill or the memorandum, would ever suspect that the amount which had been paid to the Government honestly by the owners of land was ever likely to be taxed. The Attorney-General further attempts to justify his attitude by pointing to the fact that in land taxation by the States no exemption is allowed for the purchase money paid to the Crown. He instanced several States, among them Western Australia, where no exemption of this sort exists. Eveni f that be correct, it does not bear on this measure. This Bill is one to tax community-created values and to dislodge the land monopolist. The State taxation measures which he cited ject was to raise funds to meet the ordinary expenses of government; and fheir Parliaments recognised that land, like other forms of property, should bear its legitimate share of general taxation. There is, therefore, no precedent in State enactments or policy to justify the Attorney-General's contention. He can scarcely have overlooked the essential distinction between the two cases. He must know that, whereas we are taxing the community-created value, the Governments of the States tax land for the purpose of getting revenue to defray the cost of administrationa totally different thing. If he is aware of this fact, and desires to conceal it, then his action is pitiable. It looks like a deliberate attempt to misstate the case in order to mislead the Committee. We certainly have here the gentleman says is not true. orable gentleman must withdraw that statement. General must withdraw that statement. his in regard to that matter. member has withdrawn the statement. mon knowledge of the Committee will enable members to decide between my assertion and the apparent denial of the Attorney-General. The State Governments do The Attorney-General now tells not tax land to get in the accrued value, but to raise revenue, just the same as they do by taxing other forms of property. That is the difference, and an important one it is, which the Attorney-General ignored. He also stated that persons are expected to pay taxes according to their ability. Of course, that is perfectly correct in a general way, and it would be proper in the case of an income tax. But this Bill does not involve the payment of tax according to ability, but rather the payment of tax according to the amount of property the value of which was created by the community. The honourable gentleman also said that it was not proper for me, as a member of the Labour party, to say that this measure is not in accordance with that view-that it would be a proper statement for the honourable member for Fawkner to make, but coming from a member in my position it",30,Wynne Th E Farmers At No Difference Whatever To The Principle In

Many of us would be acting contrary to our pledges to our constituents if we supported the amendment. honourable member for Nepean was somewhat unfortunate in comparing Australian conditions with those of England as regards land. In England, there is no such thing as an absolute ownership of land; it is all held there under an old feudal system, by which the rights of the Crown to obtain practically the whole economic value have been preserved for all time. It is not so very long ago, comparatively speaking, that practically all the taxation of that country was raised from land. Under the domination of certain influences that taxation was gradually taken off the land and put on the shoulders of the people as a whole, but those conditions do not apply to Australia. Here, rightly or wrongly, the land is parted with absolutely by the Crown. It may also be said that it is parted with absolutely at pretty well its market value. So far as the greater part of the lands of Australia are concerned, and having regard to the time at whicli they were taken over, the price put by the Crown on them represented approximately as much as they were likely to bring. In Western Australia the Crown is increasing the value of its lands according as the demand goes, and is very careful to keep it as near as possible to the present requirements of settlement. The Attorney-General would be doing his own cause and party a good service if he simply sat tight and allowed .his battalions to speak by means of their voting, because the last time. I heard him refer to the amendment of the honourable member for Fremantle I felt almost under compulsion to reply to what he said. He indicated that the honourable member for Fremantle practically contended in his amendment that once land was parted with by the State the State was not entitled to place any further charges upon it. Nothing could be further from the real contention Many people hold of the honourable member for Fremantle. It was quite a simple matter for the Attorney-General, having stated the position to suit himself, to proceed to demolish it. The honourable member for Fremantle does not contend that the State has no right to whatever increment may be added to the land subsequently. He merely contends that the price originally paid for the land shall not be regarded as portion of that unearned increment. If the Government are contending for the taxation of the unearned increment, I fail to see how they can, consistently with their own principles and position, refuse to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Fremantle. It will come upon the farming community as somewhat of a shock to learn from the speeches of honourable members on the other side that, apparently, the one form of unearned increment which the Labour party, in this Parliament, at any rate, have any regard for taxing is the unearned increment on land. Undoubtedly, as this principle is extended, and the limit of £5..ooo becomes reduced, as must inevitably happen, those people who are being protected by the exemption will no longer have that advantage. They will begin to realize before very long that the unearned increment, added to their smaller holdings, will be part and parcel of the plan of taxation that is now being adopted in the case of the larger estates. I think that if investigation were made of some of the speeches of the Attorney General, not perhaps in this House,"" but in connection with debates in which he has taken part in the past, there would be found in his own language the best possible refutation of the contention that we have a right to the unearned increment on land, but not on any other form of wealth.

I believe that by the methods they are adopting tliey will yet land themselves in the mire. The amendment is in absolute harmony with the principles and objects of the Bill, and I shall give it my hearty support. the Attorney-General will not relax in the least his opposition to the amendment. We ought to keep the Bill as it is now. I am surprised to hear the honourable member for Coolgardie trying to persuade the Committee that the Federal Parliament is not endeavouring to raise revenue by means of this tax, although the State Governments do apply land taxes for purely revenue purposes. raise revenue. I distinctly stated that what commended this tax largely to me, amongst other very beneficial effects, was that it would raise a considerable amount of income for purposes of defence, and other necessary works. I therefore say it is to a great extent a revenue BiU. The amendment is dressed up in such a wav that at first sight it bears the stamp of equity, but it is not so when you come to analyze it. What will be its effect? How is it to be carried out? The blocks of land that were paid for to the State originally have, in many cases, been split up in a great many ways. Some of them have been absorbed into larger estates. The question as to any particular area of land is, what did the Crown actually receive for it ? out. Take a block that was sold in Melbourne for £ 4 6 , and that has since been subdivided in such a way that the original frontage is not in the hands of the present owner. There would be trouble between the Commissioner and the present owner as soon as an attempt was made to fix what the Crown originally got for his holding. Endless difficulties would arise, and such an army of officials and such a large amount of inquiry would be required that purpose. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Al l the titles go back to the Crown grant. an acre for the land. That is hardly a prepared to give a man an exemption at the rate of £ 1 an acre, even if the amendment were carried. The Crown in many cases parted with the land nominally at £ 1 an acre, but those who bought it had twenty years' time in which to pay the purchase money. That is practically tiie same as selling the land at 12s. dd. an acre spot cash. It would therefore not be fair to allow an exemption at the rate of £ 1 an acre for land purchased under the category of first-class land at a nominal price of £ 1 an acre, as was the case in Victoria. I agree with the Attorney General that the money that has been received for the lands of Australia has been re-expended by the States, and that a The principle of this tax is to great majority of the present enhanced values are partly due to that expenditure The money passed into the Treasury and passed out again for the construction of railways and other works to still further enhance the value of the land. The money was simply transferred to the Treasury, and the value went back to the land, and is still there. The Bill is perfectly fair, but if amendments of this character are inserted it will break down of its own weight. It will be impracticable to put it into active operation, and I believe that that is the object of the Opposition in introducing these specious amendments. was interested to hear the Attorney-General's statement of the principles of the Bill.

216,Mr Hughes,"An inn is a good place-speakin g of it as a site value-lie s in the fact that there are improvements on adjacent ground, and that there does attach to each block, although, I admit, not to the same degree as in the case of a town property, a value other than the value which is attached to the particular block under consideration. Andi f no value has been added to each farm by improvements or any other means, then there can be no difference in the methods of assessment. Therefore, when each particular block is taken by itself, there is less to deductthere is more unimproved value than there would be if we took a number of blocks added together. tion is whether we should insist upon a technical adherence to the theory of the unimproved value, or whether we should not accept the suggestion made by the honourable member for Flinders, and refrain from insisting upon it, when by non-insistence we should increase the. likelihood of subdivision. I agree with the reasoning of the Attorney-General so far as the principle of taxation is concerned, because if we tax each block separately would look after that part of the matter. municipal rates, but with the effect upon the tax proposed to be imposed. I do not think there can be any doubt that when a particular area is reduced to one hundred holdings, by taxing each block separately a bigger unimproved value is obtained from the general congestion of population and improvements than would be secured if we simply taxed the one owner who had subdivided. If we are to adhere to the strict reading of the Bill, then we may be right in adopting that principle, but from the point of view of expediency it is wrong, because by following it we shall really take away an inducement to subdivide, since the moment an owner began to subdivide his property he would have to pay more taxation. Considering there are few cases of the kind, I prefer that we should not adhere to the strict theory of unimproved value, but that we should allow in these cases the tax to fall on the lower value. I have before me a letter, referring to a case in South Australia, where, by such a subdivision as that indicated, 129 persons have been placed upon land on which previously only two or three resided. They are all lessees, and they are thriving. It is mere pedantry, for the sake of a few more pounds in taxation, to insist on the owner, in a case where there is no true unearned increment, paying the full rate. My impression is that the reason this amendment is introduced is because it has been decided in New South Wales that it is the true principle of taxation under the New South Wales Act. There was a case in the Cooper Estate that went before the Court. Subdivision had taken place, and it was doubtful whether the owner should be taxed allowing him for all the improvements, including roads and houses, or taxed for each block separately. There was a division of opinion upon the point, and the New South Wales Court decided that each block should be taxed separately. We are not obliged to follow that course, and I think, as a matter of expediency, we ought not. [3.46] I do not follow the reasoning of the Attorney-General when he says that the character of the improvements upon a block gives an added site value to the adjoining block. If that be so, how comes it that the site on which the White Hart Hotel stands, in Spring-street, is worth only, say, one-half, of the site value of a block in Swanston-street? It is not the character of the building at all. There may be a worse building and less improvements on the site in Swanston-street. perfectly correct. The character of the building is only one of the elements. of the very slightest value. If there were the cheapest possible form of improvement on land where business concentrates, it would not stop the site value from incrementing. one of the elements, together with all those which the community created. to country lands.

254,I T Ought To Mr Richard Foster,"It is anthat, with such a big impost, there is going to be subdivision. But the Attorney General by his proposal is placing a bar in the way of that object. The honourable gentleman proposes the one method of immediate sale, but there is the other method, which will be largely availed of, namely, the leasing of the land with the absolute right of purchase in a given time. I ask the Government to protect themsels'es in every respect, and not to fix the period at more than six years, having satisfied themselves that there is a bond fide registered agreement to lease at a reasonable rental, with the right of purchase, not at a fictitious value, but at a value which will satisfy the ""Commissioner. The Government, if they believe in encouraging subdivision, ought to impose the most favorable conditions; and the suggestion made on this side will assist the very poorest of industrious men who desire to go on the land. To require a deposit of 15 per cent, would deprive such men of the money necessary to buy plant and stock; and we desire to assist those who, with little or no cash, may have strong muscle, and, possibly, a useful family of boys. In nine cases out of ten, suitable men would be able to exercise their right of purchase at the end of six years. To encourage the holders of big estates to subdivide, we should bring estates such as I have referred to under the most favorable conditions. I understand that it is intended to bring the be deemed to be a separate parcel."" Bill into line with the decision in the case of the New South Wales Commissioner of Taxes v. Cooper, of which I do not understand the justice. It was there held that a proprietor who had cut up his land, separating it into parcels divided by roads, was taxable on the added value resulting from the subdivision. The value of the land had increased, not in virtue of public betterment or unearned increment; but merely by the action of the owner in dedicating part of his land to the public for loads. The contention of the honourable member for Flinders is that we should make such exceptions as will promote subdivision in accordance with the policy of the measure. If a man divides his land into parcels by making roads through it, we should not tax him on the increased value which thereby results. {4.20] -It seems to me that the proposal before us takes away the incentive to subber has practically only repeated what has divide. In the case just referred to by the been said over and over again since a honourable member for Bendigo, the result of the subdivision was to increase the value of the property from ;£8o,ooo to £240,000. It might happen that a man possessing a block worth £50,000 might subdivide it by making roads through it, and thus eventually increase its value to £^150,000. If the land were subdivided into thirty blocks, all of which were sold, the original owner would have no tax to pay; but he might be able to sell only ten blocks before the increment increased, in which case he would have twenty blocks on his hands, and his taxation would be increased from £440 to £^1)593misapprehends the purport of the amendment. orable member propose to tax separate parcels only when they are occupied by'persons other than the owner? parcel that is separately held. subdivision, found himself the holder of twenty blocks? be regarded as one parcel.

The honourable member knows that subdivisions sometimes take years to get off. The case that I put was one in which the increment, as the result of subdivision, was threefold. What man is going to subdivide his land when he may find himself taxed on the increment which has been added to land of which he is unable to dispose? I pointed to a case in which an estate valued at £^50,000 had, by subdivision, incremented to ,£150,000. The owner might be able to dispose of only one-third of the land before the increment increased, so that taxation payable by him would be three times as much' as he had to pay on the original holding. That is the case I put, and I contend that under this proposal the honourable gentleman is going to defeat the very object of his Bill, which is to induce subdivision. ney-General) [4.44] A most amazing statement has just been made. It is alleged that the way to prevent and discourage subdivision is that by which a man who cuts up £50,000 worth of land is able to get for one-third of it as much as the whole is woith. not. has just cited such a case. He spoke of the case of an estate valued at ,£50,000 being subdivided, with the result that its value is increased threefold, and the owner receives for one-third of it as much as the whole was worth prior to subdivision. The honourable member says that that is the sort of thing that discourages subdivision. I wish I could secure such a chance. I know of nothing more calculated to encourage a man to subdivide his estate than the prospect of his getting as much for one-third of it as the whole is worth. What is more to the point is that the honourable member says that the remaining two-thirds would be worth as much per foot as the one-third which had been sold, so that the owner would get £ 3 for every £ 1 , and all that he would be asked to pay by way of penalty, at the outside would be the added amount of taxation on the two-thirds which he could not sell. He would already have in his breeches' pocket as much money as the whole of his estate was worth before subdivision, and two-thirds of the estate would still be in his possession to sell at the same profit. It is this diabolical amendment of the Government that proposes to enable the landlords of this country to recoup themselves in this princely and extravagant fashion at the community's expense which is denounced as a foe to subdivision.

I put the case in which the estate has incremented threefold in value, and which the subdivider has not been able to sell. Meantime, his tax has gone up three times. What is he to do about that ?

I move That all the words after the word ""owned,"" line 1, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" on the first day of January, 1911."" I have a great objection, and I think honourable members generally will agree with me, to retrospective legislation, nor do I see any necessity for it in a Bill of the far-reaching character of this one. The object, no doubt, is to get more revenue for the current year, but I do not think the clause is justifiable. It is most unusual. fence this year, and for the ships the honourable member's Government ordered. end justifies the means with the honourable member. Surely the fact that some necessity has arisen does not justify the Government in doing an unusual and unjustifiable thing. I have understood from the Attorney-General, and almost every honourable member on the Ministerial side, that the object of the Bill is primarily to burst up estates. that the objects are taxation and the burstsessment for the full year? ing up of estates. I have heard very little about taxation from honourable members opposite until now. The main objective has been closer settlement. If closer settlement is desired, we should give every inducement to people to subdivide their estates as quickly as possible, and if the Bill did not come into force for a reasonable time, it would give those who have large estates an opportunity to subdivide and promote closer settlement. The only objection, therefore, to the amendment is from the revenue point of view. I do not speak with absolute knowledge, but I think it is very unusual for taxation Bills to be retrospective. All sorts of interests are involved when you go back from the time at which you are legislating. We certainly should not go back to the ist of July, seeing that the Bill was not introduced until long after that date, and, I suppose, will not be passed until some time in October. If we make the present holders pay tlie' tax for the current year, there will be no> inducement, to them to subdivide their lands until towards the time when the tax becomes due again next year. If it were known that the tax would not be imposed, would be a great incentive to people to subdivide. The purchaser, of course, would know that he would have to pay the tax if the unimproved value was over £5.000. There is no doubt that the main reason for the introduction of the measure is to burst up large estates and give facilities for the closer occupation of land. I understand from honourable members opposite that if they could by one stroke take away all the revenue out of this Bill, and have closer settlement, they would feel that they had achieved their object. I heard one honourable member say that if they had not settled the land difficulty and brought about closer settlement within three years their work would have been a failure. Of course, this Bill is ostensibly a Tax Bill. There is nothing about closer settlement in it, for the very good reason that it is an attempt to invade an arena that does not belong to us. It is not possible to put in the Bill a statement that it is intended; to deal with land settlement or land occupation. Eveni f it were only a revenue Bill, there would be no justification for making it retrospective. The result of my amendment, if carried, would be that only half the year's tax would be collected.",47,Pairs

Taxpayers, however, did not get the advantage of half-a-year, owing to the fact that, though the next time the tax became due was in the succeeding January, it was paid for the financial year ending in June.

Under this proviso any person who, 'before the 30th day of September, subdivides his land will be entitled to be separately assessed for each parcel sold, as if it were the only land owned by him. The owner of land of the unimproved value of £150,000 will have to pay a tax at the rate of about 5d. in the £ 1 , but if , before the 30th September, such a man were to sell to ten purchasers £100,000 worth of that land, he would be entitled to be separately assessed in regard to eleven separate parcels, obtaining an exemption of £5,000 on each, which would, of course, mean a very great reduction in the rate and amount of his tax. The concession which we offer is a substantial one. Sir JOHN"" FORREST (Swan) [5.20]. -Seeing that the object of the measure is to burst up large estates, and to bring about closer settlement; the Government, with a view to inducing subdivision, should not curtail the period within which advantage may be taken of the concession provided for in the amendment just moved by the Attorney-General. It must be remembered that the Bill was not introduced until after McWilliams, W. J. the beginning of the financial year, and Palmer, A.

The Attorney-General is to be congratulated upon the proposition now before the Committee, but the time within which thf concession offered may be taken advantage of should be extended as suggested by the honourable member for Swan. . If the concession expires on the 30th Septemberthat is, two days hence-land-owner s will not know of it, and will not, in any case,, be able to take advantage of it. There may be a slight loss of revenue if the time is extended, but, as the desire of the Government is to encourage subdivision, it should not spoil the effect of the proposal now under discussion by making it impossible for land-owners to take advantage of it. I hope that the extension of time proposed will be agreed to. doubt the concession offered will be a substantial one, if the time within which it may be accepted is extended, but otherwise it will be useless. I hope that the Attorney-General will agree to some extension, even if he cannot accept the amendment of the honourable member for Swan..

I suggest that the proposed proviso should readProvided that the owner or owners .of land who sell or bond fide subdivide their landbefore the 30th September, and so forth. By such an amendment, the people to whom I have referred would be treated as if they had sold the land. be a partition of the land. like the word "" partition,"" as well as the word "" sale,"" to be used. that the Government adopt the principle suggested by the honourable member for Balaclava, it can be embodied in the Bill by the addition of the words at the end of the clause, "" For the purposes of this section 'sale' includes 'partition.'"" I agree with the merits of the proposition, but wish now to point out how the drafting of this provision will work. The Attorney-General said that a man might sell portion of his land, and it seems to me that, so far as subdivisions and sales are concerned, this is a very fair provision, because, in respect of the portions sold, the tax will be imposed on the lower rate. As regards the part not sold, however, the effect of the drafting is, I believe, that the owner will pay on the rate determined by the whole area. He will not pay the sum total of the tax over the whole area, but a rate to be determined by that on the whole area. ney-General) [5.34] -Claus e 39 deals with double taxation, and would, I think, prevent a man from being charged twice. able member supposes, then, both in respect of the land so sold and the land remaining unsold, the effect of this clause will apply. land? ber for Balaclava spoke of a partition of land under a deed of partnership, and I promise him that when the Bill is recommitted I will include bond fide partitions. -The Attorney-General has not said whether he is prepared to agree to my amendment of the amendment providing , for the substitution of the words "" thirtyfirst day of December"" for the "" thirtieth day of September."" What objection can there be to such an alteration? ney-General) [5.36] -The reason is that it would mean a distinct and very valuable concession, and one that, in its practical operation, would have obvious limitations. The Commissioner will have to be satisfied that a sale is bond fide, and I am afraid that if this period were extended so as to take in the whole of the year, so many applications would be made under this provision that, although I look at the matter from an entirely philosophical stand-point, the Treasurer could not afford to do so. It would be impossible to determine the bona fides of every sale if the whole nation, so to speak, applied for a remission of taxation under this proviso. I take it that we have allowed for a fair and reasonable period. In another part of the Bill we deal specially with leases, mortgages, and marriage settlements, ancl I think that, in the circumstances, we cannot go any further. haps the best course to pursue would be to determine that this clause shall cease to operate on the day on which this Bill becomes law. The Bill may become law at any time within the next month or two, and the course I have suggested seems an easier way of dealing with the matter than would be the fixing of any special date. I can see some reason for fixing upon the 30th June as the date of ownership, so tliat the tax may be collected .in respect of this year; but in the amendment now before us the Minister is making a concession in order to prevent hardships occurring to persons who bond fide wish to divide their land and so-carry out what I conceive to be the first principle of the Act. People should be given every opportunity to bond fide divide their land up to the date on which the Bill becomes law. The moment the Governor General's assent is given to this measure it will become law, and then the general provisions of the Act may very well apply to all classes of property. view of the statement made by the Attorney General that he will amend the clause when the Bill is recommitted, I suggest to him",51,Pairs

There is no doubt that this proviso is a great concession from the Government point of view, and makes the Bill very much more acceptable than it was before. But it throws a lot of responsibility on the shoulders of the Commissioner. I move That the amendment be amended by leaving out the words "" and not for the^ purpose of evading the payment of land tax. Those words are not necessary, because the words ""bond fide sale"" are already used, and they may put into the mind of the Commissioner thoughts that it was never the intention of this House that he should entertain. I cannot see how any one can bond fide dispose of his property a view to evade the payment of land tax. ney-General) [S-S4]--The words the honourable member proposes to strike out are very necessary. Yesterday, we discussed for hours the insertion of words to make the purpose of a clause quite clear. These words make the purpose of tins clause quite clear, but apparently the honourable member does not desire that. The sale has to be bond fide, but for what purpose? It must not be for the purpose of evading the Act There can be no possible objection to retaining the words. The honourable member ought to give a concrete illustration showing how their retention would be harmful If he could do that, I should be glad to strike them out, but he must provide us with a case. The sale must be bona fide, and not to evade the purpose of the Bill, which is to tax a big holding at a higher rate than a small holding.

The words seem to be surplusage, and as we are trusting absolutely to the. discretion of a Commissioner, whose ipse dixit is to be final, it might be safer to leave them out. If the sale is bond fide, that is all we can reasonably ask. think it matters much whether we keep the words in or leave them out. The Privy Council decided, in Sims' casea South with Australian case-that where a man makes a bond fide arrangement with his family for the purpose of escaping the liability for the tax, it is not an evasion of tbe tax, but a perfectly legitimate operation. In South Australia, two Judges held otherwise, and the case went to the Privy Council, which sustained the judgment of the Chief Justice of South Australia, as I think is invariably the case. As this proviso only applies until 30th September, I do not think it matters whether we keep the words in or not. I can quite appreciate the anxiety of the honourable member for Moreton that no injustice should be done, but I do not think we can conceive of any case in Australia of an estate having been sold now with a view to repurchase after the 30th September. In any case, the proviso applies only to this year. If it were an annual thing, the words would be clearly necessary, because there might be a sale at the end of the year with a view to repurchase after the 30th June, thus enabling the owners to",53,Hughes Amendment Put The Com

The words clearly cover the Harbor Trust of New South Wales, the -Metropolitan Board of Works of Melbourne, the Water and Sewerage Board in Sydney, and all municipal bodies. If we were to insert the word "" Trust,"" does the honourable member for Angas think that the provision would be made any clearer, as applying to the Tramway Trust in Adelaide? I am perfectly willing to insert the I word; but I think the Trust is covered by the clause. but if I were drafting the Bill, I should look very carefully at the constitution of the Trust. effect of the interpretation of section 114 of the Constitution in the Railway case, is that we have no power to tax such bodies. cannot tax municipal instrumentalities, but the question is whether this Trust is a municipal instrumentality. Constitution provides that the Commonwealth shall not impose a tax on property of any kind belonging to a State, and that provision includes municipalities. A State cannot delegate to a subordinate body any powers it does not possess itself-it cannot delegate any authority excepting by virtue of the authority possessed by itself. Anything that a municipality does directly, or indirectly, and anything that a State does, directly or indirectly, must be done by virtue of its public authority; and, therefore, I take it that if we did not insert any words in the Bill, we could not tax a municipality as a corporate entity, or any of its subordinate bodies, such as Boards or Trusts. I am glad to have the assurance of the Attorney-Generalbut I . really think there is some doubt whether this clause will exempt, for instance, the Melbourne, Bendigo, and Ballarat tramways. under certain rights given fo the municipalities, to which they eventually revert-. value in respect of a road. I do not think that we need trouble about the position of tramway companies, but I should like to point out that, in our dry districts, a number of water trusts, created by Act of Parliament, own water channels and adjoining land. There is such a trust at Ballarat. I am not sure that such a trust could be called either a municipal, local, or pubhc authority, so I ask the Attorney-General to consider their position, and, if he does not think that they are covered by the paragraph, to recommit the clause.",55,Pairs

If an honourable member wishes to know whether any particular body is or is not covered, he has only to ask himself whether it is a public authority. Is there, outside the Broken Hill Company, any private authority supplying water in Australia? Whether the authorities controlling a water supply are termed a board or a trust, they are exempt from taxation.

They are established to encourage thrift, and to assist the working classes in obtaining homes of their own. They do not declare dividends, but under the amendment as it stands their property would be liable to taxation at a high"" rate. When they make advances, they are registered as the absolute proprietors of the securities. A man who borrows from one of these societies to purchase a freehold allows it to register the property in its name, his only title being a deed of defeasance. These societies will, I think, unless specially protected, be liable to taxation on the aggregation of the properties which they hold in trust for various borrowers ; but that is scarcely the desire of the Government. The tax would fall on the thrifty, and could have no effect in bursting up large estates. much land, except as mortgagees. registered, not as mortgagees, but as proprietors, of the properties on which money has been borrowed from them.

The honourable member has omitted from the amendment of which he originally gave notice the words. "" and from the operations of which no individual or company derives profit."" With those words, its application was clear; but, as it stands, I do not think that it is. In clause 37, we provide that members of a mutual life assurance society shall be separately assessed, and the mutual principle, I understand, in its application to a life assurance company means that the profits are divided amongst the individual members of it. Starr-Bowkett societies, which my honourable friend has in mind, are admirable institutions; but they are subject to some practical disabilities. As some honourable members seem to be busily engaged in explaining something to each other, it appears to be useless to explain to the Committee the position that the Government take up. in doubt as to what is the real intention of the honourable member for Herbert in proposing this amendment. at the first view, to be a rather dangerous proposition. tax these societies? is. orable member's remark implied. ber is at liberty to place his own interpretation upon my remarks; but he must net commit me to it.

We have no explanation from this side as to the meaning of the amendment. planation from that side of the Committee. the honourable member does not care to listen to our dulcet tones. If we are to exempt building societies carried on under cooperative principles, why should we not exempt all co-operative societies? I am personally interested in a co-operative society, but do not desire, at all events at present, that such societies shall be exempt. If the enterprise and industry displayed by a man in becoming a member of a building society are to be recognised by exemption from this tax, then it seems to me to be a very small addition to the principle to exempt all co-operative societies. I fail to see why only co-operative societies relating to the building trade should be exempt when the same principle is followed in connection with all co-operative concerns. At present the amendment appears to me altogether too wide, and possibly the honourable member for Herbert does not care to explain its far-reaching effects. Since we are completely in the dark as to what is intended, we may reasonably term the amendment dangerous until some further explanation is made. I hope that the honourable member for Herbert will press his amendment. We are told that the New Zealand Act is an excellent model, and that we should follow it.

Building societies which are carrying on operations in Australia are subject, in some cases, either to the gagees in possession of a large number of dividend duty tax or income tax. The exemption proposed by the honourable member for Herbert and the honourable member for Bendigo embodies exactly what is done in New Zealand. It is a fair and reasonable exemption to make on its merits, because building societies are co-operative companies. special Building Society Acts are, as a rule, co-operative companies formed for the purpose of enabling people to combine amongst themselves to build their own homes. are speculative organizations of a proprietary kind. the Queensland cases, where hundreds of little homes have been built through the agency of building societies. A company is formed, deposits are made by different persons, who pay small sums at regular intervals, and the combined funds are used for the purpose of advancing money to. different people to build their own homes. Bowkett? the Starr-Bowkett, but with mutual building societies. on the money that they lend in that way. they technically own may be held to be their property, and subject to taxation. This is a class of investment and organization that we do not want to tax. The honourable member for Herbert knows that on the Darling Downs large numbers of people have been able to get their homes through the agency of these purely cooperative building societies, who, without them, would not have been able to get their own homes at all. The real object of the Bill, as the honourable member for Coolgardie put it, is to tax land so as to enable people to become owners of their own homes. If the Government include, as the subjects of taxation, the very institutions which enable people to get their own homes, they will cut right across the very principle of their own legislation. matter is important, because in a case decided in New South Wales-The Commissioners of Taxation v. St. Joseph's Investment and Building Society-it was held that the respondent society were the mortparcels of land which had been mortgaged to them by different mortgagors, and that the society, being mortgagee in possession, and not a bare trustee of different estates, was entitled to only one deduction on the aggregate value of all the parcels of land. The building societies should be entirely exempt from the provisions 6f this Bill. No advantage is to be gained, and no big estates will be burst up, by taxing them. On the contrary, the Commonwealth will be taking revenue from the very contributions paid to the societies which enable people to get their own homes. They are the small investors, who should be helped, and not discouraged. I can understand the Attorney-General saying that he does not know how far the proposed amendment will go, but if the words were put in it would be easy to recommit the Bill, and technically define them. None of us want to put in words that will leave the measure too open. We want to keep companies that are not bond fide out of it. I hope the Attorney General will see his way to grant the exemption asked for. ney-General) [8.20] -The object of the Government is to make the exemptions cover every case that ought properly to be exempted. There are building societies and similar institutions that ought not to come under the operation of the Bill, but the question is to what extent the amendment properties which will open the door to others. The honourable member for Melbourne has given notice of an amendment to tax building societies generally to the extent of only half the amount. On the face of it, that is a proposition to which we could not readily assent. On the whole, I think it is far better to exempt them altogether, or to tax them. With regard to societies that are mutual in their nature, like a mutual life association, we have provided, without exempting them in set terms, that each person shall be assessed separately, the practical effect, of course, being that they are exempt. Whether it would be advisable to include all other mutual societies carrying on business on a mutual basis in the same or a similar class, is a matter which I should like to have an opportunity of considering.

It is, in fact, the very contrary. same time, there are some of these StarrBowkett societies promoted for various purfree from any but mutual profits, and of poses, such as providing a manager with a billet, or giving work to conveyancers, and so on; but, generally speaking, I think it is entirely desirable to exempt building societies. I shall be glad if the honourable to the originators in the form of a commismember will withdraw the amendment, and allow us to deal with .the matter generally on the recommittal of the Bill. -The Committee would be saved a great deal of time if we could, at this early stage, make a distinction. The Attorney General now says that the Government are prepared to wholly admit the desirability of encouraging thrift through genuine mutual co-operative organizations. difficulty, as he has pointed out, is that many of these organizations or associations are started with a mutual principle, but also with another principle present, by whicli profits are derived from them by individuals. panies which have the word ""mutual "" in their title, but from which certain men are receiving large profits. "" mutual"" may be used as an attraction to the public to operate through these organizations, although I do not say it is so. I have every sympathy with the thrift side of these organizations, and with every assoand have been a shareholder myself, but ciation that is formed to enable people of small means to help one another by cooperative methods, in the form of friendly societies, insurance companies, or building societies, towards a little saving of their means or earnings; but I should be against including any organizations in the exemption which have underneath them a profit being drawn by promoters or proprietors. The amendment which the honourable member for Herbert proposed contained, in its first form, but not in its ultimate form, words which saved the situation in that regard, because it provided that no profits should be derived by individuals promoting the organization. The Committee seems to lie of one mind on the whole question, and it simply remains for the Attorney-General to shape a provision, either by additions to clause 37, or by another clause, by which all mutual associations shall be absolved from the tax, provided there are no profits The matter being derived. some profits. At the sarily. I can tell the honourable member of many companies which are quite one, at least, very large insurance company in Australia which is supposed to be conducted on mutual principles, but from which very large dividends are being paid sion on the management. If the honourable member looks into some of the great American organizations for insurance purposes, he will find that there are what are called founders' shares, by which immense profits have been derived by these so-called mutual societies for individuals, who have grown extremely rich by using the innocent and alluring word "" mutual "" for the purpose of drawing the public in. The Attorney-General could save a lot of time and The discussion if he undertook to frame a clause which would recognise the merits of the purely mutual form of association, and exclude the other kind which I have mentioned. have no objection to adopting the suggestion of the Attorney-General. In movThe word ing the amendment I had my mind specially directed to Starr-Bowkett societies, and no others. I did not include the societies referred to by the honourable member for Darling Downs. I know of them, they are of such a character that individuals do derive a profit. In Starr-Bowkett societies there is no profit for any individual, nor for .the society as a society. There are no actual profits other than what may be derived from fines or sales of books of rules, and so on. This goes for managerial expenses, and the secretary is the only one who has anything out of it. That cannot be said to be a profit. large areas of land? gagees. I do not say that they come under the operation of the measure at all.

I shall not debate the last-mentioned matter now, but merely refer the Attorney-General to a recent .book on rating, in which the word "" solely "" is said to, in nine cases out of ten, destroy the object of Parliament. The amendment which I now propose will bring within the exemptions institutions which are charitable, but which are not public in the sense of being controlled or supported by the State. I have in my mind various benevolent institutions, some under religious bodies, for the purpose of helping the weak and unfortunate, and finding new ways of life for them. If the word "" public"" be retained, these societies will be excluded from the exemptions; and I am sure every honourable member wishes that those legitimate efforts of benevolent people, and the public through their subscriptions, shall receive the same recognition Paragraph e of the clause exempts the sites as institutions that have to rely on the State for what should come from benevolence. the word "" public "" throughout the clause? everything that will lead to the development of charity, promote mutual assistance, and ultimately realize, perhaps, that truly Christian state in which man recognises, through the benevolence of his neighbour, that he is one with him. I do not wish to labour the point, because I think the amendment should pass without argument.

The only difference is that the proposed new sub-clause has relation, not so much to the lands, although it does relate to them, as to the proceeds. So far as the land itself is concerned on which charitable or educational institutions are erected, it is exempt. which an institution stands; therefore, the discussion ought to turn on the question of proceeds, as distinguished from land. An institution may own land other than the land on which the institution itself is erected. It may use the proceeds of these lands for other than pecuniary profits, and they will be exempted from taxation if the institution falls under the heading of a public educational or a public charitable institution. deal with the proceeds of land. ation any land, and propose to exempt land the rents and profits from which are devoted to particular purposes. The sites on which charitable and educational institutions stand are exempted by paragraph e. of all charitable institutions, whether public or not. The question raised by the amendment is whether the lands held by an educational or charitable institution apart from the site on which its buildings are erected shall be exempted from taxation. I think that we may well pause before determining to exempt such lands held by charitable institutions. In some cases, they are lands with which the institutions have been endowed, but in other cases they have been purchased with funds which have been collected, ancl it is doubtful whether the purposes of charity would not have been better served by expending the money directly in charitable relief than by investing it, to dole out the annual revenue. not be forgotten that we have heard of charitable institutions the major portion of whose revenues go to meet the expenses of management, only small sums being available for charitable relief. It is questionable whether the lands held by such societies, apart from the sites on which their buildings are erected, should be exempted from taxation. The honourable member for Angas desires to strike out the word "" public "" everywhere in relation to educational institutions, and I hope that that will be done. The words "" and not for pecuniary profit"" are a sufficient safeguard. There are large numbers of educational institutions endowed with lands the proceeds of which are devoted solely to educational purposes, and we, on this side, should be the last to prevent education being as free,",61,Pairs

If an institution can further its own objects, which must be charitable, by the receipt of fees, so long as those fees are only applied to the maintenance or the development of the institution it still retains its essential character as a charitable instithe taxing powers exercised under this Bill. tution. In South Australia, the words of the Act are "" solely for charitable or religious purposes."" The word "" public "" is not used. There was a test case there about five or six years ago as to the meaning of those words in the Waterworks Act. I appeared for one of the institutions-I think the Sisters of St. Joseph-and some other refuges. There is no doubt about their being strictly charities. They are supported by sisters, whose motives in life every one will respect. They do not get a penny piece for themselves, and in some cases have really to deny themselves a good deal in order to keep the institution going. The Crown, after hearing the merits of the case, declared that, whether the Act did or did not cover the case, they would not insist upon the tax if certain conditions in regard to inspection were complied with. Consequently, the defence was never gone into, the requisition for the tax or rates was abated, and the case is left undecided so far as the Supreme Court is concerned. I have not much doubt that the decision .would have been that the institution was a charity within the apparent intention of the Legislature, and ought not to be taxed, as none of the funds were applied to other than charitable purposes. I have in my mind in this matter all institutions which serve every end that benevolence recognises, and which ought not to come under our taxing power. I do not think that, if the Attorney-General looks up the English case I mentioned, or the Victorian case decided some years ago, or the New South Wales cases referred to, he will get much more light than common sense will throw upon the interpretation of these words. In the South Australian Act, there is no limitation to the effect that the institution is not to exist for pecuniary profit. We are putting in additional words of limitation in that regard, which will prevent the possibility of institutions carried on purely for private ends being exempt. I propose to move to add, after the words "" pecuniary profit,"" the words "" applied to other than such charitable or educational purpose."" Then, even if the institution is self-supporting in the sense of doing some work and getting paid for it, and the proceeds being applied to the maintenance of the Mr Glynn. institution, but there being no division of profits amongst the members of the institution, it will still be exempt.

558,Mr Glynn,"There were from 47,000assessment that is now being made in South Australia; and that will; perhaps, be published within the next few weeks. By that means, a good deal of trouble could besaved. I should like to suggest a medium course. I recognise that the measure will require an enormous number of returns for the whole Commonwealth. If South Australia, some years ago, with a comparatively small population, required from 40,000 to 50,000 returns, we may safely conclude that the number will be 600,000. or 700,000 for the whole Commonwealth. To require these returns to be sent in every year by Statute is rather arbitrary. Very little change may take place over a period of three years in the general value of lands. The Attorney General might accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Angas, while still giving the Commissioner power to have a fresh assessment made at any time within the three years if he thought it desirable. If the Commissioner sees that there is but little fluctuation in the land market, he might allow the assessment to run for another year. so under this clause. I should like the Attorney-General to consider whether it would not be better to make the term three years in the first place, leaving the Commissioner power to makf it less, if necessary. . [10.17] I shall support the amendment of the honourable member for Angas. In South Australia, the three years' periodical assessment was continued for a considerable time; and the change from three to five years was brought about to save money during times of very severe stress. While the change from three to five years might not have been for the better, it would be a distinct advantage to substitute a three-year for an annual period in tliis Bill. The Minister of External Affairs knows that, when the periodical assessment is made in South Australia, the taxation offices are crowded with extra hands. An annual assessment under this Bill would entail an extra amount of work, and an attendant cost that would not be justified. A big army would be required in the Taxation Department, and a three years' periodical valuation is all that is necessary to catch the fluctuations in the value of land. I am strongly against requiring die individual land-owner to send in his own return. The system is copied from the original New Zealand Act; but I believe it is .being set aside there because it has proved entirely unsatisfactory. Three or"" four years ago, I was told by one of the Ministers who was in charge of that Department in New Zealand that the system was found in practice to be bad. They had more people making an over, than an under, estimate; and the system was so unsatisf actory that they abandoned the principle of every man making his own assessment for a better one under which the Department made it. South Australia are submitted every year. tainly not. I am a land taxpayer in South Australia, and I do not submit a return every year. I submit one every five years. It is here provided, however, that every year the individual owner shall make his own assessment. It would be infinitely better if the New South Wales and South Australian systems were adopted by the Commonwealth instead of the system of requiring each individual owner to make his own assessment. ney-General) [10.21.] -The Government cannot accept the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Angas. The valuations are to be made by the Commissioner, not every year, but when he pleases. Under the New South Wales Act return's are called for every year. They may include any particulars. They may include, and usually do include-the y have always included within my recollection-the value of land. There is nothing unusual in this. It is the practice followed in New Zealand and in New South Wales. The object is to burst up estates and settle people on the land. It is desired, therefore, to exempt persons who in a previous year were liable to the tax, but who, having subdivided, are no longer liable. We desire to see how the country progresses under a tax of this sort-whether , in point of fact, values are going up or down. It is an excellent thing to take an annual valuation. The amount of trouble to the taxpayer is quite negligible. He will have to furnish an annual return, and the question whether he shall furnish an annual valuation is merely one of putting down a few morefigureson his already voluminous return.",69,Glynn Proposed

565,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"AttorI wish to direct the Attorney-General's attention to the need, in some part of the Bill, for a provision dealing with a class of case in which, after the assessment is made, a sale is made of part of the property. If an assessment is made for this year, and a month or two after a sale is made of a part of the property to another owner, I think there is not any provision in the Bill which will entitle the taxpayer to recover the proportion of the year's tax -to shift it on to the buyer. vision of the Bill that would enable that to' be done. We might very properly consider the point. torney-General make a note of the point ? One of the weaknesses of any scheme of land taxation in a country like this must be the cost, not merely to the Government, but to the individual taxpayer. perience has shown that it is very heavy. In his remarks to the Committee the Attorney-General appears to be utterly indifferent to this aspect-of the matter, and this is the: more regrettable because excessive cost of collection will be a strong argument against the continuance of land taxation. The honourable gentleman said just now that it was a mere trifle' for a man who was making up his annual return to include also the particulars required in clause. 14. that clause include a full and complete statement of the land owned by theindividual on the 30th June last. Now, there are very few alterations in the ownership of land throughout a year in proportion to the total number of assessments that must be made. I have it on the very best authority-that of a gentleman who has had practical experience in a land tax office in another State-that the cost of these annual assessments will be enormous. He saysTo fumish a return of land in each nnancial year would involve taxpayers in tremendous expense. The preparation of a big land tax return is a formidable affair. Once furnished, it should, after verification, be the basis; and subsidiary returns might be provided for in respect of sales and acquisitions. Then he adds' The necessity fbr these returns could he avoided by providing that the first return should, ence by dispensing with these annua) rewhen dealt with, be regarded as the basis, and thenceforward as land was acquired or sold, particulars thereof should be promptly fur038J3 nished to the Commissioner, who would add or take from the original return. Take the case of a large bank 01 society or land mortgage company whose own first return would cover many sheets of demy-sized paper; they would have a substantial grievance if compelled to furnish practically the same particulars each year. While it may be comparatively easy to deal with the returns made by new taxpayers, if the Commissioner is obliged to verify each separate return and to compare it with the previous returns of the same taxpayer, he will require a very large staff of officials. As the Attorney-General finds it necessary to indulge in second thoughts in respect of some of theamendments which have been submitted, he may very fairly devote his attention to the proposal of the honourable member for Angas. It seems to be a more workable and less costly arrangement than that proposed in the Bill. to point out that in South Australia a tax at one rate is levied upon land up to Ex.£5,000 value, and a tax at another rate upon land in excess of that value. The same practice is adopted in checking the subdivision of lands. That is accomplished by the Taxation Department being kept informed by the Registrar of Titles of every land transaction which takes place. The fact that an assessment is m'ade every five years does not make the slightest difference to the owners of land. Consequently there is nothing in the objection of the Attorney-General regarding the The particulars required in necessity of effecting an alteration according to the way in which properties have been subdivided. VVe can provide in this Bill for the necessary information being supplied through the State Registrars of Titles Offices. But I object to the whole scheme of the Bill in regard to the assessment of land. I was told in Adelaide last week, by the solicitor of an estate which has a rent roll of about j£is;ooo or ^14,000 a year, that to fumish the Department with the returns contemplated under this measure will cost that estate about j£i,ooo annually. This may be an exaggeration. There is not to be one general valuation made by the Commissioner; therefore, there will be no uniformity in regard to the comparative valuations. These are matters to which I deem it my. duty to call attention. I regret that the Government are not prepared to prevent inconveniturns. Amendment negatived.",70,Glynn Proposed
