Recommendations of Joint Select Committee Government Response 4. With respect to the problem of illegal interception, The Government will give further consideration to these the Committee recommends that: recommendations.

It is for this reason that the Australian Customs Service has long argued that the only effective means of stopping trade in restricted devices is by measures applied at the point of sale in Australia. The proposal to limit the restriction to single purpose devices would lead to enforcement difficulties and create an obvious avenue for circumventing these measures. To implement a cohesive control it would be necessary to encompass any multi-purpose, or even potential, interception device and parts thereof. The Committee's recommendations seem to acknowledge the impracticability of that approach. (c) Telecom actively pursue the maintenance of the Accepted. Telecom is committed to the prevention and integrity of the network and the detection of detection of illegal use of the telecommunications netillegal devices as a matter of urgency. work and will continue vigorously to pursue its activities aimed at these goals. As part of its programme the following two strategies are being implemented: (a) A publicity programme is being developed, and will be implemented shortly, aimed at reaching all staff in the customer network area. This will take two parts: (i) Articles in house journals outlining the obligations of its staff should they find evidence of an illegal interception, and the procedures to be followed. (ii) Personal instruction to staff in the customer network area, by supervisors, of the requirements. (b) a study is being commenced to examine the broad issues of public network security with a view to correcting any perceived weaknesses. 5.
