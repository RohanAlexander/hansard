The DEPUTY retired. move That the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Belt) do take the chair of the House aa Speaker. Mr Bell has been a member of this House and of various Commonwealth parliaments for a considerable number of years, during which period he has earned the admiration, respect and esteem of, not only his own constituents in Tasmania, but also all honourable members of this House who have come in contact with him. He is a man of irreproachable character, and is upright and fearless in every respect. He is truly a fit and proper person to occupy the high position of Speaker. During the last Parliament he was Chairman of Committees, in which position he distinguished himself, and showed that he had a f u l l knowledge of the practices and Standing Orders of the House. Another noteworthy feature of his service in the position of Chairman of Committees was his absolute impartiality. I believe that honourable members of all parties can testify as to that fact. In every way he upheld the dignity of the position, and he was efficient in all respects. I submit his name to the House with every confidence, feeling sure that he will at all times uphold the",9,Setup

Mr Bell has qualified for the position of Speaker by a long parliamentary experience, and by occupancy for a period of the ofiice of Chairman of Committees. He carried out the duties of that position efficiently, and with an impartiality which T feel should commend him to all sections of the House. the honourable members who have moved and seconded my nomination for the Speakership, and I respectfully submit myself to the House. understand that this is the one occasion in the parliamentary life of this country when a member may speak on any subject he desires. I do not know whether there will be further nominations for the position of Speaker, but I shall ask a scout or two of my party to find out. If no other n'ame is to be submitted, I shall make a nomination before I resume my seat. We have just come from the elections, and the vilification that was displayed during the contest ber who interjects was weeping for three weeks prior to the elections, and, if it had not been for his friends, the Communists, he would not be sitting in this House today. You will recall, Mr Parkes, that we sat here day after day last session, and heard the honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) say "" We must deport all Communists from this country "". Then the ex-Attorney-General( Mr Latham) brought down an amendment of the Crimes Act. I notice that the present honourable member for Kooyong( Mr heard that. I was reputed to be Mr Menzies) has taken Mr Latham's place; I shall refer later to the honourable gentleman. the amending act, the honourable member for Barton declared to the Tories of his electorate, and of every other part of Australia. "" Now we shall deport all Communists "". But it has since been ascertained that only 401 deportations have occurred during the life of the Nationalist and United Australia Party Governments, and that not one person has been deported for a political offence. We know the reason for this. The honourable memI have heard it in confidence, but I break that confidence to-day-and said, "" Do not deport the Communists from Barton; they are my friends, and they will vote for me"". When at the subsequent election Mr Lane was leading on the first preferences by a few votes, and the result depended on the distribution of the second preferences, he got the biggest majority of the Communists' 400 votes. Another candidate for Barton was Mr Albert Willis, whom Mr Lane used to vilify. You have heard of him, Mr Parkes. He went down to Bulli and "" ratted"" on the Labour party. He afterwards joined the "" T.B. "" party in New South Wales. Mr Lane said to him, "" You know, Mr Willis, that I am with you. Give me your No. 2 votes And that is how Albert Lane got in ! The honourable member suggested that I should not weep, but he was weeping and wailing all the time after the election started, until he got the assurances which he sought. Before introducing some of the new members. I shall deal with a few of my old friends. There is the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr). He represents an electorate which adjoins mine. I understand that he will be Sir Charles Marr in a short time. I saw his picture the other day. He appeared in a high hat, carried gloves in his left hand, and had a walking stick, and spats to match. He looked like a Berkshire pig. Nevertheless, I understand that he is going to resign his position in this parliament if he be made a Sir, and that Mr Stevens, the Premier of New South Wales, will take his seat. I was a bit jealous when I Lang's dummy, but the honourable member for Parkes is now apparently Mr When Mr Latham brought down Stevens' dummy. NextI come to the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett). He is one of the most capable men in the Ministry, and an ardent Tory and Nationalist. We all know where he stands.

The right honourable member haa a very hard row to hoe. It was hard enough for Moses when he led the wandering Jews, but he was on a velvet seat compared with Billy Hughes. The next gentleman, whom I desire to 'introduce to the House, is the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Casey). He possesses a good name, but he is a hard-hearted man. I have been to him on numerous occasions in connection with pension cases. Honourable members know how pensioners are being treated. A man with the name the Assistant Treasurer bears should have acted differently, and, if he has a good heart, he should be able to do something for these unfortunate people in the future. At any rate, he is again occupying a seat on the Treasury bench as an Assistant Minister, while Mr Harrison, who waa not previously in the Cabinet, is a fullyHedged Minister. How can that be accounted for? I have about 25 pensioners' cases which I propose to bring before the Assistant Treasurer at the earliest opportunity. Another gentleman on the treasury bench is the Assistant Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Francis) who in the last parliament was also administering war service homes. During his administration more returned soldiers have been evicted from their homes than have been evicted by any number of landlords in Australia. I now come to our genial old friend, posed restoration. who is shading his eyes and looking into the distance. should like to know if the right honourable being broadcast on the night of the electhe Prime Minister proposes to make him tion that William ""Valentino"" McCall deputy-leader of the party.

As is well known he had a terrific scramble to retain his seat. I read in the press where he said that in the House he had supported the claim* of the tobacco-growers, but I remember the night when the honourable member for Henty and the ex-Attorney-General( Mr Latham) grabbed him by the arm as he was crossing to vote with honourable members on this side of the chamber, and said "" Don't go over amongst those fellows, they are red. You are young, stop over on this side."" The next gentleman, who catches my eye, is the honourable member for Darling Downs( Sir Littleton Groom)a gentleman who should be elected Speaker. I say that with due respect to the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell), who has been proposed for that position, because probably by six o'clock to-morrow morning, I shall be under his jurisdiction. A good deal can be said in favour of the honourable member for Darling Downs, but for two substantial reasons he deserves my support. The first is that he declined to help the government of the day which proposed to dispense with the federal arbitration system. I am pleased to see that Sir Littleton is still with us. If he ia ever defeated politically I hope it will be by a true Labour man. I also recall the morning when it is said we raided the Treasury by voting for an additional Â£75 to our parliamentary allowance.

I Temember It,"member went into tbe electorate of Martin to fight for the selection against the late hair quite long over his collar, but one Mr Holman he declared that this was the day of youth. He said, "" We must have young men in the Commonwealth Parliament"". I advise him now to glance at the occupants of the Treasury bench. He will probably go back to the people of Roseville and Killara and say, "" I withdraw the statement that old men should not be in the Parliament. They are there. I have nothing to say against those men. They are good old men"". Here, sitting on my right, is one of the greatest old men who ever drew breath, my old friend, Dr. Maloney. If I were in the Parliamentary Labour party at a time when it had to choose a Ministry, I should vote for Dr. Maloney to be in the Cabinet. When the new honourable member said that Mr Holman was too old and that this was the time for young men he was a long way astray. opposed my friend the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) he got the honourable member for Parramatta to arrange for a meeting of bus-drivers and bus conductors at Rose Bay. said to those men, "" Gentlemen, if you return me to Parliament on Saturday week, I give you my assurance that we shall have the buses on the road again within a fortnight"". Government has been in office for a long while, but ask the honourable member for Parramatta if the buses were on the road again in a fortnight. I have not heard of the honourable member for Martin addressing the bus boys recently, and promising to get their jobs back again, but no doubt be will be able to explain that after I have resumed my seat. want him to do so. The next gentlemen I come to are the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr to South Australia to save him. The Fisken) and the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Street). like Siamese twins. Both appear in swallowtail coats and white spats. But their spats are the wrong colour. They should see to this. years ago, when Frank Burge, a prominent footballer, was in his prime. He represented Australia and also New South Wales on the football field on numerous occasions. He was the idol of the people of Glebe, particularly the Mr Gander. young fraternity. He used to wear his day he went into the hairdressers and had a neck shave. His hair was cut square across the top of the neck. When he appeared on the street on Monday morning, and for the rest of the week, every young man in Glebe was anxious to get his hair cut like Burge's. When the young fellows went into the hairdressers' saloons, the attendants said, "" How will you have it done"", and the young men replied, ""The same as Frank Burge's"". I also recollect that a good many yeaTs ago our friends Charlie Marr, and Mr Parkhill, went into Buckley and Nunn's, in Melbourne, to buy spats. That was at the time when Mr S. M . Bruce introduced spats into this Parliament. When they entered the shop the assistant asked them what they wanted, and they When he Baid, "" Spats "". He said to them, "" What kind""? They replied, ""Just the same as Stan's"". They followed Mr S. M . Bruce, and to the new honourable members. I say, "" Gentlemen, you are dressed He incorrectly for the Duke to-morrow. You need some dye on your white spats "". I have already referred to Mr Lane, and I notice that since then he has not interjected. Why not? enough. provision in that respect so far as the honourable member is concerned. I shall not comment upon the honorwell). I did not expect the honorback here again. And we all thought the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price) a "" goner "". He had to get the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) to go over people said: "" We don't want Price, we They are want one of our own men "". But, anyhow, he got through. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) also had a very I remember, many tough "" go "". But for the T.B. and the Communist votes he would not have got through.

When the first preferences were counted, he was between 5,000 and 6,000 votes down; but the weaklings of the Labour party voted for two renegades and gave the honourable member their second preferences. He is, therefore, here by the grace of the Labour party. Then there is the leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page). I must "" tickle him up"". Ho had a unity conference three weeks ago in Melbourne with the Prime Minister. I should like to have been present to hear what they discussed, but we can well imagine it. The Doctor, no doubt, came into the room and said, ""Well, Joe, we want three seats in the Cabinet-mysel f and Tom Paterson as two certainties, and then, for the third seat, we want Jimmy Hunter"". But the Prime Minister, as we know, was particularly anxious to get the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Abbott) into the Cabinet. About twelve months ago when there was some talk about a Fusion Governmen t consisting of members of the Country party and members of the United Australia party, you and I , Mr anxious to occupy the Speaker's chair, Parkes, were walking down towards the Hotel Canberra talking of the three or fouT most likely men to go into the Government. The newspapers said that MrI entered Parliament my hair was black. Thorby would be one and Mr Abbott another. Suddenly two men dashed past. One was Mr Abbott, and Joe Lyons was following him declaring that he wanted to catch M.r. Abbott as he was anxious to get him to join the Ministry; "" but "" he added, "" I cannot catch him "".

The honourable wards he thought that he had better member for Kennedy pointed out that the apologize, so he apologized to Ned Kelly. old boundaries were better for Labour. When the fight started in Calare, tbe candidates set to work to tear each other limb from limb. Dr. Nott and Mr Thorby were literally at each other's throat every night. They challenged each other on the platform and almost tore each other asunder. Mr Lyons had three meetings in the electorate for Dr. Nott. Mr Thorby said that they would never have anything to do with the United Australia party, and when there was talk in the newspapers about unity, he said that there would never be unity between the two parties. Yet at tha declaration of the poll he declared, "" Let by-gones be by-gones, and let us come together."" NowI come to Jimmy Hunter, the Whip of tbe Country party. The strongest union in this Parliament, Mr Parkes, is the Whips' union, consisting of Sydney Gardner, Jimmy Hunter, George Lawson, and myself. As one of the Whips of this Parliament I shall not talk about the others. NowI shall give some of my friends in the Labour party a bit of a boost. I shall pas3 by the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Biordan), who appears and come to the good member for Brisbane( Mr George Lawson). Parliamentary life affects men differently. When At that time. I had only my own troubles, whereas now I have the worries of a nation on my head. As honourable members can see, those worries have turned my hair grey.

18,Wimmera ( Mr Mcclelland) Has Not Been Introduction To The Honourable Member For,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Texas Green, can substantiate that statement because he asked our little group for support to save him in Kalgoorlie. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Fairbairn), who, I am glad to see to-day attired fit to meet the Duke, said that the proposed redistribution was definitely anti-labour, and if agreed to would result in the United Australia and Country parties winning more Victorian seats than if the old boundaries were retained. The then honourable member for Batman( Mr Dennis) said that under the redistribution proposals he was certain to be re-elected. Jim Fenton, who then represented Maribyrnong, said the same regarding himself. Jack Beasley, in a speech for which I love him, said "" I am here to represent the working class. As the honourable member for Flinders claims that the proposed redistribution will be against Labour, I shall vote for the retention of the old boundaries. As a Labour man I shall vote so that Labour can win seats "". It will be seen therefore that the honourable member for Batman owes his re-election, first, to the honourable member for Kennedy, then to my leader, ancl, next, to the honourable member for Flinders. During the election campaign the name of Mr Lang was frequently mentioned, both by candidates and in newspaper articles. In fact, the election was fought around Mr Lang. Mr Lang broadcast a number of speeches which numerous citizens throughout the Commonwealth requested to be published in booklet form. Parkes, I shall place on record some extracts from those speeches. You will be glad to see them incorporated in Hansard, for I feel certain that every Sunday night you sat by your wireless set listening to speeches in support of the various candidates. In a broadcast speech dealing with the influence of the banks, Mr Lang saidLast week we discussed and examined the anti-Labor election slogan of "" A Labor Government will smash the banks and Bteal your savings "". To-night we will take another of their bogey war or peace. cries: "" Labor wants to establish political control of the banks "". And with that slogan, of course, they conjure up pictures of Parliament ordering the printing of millions of pound Mr Gander. notes until the stage is reached where a pound note of. the future would be worth less than a penny is worth to-day. To understand thoroughly this position we will have to go back to the commencement of the Commonwealth Bank. In 1010 tliere werÂ« only private banks in Australia, and in most States these private banks had the righ t to issue their own pound notes. A highly profitable business. The Labor Government which came in in that year made two financial reforms: It established the Commonwealth Bank and took the right to issue notes away from the private banks. ""hear, hear!"" He voted for the establishment of the bank and I am proud of him for having done so. The quotation continuesThe power to issue notes was given to the Commonwealth Treasurer, and those conditions obtained until 1920. So you see, from 1911 unti l 1920 the politicians had control of the note issue and during that time pound notes did not become waste paper, as they did when the private bankers had control in 1893. Until 1024 the note issue was controlled by the Treasury. And the Commonwealtli Bank was under the sole control of Sir Denison Miller, an experienced banker, said Mr Lang, with no other interest in life but an absorbing pride in the great banking institution he had built up and a love for country which he and his institution had so f a it h f u l l y served during the trying years of the war and those which immediately followed. Incidentally, it might be mentioned that, of all the combatants in the war, Australia, was the only country whicli did not have a banking nrisis within a few days of the outbreak of war. Mr Lloyd George's description of the representatives of the private banking system With your indulgence,' Mr cringing and crying in the Prime Minister's room in London the day after war was declared' for the proclamation of a bank holiday, is the most vivid condemnation of the private banking system that I have ever read. Well, in 1924, we had a properly-controlled note issue and a free and independent Commonwealth Bank. The Bruce Government decided to change all this. About this time bankers overseas had a new fashion. They were -forming Central Reserve Banks everywhere, and they wanted a Central Reserve Bank in Australia, so Mr Bruce brought Australia into line with the old-world banking systems, which had failed every time they were confronted with a crisis, cither in Ho passed an act of Parliament placing the Commonwealth Bank under a board of directors and transferring control of the note issue to this board.",17,Election Of Speaker
19,Dr. Maloney,"Hear, hear!",18,Election Of Speaker
20,Mr Gander,"Dr. Maloney saysHere are the names and associations of the gentlemen who were to take control of what had been created as a people's bank. The first chairman of the board was Sir John Garvan. Sir John's other interests were managing director of the Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance Company. Tbe deputy chairman was Sir Robert Gibson, who was also a director of the National Mutual Insurance Company Limited, Union Trustee Company Limited, and Robert Harper and Company Limited. The members of the board were: Sir Samuel Hordern, a director of Anthony Hordern and Sons Limited, the Perpetual Trustee Limited, and the Royal Insurance Company Limited. Loan and Mercantile Agency Company, chairman of the Adelaide, Tasmanian, and Victorian Wool Buyers Associations, and proprietor of the wool-buying firm of William Haughton and Company. Mr Mackenzie Lees, who was chairman of the Associated Banks of Queensland, general manager of the Bank of North Queenslandincidentally, you might recall what I said last Sunday night regarding the squeezing out of the trading banks in Queensland-and Fellow of the Institute of Bankers, London. The other outside member of the board was Mr Drummond, a wheat-grower. In addition, Mr Kell, the Governor of the bank, who succeeded Sir Denison Miller, and Mr Collins, Secretary to the Commonwealth Treasury, were also members. In 1925, allegations were made that the chairman of tlie board was using his position to confer benefits upon the insurance company of whicli he was a managing director. Sir John Garvan denied the allegations, and his denial was accepted. Now, with Sir Denison Miller in control, there was no doubt tliat he was a competent banker, that his interests were solely with the hank, and that he did not allow politics to guide his policy. So far as the new board was concerned, you may have some doubts as to whether they were competent bankers or not, because there is nothing to prove that they were. You may havo some doubt as to whether their interests were solely with the bank or with their outside affiliations, but you can have absolutely no doubt as to their politics. That waa when the bank went under political control; that was when it went under wo prepared for this depression the heel of tlie trading banks. And we hadn't long to wait for verification of this. In 192(i, Mr Kell, the Governor, resigned, and, discussing his resignation with a newspaper reporter, he said this:"" The Governor of the bank should not be continually under the political heel."" A week later, Sir John Garvan, the chairman, resigned without giving any reason for biB resignation. It was very embarrassing to the Bruce-Page Government to have their new Governor resign within two years of his appointment, because he resented being continually under the political heel. Mr Scott, who was deputy-governor of the bank, was transferred to London, and Mr Riddle, the present Governor, who was then manager in Melbourne, was appointed Governor. We have to go through all this so that we may understand why the Commonwealth Bank, which was created to curb the private bankers and to defend the people, has become a creature of tlie private banking system and an enemy to the people. Having seen how tlie job was done, we will now come to the constitution of the bank at the time this depression h it Australia in 1930, and see how the Commonwealth Bank desorted the people. The board of directors at the time consisted of Sir Robert Gibson, whose affiliations we have already reviewed. Mr C. H . Reading, the chief Australian director of the world-wide tobacco combine. Mr Mackenzie Lees, the former chairman of Associated Banks. Mr Drummond. Mr Duffy, a union official, appointed by the Scullin Government. And the Governor of the bank and the Secretary to the Treasury. A few weeks ago, Professor Charteris, in one of his interesting broadcast addresses, said something along these lines:"" By the way, if any of you happen to know any of the statesmen who attended the 1911 Imperial Conference, ask him what the Dominion Ministers were told regarding the rising war cloud in Germany, aud what steps were taken by Australia as a result of that conference to meet the threatened war cloud in Germany."" Now hearing these words, my mind went back to that time, and I recalled how Lord Kitchener came out and inspected our forces and made recommendations: how we adopted compulsory military training; ]iow we ordered a navy which arrived twelve months before the war; and how, when the war did break out, our fleet was more than a match for any German fleet which might bo encountered in the Pacific; and our army organization was able quickly to mobilize a large force. We seemed to be remarkably well prepared for an unexpected war. There is an extraordinary similarity between the way v/e prepared for the war and the way Mr Parkes, I object to you holding a conference with any honourable member while I am speakingI n place of the Imperial Conference we have Prime Minister Bruce's visit to London, where the number of bankers' dinners which ha attended was, to say the least, most unusual. In place of Lord Kitchener we have the visit to Australia of Sir Ernest Harvey, Comptroller of the Bank of England. Sir Ernest thoroughly inspected our banking structure; particularly did he interview candidates for the governorship of the bank, and on",18,Election Of Speaker
21,"Mr Mccomas, One Time Of Tlie New Zealand",,19,Election Of Speaker
22,"Mr Mccomas, Whom We Know.","his departure: the chairman of the Common' wealth Bank said that he had been indebted to Sir Ernest for much helpful advice regarding the luture conduct of the banking system of Australia. Three years later, another official of the Bank of England, Sir Otto Niemeyer, came to Australia, examined the bankers' defences, and In that famous speecii at Melbourne, when he said the Australian standard of living should come down, laid down the policy which has governed Australian banking during the depression. This conference marked the final surrender of Australian independence in banking. In 1011 the Commonwealth Government set sp a free and indcpendent-bank that became master of the banking situation in Australia, continued Mr Lang. In 1924 this free and independent bank was merged with the private banking system in Australia. In 1927, with the visit of Sir Ernest Harvey, look at it . the whole of the Australian banking system became subservient to the Bank of England, and in 1930, with the visit of Sir Otto Niemeyer, tbe bank publicly acknowledged taking its policy and instructions from the old lady of Threadneedle-street. And yet there are people who say to me, "" Why do you publicly attack the banking system T Why don't you preach a moderate policy, and when you are elected, then bring about your banking reform?"" My answer is that any political leader who promises the people any improvement in their conditions, and yet hides from them the fact that he can do only so much as this outside financial ring allows him to do is not sincere, -aid Mr Lang, emphasizing every word of this significant declaration Wonderful words!And that leads us to another bogey-the lined a scheme for a managed currency which Lang plan, he continued. At a conference held be said was much approved of in London. at Canberra in February, 1931, the Premiers had to decide what policy they would adopt towards Sir Otto Niemeyer's declaration that gence in their fullest measure. It may sound the standard of living must come down. There were only two proposals-the CommonLang's goods standard. wealth Government's proposal that the Lang is a representative Australian, too, fond Premiers should ask the Commonwealth Bank of ideals, but impatient of technique. for more credits and that from the New South Basil Blackett, Sir Josiah Stamp, and Mr B, Wales Government which you know as the G. Hawtrey, on the contrary, are men inside Lang plan. So far as the rest of the Premiers were confamiliar with every point in its technique. If eerned, they were like Middleton's roustabout a goods standard as they fully understand it -Hadn' t any opinions; hadn't any ideas, he is monetary orthodoxy in 1933, it may prove added, giving the intimate touch of the the road along which Britain can lead a disPremiers' conference room. The objection to the Commonwealth proposal was that the Commonwealth Bank at that 1930, it's the action of a mad mullah. It time was committed to the policy of the Bank places a stain upon Australia's reputation of England, and unless the Bank of England that you will never be able to wipe out. It agreed to it, representations to the Commonwill ruin a nation; but proposed in 1933 by wealth Bank were hopeless. Long before this, Sir Basil Blackett and Mr R. G. Hawtrey it the Bank of England, together with the Beserve may lead a distracted world back to sanity. Bank of America, had decided upon a world policy of deflation, and they were not likely the newspapers when they attacked Labour on to alter it at the request of a Premiers' conthe Lang plan; I wonder if you will believe ference at Canberra. Mr Gander. There was a way, of course, for the Commonwealth Government's policy to be enforced, and that was by using Parliament to break the connection between the Bank of England and the Commonwealth Bank. But that is another story. The Lang plan could bo put into effect without the assistance of the banks. I don't suppose many of you have forgotten the tirade of abuse that was hurled at me because of those proposals. I remember the Sydney Telegraph had a cartoon; it was a dog with my face on it, and underneath it were the words "" Shoot the mad dog."" It's the only instance in my recollection where a powerful newspaper has deliberately incited people to assassinate a public man. They told you I was out to besmirch the fair name of Australia. Heavens, -what a song they made about it ! But, let us have another The proposals of the Lang plan were: 1. Abandon the gold standard. 2. The creation of a goods standard of currency. 3. The suspension of the payment of interest on overseas debt until more equitable terms were arranged. To-day the gold standard is something like the mother-in-law joke-to o old a joke to' be even laughed at. The next one was the creation of a goods standard of currency. Just listen to this: This is what Professor Shann wrote in the Melbourne Herald recently on his return from a trip to London. Last SundayI told you that Professor Shann was one of the authors of the Premiers plan and was the economic adviser to the Bank of New South Wales. In his article in the Melbourne Herald, the Professor outI will now quote the Professor's words: "" It challenges our courage and our intellito some good party men uncommonly like Mr What of that? MT. Sir a the charmed circle of the City of London, tracted world back to sanity."" Dear! Oh, dear! Proposed by Lang in I wonder will you ever learn. You believed them again! Do you ever stop to think that this ia the only country in the whole world where every daily newspaper, year in and year out, consistently supports the one political' party? Do you realize the significance of that? And now we come to the third plank of the plan-that of the suspension of overseas interest payments. This, you will recall, was said to be a most un-Britiflh proposal. It would mean that Australia would be posted as a defaulter, they claimed. Our trade would be boycotted, they said. Newspapers which ordinarily retained more or less an attitude of dignity descended to the gutterto find language forceful enough to vilify me and my proposal. Reading the criticism at the time, I often pictured the man who was writing the article Wring his hair in exasperation because his vocabulary was not equal to 'the occasion. And yet, just listen to this: "" The amount of interest that England is in default to us ia Â£30,000,000. In her budget you will find that salary cuts' restoration, unemployed assistance and income tax reduction amount to Â£30,000,000. interest to give to her own people."" Those are the words of Senator Robinson -peaking in the TJnited States Senate last month on Britain's interest default to America. The Lang Plan said: Suspend interest and use the money to provide employment for our own people. The British Treasurer defaults in his interest payment to America and Uses the money to restore salary cuts, increase unemployment benefits and reduce income tax. Where is the difference? There is Britain off the gold standard, drafting a goods standard of currency and defaulting in her overseas interest to improve the position of her own people. Why is she doing it? Do you think the British Statesmen read the Lang Plan and -aid: That's a good idea; we'll copy it? In England and America to-day, and in Australia soon, there is the same fight going on-the fight of the Treasury officials to free themselves from banking domination. Overseas interest is repudiated-to use the language of our Australian newspapers. Why? Isi t because the people who propose the policy don't believe in honoring their obligations? That isn't the position at all. But if they use their revenue to pay oversea interest they must then go to the bank for money to carry on their ordinary services. To free themselves from the grip of the banks they advocate a policy which enables them to keep their revenues for their own expenditure. To get the control of credit away from the private banking system they advocate a new credit system of a managed currency on a goods standard.

Australia never paid its interest before the depression came, friends. We always borrowed it in London. She has stolen our Another fairy tale they tell you is that -depressions are caused because the supply of commodities exceeds the demand, and then prices fall. The law of sunply and demand, so far as commodities are concerned, is as dead as the dodo. It belongs to the period when England waB an exporter of wool, and the biggest factory in the world was a four-roomed house. To-day we can grow more wheat, wool and butter than we can consume, and if we run the mass production factories for a fortnight continuously we can make a year's Bupply of manufactured goods.

At this stage 1 bring to your notice the undesirableness of all-night sittings, which unfortunately have been too frequent in recent years. V/e trust that you will use your influence t.o ensure that the Standing Orders which were amended to obviate all-night sittings will be carried out in their entirety-in the spirit, as well as in the letter. -The circumstances of your election as Speaker, sir, were, I feel sure, not desired by you. I believe it waa your wish that the proper procedure should be followed. Whatever views may be held by some honourable members regarding the debate this morning, it cannot de denied that every honourable member has the right to exercise to the fullest extent at any situpon any other nominations that honorting of this Blouse whatever privileges be possesses. not be abused. this Parliament the power to catch by the collar of the coat and throw out of the chamber men who, we thought, were abusing their privileges, there are on the Government benches many men, including some who hold ministerial rank, who would, on occasions, have been subjected to that indignity, and perhaps the honourable member who has interjected would have been one of them. I understand that the election of Speaker affords an opportunity, which on all other occasions is denied by the Standing Orders, to express the truth in the plainest possible terms and to lay bare tbe facts of different situations so that the community may be made fully aware of them. The extraordinary position which arose this morning was one to which, I feel sure, Mr Bell, you personally were not a party. I cannot adversely criticize the manner in which you discharged your duties in the office of Chairman of Committees in the last Parliament, although on occasions I differed from your rulings, particularly when you laid it down that a message from the Governor General recommending appropriation precluded an extension of the scope of the legislation to which it related, and thus prevented our making provision for certain sections of the community who needed assistance but were not covered by the measure. Doubtless your ruling reflected the opinion that you held as to the lines that the debate should take. On those occasions the numbers were against me, and my colleague* and I submitted to the will of tbe majority. I am confident that while you were Chairman of Committees you found that the memhers of my party presented their views in a reasonable manner. We shall adopt a similar attitude towards you in your new position, even though the circumstances in which you have been placed in the Chair to-day have no parallel in the history of this Parliament. You yourself cannot feel pleased at the manner in which you have been elected. I am sure you would have approved of the feeling of the House being disclosed able members might have submitted. Had that course been adopted the community would have been satisfied that, in the event of your election, which probably would have resulted, you were the deliberate choice of the House. We assure you that we shall always act in conformity with the Standing Orders. I hope that you will extend to us that reasonable latitude for which your predecessor was noted. We merely wish to have the fullest opportunity to express the ideas that we hold, and, what is most important, faithfully discharge our obligations to those whom we represent. I cannot compliment you upon your election because of the circumstances which surrounded your elevation to the chair; but if, as I hope and expect will be the case, you display impartiality in the discharge of your important functions, every member of my party will be pleased to congratulate you at the expiration of your term of office.

It is the practice in the British Parliament upon the occasion of the election of a Speaker to permit a member who has just been elected by the people to express his views in the frankest manner.

The Standing Orders require that a member raising such a matter shall conclude with a motion.

One honourable member, who spoke for a considerable time this morning, concluded his remarks by nominating himself, but the nomination was not even seconded.

This honourable achievement has been accompanied by an increasing devotion of our people to the British Commonwealth of Nations and to the ideals of free and democratic government with which the people of the British Empire have been associated for so many centuries. In the present time of world crisis many problems arise for the consideration of the Governments and peoples of the Empire, the solution of which can be greatly assisted by a spirit of co-operation.

The announcement of the tragic death of His Majesty King Alexander was received in Australia with feelings of very sincere regret and also of horror because of the dastardly act which terminated his reign while he was still comparatively young and zealously promoting the interests of his country. Immediately after hearing the sad news I requested His Majesty^ Ambassador at Belgrade to be so good as to convey to the Government of Jugoslavia the deep sympathy of the Government and the people of Australia in the great national loss which that country had sustained. As a tribute to the memory of the deceased ruler, flags were flown at halfmast on Government buildings throughout Australia on Thursday last, 18th October, on the occasion of King Alexander's funeral. The sympathy of the members of this House will go out to Queen Marie and family, and to the Jugoslavian Government and people in the death of King Alexander. associate myself, and the members of the Opposition, with the expressions of regret that have been passed by the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons). We join with all other honourable members of the House in extending to the people of Jugoslavia our deep sympathy in the loss of their ruler, King Alexander. to associate the Country party with the resolution which has been moved, and to express our horror at the ghastly deed which was committed.

The death of Monsieur Poincare occurred early last week, and I immediately conveyed through His Majesty's Ambassador at Paris a message of sympathy from the Government and the people of Australia. Monsieur Poincare was one of the foremost statesmen in the history of France. He was President of the Republic for a period of approximately seven years, commencing in 1913. His name will always be associated with the heroic sacrifices of France in the great European War during which time a tremendous responsibility, indeed, devolved upon the occupant of the office of President of the Republic. For many years before and subsequent to that period he served his country devotedly and with outstanding ability as Prime Minister, and in several other ministerial offices. As a tribute of respect, flags were flown at half-mast on government buildings throughout Australia on Saturday last on the occasion of the funeral of Monsieur Poincare.

Honourable members are aware that Monsieur Barthou had just met, on his arrival in France, His Majesty King Alexander of Jugoslavia, to whose regretted death I referred a few moments ago, and whose tragic fate he shared at the hands of the assassin. An expression of sympathy was immediately telegraphed by me on behalf of the Government and people of the Commonwealth. Monsieur Barthou, in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs, was actually engaged in duties connected with his important office, at the time of the sad occurrence. To the Government and the people of France the sympathy of the members of the House of Representatives is extended. The late Minister had been engaged in the public life of France for a period of 45 years, to the service of his country. the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), and with the other members of the House, in expressing regret at the assassination of Monsieur Barthou.

He was a member of this Parliament when I was first elected to it in 1910, and I can endorse everything that has been said regarding his genial personality. He was one of those who always preferred to do a kind action rather than offer an injury. Ho was attentive to his duties, and I can remember that, as Chairman of Committees, he carried out his work impartially and efficiently. I sincerely regret his death, and offer my sympathy, and that of my colleagues, to his widow in her loss. desire to express the regret of members of my party at the death of the Honourable F. W. Bamford, and to join in the motion of sympathy with his family. He was a familiar figurein the public life of Australia ever since federation. Although a fearless exponent of what he believed to be right, the late honourable gentleman always expressed himself with such kindliness and good humour that he had scarcely an enemy. He was Chairman of Committees when I first entered this Parliament as a young man, and I was indebted to him for his advice on many matters of procedure. members of my party also desire to be bers.

Question resolved in the affirmative, That this House expresses its great regret records its appreciation of his zealous public service, and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow in her bereavement. I regret to announce that Mr Mathews died in Melbourne on Tuesday last, 16th October. He, like the late Mr Bamford, was a member of the Commonwealth Parliament for a considerable period, having represented the division of Melbourne Ports, Victoria, in this House, from 1906 until the expiration of the Twelfth Parliament in 1931. He was Chairman of the Committee on the Causes of Death and Invalidity in the Commonwealth, in 1916-17, and a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works from 1917 to 1925. Mr Mathews was a very active member of thÂ© House, and devoted 'himself most zealously to the discharge of his parliamentary duties. During the closing years of his parliamentary career, his health was considerably impaired, and those who were members of this House during that period are well aware of and admired his courageous efforts, despite his diminishing physical strength, to continue to carry out his duties as a representative of the electors. The late Mr Mathews was a man of high personal worth, and during a long parliamentary career he served Australia faithfully and well.

When I first came into this Parliament the late Mr Mathews was a hale and hearty man, one of its foremost debaters and a shrewd interjector.

Tlie occupant of this office requires a great deal of parliamentary experience, and an even temperament, as well as a good knowledge of the Standing Orders. The honourable member for Forrest has been a member of this Parliament for the past fifteen years, and for over twelve years has been a Temporary Chairman of Committees. I think it will be admitted that he is eminently fitted for the position, and would act most impartially. I can commend him to tbe House with a good deal of confidence, for he has all the necessary attributes of a successful Chairman. I am sure he will endeavour, if chosen, to do justice to every section of the House. [5.54] I have pleasure in seconding the motion. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) is fairly well known to all of us. Apart from his long parliamentary experience and his knowledge of parliamentary procedure, he has the greatest of all qualifications for a judicial positiona calm and placid temperament. He is not likely to be bustled by any scenes that mav take place, and I think every honourable member will agree that he will 'be fair and impartial in his decisions, being uninfluenced in them by his political views.

This office is usually the gift of the Government to one of its favoured supporters; it is one of the perquisites that are l'egarded as spoils to the victors. On this occasion the Government has been returned with a following of 32 in a House of 74 members. Therefore, at the moment, we have minority government. If it had not been for the fact that the Government feared an embarrassing situation over the Speaker ship and tbe -Chairmanship of Committees, I have not the least doubt that the splendid qualities of the honourable member for Forrest would have been unnoticed and remained unsung. But the Government has formed a pact with the Country party, and the position of Chairman of Committees is one of the gifts that permitted the bargain to be struck. I give the honourable member for Forrest his due. against his qualifications for tbe position, bination of parties, the United Australia nor do I question his fairness. In the last Parliament he occupied the position of Temporary Chairman of Committees as well as did any other honourable member. Nor do I doubt his honesty or political sincerity; but it is evident that the Country party is making preparations for stormy scenes on tariff questions since it submitted the name of the honourable member for Forrest as its nominee for this position. Presumably it is desired that his well known fiscal views shall be stifled when tariff matters are under discussion in. committee. This is another pact such as that entered into in December, 1931, when the Country party and the Government formulated a common policy upon which they were to fight the be the new Speaker in the House of Repre[3] elections. They won a majority of seats in this House, and for months afterwards of faith and with treachery to tbe pact. There was open rivalry at the last elections between the aspirants for seats between the Country party and the United Australia party. The honourable member's remarks have no reference to the motion before the Chair. to the point that the proposed appointment of the honourable member for Forrest to the position of Chairman of Committees is more a matter of convenience than a desire to recognize his personal merits. Since the elections further negotiations have taken place, and a sordid struggle behind closed doors has occurred between the leaders of the Country party and the United Australia party for positions in the Cabinet. The whole of the press was able to tell the people, before this Parliament had assembled, that these negotiations were proceeding, and that the only serious difference of opinion was due to the ""snavelling"" for ofiice, the Country party trying to obtain more portfolios than the United Australia party was prepared to concede. Yet the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) declared that his party was placing principles before place I No sooner had the negotiations broken down than the imminent meeting of Parliament, indicated the possibility of an unpleasant I say nothing situation arising, in which, by a comparty candidates for the speakership and the chairmanship of committees might be defeated. Consequently, another secret conference between the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) and the Leader of the Country party was arranged, with the result that last night, before this House had an opportunity to discuss the merits or otherwise of the honourable member for Forrest, or, indeed, of any other honourable member for the position of Chairman of Committees, the Sydney Sun was able to announce that the way was clear for the election of a Speaker and a Chairman of Committees.

It was agreed that the Country party would support the United Australia party nominee who will be Mr Bell. He was Chairman of Committees in the last Parliament The Country party will nominate Mr J. H. Prowse as Chairman of Committees, and this will be supported by the Government party. The two parties together can outvote a Labour nomination in either case. The question before tbe House is not tbe merits of the honourable member for Forrest, but rather how best to save the Government from an position. way is now clear. are concerned to know how the way was made clear; we should know what transpired held behind closed doors. Are we to understand that the compromise in regard to the Speakership and the Chairmanship of Committees is only the first step towards a pact by which the Country party will sell the primary producers of Australia to vested interests represented by the United Australia party? It is idle to attempt to make the House believe that the two gentlemen who have advocated the claims of the honourable member for Forrest for appointment as Chairman of Committees have done so because they were impressed by his outstanding qualifications for the position. Rafher is it a case of political expediency in which tlie fitness of the nominee weighs not at all with the Government or those who support the nomination. party is not game to share the responsibility of government by entering into a coalition with the United Australia party. It wants pickings without responsibility. Knowing that trade crises are likely to arise, it is afraid to accept the responsibility associated with them, yet is prepared to share the pickings of office. In the light of what has happened, what are we to think of the professions of the right honourable member for Cowper, who indignantly left a previous conference with the Prime Minister declaring that the Country party was concerned only with policy, and was looking not for office, but for principles ? To-day, any further speeches upon the tariff. If the right honourable gentleman sells the Country party by compromising in regard to the Speakership and the Chairmanship of Committees. Mr Rosevear. these remarks, I do not desire to reflect on the qualifications of the honourable member for Forrest for the position for which he has been nominated. But I shall not allow to pass unchallenged the suggestion that he had been nominated solely because of his fitness for the position to which he will doubtless be elevated. I do not know that theTe will be any opposition to his nomination. Such opposition would be futile. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that members of this House should say whether embarrassing the nomination is based on the qualificaThe press tells us that the tions of the nominee or is merely a case We in this House of political expediency. at the secret conference do not desire to say anything in opposition to the appointment of-the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) as Chairman of Committees, the more so as I apprehend that the chances of my appointment to the position are almost incalculably remote. Looking about me, I see in this chamber a number of men who, by some means, entered this chamber during my furlough. One member, who is, however, not new to me is the honourable member for Forrest for whom I have only the friendliest of feelings. On one occasion in my callow youth-no t recentlyI made a speech on the tariff, of which the honourable member for Forrest approved. That was many years ago, but I feel there is some connection between the cirThe Country cumstances of that time and my defeat at the poll. In my felicitations to the honourable gentleman,. I am concerned only with his pronounced views on tariff matters. It would appear somewhat difficult to reconcile those views with the Speech which we heard to-day from the representative of the King. That being so, inasmuch as he is the chosen of this protectionist Government and party, I would like to know, for the security of the country and the peace of mind of honourable members generally, whether an undertaking has been obtained, under bond and seal, that the honourable member will not, during this Parliament, make that practical course has 'been taken, I can conceive of some real service being done to the country by this election, and In making such a service done to my electors and to",43,Chairman Of Committees
198,Mr Brennan (Batman) [6.5],"Ime as will greatly benefit my electors and make further secure my seat in this House. member in intelligent anticipation of bis speedy and painless election. I , like other honourable members who have spoken on this motion, have nothing whatever to say against the qualifications of the honourable member for Forrest( Mr a member allies himself with the party Prowse), or his capabilities for filling the position of Chairman of Committees. Buti t is too much to ask honourable members to accept, as just one of those bolts from the blue, a proposal by the strongest and most uncompromising free trader in this Parliament, the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), that an almost equally strong free trader, the honourable member for Forrest, shall be appointed Chairman of Committees-for if he is put in the chair he will be isolated volving extra pay or privilege or standfrom the discussion, of the tariff, most of which will take place in committee under his chairmanship, and he will not be able to vote upon the issues raised. There is somethinig moTe in it than that. When the position is analysed it seems to me that this action, involving a member of the purely free trade and uncompromising Country party, following as it does upon the uncompromising attitude of the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), is nothing more than an opportionment of the loaves and fishes. If this is done, the big guns of the Country party will have turned out to be guncrackers in some cases, and squibs in others. If it is an indication that the alliance that has already been spoken of will actually take place it is an example of coming events casting their shadows ' before them. I contend, Mr of their sham fights. Another big gun Speaker, that it cannot be reconciled with the action of certain honourable gentlemen in their adherence to party alignments right up to this moment. When we recall the political history of this country in this our National Parliament and in the State Parliaments, we find it has always been recognized by all parties that one of the greatest acts of political treachery a member of one party can commit is to accept office under another party. Order. The honourable member's word "" treachery "" is not in order. word. I said that this principle has I congratulate the honourable always been recognized, and if you say that I am out of order, I withdraw it. We know that the Parliament of New South Wales was almost torn asunder, and the sittings of that House made impossible because of an action similar to this. It has always been recognized that under which he seeks election. In my opinion, such an action as this goes very near to causing the people to lose faith in the honesty and integrity of their representatives in Parliament. A man goes to the country and swears by all the gods in heaven that with the party to which he is then allied he will destroy the other faction should his party get the opportunity to do so; but when he is returned, and is offered a position ining, all his pledges are thrown overboard, and his promises to the electors forgotten. He no longer cares whether the Government carries out its policy or not. It is clearly the intention of the Government to take the honourable member for Forrest off the floor and put him into the chair so that he will be unable to exercise his vote in furtherance of the promises he made at the election. Honourable members should not countenance such action as the Government has taken in this matter. If I had the opportunity, I would show my disapproval by my vote, .but as I have not such an opportunity, I am doing it through my voice. The action taken by the honourable gentleman indicates a complete surrender on his part, and, so far as the members of his party are concerned, it is only one more turns out to be not even a gun cracker, but a squib. not agree with the statements made by my colleagues for I am fully convinced that the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page), since the election, after making his declaration before the people that the world-wide markets for the primary produce of this country had materialized at last, has found out that his message of salvation for the farmers along that path was wrong.

261,That The Government Mr James,"Mr Speaker, I conhe would be able to see for himself evidence of appalling poverty. he would see women and'children in want of necessary clothing, though I have appealed to the Government time after time to make such clothing available. Every time we make a plea on behalf of the unemployed, we are told that the duty of feeding and clothing these people devolves upon the States, and is no concern of the Federal Government. I say that every government in Australia, and every section of the community, should co-operate in this work. The Christmas season is fast approaching, but what prospect of good cheer lies before the unwhether it will not be practicable for employed? I appeal to the Government not to adjourn Parliament for a week. I believe that His Royal Highness would prefer us to carry on the business of the nation, to make an attempt to do something to relieve the sufferings of the unwealth Government; but investigations employed. It has been said that we in this Parliament are not concerned with the unemployed, and that we are indifferent to their fate. That is not true of the members of the party to which I belong, nor of many members of the official Opposition. adjournment of Parliament at this time, more especially as we know that in about five weeks from now, Parliament will adjourn for six months in order to give certain members of the Government an opportunity to go overseas, and meet the people who have not the interests of this country at heart. They are more concerned with the making of trade treaties that will keep Australia in the'position of a vassal State as a provider of raw material for British industry. We should instead seek to develop our own manufactures in order to absorb our unemployed, and furnish a market for our own primary produce. The trouble is that some of those who sit in this House do not care a tinker's cuss about the unemployed. Much lip-service is paid to their cause when candidates are seeking the suffrages of the electors. We have now an opportunity to demonstrate the sincerity of what we then said. Let us 3eize it instead of merely coming to Canberra for 24 hours, then adjourning for a week, meeting again for four weeks, and then closing up shop for six months. I object to the motion, and propose to vote against it. Mr James. There intend to support the motion moved by the right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), because it appears to me that certain functions in connection with the Royal visit would interfere with meetings of the House this week. It is only right that the courtesy proposed should be extended to our Royal visitor. I rose more particularly to ask the Government not to commit itself to adjourning over the week during which the Melbourne Cup will be run, and to suggest that during the next few days it should definitely determine Parliament to meet that week. I appreciate the fact that many important events being celebrated in connection with the Melbourne Centenary involve official representation of tbe Commoncould be made as to whether proper representation would not be possible even if the House were to, meet on Wednesday of next week. The people of Australia, and particularly those resident in country districts, are looking forward with a great We object to the deal of hope to the work of this Parliament, and they would be cheered by the knowledge that we were to remain at work rather than to adjourn over the period suggested. I ask the Prime Minister to look further into this matter. trust that the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) will make a statement in connection with the matters referred to by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), and other honourable members. I object to an adjournment over the period > proposed, particularly when I realize that this Parliament has sat for only four or five weeks during this year. When the Government and its supporters went to the country they said that an election was being held because they desired to obtain a mandate from the people upon many important issues; but now that the general elections are over, and the people have decided in a manner more or less satisfactory to the Prime Minister, he is not at all concerned as to whether the House does, or does not, meet.

263,Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [7.7],"Iprior to the election are in the air, and, apparently, arc likely to remain there. We have been informed that the Eouse will adjourn over a period when horses will be racing round a track in Melbourne, and that there are certain functions at which the Commonwealth must be properly represented. I wonder what the bosses would say if employees absented themselves from work because there were certain functions which they wished to attend. Men who acted in that way would be sacked, and we shall deserve the sack if we do not do our job. We are the paid servants of the people, and should do what we were told by the electors. This Parliament has been in recess for all but a few weeks of the current year, and there will be further adjournments until the end of the year. I strongly object to the .Government adjourning Parliament until Wednesday next. Better arrangements could be made; Parliament could Bit longer this week. We shall have something further to say next week concerning a further proposed adjournment. When the Prime Minister moved this motion he should have made a statement in regard to certain press reports which have been commented upon. It seems that more information is available to the pTess than to honourable members. honourable gentleman's party only to-day exactly what I had in mind. a week ago. Mme from the Government. knows the psychology of this Government. for Hunter( Mr James) is right about the intended adjournment', the press is wrong. the proposal of the Government to adjourn the House in order to attend a race meeting. --' the race meeting, I would be honest about it, and say so. so far as it goes. I daresay other honourable members want to see the races. they pretend they do not. Mr LA/.ZA -.1 !\ i -During my membership of ibis Parliament in Molbourne, five cups were run, and I was not present at the running of any of them. Horseracing does not interest me. I think, however, that it is. wrong for a horse race to be permitted to sidetrack honourable members away from their jobs at a time when the nation is going through a period of stress and trial. A job has to be done, and it is our duty to do it. This was stated by tha Prime Minister at the elections, and repeated again in the speech of tbe Governor General in the Senate to-day. If there is a job to be done, we should not shut up the House as proposed. We are paid our allowance out of the public funds of this country to do our job, and not to run away from it. But, by these frequent adjournments, we are .running away from our joba practice that is not calculated to increase the confidence of-the people in democracy and in the system of constitutional government. I hope that the Prime Minister, in his reply to this debate, will indicate clearly what is proposed, and that he will offer some better excuse for the adjournment than that some honourable members desire to be present at functions in Melbourne. [Quorum formed.] I am glad to learn, from the speech of His Excellency the Governor General, that it is the intention of tbe Government to make a complete survey of the unemployment problem in Australia. That inquiry will necessarily take some time, and as the plight of the unemployed is so desperate, I appeal to the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) to take whatever action may be thought necessary to improve the lot of those people who are forced under existing conditions to live on 6s. a week, the amount of government sustenance provided. Although official statistics disclose that it costs from 22s. to 30s. a week to maintain a prisoner in our gaols, men out of work are expected to remain honest and live on 6s. a week! I recognize the difficulties confronting the Government, but the position of many unemployed is so dreadful that there should be no delay in affording relief.

273,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [7.15],"officers of the Department of Health in Melbourne have made the statementwhich to me is more terrible than the tragic death of a monarch, or the killing of a few hundreds of people in a revolutionary outbreak --that in Australia, the land of abundance, there are children who have never known the taste of milk. I urge the Government to do something to rectify this terrible state ofaffairs, and I hope the Government to do more than would be that on Wednesday next the Prime Minister will be able to announce that action is to be taken. We should face this problem of unemployment as we would face a war, without regard to parties or personal prejudices. All honourable members should come together in a resolve that in a country like this, which produces an abundance of all that is required for our people, there will be sufficient food for every man, woman, and child in it. and Treasurer) [7.16] -The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) has asked to be told of the intentions of the Government with respect to future sittings of the House. I informed the honourable gentleman privately, as the leader of his party, that. what the Government had in mind was to adjourn over tomorrow and the following day, to meet on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of next week, and then adjourn in order that honourable members and Ministers, too, may have an opportunity to take part in those celebrations in Melobject of his visit is not to attend bourne which come to each State once only in 100 years. The adjournment is not due to a desire on the part of Ministhose who are able to help him definite ters to attend the races in Melbourne, though I have been frank enough in the past in that respect. Last year, I moved the adjournment of the House so that honourable members could attend an event which, by many people, is regarded as one of very great importance. I did not move that motion for my own benefit, because I have never attended a Melbourne Cup; but I have no hesitation in saying that at this time of the year the great majority of the people of Australia are thinking about it. I repeat that I am not personally concerned about that race. On this occasion, the Government wishes to adjourn the House, because Victoria is celebrating its centenary, and important events in connection with it have been fixed for that week. His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester will be present at a number of functions, and since he was invited to Australia by the Commonwealth Government, it is only fitting that the Government should be represented at those gatherings. The adjournment will enable possible if Parliament were sitting, in two respects: first the relief of of unemployment mentioned by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) and other honourable gentlemen; and secondly, the tariff problems referred to by the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page). The Government is carrying on negotiations with a view to the making of trade treaties. Those negotiations are being conducted by a committee of Cabinet, which has been specially set up for that purpose, and more progress can be made with them if Parliament is not sitting. In addition, there are 60 or more Tariff Board reports with which the Government is anxious to deal and take action upon at as early a date as possible. The proposed adjournment will afford Ministers an opportunity to cleaT up many matters and bring them before the House before it adjourns over the Christmas holidays. The Minister who has been charged with the special duty of inquiring into matters affecting employment proposes to visit Melbourne. Honourable members will believe that the the Melbourne Cup, but to discuss with schemes of employment which we hops to submit to this Parliament for its consideration. It is important that adequate time be given for the consideration of these matters by what, after all, is a new Government. I should like the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) to realize that refusal to adjourn over tomorrow and the next day would not advance one step further the matters that he has in mind. The Government will lose no time in dealing with the problem of employment.
