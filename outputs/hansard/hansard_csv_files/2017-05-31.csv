Cheryl is a 48-year-old mother of two studying law at university in Brisbane”. Ms Butler: I second the motion. Question agreed to. National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Quality and Safeguards Commission and Other Measures) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Porter. Bill read a first time. Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. The National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Quality and Safeguards Commission and Other Measures) Bill 2017 establishes the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission for full scheme NDIS. The commission will deliver on the government's commitment to establish nationally consistent quality assurance mechanisms and safeguards for NDIS participants. The bill also makes administrative amendments to ensure the efficient and effective operation of the NDIS, resulting from an independent review of the act in 2015, as required by the act and as supported by COAG. The NDIS is one of the largest social and economic policy reforms in Australia's history. At full scheme, it is estimated that 460,000 participants will receive supports from thousands of NDIS providers. The NDIS therefore represents a dramatic shift from services delivered under largely block-funded contractual relationships between providers and primarily state and territory governments, to one where people with a disability purchase and consume services from providers. The government has been fully committed to the NDIS from day one. We are bringing forward this bill to establish a new commission to oversee quality and safeguards at full implementation of the NDIS. The commission will: Register NDIS providers and oversee provider quality",13,Setup

4,Mr Porter (Pearce,"Minister for Social Services) (09:32): I move:Respond to complaints and manage reportable incidents such as the abuse and neglect of any participant Provide leadership to reduce and eliminate the use of restrictive practices in the NDIS. The definition within the bill of a restrictive practice is any practice or intervention that has the effect of restricting the rights or freedom of movement of a person with disability. Lead the overall design and broad policy settings for nationally consistent NDIS worker screening. The bill seeks to balance appropriate protections that meet governments' duty of care obligations, with enabling participants to take reasonable risks in pursuit of their goals. The commission will support a strong and viable market for disability services that offers people with disability genuine choice and control. In February 2017, the Disability Reform Council released the NDIS Quality and Safeguarding Framework. The framework was developed in consultation with people with disability, carers, providers and peak bodies over a three-year period. It outlines the ongoing commitment of all jurisdictions to quality and safeguards for people with disability. A series of recent inquiries and reports have documented the weaknesses of the current safeguarding arrangements for disability services, many of which result from a disconnection between quality assurance and oversight regulatory functions. These inquiries include the Senate inquiry into violence, abuse and neglect against people with a disability in institutional and residential settings, Victorian government inquiries, and the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. These inquiries found failures to uncover, report and respond to abuse, and inadequate national screening of workers. They called for nationally consistent provider accreditation and the use of positive behaviour support strategies to reduce challenging behaviours instead of using restrictive practices. This bill establishes the Commonwealth's regulatory responsibilities under the NDIS Quality and Safeguarding Framework and in large part forms the basis of the government's response to the Senate inquiry. The new arrangements replace a complex and fragmented system of quality and safeguards in each state and territory, delivering a nationally consistent approach. The commission will uphold the rights of people with disability, as part of Australia's commitment to the UN convention, through the exercise of its registration and regulatory functions. Article 11 of the UN convention provides that all necessary measures must be taken to ensure the protection and safety of people with disability in situations of risk. Article 16 requires that people with disability be protected from exploitation, violence and abuse. The commission will be led by a commissioner who will be a statutory office holder and staffed by members of the Australian Public Service. The commission will operate with up to 300 staff, at a total cost of $209 million over four years. The bill establishes the commission in the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 (the act). The existing objects and principles of the act will underpin and inform the commission's regulatory activities. An additional object has been included to provide the specific focus required of this commission-'to protect and prevent people with disability from experiencing harm arising from poor or unsafe supports or services under the NDIS'. In support of the commission's registration functions, the bill provides the power to mandate types of supports considered higher risk which can only be delivered by a registered NDIS provider. The bill includes a power to issue NDIS practice standards benchmarking expectations relating to the quality of support delivery, participants' rights, the management of organisational and operational risk, continuous improvement, legal obligations and workforce management. The registration system requires providers delivering higher risk supports to obtain third-party quality certification against the practice standards and providers delivering lower-risk supports to undergo a 'lighter touch' verification process. Registered NDIS providers will be required to notify the commission of certain reportable incidents, and comply with all registration conditions and the NDIS Code of Conduct. Establishing the expectations and obligations for NDIS providers will contribute to fostering high-quality and safe supports and services. The bill requires registered NDIS providers to maintain complaints and incident management systems in accordance with requirements to be detailed in the rules. It further establishes the commission's complaints function, which will receive, manage and respond to complaints about NDIS providers and workers. The commission will provide information about the complaints process to people with disability and also provide information to providers, on best practice complaints handling. The commission will support people with disability to be heard and provide protections from victimisation should they make a complaint. The commission will have extensive compliance and enforcement powers under this bill, commensurate to the vulnerability of some participants within the NDIS. Monitoring and investigation powers will allow matters to be pursued whether they originate from suspected breaches of registration conditions, the NDIS Code of Conduct, reportable incidents or complaints. Operating as an independent statutory body with integrated functions and powers, the commission will be a fit-for-purpose, evidence-based, responsive regulator. Integral to responsive regulation is the ability to monitor changes in the market using data it collects in the course of its regulatory activities. The bill establishes a market oversight function which will draw on information gathered across the commission's functions. It will identify provider practice indicating emerging risk and that may contribute to provider failure and unplanned service withdrawal. Information gathering and sharing provisions within the bill will support the commission to work with other regulators and state and territory governments to identify and collect regulatory intelligence. The bill provides the commission with a broad policy design responsibility, including determining scope, information to be considered and a decision-making framework. The states and territories will be responsible for operating worker screening for the NDIS. The bill sets out the role of the commission in providing national oversight and policy settings in relation to promoting strategies to reduce challenging behaviours, and monitoring the use of restrictive practices within the NDIS. Under the commission a restrictive practice will be used only as a last resort. It must form part of a behaviour support plan which includes positive behaviour support strategies and which has been developed by a registered behaviour support practitioner. Restrictive practices must also be authorised by the state or territory in which the participant resides. The bill provides for the orderly transfer of providers from existing state and territory regulatory environments as each jurisdiction reaches full scheme. The commission will be established in early 2018 and commence operations in New South Wales and South Australia in July 2018 and in remaining states and territories, except Western Australia, in July 2019. In Western Australia, it will operate from 2020, subject to final negotiations with that state. The NDIS participants will continue to be covered by state and territory quality and safeguards systems until the new commission is in place at full scheme. This bill also amends the NDIS Act in response to an independent review of the operation of the act. The review, required by section 208 of the act, considered the operation of the act in supporting the scheme, and whether any changes were necessary for that purpose. The amendments in schedule 2 to this bill were recommended by the review and are supported by COAG in its response to the review recommendations. The amendments are largely administrative and focus on ensuring the effective operation of the legislation. For example, the amendments expand on the general supports which can be provided to people with disability under the scheme, to support the implementation of the Information, Linkages and Capacity Building element of the scheme. The amendments provide clarification of some elements of act-for example, how the disability requirements apply to people with chronic health conditions; how a person with lived experience of disability can become a member of the NDIA board; and how the NDIA gathers information on people who may be eligible for support under the NDIS. The Turnbull government will continue to work with NDIS participants and the disability sector to deliver a fully funded, high-quality NDIS. This bill represents a significant step forward in protections for people with disability, their families and carers. We will continue to consult with stakeholders to establish nationally consistent expectations for the conduct of providers, the training and screening of their workers and the quality of supports and services that they deliver under the NDIS. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Social Services Legislation Amendment (Ending Carbon Tax Compensation) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Porter. Bill read a first time. Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. This bill seeks to end compensation for a carbon tax that no longer exists by closing the energy supplement to new welfare recipients. The government is committed to ensuring that Australia's welfare system provides appropriate support to those in need whilst also remaining",15,Bills
5,Mr Porter (Pearce,"Minister for Social Services) (09:43): I move:sustainable for future generations. The government therefore does not consider it appropriate to continue to compensate people for a tax that no longer exists. The carbon tax was repealed from 1 July 2014. Had the carbon tax not been repealed it would have caused long-term increases in electricity prices. Indeed, electricity prices more than doubled under the previous government between December 2007 and September 2013, and when the carbon tax was repealed on 1 July 2014 the ACCC estimated annual savings of between $46 and $263 in residential electricity costs alone. The concept of ending compensation for a tax that no longer exists has already been agreed to by the parliament through the passage of the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016. As a result of the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Act 2016, carbon tax compensation has already been closed to new recipients of FTB A, FTB B and the Commonwealth seniors health card from 20 March 2017. Under the bill that I introduce today, the energy supplement will be closed to new income support recipients, from 20 September 2017. People who have been in the income support system continuously since 19 September 2016 will continue to receive the energy supplement. Existing recipients will continue to receive the payment as long as they have remained continuously eligible from 19 September 2016 for an income support payment that attracts the energy supplement. From 19 September 2016, if an existing recipient transfers, or has transferred, directly from one income support payment attracting the supplement to another, without a break in entitlement, they will continue to receive the energy supplement applicable to their new payment. There will be transitional arrangements in place for people who have entered the income support system between 20 September 2016 and 19 September 2017. These people have and will receive the energy supplement temporarily during that period, as long as they remain eligible for an income support payment, but will no longer receive the supplement from 20 September 2017. This measure was previously introduced in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Omnibus Savings and Child Care Reform) Bill 2017. The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Omnibus Savings and Child Care Reform) Bill 2017 was reviewed by three different committees within this parliament. I thank the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for its report on the measures that were contained in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Omnibus Savings and Child Care Reform) Bill 2017 and for its recommendations. The report was published on 21 March 2017 and I note that the committee recommended that the bill be passed. The committee considered that the changes to Australia's welfare system would better target government payments whilst still providing a fair and reasonable safety net for those who need it. The committee also noted that the measures in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Omnibus Savings and Child Care Reform) Bill 2017 would encourage and support greater workforce participation for those who have the capacity to work and would therefore ensure that Australia's welfare system is sustainable in the future. For these reasons, the government supports the measure being introduced today, that was previously introduced in schedule 9 of that bill to which I have referred. The government will continue to prioritise energy security and affordability. The 2017-18 budget includes a $265 million energy package that will ensure Australia maintains a secure, reliable and competitive energy system into the future. Amongst a range of measures, it provides funding to expand gas supply, makes finance available to build a solar thermal plant and provides additional funding for the Australian Energy Regulator to scrutinise energy providers to ensure they are serving consumers' needs. The government has also directed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to review electricity retail prices. The review will examine the competitiveness of offers available to households and businesses to make sure they are paying no more than necessary. A preliminary report is due by 27 September 2017 and a final report due 30 June 2018. The Turnbull government will start work on an electricity game-changer: the plan for the Snowy Mountains Scheme 2.0. This unprecedented expansion will help make renewables reliable, filling in holes caused by intermittent supply and generator outages. It will enable greater energy efficiency and help stabilise electricity supply into the future. This will ultimately mean cheaper power prices and more money in the pockets of Australians. Gas-fired generation is also an important part of our electricity system. The higher the price of gas the higher the price of electricity. That is why the government is also taking action to put downward pressure on the price of gas by expanding supply. The government is putting in place an export control mechanism to ensure Australians have access to gas at a fair price and calling on the states and territories to lift their moratoria to allow for more supply. The repeal of the carbon tax and the actions this government is taking to put downward pressure on electricity prices will ensure that new welfare recipients are provided appropriate support without the ongoing need for compensation for a tax that no longer exists. I note that those opposite adopted this very policy in their election costings in 2016, and I seek support for the passage of the legislation or, at the very least, appropriate explanations to the Australian people for the additional billion dollar black hole that would occur in the budget of those opposite. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Clean Energy Finance Corporation Amendment (Carbon Capture and Storage) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Frydenberg. Bill read a first time. Second Reading move: That this bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to permit the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to invest in carbon capture and storage technologies. The CEFC invests directly and indirectly in clean energy technologies, helping to drive down their cost. It makes its investment decisions independently of the government, and has a total of $10 billion in available capital.",18,Bills
6,Mr Frydenberg (Kooyong,"Minister for the Environment and Energy) (09:50): IUnder the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act, the CEFC is prohibited from funding CCS technologies. This bill removes the prohibition and provides the CEFC with the option of investing in CCS technologies. Access to finance is one of the barriers to investment in CCS technologies. This change will provide direct support for CCS technologies, encourage greater private sector investment and reduce risk for potential investors. Widening the scope of emissions reduction technologies the CEFC can invest in will also assist in achieving our emissions reduction targets more cost-effectively while delivering on our commitment to maintaining energy reliability and security as we transition to a loweremissions future. CCS technology has been acclaimed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) as critical to enabling the world to meet its emission reduction targets. CCS is now a proven low-emissions technology. Data provided by the Global CCS Institute and the CO2CRC illustrates that there are 17 large-scale CCS facilities in operation around the world. Further, the institute expects that by the end of 2017 there will be more than 22 facilities operational globally, compared to fewer than 10 at the beginning of this decade. CCS technology can also help reduce emissions from emissions-intensive industrial processes. The International Energy Agency has stated that CCS is the only option available to significantly reduce emissions from some major industrial processes, such as iron and steel production, cement production and natural gas processing. By way of example, the Gorgon LNG project in Western Australia will soon become one of the world's largest CCS projects when it begins sequestering up to four million tonnes per annum of carbon dioxide in the coming years. Removing the prohibition against investment in CCS technologies will allow the CEFC to support a wider range of low-emission technologies and thereby reduce emissions more costeffectively. The CEFC's ability to invest in CCS technologies will complement other low-emissions investment by the federal government, including more than $3 billion worth of wind, solar and storage projects since 2013. Debate adjourned. Safe Work Australia Amendment (Role and Functions) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill read a first time. Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to introduce a bill that will clarify and strengthen the role and functions of Safe Work Australia.",20,Bills
7,Bill And Explanatory Memorandum Presented By Mr Mccormack.,,21,Bills
8,Mr Mccormack (Riverina,"Minister for Small Business) (09:54): I move:Safe Work Australia was established in 2008 to develop national policy relating to work health and safety and workers' compensation. The bill was informed by the review of the role and functions of Safe Work Australia. Under the Safe Work Australia Act, a review of the legislation was required after six years of operation. The review was tabled in parliament on 8 November 2016. The review confirmed that Safe Work Australia plays an important role in facilitating a national focus on work health and safety and workers' compensation. It provides a strong tripartite framework-that is, representatives from government, employers and employees-for engagement on safety matters. The review also identified scope for improvement and recommended the Safe Work Australia Act be amended to:  clarify Safe Work Australia's role and the relationships between its role and functions, and  update, consolidate and simplify Safe Work Australia's functions to ensure they are clear, achievable, remain contemporary and support Safe Work Australia's role into the future. The bill gives effect to these recommendations. The bill amends the Safe Work Australia Act to insert an object provision which clearly states that Safe Work Australia's role and purpose is to-among other things-improve national work health and safety and workers' compensation arrangements. The new object provision also emphasises the importance of collaboration on national work health and safety and workers' compensation matters. To complement this, the bill provides Safe Work Australia with a specific function to collaborate with the Commonwealth, the states and territories and international bodies to drive further improvements in work health and safety outcomes and workers' compensation arrangements. There was extensive consultation with stakeholders through both the Review process and the development of this bill. This bill strengthens Safe Work Australia's ability to respond effectively to the challenges that impact health and safety now and in the future. A better alignment of its functions, that will remain contemporary into the future and not become outdated, will mean it is better placed to respond effectively to emerging work health and safety issues. The level of consensus that was achieved throughout the consultation process on the role of Safe Work Australia and its functions was very positive and commendable. It highlights the value all parties involved place on governments and employee and employer representatives taking concerted action on a national scale to reduce the significant social, human and economic cost of work-related death, injury and disease. This bill demonstrates the Australian government's strong commitment to working collaboratively, with states and territories, employee and employer representatives, to improve the safety of Australia's workplaces and its workers' compensation arrangements. Debate adjourned. Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. to which the following amendment was moved: That all the words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government’s cuts to Australian pensioners; (2) notes that the Government is giving a one-off payment of $75 to single pensioners with one hand, while removing the permanent Energy Supplement of $365 per year from all new pensioners; (3) calls on the Government to drop its unfair cuts to pensioners and vulnerable Australians; and (4) calls on the Government to drop its plan to increase the pension age to 70, the oldest pension age in the world.” time. To this the honourable member for Jagajaga has now moved as an amendment that all the words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the amendment be agreed to. (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017 that this government has introduced to this place. We will support the amendment moved by the member for Jagajaga. This is a bill introduced at the same time that we see inequality at a 75-year high, when wage growth has stalled to an all-time low and when energy costs continue to skyrocket. A matter of minutes ago, the minister came into this place to strip away money from seniors and pensioners who have worked hard their whole lives only to be treated like dirt by this government. We just heard the minister come in here and want to be congratulated for giving a one-off payment but taking away a lifetime payment to many pensioners and seniors in our community. Let's not be fooled. While Labor will be supporting the one-off energy assistance payment to pensioners, the government has today confirmed and introduced by law that they want to cut the energy supplement. That is a permanent payment which is worth much more to pensioners. Put simply, what we have just witnessed a matter of minutes ago is the government giving on one hand and taking much, much more on the other hand. This is not a win for pensioners. On this side of the House, Labor recognises that many Australians and seniors are doing it tough. Time and time again, what we have seen is the government making it harder for pensioners to make ends meet and harder for working Australians. Whether it be cutting penalty rates, hiking university fees, the Medicare freeze or a whole range of projects and programs in the budget that do not help pensioners, what we are seeing today is a minor commitment to pensioners but a major cut to thousands of pensioners across Australia. We know that the one-off payment in the legislation that we are debating today will mean a payment of $75 to pensioners, but we will also see, as a result of the legislation introduced",21,Bills
9,The Speaker (09:58,The original question was that this bill be now read a second,23,Bills
10,Mr Dick (Oxley) (09:58,"I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendmentinto this place before I spoke, a cut of $375 each and every year to pensioners as part of axing the energy assistance payment. I mentioned before that I know many seniors and pensioners are doing it tough across the country, but this is in particular for those who rely on assistance from the government to help pay for their skyrocketing energy bills. An analysis by the University of Melbourne's Australian-German Climate and Energy College earlier this year found that the average wholesale electricity price doubled to $134 a megawatt hour last summer, compared with $65 to $67 in the two summers during 2013 and 2014. Yet the government then sees fit to cut $375 to pensioners while energy costs continue to skyrocket. I have to ask: are those opposite in the same communities that we all walk around in? The same shopping centres that we visit? Or in the same pubs and clubs-all of those areas? Go into one of those clubs in my electorate-the mighty Blue Fin Fishing Club or the Goodna Services Club-and said to a group of pensioners who might be having a nice lunch together, perhaps after having a social activity, and say: 'Do you know what? We're going to give you a $75 payment but on the same day that we do that we're going to introduce legislation to take $375 from you.' I can say that that would not go down very well in my community, and in every single electorate in Australia that would be the same. So what is it with this government? Wage growth is at an all-time low; their answer is to cut wages. Inequality is at an all-time high; their answer is to cut support. And energy costs continue to rise and their answer is to cut the energy assistance payments. Really, all you can do is to shake your head and say, 'Why won't this government actually hear what is going on in Australia?' Let's be clear about what this government is proposing with this legislation. There is a oneoff payment which is merely a shallow attempt to distract Australians from the fact that this Liberal government wants to cut the energy supplement. Australian pensioners deserve much better than this. The Prime Minister and those opposite will not get away with pulling the wool over the eyes of Australians. Offering a one-off energy assistance payment of $75 to single pensioners while attempting to take $365 a year from single pensioners by removing the energy supplement to new pensioners is not good government; it is deceitful government. A one-off $75 payment is not the same as $365 assistance every year to help pensioners keep up with increasing energy costs: $75 does not equal $365. The Prime Minister has shown us time and time again that he does not 'get' fairness. I have said it in this place before and in the other place-in the Federation Chamber-that we hear the government talk a lot about fairness. We hear them put that out in materials and in advertising, but we know that they do not believe in fairness. That was the Liberal Party spending $200,000 to get a focus group to tell them that they needed to use the word fairness in their budget! Only a few weeks ago I was able to host the shadow minister for families and social services and the member for Jagajaga at a seniors forum, where this exact bill was being discussed by members of the community-the issues of cost of living, of energy cost and of people finding it really tough to make ends meet. We met at the Jindalee Bowls Club with Centenary Suburbs residents. Over 200 residents were out in force to make it very clear to me as their federal member and to the shadow minister that they found the rising costs of energy, when every dollar counts, to be a huge impact. Cuts like those that the minister just introduced, whilst we are seeing a once-off payment, simply will not make up that shortfall. The Jindalee Bowls Club is also home to Centenary Meals on Wheels. They do a great job serving pensioners and seniors. We know that the funding for Meals on Wheels is also under question and that there is a lot of pressure from service providers who are worried about the government's commitment. So, looking at this package and the amendment the shadow minister has moved, and going through those items one by one, in condemning the government's cuts to Australian pensioners we need to look back only a very short time. In that horrific budget in 2014 the government tried to cut pension indexation and leave pensioners $80 a week poorer over 10 years. We remember when the Liberals tried to reset the deeming rate thresholds, changes that would have negatively impacted half a million part pensioners. And who could forget the change to the assets test earlier this year, when the goalposts were shifted on hundreds of thousands of pensioners who carefully planned for their retirement? Almost 100,000 retirees lost their pension, and many more had their payments cut. This bill, at the same time as trying to pull the wool over the eyes of older Australians, also tries to clean up the mess left by the former Treasurer, Mr Hockey. When the changes to the assets test were introduced, the Treasurer promised that those who lost their pension as a result of the change would be able to keep their concession card. He said: … anyone who currently has a Pensioner Concession Card will continue to receive a concession card that provides the same benefits … That was false. That simply did not happen. Instead, former pensioners were issued with Health Care Cards and Commonwealth Senior Health Care Cards, which did not provide the same benefits. For example, without a pensioner concession card, former pensioners were not able to access vital government funded hearing services, and different concessions were applied from state to state. The government did not even bother talking to the states and territories about maintaining these concessions. I know that in my own community pensioner groups rallied, came together to make very clear their position on this breach of faith, this lack of trust that the government thought was the right way to go. We know that fundamentally the Australian community rejected it. Who can forget that famous night in 2014 when the then Treasurer in this government was putting the axe to pensioners, to those most vulnerable? He cranked up the music in his office and said it was the best night of his life. Well, it was the worse night of the lives of pensioners and seniors in our community. Either the former Treasurer forgot to include the maintenance of eligibility for those concessions in his budget or he just did not understand the difference between the two types of cards. Regardless, it goes to show that this government does not care about low-income Australians. Nor does this government care about middle-income Australians. We know from their actions and their policies that their priority is looking after the top end of town and those in big business. On top of all of this, if the government had its way, a retiree who dreamed of having an overseas trip would have their pension cut after just six weeks of travel. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Services have all said that the only reason these cuts were not in the budget is not that they had a change of heart, not that they listened to the Australian community, not because they would go out to seniors forums like the ones I hosted with shadow minister Jenny Macklin a couple of weeks ago and the shadow age minister last Friday. They did not do any of that. They did not go out and consult. They did not actually listen. They said: 'We couldn't get them through. We couldn't pass these cuts-not because we didn't believe in them and not because we don't think they're great. We couldn't pass them, so we junked them.' They still believe in them. If they had the numbers, they would pass them. If they could, they would lower the living standards of those on low incomes; they would lower the payments to those who rely on them the most. This is not an ideological shift; this is just a sheer pragmatic shift by a government more worried about their own skin than worried about those who rely on these payments. These cuts are not gone. The ministers in this place, the ministers at the table and the backbenchers in this chamber still want to deliver them. No-one has publicly gone out and said: 'We got it wrong. We shouldn't have gone so hard. We shouldn't have gone so fast.' I have seen all of this tragedy play out over the past couple of years in my community. But pensioners, seniors and others in the community rallied together and made sure that those sorts of cuts were not delivered. We also know that one of those measures, delivered by then Treasurer Hockey and the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, was to increase the pension age to 70. This would mean that Australians would have to work longer than anybody else in the world. I know the government like to be congratulated and like to think this is a fair budget. They go out and say, 'This is being well received in the electorate.' I do not know what planet they are on. You only need to look at the messaging coming out of the community from the nonprofit sector. If they bothered to leave this place and go to the bowls clubs and the service organisations in my electorate and meet with pensioners and seniors groups, they would hear a completely different message, where people in our community are doing it tough and need support. That is what the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, does every day of the week, criss-crossing the country going to town hall meetings week in, week out, listening to Middle Australia, listening to regional Australia and ensuring that pensioners and seniors, particularly, get the fair go they deserve. As I mentioned earlier regarding this bill and these changes, I was privileged to host the shadow minister for ageing, the member for Franklin, in my electorate last Friday. We visited two aged-care facilities and retirement locations in my electorate-a great new location in Springfield, and Sinnamon Village, a wonderful retirement village and nursing home facility at Jindalee. We heard from residents and staff about the enormous pressure and strains that those in aged care are under, particularly seniors who are relying on government support. So, whilst this bill is welcome for a one-off hit, a one-off payment, it does not go far enough and it simply does not undo the damage that this government has done to seniors and aged people in our community. They deserve dignity, they deserve respect, but more importantly they deserve a government that is on their side. This government has proved time and time again that it is not on the side of senior Australians. said, we agreed to support this bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017, because it is some evidence that the government is trying to help those on fixed incomes and those on the smallest incomes in our electorates. But we need to make sure that the government is held to account for what is happening and remind people about the con the government is trying to put forward in the budget.",23,Bills
11,Ms Chesters (Bendigo) (10:13,"As previous speakers on this side of the House haveFirst off, the one-off energy assistance payment of $75 a week for singles to help with their energy bills is welcome. Any good MP who, when they are not in this place, is out there talking to their constituents and holding their listening posts and their street stalls would know that the cost of energy is a major concern. We are about to hit winter. In regional Victorian areas like Bendigo, winter is particularly cold. The energy policy crisis that we are in because we are exporting too much of our own gas is putting pressure on the energy market and therefore driving up power bills. So $75 per single and $62.50 for each member of a couple is welcome because it will give some people and some households relief with their energy bills this year. I should say, however, that this is not a silver bullet solution. This is not a long-term solution to the energy policy crisis we have in our country. It is a one-off payment. They are saying, 'Here's a little bit of cash to distract you from the fact that we have no long-term plan to address skyrocketing energy bills.' At the same time as giving a small relief to households, they are taking from those who are about to come onto these sorts of payments. What the government have also put forward in their budget is to scrap the energy supplement for new pensioners and people on new payments. So whilst this one-off payment is good news for our aged pensioners, our disability support pensioners, our parenting payment single recipients and our veterans' payments recipients, it is a one-off. People are not fools. They say: 'Great, that helps me this year, but that doesn't help me next year. It doesn't help me in the long term.' My electorate, the Bendigo electorate, is like many regional electorates. We have a significant number of people on fixed incomes or on some form of government payments. We have a large proportion of people on the age pension. We have single parents and a number of people on the disability pension. One pensioner said to me on the weekend: 'The cost for me turning on my power is the same as for my next-door neighbour. Whilst my pensioner discount does help, there is a point where it doesn't help because our bills have gone up so much.' Bills are skyrocketing and $75 will help, but it will not really get on top of the massive increases they are paying. The other part of this bill that I need to draw people's attention to is where the government is trying to clean up a mistake they made back when the former Treasurer in this place made a bit of a mistake on budget night. Now we are seeing the reinstatement of the pensioner concession card. This is for people who lost their pensioner concession card because of the new pensioner asset test that began on 1 January 2017. I think what is really frustrating about the fact that the government has only brought this forward now is that since that budget night when the former Treasurer promised this and up until people lost their pensioner concession card-a few years now-people on this side of the House have been saying: 'What are you doing about this? Because of the pension asset test changes people will lose this concession card,' and the government did nothing. The government did nothing when pensioner groups got active about this to say: 'We will lose it. There is a significant proportion of people in our community who will lose this pension concession card.' Still, the government did nothing about this. It was not until people lost it that they went, 'Oh, this has created a problem.' It is the growing mantra of this government: pretend it is not an issue, say it is not an issue, stick your head in the sand about the issue, and only when people start to complain go, 'Okay, maybe we need to look at this.' The government estimates that approximately 92,000 pensioners lost the concessions card in this period alone. However, as people's retirement income starts to grow because we have had superannuation and as fewer people will qualify for the pension, in the future there would have been more pensioners not eligible for this card. It actually challenges the government to rethink their entire approach towards retirement income. I am proud, as all Labor members are, that it was a Labor government that first introduced compulsory superannuation. The vision was that throughout somebody's working life they would save enough through their super contributions to have a decent retirement through their own retirement savings. That was first introduced in 1992 by former Prime Minister Paul Keating, and it was a great reform. It was something that working people, that the unions and that Labor had long championed. For Australian workers to get to a place where they have enough to retire on, they need to have had a working life of superannuation savings. We are talking about my generation. I started working in 1994. We hope that when people now in their 30s retire-as is the government's wish, when they are 70, but at the moment if they retire at 67-they will have earned enough in their working life to have enough in superannuation to retire. If we acknowledge that it will take a generation of workers to get to that point, for those who between now and then, unless they are full age pensioners, there will be a sliding scale of people who will have a mix of super and pension. The problem in the approach of this government is that they want to knock out people who may have a mix-they want to force a group of pensioners back to the poverty line. It has been well established by a number of groups, by research, that the level of single pension that people are trying to survive on is well below the poverty line. We have older Australians currently living in poverty. Our pension rate is too low. People may have been trying to supplement their pension with their super to get themselves above that point, but this government has taken the axe to them and cut back the assets test to say, 'No, we think you are millionaires and you all must live below the poverty line.' It was purely a budget save, and I am very disappointed, like many people in my electorate, that the Greens got on board with this idea from the government, that they backed the government in. The Greens, the Liberals and the Nats all said at the time that millionaires should not get pensions. What they did not talk about were the teachers and the nurses; they did not talk about the people who worked in trades who were not millionaires-they had some superannuation savings because of collective agreements that they had negotiated, but not enough to provide them with what could be considered a decent retirement income. They are the people who lost when this government changed the pension assets test. We do welcome the fact that at least this group of pensioners will get their concession card back. The cost of services in the regions is expensive. Pensioners in my part of the world do enjoy their discounts on public transport-every year the state of Victoria sends them a couple of free tickets for V/Line services to go to Melbourne. They can use them when they like-it could be for medical appointments or it could be to catch up with grandchildren; it is their chance to go to Melbourne. What is really frustrating about what the government did, without consultation with the states, is that when they stopped issuing the card there was a knock-on effect. People came to speak to us about the fact that they lost discounts on their rates notices, and then councils had to scramble to see what they could do. We had people come and say that they lost discounts on all forms of public transport, and concessions on their energy bills. The government just did not think through the consequences of scrapping this card for a group of people. The frustrating thing is that it has taken this long for the government to realise their error and reinstate the concession card. It is like the government do not trust people when organisations tell them what the impact of their decisions will be. They wait for the impact to happen-they do not trust the organisations, they do not trust their own department and, they do not trust people in the community when they come up and say, 'When this kicks in on 1 January, I will be affected.' That is what is disappointing: the government, knowing full well the impact of scrapping the concession card on this group of pensioners, did nothing, until now, to fix it. I mentioned that this government's once-off payment is not the same as $365 of assistance every year to help pensioners keep up with the increasing energy costs. It is not just pensioners that they choose to scrap this energy supplement for; it is people who are on Newstart and people who are on youth allowance. This government, again, is forcing the most vulnerable in our community, who need our support, further into poverty. These are the people who are seeking support from our welfare and relief agencies. In my own area of Bendigo, our welfare agencies and emergency relief agencies report a 40 per cent increase in people seeking help over the last financial year. This year, so far, it is growing. They state that the reasons for this are the cost of energy bills, the costs of car registration and insurance, and, if those in need of help have children, the cost of children going to school. The agencies are saying that single pensioners, in particular, are doing it incredibly toughpeople who are just trying to get by. Without food hampers-without emergency relief food-they literally would not survive. Max at the UnitingCare at Kangaroo Flat does an amazing job in reaching out to this group. He has people who rock up to say, 'I've just spent all of my pension on my rent and on my energy bills, can you help me out? Max is not alone. There is also UnitingCare in Forest Street, Bendigo and St Vincent de Paul in Bendigo. These organisations, every single day, are supporting people with food hampers and emergency relief, because people are being crippled by the cost of living. This is so typical of this government-caring about the top end of town whilst putting pressure on people on the smallest of incomes. Coming up on 1 July, we have a government which will give millionaires a tax cut-$16,400 a year-while standing by and doing nothing to stop penalty rates being cut. Retail workers could lose up to $6,000 a year, or $77 a week. It may not sound like a lot to a millionaire or a government backbencher, with what they earn, but to someone on the smallest of incomes it is a lot. It is a government that continues to do nothing to support those on the lowest incomes. One pensioner said to me: '$75? Really, that's it? That will help pay a fraction of my bill. A once off-is it a bribe? Are they trying to get me to be quiet?' People will see this for what it is. Whilst we support it and welcome it, it is not enough. The government is really out of touch with those on the smallest of incomes. It is really out of touch with people who need ongoing and continuous help. It is a government that is caught up in its own rhetoric and thinks that people will be taken as fools. Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017. We will be supporting this bill, but we really want to put on the record that on this side of the House-not just us, but our Australian pensioners-we are sick and tired of seeing",26,Bills
12,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (10:28,"I too rise to speak about the Social Servicespensioners being used as political footballs at every budget. It is unfair to treat people in this way. Our pensioners in our community have paid their taxes all their lives. They have worked hard most of their lives in jobs that were labour intensive-because of the technology in the days when they started work. Some have even fought in wars to protect this country. They have built the foundations that we live our lives on today, and I think we live pretty good lives here in Australia. We owe it all to the generation before us. We owe it to them because they built this country, and now we treat them with great disrespect. Also, these are the people who put in place, a generation before us, our workers' rights-the rights that we take for granted. We see many other things that affect the hard-earned work that they have done, including the rights that they put in place during their working lives. We see penalty rates being cut, for example. They may not be affected directly because they are now on a pension, but it irks them and it upsets them because they think of the standards that they had when they worked and they look at the standards that our workers have to put up with today. All these things affect these people. In my electorate I speak to pensioners. I have one of the oldest electorates in the country. Over 20 per cent are 65 or over. SoI speak with lots of pensioners on a regulator basis, and they tell me that they are sick of being used as political footballs, especially by this government, at every budget. They are made to feel like they are a burden, welfare recipients, a cost and a nuisance, which is not correct, because these people built the foundations that we live our lives on today. Certainly on this side of the House we will not have it. They have contributed to our society and to our economy, and they deserve better. So, while we welcome the fact that we will get the very, very modest one-off payment that is outlined in this bill, it certainly does not compensate for the cuts and the hardships that pensioners have had to endure under this government over the last four years. We remember in 2013 in the lead-up to the election when the member for Warringah, the former Leader of the Opposition and then Prime Minister, made a promise that there would be 'no cuts to pensioners', and 'no changes to the pension'. What did we see in the very first budget? A whole range of cuts. I will go through them now. The Abbott-Turnbull government's record on pensions is nothing short of a disgrace when it comes to our pensioners. In every budget since they have been in government, they have handed down their proposed cuts to the pension. And that is four budgets in a row-not one; not a one-off; not two; not three-at every single budget there has been some detrimental effect on our pensioners. This government has no shame when it comes to doing over our pensioners. While they are doing this, at the very same time, they are proposing a $65 billion tax cut for the top end of town, the richest people of Australia. Yet our most vulnerable and those that have built the foundations that we live our lives on are enduring cuts. I do not see how that is fair. We have a government that throws the word 'fairness' around continually. You will hear it during question time, in speeches and in press conferences. They must be tracking it through polling that the word 'fair' or 'fairness' resonates well. You hear it continually. But what is so fair about cutting from pensioners and giving a $65 billion cut to Australia's richest people? There is nothing fair in that-absolutely nothing. Not only does the Turnbull government want to raise the pension age to 70, he is making it the oldest pension age in the developed world. Where are the jobs anyway where these people will work? And how do we expect people, especially people who work in labour intensive jobs, to keep on going until they are 70? They also want to scrap the energy supplement-and this is the heart of this bill-making pensioners, carers and Newstart recipients $550 a year worse off. And this comes on top of the harsh cuts to pensioners as a result of the government's new assets test that we saw earlier. They are constantly nipping away at the eligibility for pensioners. With the energy supplement making pensioners, carers and Newstart recipients $550 a year worse off-can you tell me: how can that be fair? This government is hanging our pensioners out to dry. They do not deserve to be treated so poorly. Schedule1 of the energy assistance payment-let's have a look at it. What is Schedule1 of the energy assistance payment? I will tell you what it is. It is just a smokescreen. It is a smokescreen to distract us from the fact that this government still wants to abolish the energy supplement. They still want to abolish the energy supplement which assists people with their energy bills. We know that energy bills have quadrupled since they have been in government. They have quadrupled in terms of the costs of supplying energy to your house. The government will carry on about the carbon tax and a whole range of other things, but what have they put in place? What have they done to ensure that our pensioners have some form of assistance and to ensure that we have a market out there that keeps the prices down? They have done nothing about it. They are happy to bang on about coal and a whole range of other things, but energy prices have gone up-which is hurting our pensioners-because the government have not acted to keep us up to date with renewables and a whole range of other things that are taking place around the world in markets and industries that we are falling behind in. If the government were really interested in ensuring that energy prices were down, we would be looking at a different mechanism to ensure that there are more players in the market with a mix of renewables and a whole range of other energy suppliers in order to have a good cap on prices so pensioners in my electorate and everyone else's electorates are not hurt. The government will not get away with pulling the wool over the eyes of our pensioners. They can see through this and they are already raising it with me and with other colleagues. As I said, these pensioners were hard working once upon a time. In this bill, the government are offering a one-off energy assistance payment of $75-a one-off of $75-and at the same time are taking away $365 a year from single pensioners by removing the energy supplement to new pensioners. My maths might not be 100 per cent but a one-off $75 payment is not the same as a $365 in assistance every year to help pensioners to keep up with increasing energy costs. They are offering a $75 payment and what was in place was $365 in assistance every year to help pensioners with the increasing energy costs-and, by the way, the government have done noting to ensure that energy costs do not keep on rising. These sums just do not add up. As I said in other speeches, it is like setting a fire, being the arsonist, lighting the match, and then calling triple 0 and getting the fire brigade and wanting a pat on the back because you are a hero. Well, it does not work that way. Our pensioners will see through this and they will vote accordingly at the next election. We on this side will oppose the government's attempt to remove the energy supplement from the most vulnerable Australians who will be affected by this. The 2017 budget confirms that the government still want to cut this energy supplement. The Prime Minister likes to say that he is all about fairness-and I spoke about that-but there is no way that there is anything fair about this. They talk about fairness, but at the same time that they are hitting the most vulnerable people-cutting from them; taking away from them-they are proposing, pushing and trying to bully through every day that $65 billion tax cut to Australia's highest earners, richest people and big businesses that pay very little tax to begin with. If the Prime Minister really cared about the living expenses of vulnerable Australian, he would no be trying to abolish this energy supplement. The payment will be $75 for singles and $62 each for each member of a couple. Schedule2 provides for the reinstatement of the pensioner concession cards. I have to say that the government's previous attempt to get rid of the concession cards was very meanspirited. But, thanks to the efforts of Australian pensioners around the country who lobbied their MPs-and I suspect many on the other side-the government has been forced to reinstate it. The government has been forced to overturn a very cruel measure that it had in place, after failing to keep then Treasurer Joe Hockey's promise in his budget where he said that no-one would lose their Commonwealth pensioner card. This shows that when we work together-and Australians do work together-we can actually achieve results. Many, many pensioners in my electorate have written to me and spoken to me at street corner meetings and at forums that we had on this issue to tell me just how unhappy they were about their concession cards. When the changes to the pension asset test began on 1 January 2017 many pensioners ceased to be eligible for their payment and they also lost their concession card. I am really happy to say that almost 1,000 pensioners in my electorate of Hindmarsh who lost their pension following this government's asset test change will get their concession card back through this bill. I am very pleased about that, because many of them wrote to me. I received many emails and had many discussions and phone conversations about this. Through the campaign that they ran, they have managed a good result. It certainly does not make up, though, for all the other cuts that they have to endure. Let us face it: this government is only doing this as a result of pressure that we on this side of the House and pensioners have exerted on them. The let us not forget that, when the changes to the asset test were introduced, the then Treasurer Joe Hockey promised that those who lost their pension as a result of the change would be able to keep their concession card. That turned out to be a furphy, didn't it? To quote the words of the previous Treasurer Joe Hockey: … anyone who currently has a Pensioner Concession Card will continue to receive a concession card that provides the same benefits … Was that true? Certainly not. Instead, former pensioners were issued with healthcare cards and Commonwealth senior healthcare cards, which did not provide the same benefits. I was asked by the media yesterday about the polls. My response was that you do not have to be a rocket scientist to know that this government is travelling so badly. When you have a senior member of the government promising that Commonwealth concession cards will not be taken away and then they get taken away, it is no wonder they are in a state of disarray. For example, without that pensioner concession card former pensioners are not able to access vital government funded hearing services, and we all know that the minimum cost would be around $3,000 for hearing devices from different states. It depends on where you are. The loss of the pensioner concession card is a very cruel double blow to many former pensioners with modest incomes. I am very pleased that pressure from this side and pressure from pensioner groups around Australia has changed the government's proposal. The government must think Australia has a very short memory. As I said, I am sure these people have not forgotten, and you cannot pull the wool over their eyes. I remember in 2014 when the government tried to cut pension indexation and leave pensioners $80 a week poorer over 10 years. This is the stuff that has been happening while at the same time they are still pushing that $65 billion tax cut for the high-end of town. I also remember when the government tried to reset the deeming rate threshold-changes that would have negatively impacted half a million part pensioners around the country. These are not people on wealthy incomes; they are part pensioners. They rely on a part pension and a bit of modest savings that they have. I also remember when this government changed the assets test and shifted the goalposts on hundreds of thousands of pensioners who had carefully planned their retirement. All of a sudden they had the goalposts changed. At that point 100,000 retirees lost their part pension or pension and many more had their payments reduced-many hundreds in my the electorate, who lobbied me and still do. God forbid for a retiree to dare to aspire to an overseas trip. If the PM has his way, their payments will be cut after six weeks overseas. It is even worse for migrant pensioners or people who have settled in Australia from overseas. If you are a pensioner who was not born in Australia and you wanted to visit family and friends overseas, you pension will be reduced in line with the time that you have lived in Australia as though your contribution was worth less. They say these cuts are gone for good. (Time expired) Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017 and to join with my Labor colleagues in highlighting and condemning the appalling record of the coalition relating to their treatment of the pension. I am proud to be a member of the Labor Party-a Labor Party that, through the great Prime Minister Andrew Fisher introduced the old-age pension over 100 years ago. The age pension is a compact with senior Australians that says that we commit to giving you a dignified retirement. It is a compact that says that we commit to ensuring that every Australian has the ability to retire and live their final years in some dignity and not be left to starve on the streets, as still occurs in some other nations around the world today. It is a compact that the Liberal and National parties do not understand. It is a compact that they repeatedly attempt to break, and without the Labor Party holding them to account they will try and break it at every opportunity. Before discussing the energy assistance payment, I want to highlight the asset test changes introduced by the Liberals and Nationals, which is related to the concession card aspect of this bill. This change cut the pension for 330,000 elderly Australians. Approximately 3,000 of my constituents in Shortland had their pensions reduced or cancelled, and one quarter of the residents in Shortland are over the age of 60. So these changes had a very significant impact on the electorate that I represent. I am very proud to have voted against this legislation, to have voted against the pensions asset test change that cut the pension for 3,000 of my constituents. This policy shifted the goalposts for tens of thousands of pensioners who had in good faith planned for their retirement, and nearly 100,000 retirees lost their pension completely. The government should know that my constituents who were affected by these",29,Bills
13,Mr Conroy (Shortland) (10:43,"It is good to have an opportunity to speak on thechanges are still incredibly angry about this issue-and I know this, because I have met with them and seen how distressed and upset they are. In fact, at every single seniors expo I hold in Shortland, this is still raised as a massive issue. These changes are even worse because of the direct betrayal of a promise the government had previously made relating to the pensioner concession charge. When these asset changes were introduced, Joe Hockey stated very clearly that those who lost their pension as a result of the change would be able to keep their concession cards. He said: Anyone who currently has a Pensioner Concession Card will continue to receive a concession card that provides the same benefits … This was a blatant lie. As I said previously, my constituents are very angry about it. So Labor welcomes the provision in this bill which provides for the reinstatement of the pensioner concession card for those who ceased to be eligible for the card as a result of the asset test changes on 1 January this year. But it should be noted that the government has only done this with the utmost reluctance and only after concerted pressure by pensioner groups and the Labor Party. This is another clear example of how out of touch the Prime Minister and his government are with the realities of the day-to-day lives of pensioners, retirees and, indeed, all ordinary Australians. As I have noted previously, given the background of the Prime Minister and his substantial wealth, this is not surprising, but it is still no excuse to attack the living standards and quality of life of the pensioners that I represent in this place. Let there be no mistake that the government is cutting the pension. The introduction of the energy assistance payment is a blatant attempt by the Liberals and Nationals to disguise the fact that they are cutting the pension by abolishing the energy supplement. This bill provides a one-off energy assistance payment of $75 to single pensioners, while attempting to take $365 a year from single pensioners by removing the energy supplement to new pensioners. This might not be a significant amount for the Prime Minister but it is a very substantial amount for pensioners in Cardiff, Windale and Lake Munmorah-in fact, every suburb that I represent. I state again that the Prime Minister and his government are so out of touch that they do not comprehend the harm they are doing to pensioners, who deserve to be treated so much better. The truth is that the $75 one-off payment to single pensioners is welcome but it does not begin to touch the sides of the energy crisis and the rise in energy bills that pensioners and, in fact, all Australians are confronting right now because of this government's incompetence. Wholesale energy prices have doubled on the coalition's watch and the cost of energy is a major concern for my constituents, particularly those on fixed incomes. The government is trying to con them with a one-off payment of $75. If this government were truly worried about the impact of energy prices on pensioners, they would do two simple things: firstly, they would support an emissions intensity scheme for the electricity sector-an emissions intensity scheme supported by basically every single stakeholder in the energy sector, whether it is the networks, the generators or the consumers. In fact, the government's own regulator supports an emissions intensity scheme. Basically anyone with a pulse who has any knowledge of the electricity sector, other than this government, is supporting an emissions intensity scheme. Why are they doing that? For two simple reasons: firstly, it will provide investment certainty that will unlock $48 billion of investment in the energy sector, which is so vitally needed; and, secondly, it will place downward pressure on electricity prices. Because of the way an EIS works, it subsidises the marginal producer in the energy market, which is gas. Gas sets the price for electricity, so by subsidising gas an EIS will actually reduce electricity prices. Modelling commissioned by the government's own regulator and conducted by the government's favourite energy modeller, Danny Price, has found that an EIS will reduce electricity prices by $15 billion-$15 billion! So if the government were really interested in reducing electricity prices for pensioners and all Australians they would embrace an EIS, because that is the quickest, simplest and most efficient way of reducing electricity prices in this country. The second thing they would do is to solve the gas crisis-a gas crisis that has seen incredibly high increases in the price of gas both for Australian manufacturers and Australian consumers of energy through gas. The government have been asleep at the wheel on this issue. For four years they have done nothing about the gas crisis, which has been barrelling down the line. In fact, they have made a couple of headline announcements recently on this issue: Prime Minister Turnbull promised that that he would halve the price of gas in this country. He said that he could get the price of gas down from $20 a gigajoule to $10 a gigajoule overnight, but he has not done anything concrete to achieve this promise. He has made a lot of hot air but he has done nothing to solve the gas crisis that the government have played a role in contributing to. So while I welcome these one-off energy assistance payments, if the government were really serious about solving the energy crisis and reducing electricity prices they would embrace an EIS and solve the gas crisis. But whilst discussing energy assistance payments provided by the government, I want to note that Labor will still oppose the government's attempts to remove the energy supplement from the most vulnerable Australians. The 2017 budget papers confirm the government's determination to abolish this payment. The Prime Minister and his government are intent on creating a two-tier system for social security payments relating to the age pension. That goes so very much against the fundamental Australian values of equality and a fair go. Creating two classes of age pension is just wrong. Those Liberals and Nationals in this House who will vote for that change should be ashamed. When I speak with pensioners affected by this change I proudly tell them that I and the Labor Party will continue to vote against these cruel cuts to those on fixed incomes. I recently ran a series of budget forums, briefing my constituents about what was in this budget. When I highlighted that the two zombie measures from the 2014 budget that remained in it were, first off, increasing the pension age to 70-the highest in the developed world-and, secondly, creating a two-class pension system, they were aghast. This was not just pensioners who were going to be affected by this change, or potential pensioners, it was existing pensioners, who were horrified that there would be a two-tier pension system. The government has been unable to answer the question about why there should be two classes of pensioners. What will a new pensioner face in terms of reduced electricity prices that an existing pensioner does not face? It is blatantly inequitable and it is blatantly an attack on the universality of our social security system. It breaks that compact that I talked about previously, about providing a dignified retirement for all Australians. Labor will continue to work with pensioner groups and the crossbench to ensure that the government does not prevail with this significant and unfair cut. I dare all coalition members of this House to actually go to their constituencies to explain why there should be a two-tier pension system, why new pensioners should be treated as second-class pensioners and why Australians need to work to the age of 70 to receive a pension. I would submit that the people who support this clearly do not know many manual labourers-or nurses, for that matter. Anyone whose job requires intense physical activity is going to be very unlikely to be able to work until the age of 70. Labor will continue to work with pensioner groups to oppose this. The crossbench should also know that Labor will hold them to account if they side with the government and vote to cut the pension, because the crossbench has a pretty sordid history on these issues. The Greens were the only reason the government got through the reductions in the pension assets threshold. The Greens did a dirty dealMr Perrett: Shame! pensions for 300,000 Australians-and for what? What did they get in return for this sellout of some of the poorest Australians in this country? They got a commitment to an inquiry. That was worth reducing the income of 300,000 Australians and throwing 100,000 Australians off the pension. In speaking on this bill, I also want to draw the attention of the House to the government's disgraceful and shameful record relating to social security payments. In their first budget, the government tried to cut pension indexation and leave pensioners $80 a week poorer. This is from a mob who is currently giving millionaires and big business a tax cut. It clearly identifies who they govern for and the priorities they have. I am proud that we defeated that change. In fact, I am proud that was a key reason the Liberals rolled their Prime Minister and replaced him with the member for Warringah. We will continue to fight for a fair treatment of pensioners. I have already referred to the asset test changes. The government now wants to cut payments to retirees after six weeks of travelling overseas. Surely, elderly Australians who have worked hard and saved are entitled to a holiday. The government has said that their most recent budget is about fairness, but their most senior ministers-the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the finance minister-have all confirmed that the only reason they are not pursuing their draconian cuts to other measures is they cannot pass them in the Senate. Let us be clear on this matter: the Liberals and Nationals still believe in these cruel cuts to the pension, but they have been stifled from enacting them by the Labor Party in the Senate. They have, all of a sudden, discovered the concept of fairness. Australians will not be fooled by the government. They know that this government discovered the concept of fairness through a focus group and that the Labor Party is the only political party that delivers a fair go. In concluding, let me reiterate that I am proud to be a member of a party that supports the pension, that created the pension, that defends the pension, that protects the pension against the inequitable attacks by the coalition. In conclusion, the Labor Party does welcome the government's backdown regarding the pensioner concession card. We will continue to highlight that the government are cutting the pension. They would have made even more severe cuts over the previous years but have been prevented in doing so by the Labor Party. The provision of the age pension and social security payments in general is incredibly important to ordinary Australians. The government just do not understand this.",33,Bills
14,Mr Conroy,"The Greens, shamefully, did a dirty deal with the coalition to cut theI commend the bill to the House. Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017. I commend the member for Shortland for his contribution, even though he has some dubious tastes in football teams! Labor supports this bill. Labor will always support Australians who are doing it tough. But let us be clear about what this bill really is. It is a mere distraction by the Turnbull government-a mere leisure domain. It is a legislative equivalent of smoke and mirrors. It is the sleazy grin of a snake oil salesman while he fleeces you. Most Australian pensioners are too smart to be taken in by this cheap con trick. Prime Minister Turnbull thinks, seriously, that if he gives pensioners a one-off payment of $75 they will not notice him taking $365 a year from them every year. This is a bad late-night TV ad-you know, 'We'll throw in some matching steak knives, but then we're going to bill you 30 bucks a month forever.' This is shear arrogance coming out of Point Piper and shows a Prime Minister who is simply out of touch. Despite what he says, Prime Minister Turnbull has no idea about fairness. He can say the word over and over again but never actually feel it. His focus group research says, 'If you can fake fairness, you'll have it made.' Well, Australian pensioners are on to him. How is it fair to expect that pensioners should be thanking the Prime Minister for giving them a $75 one-off payment while, at the same time, trying to cut the energy supplement, which will leave pensioners $365 worse off every year? That is not fair. It is a shocking way to treat Australians who are already doing it tough. We know that. But we should not be surprised. The Liberals have never ever cared about pensioners. People on the age pension have worked hard all their lives and saved hard. They deserve better from our government. Sadly, they are being treated like beggars in the street-expected to be grateful if the government throws a few coins their way. Pensioners will be worse off under the Turnbull government if this legislation goes through. This one-off $75 payment will go nowhere near making up for the axing of the energy supplement. As I said, that will cost pensioners $365 every year. We know that there is no fat when it comes to pensioners' lifestyle. The pension payment does not allow for a lavish lifestyle at all. It barely covers the necessities of life. I remember doorknocking a couple of pensioners last year in the lead-up to the election. I remember one guy in Tarragindi in particular. He was saying how he only turned his hot water system on every couple of days. Brisbane winters are not the same as Canberra winters; nevertheless, it broke my heart to think that a guy who had worked hard all his life had to make decisions like that. And $365 a year less is an awful lot when you are living that sort of lifestyle on a pension. It can be the difference between being able to have an extra blanket in winter or going cold; the difference between eating a healthy diet of good quality, fresh food or eating the cheap and nasty stuff; the difference between leaving your home or becoming a hermit. Every cent matters to pensioners. Labor understands this. It was Labor who first introduced the pension system into the Australian parliament. There was no social security system in Australia at the beginning of the 20th century. People who needed assistance relied on charitable relief by voluntary organisations-in some cases, with the benefit of government grants. So there was basically no social safety net. The sick poor or neglected children, old people who were destitute and",36,Bills
15,Mr Perrett (Moreton,"Opposition Whip) (10:56): I rise to speak on the Socialwomen who had been deserted or had fallen pregnant were the most in need of the limited charitable assistance. The unemployed were assisted by grants of wages or rations in return for relief work provided by the government of the day. In 1909 it was a Labor government that created our pension system, only eight years after Federation. In June 1908, Labor exercised the power granted to the Commonwealth upon Federation to legislate in respect of age and invalid pensions. Labor introduced means tested, flat rate age and invalid pensions. These new pensions, which were financed from general revenue, came into operation in July 1909 and December 1910 under Andrew Fisher's Labor government. The new pension was paid to men from age 65; it was paid to women from age 60, but not until December 1910. Obviously, there have been many changes in Australia since 1910. The population has expanded. Our standard of living has improved. Our health care has improved-to a large extent, due to another Labor initiative, Medibank, and then Medicare. Our life expectancy has increased: a baby boy born in 1910 had a life expectancy of only 55.2 years, but a baby boy born in 2015 has a life expectancy of 80.4 years and a baby girl even longer. People live longer, and the period of time beyond their working life has increased. It now costs more to sustain a person beyond their working life, and there are many reasons why people have not accumulated enough savings to carry them through. Compulsory superannuation was introduced by the Paul Keating government in July 1992. Prior to that, unless you had an income substantial enough to allow you to create a nest eggand, sadly, there were many people, and families in particular, that could not-you were destined to eventually be on a pension after retirement. It was how the system worked, prior to compulsory superannuation. Every worker paid taxes, and that allowed the government to look after those who could not afford to adequately look after themselves in retirement. People worked hard and saved hard, but that did not always guarantee that they would have enough money to see them through their autumn years when they could no longer work. So that is why Labor introduced compulsory superannuation. The superannuation guarantee system was part of a major reform package addressing Australia's retirement income policies and challenges. Labor, in a visionary way, correctly anticipated that there would be a major demographic shift in the coming decades that would result in an increase in age pension payments and would place an unaffordable strain on the Australian economy-particularly as the baby boomers made that transition. Labor introduced a three-pillars approach: a safety net, consisting of a means tested government age pension system; private savings, generated through compulsory contributions to superannuation; and then voluntary savings, through superannuation and other investments. The superannuation guarantee is a great system, and this nation now has the third-biggest managed fund in the world: $2.2 trillion and rising-not bad for a small nation of only 23 million people. But we need to remember that compulsory superannuation was not available until 1992. So people reaching their current retirement age of 65 this year were already 40 when the superannuation guarantee came in, so half of their working life had already passed. People who are currently receiving the age pension have had even less working life to accumulate superannuation. There are other reasons people may not have been able to accumulate enough superannuation to see them through their retirement years-for example, people may not have had steady employment during their working life; women may have taken time out of the workforce to care for their families and raise children; workers perhaps have been in sectors transformed by the digital revolution and changes in manufacturing and the like. So it is very arrogant of a government to assume that everyone has had the opportunity to accumulate enough superannuation to set up a Cayman Islands account and will be able to live comfortably in retirement. A good government understands this. But most pensioners, including past pensioners, would consider 'living comfortably' as being able to afford safe, secure housing, to eat nutritious food and to occasionally be able to see family and friends. These are things that most Australians would think every person in our lucky country has the right to enjoy, especially after 25 years of uninterrupted growth and economic success. There is absolutely no doubt that the Superannuation Guarantee was a great Labor policy success; it was a solution to a problem that was identified. Through Labor's initiative, Australians have accumulated more than $2.2 trillion-and rising-in superannuation assets. Of course, that balance sheet would look a whole lot better if the Howard government had not abandoned the Keating government's 15 per cent Superannuation Guarantee way back in 1996. That myopic decision has cost the average Australian worker about $250,000 in accumulated superannuation. The government's decision to abandon the previous Labor government's Superannuation Guarantee rise to 12 per cent has further eroded the future retirement savings of Australians. Compulsory superannuation contributions have been frozen by the Abbott-Turnbull government at 9.5 per cent until 2021. The Labor architect of the Superannuation Guarantee, former Prime Minister Paul Keating, has described that decision by the coalition government as representing 'nothing other than the wilful sabotage of the nation's universal savings scheme, and sabotage for reasons only of prejudice'. We can also see it in the coalition's misguided attempts on industry funds, which are outperforming the retail funds; it is certainly very short sighted. The three pillared approach introduced by the Keating Labor government, vandalised by the Howard government and further undermined by the Abbott-Turnbull government is now a very wobbly tripod indeed. By way of confirmation that the Turnbull government is completely out of touch, a government that fundamentally does not understand pensions, it wants to increase the pension age to 70. That might be fine if you are a barrister, but it is a lot tougher if you are a brickies labourer, a nurse or someone who uses their body for lifting and the like. The Finance Minister confirmed in Senate estimates last week that increasing the pension age to 70 is 'a measure they remain committed to'. He said it remained government policy. If that occurs, Australia will have the oldest pension age in the developed world. Builders, tradies, nurses and farmers would have to continue doing what is sometimes backbreaking work until they are 70 before they would be eligible for the age pension. This policy shows a complete disconnect between the government and ordinary working Australians. Sadly, we have seen this before with the Turnbull government. This bill will reinstate the pensioner concession cards to some former pensioners who became ineligible for the cards after the changes to the pension assets test. This will correct what was a bungle by a government who does not understand the pension system and does not fundamentally understand or care about pensioners. Joe Hockey, the former Treasurer, told Australians that 'anyone who currently has a pensioner concession card will continue to receive a concession card that provides the same benefits'. That was a quote from the cigar-smoking Treasurer. Sadly, it was not true; it was a lie. It was up there with the Medicare safety net commitment. Remember that rock-solid, ironclad guarantee given by the former Health Minister Abbott, now the Banquo of the backbench? It was not the truth, according to the former Treasurer. Former pensioners were issued with health care cards and Commonwealth seniors cards, which did not provide the same benefits. Former pensioners were no longer able to access vital government funded hearing services. Former pensioners, who are living on modest means, suffered a cruel blow with the loss of benefits. Finally realising the error of their policy, they have now reinstated those pensioner concession cards to those that ceased to be eligible for those cards. We should be thankful for small mercies, I guess, but it does not change the fact that the Turnbull government does not understand pensions or pensioners, does not care about then and perhaps never has. In 2014 the Liberals tried to cut pension indexation and leave pensioners $80 a week poorer over 10 years. The Liberals tried to reset the deeming rate thresholds. That would have had a devastating impact on half a million part pensioners. The Liberals changed the assets test and almost 100,000 retirees lost their pension and many more had their payments reduced. The Liberals tried to prevent pensioner retirees from travelling overseas for more than six weeks to spend time with their families overseas. The member for Warringah promised in 2013 before the election that there would be no changes to the pension. We could not trust his government then and we still cannot trust the person responsible for the coup that removed that Prime Minister. If the Turnbull government thinks they will get away with it, they will make cuts to the pension in an instant. Pensioners and Labor are awake to them and we will not let pensioners be treated with contempt. Labor understands pensions. Labor fundamentally understands fairness. It is in our DNA. It was Labor that created our pension system in 1909 and built universal superannuation in 1992. Labor has not stopped there. In terms of pension reforms, between September 2009 and 2013 there was an increase in the maximum rate of pension of around $207 per fortnight for singles and $236 per fortnight for couples combined. That was a Labor initiative. It is Labor that will continue to protect retirement income for all Australians and ensure the financial security of older Australians. Labor understands that pensioners have worked hard all their lives and have contributed so much to make this country great. Australian pensioners deserve the dignity of a decent retirement. They do not deserve to be betrayed and made to feel like a burden by the Liberal Party and Prime Minister Turnbull. We have made it clear that Labor will continue to fight for Australian pensioners and oppose any attacks by this uncaring, out of touch government. Moreton in a debate in this chamber. In speaking on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017, can I say to the member for Moreton that I commend him on the speech he has just delivered. I believe he very eloquently outlined the issue in respect of pensioners, the treatment they have received under this government and the very stark difference between the Turnbull government and previous Labor governments. Indeed, no government in recent times has treated pensioners more disgracefully than has the Turnbull-Abbott coalition government since their election in 2013. At that election they made a very clear promise: no cuts to pensions if they were to be elected. Sadly, immediately",37,Bills
16,Mr Zappia (Makin) (11:12,"Once again, it is a pleasure to follow the member forupon being elected, they did the opposite. Indeed, they not only set about cutting the pensions for pensioners but they also set about cutting a whole range of other payments and support measures that were in place that directly affected the income pensioners would have received or the support they were receiving. Pensioners are people who, in many cases, already face considerable hardship. They have no other options in life with respect to raising funds. Many of them are at a stage in their life where they simply cannot do any part-time work if it were able. They simply have no alternative and no choice but to depend on the payments they receive through their pension. These are also people who lived in times that very likely meant they endured hardship and sacrifice to a level current generations simply would never understand-sacrifice and hardship I suspect many cabinet members of this Turnbull coalition government would not understand, because if they did they would not treat them so badly. This is a coalition government that thinks pensioners are easy targets and that perhaps they simply do not understand the impact and the effects of the changes they are making. The reality is that pensioners do understand. They know that they have been gutted and they know exactly when they are losing out as a result of government decisions. I hear it regularly from people I speak to in my electorate, as I am sure every member of this House-including coalition members-must hear as they are out and about speaking to people within their electorates. This legislation is an attempt by the Turnbull government to restore only a fraction of what has been taken from them over the last four years. Doing this will simply not restore the faith of pensioners in the Turnbull government. The Turnbull government is only doing it because it has been pressured into it by the public response, by this side of the parliament and by other MPs on the crossbench that have also been raising the unfairness of this government with respect to pensioners. The legislation does two things: it restores the pensioner concession card, and it provides a one-off $75 payment to single pensioners with energy costs; for couples the payment is $62.50 each. Again, everyone would agree that this is a very meagre amount of money, and it is a one-off payment only. Simultaneously, this government wants to take $365 of ongoing annual payment that pensioners currently receive in the way of energy supplement. That payment will be taken away from new pensioners in the future and, I understand, for any pensioner that started receiving the pension after September 2016. My understanding is that legislation in respect of that was only brought into the House this morning. So again, I say to pensioners that have come on in the last 12 months, if you started receiving your pension in September 2016 expect that under this legislation you will lose the $365 energy supplement and in place you will get a one-off $75 amount. Pensioners can do their sums, and they have. If you go through the measures that this government has brought into this place since coming into office, the attacks on pensioners have been relentless. Firstly, they brought in only at the beginning of this year changes to the pension asset test rules. As a result of those changes, 330,000 pensioners became worse off. 236,000 lost an average of $130 per fortnight and 91,000 lost their pension entirely. That was $190 per fortnight for them on average. For pensioners those amounts of money matter a lot. It makes a difference to the kind of life they can live. The government did this in order to save $2.4 billion over four years. That is $2.4 billion that was taken out of the hands of pensioners in order for the government to try and balance its budget. Whichever way the government wants to spin the issue about the asset test rules, the reality is that that $2.4 billion came directly out of the household budgets of pensioners. The changes at the time also meant that those 91,000, which I now understand is 92,000, that lost their pension altogether in turn lost their pensioner concession card. So for them it was a double hit, because the pensioner concession card also enabled them to access a number of other things they needed in their lives at a reduced rate. So they were hit doubly. The government is now saying that they will restore that-only because, as I said earlier on, of the pressure that has been put on them. Of course Labor will be supporting this legislation, because it does reinstate the pensioner concession card. Whilst the $75, or the $62.50 for each couple, is only a meagre amount, I have no doubt that it will still be money that the pensioners would rather have than not have. I want to talk about the record of this government on pensioners. As I said from the outset, this government has treated the pensioners more disgracefully than any other government in recent times. The measures that this government has brought in, or tried to do, are beyond what I would have thought any fair-minded government would ever have wanted to do. Firstly, they tried to reset the deeming rate threshold, which would have affected the part pension of half a million pensioners across the country. Secondly, they wanted to change the indexation rate. These are matters that the member for Moreton covered in his speech a few minutes ago but I want to reiterate, because when you look at the list it really brings home how harsh this government has been when it comes to pensioners. Then there was the $1.3 billion of cuts to the pensioner concession payments that were being made to the states. The Turnbull and Abbott governments claimed that these were payments that were made by the states, and therefore, it was not a responsibility of the federal government. The reality is that that $1.3 billion had been paid by the Commonwealth government for years and years, and it went directly into the households of pensioners. The states might have picked up the tab, but this was a direct cut to pensioner payments by this government. We then had the asset test and taper rate, which I referred to earlier on, that took $2.4 billion from pensioners. We had the education supplement, where around 41,000 recipients would have been worse off as a result of what this government proposed to do. There is the issue of pensioners going overseas-if they were there for more than six weeks they would have had their pension also cut. If they were a migrant pensioner who did not spend their entire life in this country, the cuts would have been even deeper. But those are not the only things that were going to hit pensioners. We also had the proposal, reaffirmed last week by the finance minister, that the pension age is going to rise to 70. This is not about cutting the pension or cutting the assistance and support payments to the pension-this is about cutting the whole thing. You do not get anything until you reach the age of 70-the highest age in the world for people to receive a pension, and this was the work of the coalition government. It goes further than that, because when we look at other out-of-pocket costs that pensioners have to face on a daily basis, we then come to the issue of health funding in this country. We know that out-of-pocket health and medical costs have risen in recent years since this government came to office, particularly because the government has extended the Medicare rebate freeze. As a result of that, we know that more doctors are charging a co-payment or have increased their co-payment when they see a patient. That has a direct effect on pensioners because, as we also all know, pensioners, because of the stage in their life, are more likely to have to go and see their doctor and, therefore, incur medical costs. So the cuts to health payments by this government have also had a very direct impact on pensionersmore so than on any other sector in the community-and the government would have known that. Again, it just shows the callous disregard that this government has had for pensioners. I now turn to aged-care funding-a sector of funding that, as we all know, pensioners are more likely to be in need of. Whether it is home and community care funding or whether it is the assistance and aged-care packages, it is more likely than not that the person applying for those packages or the home and community care assistance is going to be pensioner. Quite often it is a single pensioner; sometimes it is a pensioner where the spouse is in need of that support. Again, we see billions of dollars cut from those programs. As a result of those cuts, we also know that just getting an aged-care package at the moment is an absolute nightmare. Not only are the packages simply not available, particularly if you need a level 3 or level 4 package-even just getting the assessment has become very difficult. All of this is in order to stall the provision of the support that those packages would otherwise provide. This goes to the heart of the needs of pensioners. I can assure the House that I have had many people talk to me about that issue alone, and they are all pensioners. When they get to a point where they do not get the funding, what do they do? They have to find it one way or another, because it is funding that they absolutely need. They are in a desperate situation, and we have this government cutting their funding and simultaneously cutting the support to them in every other service that they might, in the past, have been receiving support from. Whichever way pensioners turn, the Turnbull government's policies and budget cuts have made their lives more difficult. Pensioners know that, and that is why they have lost faith in the Turnbull government. Not only were they lied to by the coalition in the 2013 election, when they were promised no cuts to pensions; they feel even more cheated when they see $65 billion of tax cuts given to business whilst, simultaneously, they are asked to receive cuts to their weekly income. I particularly focus on the cuts that go to those businesses which turnover more than $50 million per year, and which the government wants to proceed with in respect of the tax cuts that it wants to make for those businesses. Those cuts will amount to some $45 billion over the next decade. Most of that money will probably go to businesses that are based overseas or which have their headquarters overseas and, in fact, to many shareholders who are overseas, so it will not even be circulating in the Australian economy. Contrast that with the money that is being cut to pensioners, which in my view is a false saving by the government. Pensioners, because of their meagre income every week, spend every last dollar in their local community. They keep people employed in the local community and they keep small businesses going in their local community. So most of the money that the government outlays to support pensioners inevitably would be coming back to local communities, supporting them, and through that much of the money would actually be coming back to government because it would save the government other expenditure down the track, whether that is increased unemployment payments that it would have to make or something similar. I started off by talking about the very cruel cuts that are being made to pensioners by this government. These two measures, yes, will be supported by this side of the House. But both fall far short of restoring all of the cuts made by this government. I say to members opposite: pensioners do understand the way they are being treated by this government. They understand it well. I have spoken to them at forums, I have met with them in my office and I have met with them as I am out and around in the community. There is no sector in the community that feels more aggrieved and feels that they have been more harshly treated than do the pensioners I speak to. It is time that this government showed a little respect for them and treated them with the dignity they deserve. age pensioners and around 7,000 people with disability in my electorate who receive a pension. They are deeply concerned about the government's flip-flopping on retirement income policy. Whether they are fullor part-pensioners, or whether they are superannuants, they are looking for certainty, and this Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017 provides none of it. The bill has two schedules. We know that the first schedule is an afterthought and the second schedule is a complete backflip on everything the government has been doing for the last four years. Let's have a look at the first schedule. We know that the schedule, which contains a one-off payment of $75 for age pensioners, is an absolute afterthought. It comes here not on its policy merits but as part of a deal which was put there to try to ease the $64 billion in big business tax cuts through the Senate. We know that they are deeply unpopular. We know that the Senate crossbenchers were not happy about them, because they are underfunded and unaffordable. So this was part of the deal to try to squeeze them through an otherwise reticent Senate. The government hopes that this bill is going to distract pensioners from the cuts to energy supplements that it hopes to smuggle through in the shadow of this legislation, but we are not going to allow it and pensioners are not going to be so easily fooled. Here is why: in 2014 the coalition promised that it would reduce power prices. The only thing that stood between pensioners and lower electricity bills, according to the coalition, was the carbon price. We knew at the time that this was not true, but pensioners now know it is not true and everybody in fact now knows that it is not true, because energy prices have not dropped-they have gone through the roof. Whether it is gas or electricity prices, their mismanagement of the energy market has been an absolute disaster. It has seen prices go up and up and up, with no sign of abating. When the carbon price was removed, the wholesale prices for electricity stood at about $65 or $67 per megawatt hour. Today, do you know what they are, Mr Deputy Speaker Goodenough? They are $134 per megawatt hour on average. That is the average national price. So, instead of going down, they have actually doubled. Against this backdrop you would think a government that was serious about looking after pensioners and people on fixed incomes would be doing something to ensure that we could help people who are struggling to pay their power bills. But instead of this we saw, this very morning, the minister come into this place and introduce legislation that is going to axe the energy supplement for 1.7 million Australians-a payment designed to help vulnerable Australians meet the cost of energy. The bill-a $1 billion cut to new pensioners and people with disabilities, carers and people on Newstart-will see a single pensioner have their pension cut by $14.10 per fortnight, or $365 a year, a cut that was designed by this government and that is going to hurt pensioners.",40,Bills

It is an absolute disgrace, in the same week that they are claiming credit for a once-off payment of $75-this is less than $1.50 a week for pensioners-ripping away $365 for every new pensioner. This is a government that as completely two-faced when it comes to pensions. But I can tell you, the people I represent in this place will be single-minded in their judgement of this government and its pensions policy. It is bad enough for the government to say to people who need help with rising energy costs that they are going to scrap the payments that were designed to assist them to meet those costs. It is bad enough that they are doing that, but it is made doubly worse by the fact that the government's own policies are responsible for sending energy prices through the roof. A few weeks ago the Prime Minister promised that he was going to do something about gas prices, after sitting on his hands for over four years. They have suddenly twigged to the fact that we have a problem with the gas market in this country, which is seeing gas prices go through the roof for both manufacturers and households. The Prime Minister has promised that by July he is going to reduce the wholesale price for gas from $20 a gigajoule to bring us somewhere closer to the long-term average. Well, today industry passed a vote of no confidence in this prediction by the Prime Minister, in strongly worded statements by the manufacturers of this country, led by aluminium, but they are not alone. They have said that they have no faith in this government's ability to meet this objective. Neither do the pensioners, and neither does the Labor opposition, because we have seen them fail through their inattention and inactivity on gas prices, and we have seen them fail through their inactivity and their mismanagement of electricity policy. The lack of a long-term policy for our electricity markets and the ability to send long-term signals has led to an investment strike in new energy production, and it is this that is having a big impact on the high power prices that pensioners and other households are paying today. The second schedule to this bill is an absolute backflip. In 2015 the former Treasurer announced in his budget changes to the income and assets test which would see a large number of pensioners removed from their pension. In an attempt to assuage the inevitable anger that those people who were being knocked off their part pension were going to feel towards the Treasurer, the Treasurer announced in his budget night speech that they would retain access to the pension concession card. We know that this was a lie. We know that this was not true. Labor have been relentless in pursuing the government to ensure that they stood true to the commitment that they gave to pensioners on budget night in 2015. Well, here we are, nearly two years later, and it has taken until now for the government to introduce this legislation, after being chased up hill and down dale by the Labor opposition and supported by those angry pensioners who have lost access and lost faith in this government. Only today have we seen the legislation introduced to the House to make good on a promise that was made two years ago by the former Treasurer. We welcome the fact that the government is finally doing the right thing, after exhausting every other option. There are many in this place who value the important relationship that we have with our pensioners and superannuants. It is why the member for Cunningham and I, together with Labor's candidate for the seat of Gilmore, have organised over the last few months a series of pensioner forums. On7 March in my electorate and in the electorate of Gilmore, we were very happy to host the member for Jagajaga-somebody who is respected across the aisle and around the country for her expertise and long-term commitment in this area. Over 600 pensioners and superannuants attended those forums. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that is a large turnout in any electorate and in anyone's language. They were deeply concerned about the flip-flopping on policy by this government. They were deeply concerned to hear some straight information about what was going on and how they could get some certainty around pension policy in this country. Many issues were raised, such as what was happening with access to the concession card and what was happening to the energy supplementsmatters that are the subject of legislation before the House today-but there were some other issues that they wanted answers on. If you are a part-pensioner then you are acutely interested in the policy around deeming rates. If there is an issue on which the coalition government has been asleep at the wheel, it is deeming rates. There are many Australians who, if they have a mortgage, are enjoying historically low interest rates. We welcome the fact that this is assisting those people who are struggling to meet the cost of their mortgage to have more money in their pocket, because less money is going towards meeting their mortgage payments. But there is a flip side to this coin. If you are a pensioner or a superannuant who is relying on interest on your fixed capital to derive an income then the historically low rates of interest are hitting you hard and making it harder for you to earn the income necessary to meet your weekly expenses. Against this backdrop, you would expect a government that was in tune with the needs of superannuants to be focused on the deeming rates and ensuring that they were relevant with the current rates that were being earned within the investment market. Despite interest rates falling from 2.5 per cent in February 2015 to 1.5 per cent as of 7 March 2017, there has not been an adjustment in the deeming rates. Currently, a single pensioner's savings are deemed at 1.75 per cent on the first $49,200 and any amount over that rate is deemed at a rate of 3.25 per cent. The pensioners and the superannuants that I talk to say, 'If you can find a rate, if you can find a product, if you can find an investment that delivers on that, tell me about it, because there is nowhere in the market that we can get that rate.' There is a call to action for the government to do something about this, to provide some relief to pensioners, part-pensioners and superannuants, because they are struggling to make ends meet. I have stood in this place before and asked the government to revisit its plan to lift the pension retirement age in this country to the highest level in the Western world. We thought that the deep concern within the community was going to have the government rethink its position on this, but we learnt only this week that the government is persisting with its plan to ensure that we lift the pension age to the highest level in the Western world. Well, retiring at age 70 might be realistic if you have done office work or non-manual work for your entire life, but if you have worked with your body, if you have worked in physical labour, if you have worked as a builder, a carpenter, an electrician, a plumber or a labourer, or if you have worked as a nurse or a nurse's aide or a hospital orderly, and you have spent your entire life lifting weights, or being on your knees or working in confined spaces, or if you have worked as a truck driver and you have been responsible for lifting weights at awkward angles, you know that, by the time you are hitting your mid-60s, your back, your knees, your elbows and your skin are starting to give in. So only a person who has worked in an office all their life could say with any sincerity that you can work to the age of 70 and your body is going to hold up. People who have worked in physical labour their whole lives know that that is not true. So again I call on the government to rethink this reckless policy, together with the other areas of their retirement, pension and income policy which are out of tune with the needs of people in my electorate and throughout the Illawarra, the Southern Highlands and the South Coast who are asking for a better deal from the government. They deserve better than the sleight of hand that they are getting through this legislation, this package of bills that is before the parliament today. The coalition have always thought that they could take this constituency for granted. That is no longer the case. Ms O'TOOLE (Herbert) (11:42): I rise in this place to make it very clear that I am appalled at the way the Turnbull government is treating our pensioners and I am proud to support the amendment moved by Jenny Macklin MP. This government's continual attack on pensioners shows just how out of touch they really are with the basic needs of the people in our communities who need the most support. It is also a pleasure for me to follow the member for Whitlam, who has identified very succinctly the plight of pensioners in our community today. The findings of the OECD report Pensions at a glance 2015 show that one-third of pensioners are living below the poverty line. Australia was ranked second-lowest on social equity, with 36 per cent of pensioners living below the poverty line, and, for Australia, this is simply disgraceful and totally unacceptable. Not only is this government now making Australians work until they are 70 years of age, but it has put forward detrimental cuts to pensioners' livelihoods. This will see Australia have the oldest retirement age in the developed world. It is a sad fact that the Turnbull government will give big business a $65 billion tax break whilst making significant, life-altering cuts for pensioners. How out of touch is that! The vast majority of the age pensioners in this country have worked and paid their taxes. They are not 'leaners'. They have earned their pension. They have contributed to our economy and our communities. In the Herbert electorate there are more than 12,000 people who are on the age pension. These pensioners are former teachers, construction workers, secretaries and nurses. These are the people who, during their lifetime, have contributed to the Herbert economy and community, and I intend to stand up for them against this government's cruel cuts. But let us address the elephant in the room in this bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payments and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017: the energy assistance payment. A single pensioner will have a pension cut of $14.10 per fortnight or $365 a year because of the Turnbull government. Couple pensioners will be $21.20 a fortnight worse off, or around $550 a year worse off. If someone, anyone, in the Turnbull government could please explain to me how taking $365 a year from a pensioner and replacing it with a measly one-off payment of $75 does not mean that pensioners will be worse off, I would be truly grateful. Taking $365 per year and giving a one-off payment of $75 simply does not add up and is not a win, in my book, for pensioners. If this is the maths that our Treasurer is doing, it is no wonder that he has put our AAA credit rating at risk and trebled the deficit. A once-off $75 payment is not the same as $365 in assistance every year to help pensioners keep up with the increasing energy and cost-of-living outlays. A one-off $75 payment will never equal an annual $365 payment. This Prime Minister has shown time and time again that he does not even begin to get fairness. This government cannot try shaking your right hand whilst stealing from your left hand-that is just not fair. Yet this government talks about fairness every day. Clearly it just does not understand what the word 'fairness' means. It is absolutely outrageous that this government is desperate to give big business a $65 billion tax cut but cannot even give our pensioners $365 a year to help cover the cost of electricity and the growing cost of living. What is even worse is the fact that the Turnbull government is doing nothing to lower the cost of energy prices in the north. Under the Abbott and Turnbull governments, wholesale electricity prices have doubled across the National Electricity Market. The lack of a clear investment framework for industry to invest in new electricity generation is driving up power prices. The Australian Energy Council has stated that 'the lack of national policy certainty is now the single biggest driver of higher electricity prices'. So not only is the Turnbull government cutting vital assistance to pensioners to pay their electricity bills; it is also driving up the cost of electricity across the country by its inaction. Unfortunately in the Herbert electorate, inaction on electricity prices is nothing new, with this government not matching Labor's commitment of $200 million for a hydro power station on the Burdekin Falls Dam. All of this inaction and cuts just leave our pensioners worse off every day. I challenge the government to meet some of the people they are affecting with these horrible cuts. Marie lives in my electorate of Herbert and is very active in her community. Marie is 70 years old and is still working. She currently works casually as a cook at one of the boarding schools in Townsville. Although Marie does receive the pension, she cannot afford to not work. Marie is forced to pinch pennies just to survive. She has also been a victim of the Centrelink robo-debt, even though her earnings were reported formally to Centrelink every pay day by the HR department in her place of work. Marie also works to help support her daughter, who is currently unemployed due to a workplace accident and is a single mother with a daughter with a disability. Pensioners like Marie will really miss the $365 energy supplement payment, and a one-off $75 payment just will not cut it. Living in regional Queensland can be tough for pensioners who are trying to make ends meet. However, this government should never underestimate the determination and activism of seniors and pensioners. In my electorate of Herbert we have a flash mob called Seniors Creating Change, who are very innovative and active in educating the community and sending clear messages to this government. They use music and songs that they write to get their message out, and they are very popular performers in our community. On 10 June, Seniors Creating Change will celebrate their sixth birthday, and they are supported by the Townsville Community Legal Service. Another issue for pensioners in our community is the price of fuel. It is much higher than the price of fuel in Brisbane. Our electricity costs are more than that of our southern counterparts, and some grocery items are much more expensive. Pensioners like Marie rely heavily on the support provided by the government, which is fair enough, as they have worked all of their lives-and in Marie's case, is still working-paid taxes and contributed to our communities. Surely in their ageing years they deserve to be able to live stress-free and not worry about having enough money to survive day to day and week to week. The energy supplement payment means a lot to pensioners like Marie. It allows them to take a breath and keep their head above water. It is a fair go, a hand up and not a handout. But the Turnbull government makes people like Marie feel ashamed to have something that should be rightfully theirs. Australian pensioners deserve better than this. The Prime Minister cannot get away with this. He will not get away with pulling the wool over the eyes of age pensioners and hard working Australians. The Prime Minister does not seem to care about our pensioners. If he really cared about fairness, he would support vulnerable Australians to make ends meet and he would not be trying to abolish the energy supplement payment. I am proud to stand with my Labor colleagues, and I would like to particularly mention the advocacy efforts of the honourable Jenny Macklin. Labor will once again oppose the government's attempts to remove the energy supplement payment for our pensioners, and Labor will once again take up the charge to fight for our pensioners. Then we have the pensioner concession card. The coalition's disastrous handling of the pensioner concession card has effectively delivered a health cut for many pensioners. Joe Hockey, the then Treasurer, promised Australians that nobody would lose their concession entitlements. The reality is that people did. The coalition government misled the Australian people, and as a result many pensioners have gone without. He said that anyone who currently has a pensioner concession card would continue to receive a concession card that provides the same benefits. Instead, former pensioners were issued with health care cards and Commonwealth seniors cards, which did not provide the same benefits. Many pensioners without a pensioner concession card were not able to access vital government-funded hearing services, and from state to state different concessions were applied. The loss of the pensioner concession card was a cruel double blow to many former pensioners with modest incomes. After Labor had to drag this government kicking and screaming, and after Australian pensioners had to fight for something that was rightfully theirs, the Turnbull government have heard our call and are finally attempting to right the wrong they created. However, the damage is done. Pensioners can see through this cellophane Turnbull government and know that this government cannot be trusted to protect their pensions. This government must think that Australians have a very short and poor memory. We remember 2014, when this government tried to cut pension indexation and leave pensioners $80 dollars a week poorer over 10 years. We remember when the Liberals tried to reset the deeming rate thresholds, changes that would have negatively impacted half a million part pensioners. Who could forget when the assets test changed and the goalposts were shifted on hundreds of thousands of pensioners who had carefully planned for their retirement. Almost 100,000 retirees lost their pension and many more had their payments reduced. Heaven forbid that a retiree would dare aspire to travel overseas-if Malcolm Turnbull had his way, after six weeks overseas pensioners' payments would be cut off. It would be even worse for migrant pensioners. If you are a pensioner who was not born in Australia and you wanted to visit family and friends overseas, your pension would be reduced in line with the time you have lived in Australia, as though your contribution was simply worthless. They say these cuts have gone for good, but, as usual, pensioners cannot trust this government. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Services have all said that the only reason these cuts are not in the budget is because they cannot get through the Senate. This government still believes that making life harder for hard working Australians is fair and reasonable. These cuts are not gone. The Prime Minister is just waiting for an opportunity to resurrect them. In 2013, Tony Abbott promised no changes to the pension. They could not be trusted then and they cannot be trusted now. The Prime Minister is holding onto the member for Warringah's plan to increase the pension age to 70. Australians will have to work longer than anybody else anywhere in the world, as I have said. That is not a dream-that is called a nightmare. The Turnbull government is weak when it comes to delivering for our pensioners. The Hon. Christian Porter should be ashamed. As elected representatives, we should be looking after all Australians and not just those with big pockets and big bank accounts. Big business does not need our help. Our pensioners have paid more tax than a lot of tax dodging big businesses. Pensioners deserve and need our help. I will continue to stand up for those who cannot advocate for themselves and I will fight to ensure that pensioners get a fair go, because that is the Australian way. Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro) (11:54): I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017. I would like to reflect on quite an amazing history. We talked the other night about the education policy of the present government and the Orwellian nightmare we have been traversing. The issue of pensions is one that also illustrates that incredible story. Really, I think that nothing illustrates more the government's unfairness in its approach to budget measures than the history we have seen in relation to pensions. Again, if we hark back to those promises that were made before the 2013 election, they were that there would be no changes to pensions, let alone cuts-no changes whatsoever. Then what we saw in that 2014 budget was an incredibly brutal attack on those pensions. I think the area of those pension cuts that concerned me the most related to, in particular, the attempts to cut veterans' pensions and support for war widows and for war orphans. Of course, this was following the Labor record in government of actually taking pensions to historic levels-historic improvements-and introducing new measures to better reflect the support that pensioners of all kinds needed. In particular, there was the introduction of one new indexation mechanism known as the pensioners and beneficiaries cost of living index. We know that CPI did not necessarily reflect the true costs of living. You cannot eat a plasma television even if the price of those TVs come down. That is not something that is relevant to the day-to-day survival of a pensioner. And so this PBCLI was a very important mechanism to reflect the true cost of living for a pensioner. What does it cost to actually put food on the table or to use electricity, petrol and other basic services and charges? The stripping away of all those efforts by Labor really set back the cause of providing for citizens in the context of a period of time where we had seen the cost of living become a major problem for lowand middle-income earners and pensioners in Australia. It effectively doubled. We saw articles in the media today reflecting on the doubling of cost-of-living issues and the essential elements for maintaining life. This 2014 attempt to wind back these pensions, in particular in the veterans' area, caused a storm of protest in the veterans' community, as it rightly should. One article at the time in relation to those cost-cutting exercises was very illustrative of this. It was an article by Heath Aston in April 2015, as the full impact of these cuts were starting to be felt. Of course, the Abbott government was refusing to release documents which fully explained and elucidated on these things, but we knew that those changes were going to affect something like 300,000 military veterans and their spouses. The decision in the budget papers at that time was forecast to cut $65.1 million from veterans and widows when it was to take effect in 2017, and those effects were to compound year-on-year. The government at that time also announced that it was scrapping the $800-ayear seniors supplement that Labor created and which was accessed by an estimated 29,000 veterans and their families. It was to help pay for energy, telephone and internet bills, council rates and the like. One particularly bitter veteran, Bob Whinnen, a South Australian truck driver who fought in Vietnam, said that conscripts like him were never able to fulfil their full potential in civilian life. His quote in that article was: We were conscripted by a Liberal-National Coalition government and they sent us there grossly illequipped with World War II arms. The North Vietnamese were cutting the grass with their machine guns. Now another Coalition government does this to us. So there was a great deal of resentment and disgust at what was happening to our war widows, war orphans and veterans at that time. The Defence Force Welfare Association and the ADSO really importuned the then Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, to have a closer look at what he was doing there and to realise the folly of his ways. I am proud of the effort that the Labor Party and the crossbenchers put in to defeat the worse aspects of what was being attempted then. Of course, that then folded over into defending Defence Force wages. At the same time as we saw that happen in the 2014 budget, later the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal effectively attempted to cut Defence Force pay and conditions. That was received with equal horror. Again, that battle was entered into by Labor and crossbenchers and we were able to achieve some relenting of that vicious attack. But we still did not achieve Labor's three per cent wage rises for Defence Force personnel. That was a shocking situation and now, again, we are now seeing in this attempt to wind back the support for the energy supplement for our seniors a repetition of that, because it will apply across the board to all these pension and support recipients. What a cynical move it is to say they are going to give them $75 in 'go-away money' in exchange for the $375 a year that they were going to get. What we see in that is a classic illustration of how this government has approached its time-the policy confusion over these last four years. Effectively, they begin by taking four wheels off your car and then give you one back and then ask you to congratulate them and tell them what a great job they have done. We are seeing that in the schools debate-they rip all that money out and then try and put some back in and say it is all good. We have seen that in so many policy areas this government has pursued. Really, the public are not going to cop this kind of con anymore. In this respect, it is an insult to say they will give $75 and that is it. It is a recognition that the cost-of-living pressures are real, that these energy cost increases are real, but at the same time it is saying that is all you get and you will have to make that $75 stretch for the rest of your life. That brings us back to the government's heinous attempt to blame the carbon tax and renewable energy for these cost-of-living increases in the energy sector. You will recall that the so-called carbon tax was the source of all evil for costs on pensioners and lowand middle-income earners. That denied the truth of the situation at the time, which was that, firstly, Labor introduced a support mechanism that completely dealt with any impacts arising out of the introduction of our carbon pricing scheme. The truth of that situation-and it is the truth now-is that the increase in electricity costs is being generated by so many other aspects. In particular, there was a wide-ranging upgrade of the poles and wires in New South Wales. Massive cost increases were introduced into the system through that process. Privatisation was also a factor in that. Sharon Beder, from the University of Wollongong, in a paper that she wrote in 2013, concluded: The real cause of electricity price increases in eastern Australia have been: firstly the introduction of a national electricity market and the consequent price manipulation by electricity generators; secondly the shifting of risk arising from market price volatility from electricity retailers to ratepayers; and finally, the introduction of a pricing formula for electricity distribution companies which replaces investment decisions based on need and forward planning with those based on maximising rate of return. Further privatisation or deregulation is therefore a solution likely to exacerbate the problem rather solve it. These are the sorts of things that my friends in the Electrical Trades Union and others have warned about. There will be issues for national security, the cost of electricity down the track and the reliability of the service provided. And boy, haven't we seen that played out! All of the reports that have been done since the Prime Minister's attempts to blame it on renewable energy or the heat in South Australia have been shown to be complete fallacy. Effectively, if it had not been for the investment that we saw in renewable energy, there would have been much greater impact on consumer prices because of the system capacity that is disappearing as our fossil fuel generated energy sources decline. The simple commercial reality is that noone is going to invest in new coal-fired power generation. The decision to shut Hazlewood was a commercial decision made by companies in France and Japan based on a simple commercial analysis. If you were going to build new coal-fired power stations now, that would simply add even more to the consumer cost impact of electricity prices. At the same time, we know that investment in renewables is an investment in long-term cheaper electricity. You can see the logic of that. For coal-fired power, you have to have a huge open-cut or subsurface coalmine and there is the effort to extract the coal, and then it has to be transported to a massive coal-fired power station, the coal has to be burnt to produce steam and then the electricity has to be generated. If you put up a wind turbine, it takes advantage of a free resource-the wind that is blowing-and a solar farm takes advantage of the free resource of the sun. When you achieve the strategic weight of that renewable energy investment, that renewable energy sector, you will see that there will over time be a significant reduction in cost provided it is all put in the context of a well-managed transition plan and a plan to manage the grid. The most heinous impact of the failure of government policy in this area is that that transition and that management of the grid has just not happened. In the context of what is a national situation and a national energy electricity market, it was the federal government's responsibility to put in place a plan to take charge of the transition and the management of the grid. We have seen nothing happen in four years, and as a consequence the current situation has unfolded and we see impacts on consumer prices as a result. In countries where they have got this right-Denmark, for example-they are already withdrawing subsidies from the renewable energy sector because it is now well and truly standing on its own two feet and undercutting fossil fuel sources. We have also seen in our country, apart from the gaming of the system by private operators, the impact of gas policy. The government has failed to adopt national interest tests up until now in relation to gas, and that has created a massive problem. Without moving rapidly to even greater sources of renewable energy, energy markets have to fall back on gas as the transition fuel, as the mechanism with which to manage peaks. The situation that has evolved in relation to gas exports has had a massive impact on the domestic price of gas. The interests of ordinary Australians have been sold out by governments that have been prepared in this country at state and federal levels to sacrifice consumers' interests for the export buck when at the same time in those early days we seemed to be getting nothing back from exports because of the concessions that were made to them. Obviously a number of factors have caused these price increases, but what we know is that they are going to continue in the short term. There have been forecasts of price rises increasing by another 40 per cent or so in time to come. The government have completely disregarded all the best advice that could be offered to them on how to achieve efficiency in the energy market-advice from, initially, Mr Shergold, the Productivity Commission, the OECD and the IMF. They did not follow the example of Conservative colleagues in the UK, Germany and New Zealand, and they were not prepared to get involved in energy markets with China, Japan, South Korea, California, Canada, Europe et cetera. We are going to see price rises because they are ignoring the advice of all of these bodies, including the Young Nationals, the National Farmers Federation, all of business, the energy market operators and time again that an emissions intensity scheme not only is going to be the way to achieve our outcomes here but also will reduce the impact for consumers, and it is the most cost-effective way to do that and to transition effectively to a decarbonised energy generation sector. It is time the government woke up to that and did not make pensioners pay the price for their bad policy Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017. The bill has two purposes: firstly, in providing a one-off energy assistance payment, which will apply to nearly four million pensioners; secondly, in reinstating the pensioner concession card, which I understand will be provided to some 92,000 people who, since 1 January this year, have no longer been eligible for the pensioner concession card due to the changing of the assets test. Let there be no doubt that we will support this bill because we are committed to supporting the most vulnerable and most disadvantaged in the community. That is not exactly why the government is doing this, by the way, but I will come to that. Labor will always move to hold the government to account. We will not let the government get away with the savage and unfair cuts to Australian pensioners. We will not let the",44,Bills

19,Mr Hayes (Fowler,"Chief Opposition Whip) (12:09): I also seek to speak on the Socialgovernment fool everyday Australians into thinking that they care about pensioners. History has shown us differently. Time and time again, we have seen what the Liberals do in terms of the notion of fairness. The fairness certainly does not ring true in this current budget. If you go back into the last four budgets, you can also see that one constant theme was they could retrieve money from some of the most vulnerable in our community. Some of the most vulnerable people are our age pensioners who rely on disability support. The past four budgets of the Abbott-Turnbull government have certainly been a classic example of that. Many of the measures did not get through the Senate, but they were still there. They were referred to as the 'zombie measures'. Bear in mind that in 2013 when the member for Warringah, Tony Abbott, was leader of the coalition, he went to the election promising that there would be no changes that would impact on pensioners. In their very first budget after they formed government, the 2014 budget had limitations put on the indexation that would be applied to pensions. They moved straight away to impact the cuts on pensioners. They moved straight away to take the energy supplement off pensioners and people that were living on disability support pensions and people on Newstart. Simply because this bill comes to us today and says that there is some additional money being put out to pensioners, it does not mean that they have changed their spots on this. They have not changed at all when it comes to addressing the issue of fairness and decency for some of those who are the most vulnerable people in our community. Bear in mind, this government, as it stands now, is wedded to a retirement age of 70 before people can receive the old age pension. That, by the way, will be the oldest retirement age in the developed world for receiving a state-funded pension for retirement. I would like to think that members opposite might reflect on this a little. I know many of them are a lot younger than 70 years of age, but, perhaps, some of them speak to their parents. Do they really think that they can expect people to work-and some of those people are going to be without assets and are going to be working in construction and other labouring-based industries-until they are 70 before they can attract a pension? I know that the people I used to represent before coming into parliament, the police officers of the country, have all assured me that they would not want to be out on trucks wrestling drunks and out at pubs, and things like that, at 70 years of age. These people opposite just do not get that. There has to be fairness and decency in the way that we treat people in our community. Simply trying to jack up retirement age is not one of the ways to do that, particularly when they have a view that, whilst they cannot find money to treat pensioners fairly and they cannot find the money to support the indexation of pensions, they can find $65 billion for tax cuts to big businessmany of which will be multinationals, so the profits will go offshore. They can do that okay but fail to actually look after the vulnerable in our community. We on this side of the House will never walk away from people who do not have a large voice or footprint in terms of what they can and cannot demand. We will always speak up for them. We will be the ones always fighting to make sure that they get a fair deal. In schedule 1 of the bill the government are offering a one-off energy assistance to pensioners of $75. About four million pensioners that will get that. But do not forget that the government also have a plan to actually take away from pensioners the energy assistance supplement of $365 that applies each year. These pensioners are already receiving that. That is going to be taken away and they are going to be given $75. As the member for Eden Monaro said, it is like having someone take four tyres off your car and then give one back and expect to get a pat on the back for being generous. The government are physically taking that money away and simply saying, 'Because we're going to give them $75 that should make a difference.' Bear in mind that this is an energy assistance payment. It has been very quiet from many of those who ranted and raved on that side of the House in the last term of the government about energy prices going up. I cannot speak for everyone, but I know in New South Wales energy prices just about doubled. The fact that they have doubled means that everyone is having to dig a bit deeper to pay for their energy costs. But people that are pensioners cannot decide to just go and work another shift, get some overtime or take on a casual job to make up the difference. People who are on an age pension do not get those opportunities. The energy supplement of $365 a year was there to help make up that difference, and that is now being taken away. As I said, we will not oppose the bill because it is going to put money out therethe $75 payment-but we will certainly move to resist those other aspects trying to restrict the ongoing energy supplement of $365 a year being paid to pensioners in this country. OftenI wonder about the government and the way they reflect on some of the most vulnerable in the community. To be quite honest about it, it is not that the pensioners are all going to get together and outvote them; pensioners probably do not have that sort of political power. It is not that they are going to have placards in front of the member for Wentworth's office, because that is probably not what pensioners do. People who have made a lifetime of contribution to this country are entitled to be treated fairly and decently. We only have to look back to 2013, when those who formed this government said there would be no change to issues such as pensions, education and health. Just look to see what they have done in their time in government. They have moved on each and every one of those areas. They have moved to make those changes. They have moved to make cuts and to make it more difficult for the vulnerable in our community to live. The other aspect of this bill seeks to perform a well overdue backflip. It is going to actually return the pensioner concession card to people who did have it but, due to a change to the asset test, became ineligible for that pensioner concession card on 1 January this year. It is a much overdue backflip. It is trying to right a wrong they created. This is another broken promise by this government. The former Treasurer, Joe Hockey, who was the member for North Sydney, when he stood up and spoke in this parliament made it very clear: … anyone who currently has a Pensioner Concession Card will continue to receive a concession card that provides the same benefits … Clearly that just did not happen, because it is changed, so we have this backflip occurring now. They are trying to, again, say that they are being magnanimous to the pensioners out there, that they are doing something for them. What they are not saying is that they are correcting something that they created, and that is the asset test that made these people ineligible to hold the card they once held. There is the temptation to come into the parliament and talk just about the theory of these things. But those of us who actually get out and among the community, who actually talk to real people, really start to see how it impacts. One of my constituents visited my office about this. Marian Parkin came to see me about what this would mean to her. She is one of those 92,000 people who lost their pensioner concession card. As she said, she and her husband relied on the card heavily. It got them through the hardships of daily life. For example, she indicated to me that prior to losing the pensioner card she would receive water bills of about $88 a year in Sydney. I suppose for a pensioner that is about average. But now those water bills, without any increase in her and her husband's use of water, are just a little under $300 a year. So, her position is being further impacted. It certainly does not help when the government takes away these concessions and then expects people who have no ability to raise additional income, other than borrowing from family members, to just meet the rising costs of living. This may not mean much to those sitting opposite, but elderly Australians deserve to see that they will be treated with fairness and decency, whichever government is in power. Part of the reason for pulling this back in the first place was to make good on a promise to give a $65 billion tax cut. That certainly does not go down well with pensioners, the people who are on fixed incomes or the working families out there. People think that first and foremost we look after our own. We know that a majority of the tax cut is going to multinational companies and will find its way overseas. I think countries like Australia are in a very good place. We know that countries like Australia are sought-after investment destinations. Yet we are depriving our own. We cannot find the money to look after schools. We cannot find the money to keep our health system free of Medicare cuts. And we cannot find the money to treat pensioners with fairness and decency. But we can, as of 1 July this year, ensure that anyone who is earning $1 million a year will get a tax cut in the vicinity of $16½ thousand-while everyone else, by the way, will have a tax increase, and the government will pursue its endeavour of giving big business a tax cut of $65 billion. This is a government that has misled vulnerable Australians from time to time. Right from the election in 2013, this government has promised that there will be no changes to the pension. But, despite the promise, after six months of being in government, it moved to cut pensions as quickly as it could. It falls to us to actually stand up for those who do not have a strong voice in our community. (Time expired) contributions of senior Australians to our country. There is no doubt that we live in the best country in the world. It is a fantastic country. People from all over the world want to come and live here. Part of that is what senior Australians have left us. For many generations before us and the current generation of seniors who are self-funded retirees and pensioners, their work, their contribution through volunteering and their involvement in the community have made Australia the great country that it is. The Turnbull government recognises that, and I am proud to be part of a government that does. I am also be proud to be part of a government that backs the families of those seniors. The government recognises and is working to make sure that they get the most out of every dollar that they earn. I am proud to be part of a government that supports the vulnerable and casts a secure net under Australians who find themselves falling on hard times. I am proud to be part of a government that has enormous respect for our veterans, those who have been prepared to pay with their lives so that we all may be free. I am particularly proud to be able to rise to speak today on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017. That is because the bill provides a one-off energy assistance payment to recipients of the age pension,",53,Bills
20,Mr Howarth (Petrie) (12:24,"I am proud to be part of a government that values thethe disability support pension, the parenting payment single and certain veterans' payments. Approximately 3.8 million people will benefit, which is great news. In addition to providing energy assistance payments, the bill will provide a pensioner concession card to former social security pensioners and receivers of veterans' payments cancelled with the rebalancing of the pension assets test by Social Services Legislation Amendment Act 2015. This is important because the coalition has been listening to people in their electorates, and that is why this card is being restored. As a result of losing their concession card, former pensioners also lost access to hearing services from the Department of Health as well as access to some state and local government and private enterprise concessions outside the Commonwealth jurisdiction. It could have been Brisbane City Council rates or Moreton Bay Regional Council rates, or it might have been car registration. So this change to restore the card and this one-off energy supplement are very important. I am proud to say that we are listening to the people in our electorates, as is the minister, and I very much support this bill. But I have to say that this amendment from Labor is a bit rich, particularly coming from the member for Jagajaga. Australians know that Labor cannot be trusted with energy prices. Labor cannot be trusted when it comes to balancing the budget, and they flip-flop on all sorts of different issues, which I would just like to highlight. We will hear the member for Jagajaga come in and sum up in a minute and talk about how terrible we are, but you know what? The people in my electorate know that the member for Jagajaga brought in the world's largest carbon tax, which I was elected under in 2013 and we said we would scrap. They also know that the members for Moreton, Whitlam, Eden-Monaro and Fowler also voted for that carbon tax. They all voted for it, every one of them sitting over there that get up and speak on this bill. The words that come out of their mouths in relation to energy prices are absolutely hypocritical. They brought in the biggest carbon tax on the back of their Prime Minister Gillard at the time saying, 'There will be no carbon tax under any government that I lead.' Do you think Australians have forgotten that? I do not think so. Not in my electorate, because every pensioner that went down to the RSL for a meal got hit with the carbon tax. Refrigeration prices, gas prices, all of this that the poor old RSL had to pay, and at the local pub where they went for a counter meal, the pensioners got hit with, and hit with hard. They were hit really hard. I remember the Bracken Ridge Tavern in my electorate in 2013 telling me that they had a bloody carbon tax bill-excuse me, Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw that comment-of $120,000 a year. And do you think that is not passed on to pensioners when they go down to eat? They want to talk about a supplement, a lousy 365 bucks a year that they gave, because people's electricity bills went up by 50 per cent. So their home electricity bill went through the roof, they got hit with it down at the local pub as well, or the RSL, for a counter meal. And, somehow, they are sticking up for pensioners? Australians have not forgotten. We will keep reminding them, no doubt about that. We also have Labor's ridiculous renewable energy policy of 50 per cent by 2030, where we are seeing a rush to renewables. It is so much so that in states like South Australia they are having problems with supply. If you get onto the NEM-the National Electricity Marketyou will see that often South Australia is paying a lot more than other states, like Queensland, when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining. Once again, that is a Labor policy. And it is not only federal Labor policy. The Palaszczuk government in Queensland, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, has the same policy. It is going to see energy costs skyrocket even more. So we will not take lectures from those opposite and the member for Jagajaga when it comes to electricity prices. The Labor Party flip-flops on so many different items, including under the leadership of Bill Shorten. That man cannot be trusted with the prime ministership of this country. When you look at what he says in relation to the NDIS, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which needs to be properly funded, one minute he thinks it is great to raise the Medicare levy and then he says he is going to vote against it! Now he says he is going to vote against it! Mrs Sudmalis: Shame! her. One minute they are saying that needs based school funding is important and that they give a Gonski and everything, and then when Mr Gonski himself comes out with the Prime Minister and Minister Birmingham in relation to $18 billion worth of increases for schools, what do Labor do? They vote against it, because they said that it is not enough. They cannot fund a single thing. Everyone knows that the Labor Party cannot balance the budget. The young people up in the gallery know that. That is the reason why this young generation is going to be stuck with higher taxes for generations to come, because that mob over there racked up deficits after Kevin Rudd got in and said that he was an economic conservative. My 15-year-old son could spend more than what he earns, if he were able to. It does not take a genius to come into this place and say: 'I'm going to spend more than what I have: There's a GFC-quick, that's a good excuse to rack it up. Let's rack it up. Let's give away school halls, let's give away pink batts and let's give away all the other stuff. And, while we're at it, let's whack a carbon tax on to keep the votes for the Greens on side. That's going to push up energy bills for pensioners.' This is the modern-day Labor Party. One minute we get the member for Lilley, as Treasurer, saying that he was going to fight tooth and nail for company tax reductions. That is what he said, and the Leader of the Opposition said the same thing, 'Were going to fight for this; it's going to be great for jobs and great for small business.' Now, it is a $65 billion tax cut. SoI ask the young people in the gallery and those people reading this speech at home that when we talk about company tax reductions, do you think that the government just likes to give away tax? Do you think that somehow we like to come in here and say, 'Here you go, let's hand over a bit of extra tax.' I do not think so. There is a reason for it. It supports our plan for jobs and growth, a plan that those people over there do not have. They have no plan for jobs and growth. We have a plan that will help young people to secure a job well into the future. But I will not go off on that. I am just highlighting to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the people in my constituency, the hypocrisy of Labor and their flip-flopping on all sorts of issues. This includes more affordable child care. We all know that parents who are wanting to get back to work are getting hit with big excesses in child care after nine months. Those over the voted against it. And there is balancing the budget. Please, as I said before, we know that every time they run a deficit. Last time, not only did they rack up billions of dollars' worth of debt-what if",56,Bills
21,Mr Howarth,"The member for Gilmore is right when she says, 'Shame!' I agree withour senators had not been in the Senate to make savings?-but they went into the 2016 election promising an extra $16 billion in debt, and the member for McMahon said that somehow they were going to magically balance the budget at the same time. They were going to rack up $16 billion in debt that every single person in the public gallery would have to pay for through higher taxes because of accumulating debt each year. Every single person would pay for that and every business would get hit with it. And then, when you went to buy something at a business, whether it was a bed from Harvey Norman, a counter meal at the local pub or a holiday, you would get hit with increased cost. You would get hit with increased cost, because the Labor Party thinks that businesses are cash cows. The reason we support lowering company tax is that we want to be competitive worldwide, and we know that, as the member for Lilley said-and he fought tooth and nail for it when he was Treasurer-it helps jobs. I want to thank the crossbenchers for voting to support small business and medium businesses up to $50 million and giving them a company tax reduction. I will not thank the member opposite who was once the small business minister in 2013. He came up to my electorate in 2013 and spoke at the chamber of commerce and spoke about how good they were for small business! Give me a break, please! He upped the carbon tax. But let me get on to state Labor. Let me get on to the Palaszczuk government, because probably everyone who is my age or above in Queensland will remember the blackouts we had in 2004. Basically, in Queensland, ever since Joh left, back in '87, we had not had any investment in our electricity system by Labor premiers. Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, you would remember that, in 2004, we had a lot of blackouts. honourable member for Fenner? Dr Leigh: Mr Deputy Speaker, I am usually loathe to interrupt my colleagues in full flight, but when they talk about the history of the Bjelke-Petersen state government, it might be the moment to draw them back to the subject of the bill. been no investment in electricity by state Labor since the National Party left in 1987. Dr Leigh: What has that got to do with the social services bill? jumping in at the end of the conversation. ranging debate. are happy for energy prices to go up. But state Labor borrowed billions of dollars. If there are any Queenslanders here, do you know what they are doing now? Do you know what the Palaszczuk government are doing? They owe $80 billion in Queensland, and they are getting billions of that money and they are putting it on to Energy Queensland, which is a merger of Energex and Ergon; they are putting it onto CS Energy, which is a generator in Queensland, and Stanwell, which is a generator-all state-government-owned assets-and they are saying, 'We don't owe any money.

27,Mr Howarth,"You are happy for energy pricing to go up for pensioners, right? Youto the energy generators and distributors.' And this mob here wonder why energy prices are going up! We have just had state Labor, the Palaszczuk government, offload some $10 billion worth of their debt onto their own energy providers. They moved billions of dollars. They also gold-plated poles and wires. So the Australian public know that these two members over here-I cannot blame the guy from Tassie up the back; he has only just come in-along with everyone else, voted for the carbon tax. And now they come in here and try to tell us that we are not doing enough to help pensioners with energy pricing. I would like to quote the minister here. He said this morning: The government will continue to prioritise energy security and affordability. The 2017-18 budget includes a $265 million energy package that will ensure Australia maintains a secure, reliable and competitive energy system into the future. Amongst a range of measures, it provides funding to expand gas supply, makes finance available to build a solar thermal plant and provides additional funding for the Australian Energy Regulator to scrutinise energy providers to ensure they are serving consumers' needs. He also spoke about Prime Minister Turnbull's plan for Snowy 2.0, which is a great plan that he is acting on, that he is implementing, that he has made a decision on, to help with our energy supply, which is very, very important. The minister also spoke about gas-fired generation, saying how it is an important part of our electricity system and saying that the higher the price of gas the higher the price of electricity, and calling on the state governments, particularly Victoria's, to lift the moratoriums to allow for more supply of gas, so that pensioners are not getting hit with higher gas prices. The Australian public are awake up to Labor; they are right onto them. They know that Labor cannot balance the budget and that, every time they cannot, that pushes up the cost for people. They know that Labor cannot be trusted but the coalition can. for their contributions, particularly the member who has just spoken for his excellent contribution to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017. Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, as you are aware, the bill provides for a one-off energy assistance payment to welfare recipients who have a limited ability to earn additional income, and the bill reinstates the pensioner concession card to more than 92,000 former pensioners who ceased being eligible for a pension on 1 January 2017 due to the rebalancing of the pension assets test. So the bill provides for a one-off energy assistance payment to recipients of the age pension, disability support pension, parenting payment single, and veterans and their partners paid the service pension, the income support supplement or relevant compensation payments who are eligible for payment and residing in Australia on 20 June 2017, the test date. This payment is to assist them with their energy costs. The energy assistance payment will be $75 for singles and $62.50 for each member of a couple and will provide additional assistance to individuals, totalling 3.8 million Australians. The bill will also reinstate the pensioner concession card to about 92,300 former pension recipients. These former pensioners lost their entitlement to the pensioner concession card when they ceased being eligible for the pension on 1 January 2017 due to the rebalancing of the pension assets test. They will once again be eligible for the card. To maintain their current benefits, those former pensioners issued with a Commonwealth seniors health card will also",59,Bills
28,Mr Porter (Pearce,"Minister for Social Services) (12:39): I thank all of the membersretain that card. As the pensioner concession card provides all the benefits of the healthcare card, the healthcare card will become redundant and will be deactivated for those former pensioners issued with a healthcare card on 1 January 2017 due to the rebalancing of the pension assets test. I might note here in closing that, in response to the amendment to this bill moved by the member for Jagajaga, it will probably not come as a surprise to members opposite that I can confirm the government will not be supporting that amendment. I would also note that that amendment is in effect something of a protest. Despite the protests of members opposite, when they delivered their election costings to the Australian people at the last election, the absolute fact is that they failed to reverse and thereby adopted the exact measures that they now continually protest. So we can be absolutely clear as a matter of fact that Labor adopted the rebalancing of the pension assets test. They adopted the measure, they took the savings and they spent the savings. We can confirm, to be absolutely clear, that Labor adopted changes to the schoolkids bonus. They took those savings, they banked those savings and they spent those saving. We can also be absolutely clear that, at the 2016 election-in the election policy that they took to the Australian people and that the Australian people took in good faith-they adopted ending the carbon tax compensation for new entrants to the welfare system-that is, they adopted our position, which is to end compensation for a tax that no longer exists. It does take, I think, a very thorough-going devotion to fantasy when you can both oppose and support a measure all at the same time-but that is a devotion to fantasy that is being repeated with great regularity. Members opposite with respect to the NDIS funding gap claim to be able to spend savings three times. For years members opposite have said that they want simpler, more affordable child care, and then they voted against it. For years members opposite have said that they support needs based school funding, but now they intend to vote against it. For years they have said that they fully support the NDIS, but now they oppose the very mechanism that they have always suggested is the fairest way to fully fund the NDIS. SoI would encourage those opposite to be, at the very least, up-front, genuine and transparent with the Australian people. It is an untenable position to take to an election, a full general election, the adoption of a savings measure and then continually try and convince the Australian people that you are in actual fact opposing it. Where measures have been supported at an election they should be supported when the government moves those measures in parliament. These measures are designed to improve the sustainability of the welfare system, which is no doubt why they were agreed to by members opposite at the 2016 election. The coalition says what it will do. We are transparent. We are open. We take challenging and difficult decisions in the broader interests of the Australian people, and it is these decisions that are allowing us to plot a real and consistent path back to surplus. In closing, the bill acts on the government's commitments outlined in the 2017-18 budget. I commend the bill to the House. read a second time.

Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation For Small Business Entities) Bill 2017 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Dr LEIGH (Fenner) (12:46): In 1936, John Maynard Keynes published The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, and one of the key insights of that book was to draw a distinction between the short run and the long run. In the short run, Keynes pointed out that it was important to have policies that would get the economy out of a temporary slump, such as that the world was in the mid-1930s. It could either be monetary policy or fiscal policy, but where it was fiscal policy he urged that it might be important to put in place temporary measures that encouraged businesses to invest over the short term to get the economy out of a hole. Keynes distinguished this from measures that might be put in place to boost long-run aggregate demand. Those measures would seek to be stable and predictable; they would not have sudden death thresholds. Today, the House is facing a measure which, frankly, would be better crafted to get the economy out of a temporary slump than to feed long-term demand. In its policy on accelerated depreciation, the government has chopped and changed over the years. In office, Labor put in place a higher level of instant write-off, increasing the threshold from $1,000 to $6,500-a stable and sustainable level which we felt would do a great deal to encourage investments by firms. Accelerated depreciation has good economic insights behind it. By acceleration depreciation schedules firms have a greater incentive to purchase fixed assets for their businesses. Under the expenditure tax laws in place in Australia, the GST allows you to write off inputs in the same year as you pay the tax, further up the chain. But, in the case of company tax or personal tax, the items are depreciated over succeeding years. Accelerated depreciation tips the hand of a business owner towards putting in place investment that they might not otherwise have done. It is, in the view of many economists, a more efficient way of incentivising investment than changing the corporate rate. But the key question is whether or not it is best done in a stable way which provides clear predictability or with sudden death cliffs. When Labor put out measure in place we did so at a $6,500 level, because we felt that that was what the economy could bear going forward. But yet in the coalition's first budget they decreased that threshold, taking it down from $6,500 to",61,Bills

31,Mr Porter (Pearce,"Minister for Social Services) (12:45): by leave-I move:$1,000. Then, in their second budget, in the 2015 budget, they increased up to $20,000 but with a sudden death cut-off of 30 June 2017. The government now proposes to push out that cut-off to 30 June 2018, which pushes the problem down the road but does not put in place a stable level of accelerated depreciation for small business entities. Labor has held a clear and consistent position on accelerated depreciation. We opposed the government when they cut the accelerated depreciation threshold from $6,500 to $1,000. When the government increased it to $20,000, we also warned that that might be a level that was not sustainable. Indeed, this bill reflects the government's own concerns about the sustainability of a $20,000 threshold, because again a sudden death threshold is put in place. To look at accelerated depreciation threshold under the coalition is to look at a mountain range-a threshold which started at $6,500, plummeted to $1,000, went back up to $20,000 and then is scheduled now under this bill, Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation For Small Business Entities) Bill 2017 to drop back down again. Let me be clear: Labor supports accelerated depreciation, and I have outlined the strong economic principles behind this. In that, we stand alongside the Council of Small Business Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman and the Institute of Public Accountants. We recognise the value of a accelerated depreciation but, unlike the government, we also recognise the importance of setting policies for the long term. Labor's small business policies are intended to create enduring growth. When we committed to the National Broadband Network with fibre to the premises and to getting the gigabit speeds that NBN connections with fibre to the home can now generate, we put in place a long-term policy. When Labor commits to investing in our schools, providing the human capital that small businesses need, again it is long-term investment. These things matter. I held a small business roundtable in Burnie. I was speaking to a small business owner there about his frustrations with the National Broadband Network. He told the story of the fact that with his small business he often has to upload large design files. He will set the upload going, walk down to the local cafe, come back and often finding the upload is still going. His connection is buffering and his business is suffering. The policies of this government on education also leave much to be desired. By ripping money out of schools and out of universities, the latest budget takes away the productive potential for Australian small businesses. Australian small businesses need a better human capital workforce than this government is giving to them. They need policies for the long term, not sugar hits for the short term. Labor has also committed to access to justice reforms, and we took that to the last election. They will provide an opportunity for small businesses to take anticompetitive behaviour to court. Currently small businesses are deterred from taking up private litigation against anticompetitive behaviour because they are concerned about the armies of lawyers that the big end of town can array against them. The risk of having to pay the other side's legal fees if the action is unsuccessful is a significant deterrent. Labor's access to justice reforms restore the balance by letting small businesses request a 'no adverse costs' order early in a court case. It will help level the playing field and encourage more small businesses to take on anticompetitive behaviour and it reflects Labor's strong commitment to a level playing field in our competition laws. Labor believes that we need to have tougher penalties for anticompetitive conduct and that we need to double the ACCC's litigation budget. Labor believes that it is important for small businesses to be protected from dodgy phoenix operators through a director identification number, dealing with the fact that it is currently almost possible to register your dog as a director. The tax commissioner told the Senate yesterday, when answering a question from Senator Williams, that he could register Senator Williams as a director in a firm that he controlled and Senator Williams would not even know about it. That is why we need a director identification number: to protect honest small businesses. Labor's phoenixing policy also increases the penalties and gets the standard of proof right. These are pro small business measures from this side of the House. But this measure, which is assisting small and medium businesses-by extending the turnover threshold from $2 million to $10 million-has a troubling deadline coming down the track. We on this side of the House are concerned that small businesses get the stability they need from a terribly unstable government. This government has chopped and changed prime ministers and ministers in portfolios across the board. We have had multiple ministers responsible for almost every single policy. Indeed, one of the policy areas for which I am responsible, the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, has had no fewer than five coalition ministers responsible for it under the Abbott-Turnbull government. Providing stability is about more than three word slogans such as 'jobs and growth'; it is about making sure that our tax laws, our competition laws and, indeed, our litigation rules are appropriate to look after the needs of small business. Labor's competition policies are proconsumer but they will also assist start-up businesses. In Australia, we have had a troubling stagnation in the rate of new business formation over recent years. In a piece in the Monthly recently, Adam Triggs and I pointed out that, over the past couple of decades, we have seen a significant ramp-up in merger activity and a significant stagnation in small business start-up rates. One of the ways of spurring that is through appropriate competition laws. Labor's proposal is that we increase the civil penalties in the Australian Consumer Law from $1.1 million to $10 million. And we are very pleased this year to see the government finally falling into line and adopting that policy in the budget. But we also call on the government to adopt the other pro-competition pro-small-business policies that we have been calling for. We call on them to adopt the European Union's penalty system for anti-competitive conduct. It is based on 30 per cent of the annual sales of the relevant product or service multiplied by the number of years over which the infringement took place and limited to the greater of 10 per cent of annual turnover or $2 million. We call on the government to double the ACCC's litigation budget from its current $24.5 million to $49 million. We call on the government to give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission an independent market studies power so it is able to undertake its own investigations on issues such as pricing discrepancies and increased market concentration. The government has called the consumer watchdog in on recent months over issues such as energy and the banking sector. But if the consumer watchdog had a market studies power, it could immediately be on the case rather than waiting to be given those additional powers on an ad hoc basis by the government of the day. Labor wants the act amended to apply higher penalties for conduct that targets or disproportionately impacts disadvantaged Australians and to encourage the consumer watchdog to focus its investigatory efforts on cases that affect disadvantaged Australians. It is important that competition law, which goes back to the Trade Practices Act 1974-a great achievement of the Whitlam government-works for consumers and firms. Labor is the party of the Trade Practices Act; national competition policy under the Hawke and Keating governments; and the Australian Consumer Law and the criminalisation of cartels under the Rudd and Gillard government, with the leadership of the member for McMahon, Chris Bowen. Australians can trust Labor to get it right on competition policies and stable economic policies. Through our Access to Justice policy, our competition reforms and our commitment to ensuring the tax policies are right for the long term, Labor is truly the party of small business. We recognise that the measures in this bill will provide assistance to small and medium businesses. But we again raise our reservations about a measure which would have been recognised by Keynes, writing two generations ago, as better suited to temporary stimulus than to the ongoing stable policy that Australian small and medium size businesses so desperately need. members of the Labor Party, rise to make statements like we have just heard, that Labor is the party for small business and competition policy, they can only ever refer to the HawkeKeating era? I think they are purposely ignoring the fact that they did go through that disastrous Rudd-Gillard-Rudd era, an era that they now wish to wash away from modern history, despite the fact that ever since that era, right through until today, the Labor Party has continued to be a party for the union movement only, and certainly not for small business. It is a party that has sought to stand in the way of reforms to competition policy that will level the playing field. Let me come to Hawke and Keating in a few moments. I rise today in support of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation For Small Business Entities) Bill 2017. There is little doubt that in the broad sweep of Australian politics it is the coalition that truly respects and understands the vital role that some 3.2 million small businesses, businesses employing 5.6 million people, play in our national economy. In the now distant past, during that Hawke-Keating golden age of reform to which the previous member referred, Labor did offer a very uncharacteristic glimpse of understanding of the small business sector. For a short while they supported the crucial role of that sector as the engine room of jobs and growth in the Australian economy. They did so, I probably should add, with support from the coalition, then the opposition. However, such glimpses of hope from Labor are rare, and all too often it has fallen to the coalition, and the coalition alone, to restore and repatriate the confidence of small-business operators to a point where they again look to expand, to pursue new ideas by investing in themselves and creating jobs. In fact, helping small business, can I say, is part of our DNA. For generations the great Liberal Party, together with our coalition partners the Nationals and the old Country Party before them, have worked to support and give voice to millions of hard working small business people and professionals, not to mention the millions of people they employ. These were Menzies's forgotten people, vividly brought to life only last week at Old Parliament House on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of Sir Robert's landmark broadcast of 22 May 1942.",62,Bills
32,Mr Ted O'brien (Fairfax) (12:59,"Why is it that whenever members opposite,Mr Brian Mitchell interjectingregretful that they were unable to attend at last week's event, for indeed they have listened to its recording since and they have taken some notes. There is no doubt that it is never too late for the Labor Party to learn from the great Robert Menzies, and I am delighted that members opposite clearly agree with that sentiment today. But we are a long way from 1942, when Menzies made that wonderful speech. Or are we? Certainly we still have the lifters and leaners. We still have radical trade unions in the form of today's CFMEU and others. There is no heckling when I make that statement, so let me repeat it for the members opposite: we still do have those radical trade unions in the form of today's committed to workplace disruption and extortion, often backed up by the threat of violence, with no respect for the rule of law whatever. The new ACTU secretary is an obvious case in point. We still have big business, which today is even bigger business-vast multinationalsmany acting as good corporate citizens while a powerful minority seek to siphon off huge fortunes in undeclared Australian tax dollars to low-tax jurisdictions elsewhere. And we still have the forgotten people, which include approximately 3.2 million small businesses, and their largely non-unionised staff-businesses that include the builders, the IT technicians, the bakers and heaven knows how many cafe owners. These are all members of today's forgotten people. But they are not forgotten by the coalition, and certainly not forgotten by the Turnbull government. While Labor threatens to unpick the government's Enterprise Tax Plan at every opportunity and turns its back on small businesses, the Turnbull government is getting on with the business of delivering, of helping businesses to invest in the opportunities they need to grow and, most importantly, the opportunities that will help them generate jobs. By any measure, the government's instant asset write-off, or its accelerated depreciation treatment, which offers an immediate tax deduction with a threshold of $20,000 for newly acquired assets, has been an outstanding success. By extending this instant asset write-off for a further 12 months to 30 June 2018 while also providing broad incentives to cut red tape and changing the definition of small businesses to include those enterprises that have an annual turnover of up to $10 million, the coalition is delivering for today's forgotten people. When first introduced in the 2015-16 tax year, the temporary increase in the instant asset write-off threshold, from $1,000 to $20,000, delivered an almost 30 per cent increase in the number of taxpaying entities claiming the deduction, while the dollar value claimed increased by some 140 per cent. And keep in mind that this was when it was limited to only $2 million businesses. With the recent change in definition of a small business from one with just up to a $2 million turnover to one with a $10 million turnover, the Turnbull government has yet again demonstrated how seriously it wants to deliver for this sector. That reform of changing the definition will give access to the instant asset write-off for the forthcoming tax year to approximately 90,000 additional small businesses across Australia. To the mums and dads who own their own business, to the young entrepreneurs wanting to catch a break and to those who need a job or just more hours, this is very good news. While the extension of the instant asset write-off to 30 June 2018 is estimated to cost the budget $650 million over the forward estimates, and while the government holds budget repair as a",65,Bills
33,Mr Ted O'brien,"I note that the members opposite who are calling out are verykey priority, this temporary measure to improve cash flow and capital investment for small business will not only create jobs but also boost productivity across the sector. Small businesses, by their very nature, are generally more vulnerable and exposed to sudden adverse trading conditions. Such heightened trading risk and volatility, together with major capital expenditures early in the life of the new business, puts a significant strain on cash flow. This proves fatal for many fledgling enterprises. The opportunity for immediate deductibility will on most occasions improve cash flow for small businesses by allowing an instant deduction, in full, of up to $20,000 per item in the year the cost was incurred up to 30 June 2018. The small business sector is saying, 'Alleluia!' A meaningful reduction in compliance costs, long the bane of small businesses, is a further but by no means insignificant benefit. There is a significant regulatory saving for small businesses not needing to maintain a depreciation schedule for assets up to the $20,000 threshold mark. No wonder this measure is popular, including with those opposite in the chamber today, who wish for this measure to go on for eternity. Although we would like to see that happen, we make this commitment time bound, because we on this side of the House understand the ongoing importance of fiscal discipline and the critical need to repair a budget that was so woefully damaged by those opposite when they were on the Treasury benches. James Pearson, CEO of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: Small businesses are particularly pleased to see the highly successful instant asset write-off extended to June 2018 … Innes Willox, CEO of the Ai Group, said following the Treasurer's speech: … the Budget provides a substantial boost for smaller businesses by lowering tax burdens, extending asset write-off eligibility and cutting red tape. Andrew Conway, CEO of the Institute of Public Accountants, said: We welcome this Budget for Australia's small businesses. This Budget provides small businesses with further confidence to employ, invest and grow. The quotes from authoritative and respected business leaders are endless, but I will not go on, for they all reinforce the same point-that is, a uniform and glowing praise for this initiative and, moreover, for a federal budget that is poised to deliver so much for all Australians. The temporary extension to June 2018 of the instant asset write-off of up to $20,000 for small businesses forms part of a broader, more comprehensive platform of targeted incentives under the government's 2017 budget that will help small businesses grow and deliver more jobs. Other key measures include small business tax cuts, reducing to 27½ per cent from 1 July this year; increasing the eligibility for small business tax concessions; a simpler BAS mechanism; the small business restructure rollover, removing the tax burden for small businesses that seek to transfer active assets; the scrapping of $5.8 billion in red tape; the easing of raising capital via crowdfunding changes; the clamping down on tax avoidance by large multinationals; and helping to create a level playing field for small businesses by taking action to prevent the misuse of market power. These reforms, taken together, show how serious the Turnbull coalition government is about helping small businesses and the millions of hard working Australians they employ. This is truly a coalition government cast in the image of Robert Menzies, that great leader of our nation, one with an unchangeable resolve-to always represent and fight for the 'Forgotten People'. It is for that reason that I wholeheartedly commend this bill to the House. second time. I call the honourable member for Parramatta and I want to compliment her on her coat of many colours. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (13:14): Thank you, Deputy Speaker. It is a local design, yet again-on indulgence. I am pleased to rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation For Small Business Entities) Bill 2017. It is a bill that extends the current instant asset depreciation for small business from July 2017 through another year to 1 July 2018. As members opposite have said, and as members on this side have said, there are many businesses that are appreciative of this opportunity to depreciate their assets upfront rather than going through the usual lengthy depreciate process over several years. Depreciation in this way is a very effective way to incentivise investment. The official way it is put is that it encourages capital investment by small business through lowering the pre-tax rate of return required to justify new investments. What that essentially means is that it helps cash flow. So when a business buys an asset up to $20,000 in this financial year it can depreciate that asset in full in the tax for that year rather than doing that over several years. So it does not actually reduce the amount, but it brings it forward. In doing so, it is a cash-flow benefit. One of the problems I have with this bill is that it handles depreciation, which is an incredibly important incentivising tool, in a rather inconsistent way. I am going to talk a little bit about the history of instant asset depreciation because it is six or seven years old now. It was first introduced in the Tax Laws Amendment (Stronger, Fairer, Simpler and Other Measures) Bill 2011 by the previous Labor government when the Labor government increased the threshold from $1,000 to $6,500 as part of a broader package of tax reforms. It was within the period of the global financial crisis. It was also stimulatory. I remember going out to my community at the time and talking to businesses that provided equipment to other businesses, whether that was refrigeration, air conditioning or solar panels, and walking through with them how this bringing forward of depreciation could actually benefit them in their selling of assets to business. It was actually designed to be stimulatory and to stimulate investment by the small business sector, and it was effective. It was passed in 2011 and introduced in 2012. It was $6½ thousand in perpetuity. We just raised the threshold. Small business knew that, from that point forward, that would be the rule. It meant that they did not have to adjust their investment decisions around changing rules. They knew what they were; they were there, we thought, in perpetuity. It was a good thing. It was a recommendation made by experts in the tax field and it was one that we were pleased to take up at that time. Unfortunately, when the Abbott government was elected one of the first things it did in the 2014 budget was abolish the $6½ thousand threshold and take it back down to $1,000. So it was introduced in 2012; in 2014, it went from $6½ thousand back down to $1,000. It was something that we thought was a strange decision from a government that considered itself to be pro-business. It was a government that would get up and talk about how it supported small",66,Cfmeu And Others I Note Their Heads Are Now Buried In Their Chairs Such Groups Are
34,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Vasta,"The question is that this bill be now read abusiness, yet one of its first actions was to take away something that was actually greatly appreciated by small business. Then, a little while later, we saw that the government changed its mind. In 2016, we saw the asset threshold raised to $20,000 for two years. So in the budget-in 2015, I think-it was announced that it would go up to $20,000. It was $6½ thousand; it was reduced down to $1,000; a couple years later, they increased it again up to $20,000. But it was only for two years. It was only up until 1 July 2017. This meant that small businesses were now in a position where, if they bought their assets before 30 June, they had favourable treatment on their cash flow. If they bought them after 30 June 2017, they were back down to $1,000 again. In my community I was talking to businesses about that. It calls businesses, in many ways, to plan their investment decisions around the changing tax rate-around the changing threshold for depreciation. That is never a good thing. I remember saying to businesses, 'I can't give you advice, but this is cash flow here. You don't invest in something because of this, you invest in something that you need. You should do it in the time frame that suits your business.' This, of course, was an incredibly powerful incentive for businesses to think about their investment strategies in relation to the threshold. When the cliff comes on 30 June 2017, you are back to $1,000. It is quite a different story than if you buy the month before. Now we have the government, in May, announcing that it is extending one more time, up until July 2018. We on this side of the House are going to support it. As we said in 2011 when we introduced the initial accelerated depreciation, it is a very effective way of incentivising investment. But we would argue that it is more a way of incentivising investment in the long term if it is actually consistent-if you do not keep changing the rules and causing businesses to alter their investment strategies to maximise the benefit from the rules before they change again. Now we have had, in 2012, from $1,000 to $6,500; in 2014 up to $20,000; there was supposed to be a cliff in July this year and now it is extended for a year. In July 2018 we go back to $1,000. We are going to support it, and there will be many businesses that manage to use this accelerated depreciation to invest in ways that they otherwise might not have thought possible because of the lengthy depreciation schedule. It is a good thing, but we would argue very strongly that if the government has a genuine commitment to using accelerated depreciation as an investment incentive, they should choose a number that they think is sustainable over the long term and apply that, so that business can actually go about its long-term planning of its investment decisions rather than changing them from year to year as the government changes its mind. So it is good for some, but not as good as it would be if we had a government that was genuinely using accelerated depreciation as more than a marketing ploy, as a genuine indication of its commitment to small business. I said in the appropriation speech this morning that in many ways the government has, rather than a vision, a storyboard. It decides how to make something look good and that is what it announces. In some ways this is that. 'We are good for small business because we have extended it for a year.' AgainI would urge the government to consider finding a final position on this and giving small business certainty moving forward. You know that we on this side of the House are in favour of that. I doubt that you would have any trouble at all convincing us that a permanent change to the accelerated depreciation rate is in order. We did it once. I have no doubt that the negotiation would be very fast and smooth and we could come to some kind of agreement, because in the long run it is good for business to have certainty over something as important as this. There were a number of other changes that the government made back in 2014, like removing the $6,500 threshold, that were actually not good for small business. One of them was the abolition of the loss carry back. Labor had introduced it after consultation and advice from an incredible number of tax professionals. It allowed businesses that made a loss this year to draw on the tax that they had paid up to two years prior to cover that loss. Again, it was one of those incentivising tax rules which allow a business that has been making a profit to make a loss this year and then draw on it. So it incentivises investment, just like accelerated depreciation does. But the government abolished that one as well. On my side of the House, facing a government that claims to be pro small business and claims to be about incentives and investment, to see it doing something which was so negative was quite a surprise. Again, I urge the government to consider their position on that as well. It was an incredibly effective reform. It was genuine reform, at the time, and it was a great shame for many small businesses to see it go. There were many voices saying that at the time. There are fewer now because, I suspect, they do not see the government as serious on tax reform at all, except in this sugar-hit style that we are seeing today in the extension of an accelerated depreciation rate for one year only. It was important reform, and I urge the government to consider it. I also urge the government to act on a few other things that there has been talk about recently. There was an incredibly important report on late payments from the small business ombudsman. Anyone who has run a small business, and I have, and anyone who talks to small businesses, knows that late payments are quite often the things that kill you. You can actually go out of business not because you are not viable-because you are viable-but because you do not get paid on time. In the music business, when I used to run the trade association, I used to make a not very funny joke that if every small business and large business got into a room on the same day and all handed over our money at the same time, it would clear up a whole stack of back payments. I had one situation where one company owed me $80,000 and I owed them $400. They could not net it out; I had to pay them the $400 before they paid me the $80,000. So there were people waiting for that payment, as well. I am absolutely familiar with what even a delay of a couple of weeks can do. It is an incredibly important report, and I would say that finding a solution to that-and this side of the House would be very willingwould be more valuable than whatever tax cuts and whatever accelerated depreciation you can give them. Solving that one, which actually allows businesses to be paid for the work they do relatively soon to the time they have to pay the costs of providing that service, would make an extraordinary difference. I also urge the government to consider the impact of power costs and gas prices on business at the moment. We are hearing from some of the big businesses about how difficult life is becoming because of the size of their power bills. We have seen wholesale prices double since this government was elected-double since this government was elected. I had to say that twice, because that is an extraordinary change. We know what has happened to gas prices, and there are many, many big businesses already speaking loudly, but there are also many small businesses that are just suffering it, and trying to get through the next week and the next week after that, as their prices go up and up and up. I also urge the government to heed the calls from small business to fix the NBN. I was out in a country town recently trying to buy a beautiful pottery tea set from an art gallery between here and the snow. It is not in the middle of nowhere; it is actually on the highway between here and the snow. He spent half an hour trying to take my money. In the end, he stood in the paddock with his credit-card reader trying to get a signal-walking around in the paddock trying to get a signal so he could take my money. If it had been in the city I would have said, 'Forget it; I'm not waiting half an hour.' I did have somewhere to go, but I felt so sorry for the guy I actually stayed there for half an hour trying to give the guy the opportunity to take my money. Businesses want customers that are willing to pay, and I was willing to pay. In this case, I could not pay, because the technology was not there. I suspect that businesses know better today than then. We are talking here about the simplest use of NBN, which is simply to take a payment. That is before you get to the possibilities of staff that live in different cities and still manage to work in a virtual office and before you get to the upload side of things. We really have to fix that, and I really urge the government to understand how seriously they damaged the capacity of business when they stuffed around with the NBN and went back to copper. It was a serious, serious step back in time. Also, there is work on phoenixing. We all know that when companies phoenix-and many of them do it as a pattern, as repeat offenders-that it is small business that wears the cost. We all know someone who did the work and has no chance of being paid, and we all know businesses that have gone to the wall, not because they were not viable, but because there were people who were deliberately phoenixing in order to avoid payments. We have a government that does not seem prepared to act on that. The 'government of small business' does not seem prepared to act on that. There are many things still to do. Congratulations on this one, even though it is one year only, but there is much, much, much more to do. standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour.

Now they tell us stuff like 'we are us' and they stand for whatever the Greens want them to stand for-when the unions aren't looking. Fence-sitting and wavering between competing ideologies is a dangerous policy when the country desperately needs jobs and business desperately needs certainty. In North Queensland, the Carmichael coal project is poised to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs-in the coalmine, in the expanded port and in the rail line connecting the two. The proponents, Adani, are stuck in no-man's land because there are multiple Labor parties in government in Queensland. The Labor party led by Annastacia Palaszczuk sometimes says that they will support the jobs that Adani will create. She even offered a deal on royalties to encourage the project. But the Labor party led by Jackie Trad says they will never support Adani, there will be no royalties deal, and, further, they will block Adani from getting a concessional loan to build the rail line. Then Curtis Pitt of the Palaszczuk Labor party comes out and says they will not block the loan. Adani must think they are stuck in a Jim Carrey movie, not knowing if they are dealing with 'me, myself or Irene'. To make matters worse, we have the Opposition in this place all over the shop on the issue. Labor should start supporting labourers and jobs for labourers, and support the Adani mine.

Padstow Rotary is one of the great organisations of the Banks electorate and for more than half a century it has been doing good work in our community. Amongst the various activities of Padstow Rotary, they have recently instituted the Panania Markets, which are very popular. Every year they run Christmas Carols in Playford Park, which is attended by literally thousands of people. Every year they also run service awards which recognise the efforts in our community of local SES, fire services, police and St John Ambulance. It is always a particularly moving event, because it is not often enough that those people who serve our community are celebrated and acknowledged. Padstow Rotary does it particularly well every single year. I would also like to thank local residents from Revesby Heights, Rebecca Currier and Blake Fischer, who entertained us on Sunday with their remarkable voices. They are amazing singers who have performed all around the world, and it was great of them to be there to celebrate with Padstow Rotary on this great occasion of its 60th anniversary celebration. Vocational Education and Training most Australians slept, over 15,000 Australian students were sent text messages telling them their apprenticeships and courses had been suspended. Careers Australia, one of the biggest providers in the country, was placed into sudden voluntary administration, leaving students and 1,000 staff in the lurch and worse. Receiving text messages in the middle of the night telling young apprentices and trainees that they should not show up for work placements and training is totally unacceptable. Early the next morning I received a phone call at my office from Peter, a teacher in refrigeration and air-conditioning at the Careers Australia Salisbury campus in my electorate. Peter was distraught. He was very upset. He had to tell his class of apprentices that they could not finish their course-a course they had paid for-leaving their futures so uncertain. It is truly heart breaking that young people in my local area have had their dreams dashed. To make matters even worse, students could end up with massive debts and no qualification to show for it. I call on the Turnbull government to step in to ensure that every single Careers Australia student or apprentice can complete their course at TAFE or some other quality provider. It is extremely important that no student is left worse off by this disaster that occurred on Prime Minister Turnbull's watch. The next Labor government will rebuild confidence in our vocational education sector by again making quality public TAFE the backbone of the system. For the sake of Peter, his colleagues and all the students affected by this terrible situation, we need action and we need these changes now.

Along with thousands of passionate sports fans, I have cheered my lungs out watching our boys take to the field with the best of the game. Since 2005, our vibrant royal blue jerseys have been a proud sign that rugby is indeed alive and kicking in Western Australia. Rugby in the west is a good thing for the game and in the west it is a good thing. Rugby at the highest level must remain in WA; otherwise, it weakens the development of our entire code in the state. Any attempt to crash tackle the Force out of super rugby would not only be devastating for local rugby fans but also a backward step for the game itself. Today Western Force are fighting for their survival. Their legal team, led by former Western Australia Governor Malcolm McCusker, are fighting to keep the Force out of compulsory arbitration. And the sea of blue are meeting tonight to support our WA team. For the fans and the players, rugby deserves to remain a part of our sporting culture in the WA, and I call on the ARU to keep our pride game alive in Western Australia-not just for the players; not just for the supports; but also for the thousands of young girls and boys who take to their own rugby fields each week fuelled by their passion for the game and looking forward to emulating their Western Force idols.

A total of 97 residential care places have been allocated over six facilities, with an estimated value of $6.35 million. A strong percentage of beds that have been awarded to these aged-care facilities are for dementia care. We were also pleased to announce that $2.4 million will also be going to the Cobram aged-care facility. I am proud to be part of this coalition government that is delivering on aged care. (Time expired) Australian Federal Police: Hobart Airport urgently reinstate the permanent Australian Federal Police presence at Hobart Airport. Those officers were controversially withdrawn in 2014, and the decision has now become a whole lot more problematic in the wake of the attacks on soft targets throughout Europe, including in France, Germany, Belgium and, of course, most recently the shocking attack in Manchester. The government claims Tasmania Police have filled the gap and that the decision was supported by an appropriate risk assessment. But, frankly, that is patent nonsense, because there is still no permanent TasPol presence at the airport, and it takes a ridiculously long time for them to reach the airport in the event of an incident. Moreover it is an undeniable fact that the terrorist threat these days is from people who are already among us and who are smart enough to search out soft targets. The decision to withdraw the AFP from Hobart Airport was foolish and dangerous, and there is no good reason to not remedy it now, seeing as the government has just boosted the AFP's budget by $500 million. Frankly, in the circumstances with all that we know and all the warnings that have been given, if there is a tragic incident at Hobart Airport then the blood will be on this federal government's hands. Aspire to be Deadly: Beyond Sports Global Award 2017 Aspire to be Deadly program for being nominated for a Queensland Reconciliation Award. TodayI would like to add to this by announcing that Aspire has, for the second year in a row, been shortlisted for the prestigious Beyond Sport Global Award, in the category of Best Partnership or Collaboration. These awards celebrate, support, raise awareness and provide funding for ways sport is being used to help make the Global Goals for Sustainable Development a reality. The Aspire team are now fundraising so that Jess Fatnowna, who is the development officer for the Cairns Hockey Association and has committed to this program over the last two years, can attend the summit and awards in New York at the end of July. Cairns Hockey needs to raise $5,000 for Jess to attend and, if they raise more than that, they will try to take her sister Lisa as well, as both girls have shown their value to the program as ambassadors and role models. If any community members, hockey supporters, colleagues or friends want to help Jess and Lisa experience this amazing opportunity, they can visit www.mycause.com.au and search 'Cairns Hockey' and donate. They have until 7 July to raise these funds, so please assist if you can. Congratulations again to the Aspire program-it is a fabulous initiative-and the great work that is continuing to be carried out by Cairns Hockey.",74,Statements By Members

What do the members for Curtin, Stirling, Pearce and Hasluck and senators Cormann and Cash have in common? I will give you a hint: not only are they all allegedly Western Australians, but they all form part of this so-called government's ministry. I tell you whatwe have heard of the Dirty Dozen, but I cannot help but think, what do we call this half dozen? What do we call them? The flaccid, wet-lettuce half dozen, who could not go in to bat for Western Australia if their lives depended on it. The foreign minister stood up here in question time only a few days ago and could not even get the narrative right about where the gas is delivered from the Browse Basin-not to Western Australia but to Darwin. What do we see when we look at the budget in relation to any so-called compensation for our paltry share of GST? We get next to nothing-a top-up from 30c to 34c. When you factor in the losses in education and health, we go backwards to the tune of $200 million. Is that the sort of advocacy you want from this bunch of wet lettuces? You talk about education. What do I give this half dozen? AnF for fail. Brisbane Metro business case for the Brisbane Metro. It aims to improve bus travel times right across Brisbane by addressing a critical bottleneck across the Brisbane River. Unlike other major cities around Australia, Brisbane has a megacouncil with a strong track record of delivering the major infrastructure projects that our city needs. In Brisbane, the majority of commuters take buses, not trains. I would like to welcome to the chamber Councillor Bourke and Councillor Toomey from Brisbane City Council. I would like to congratulate the Treasurer for mentioning the Brisbane Metro in his budget speech as one of many nationally significant infrastructure projects that can be considered for federal infrastructure funding following the completion and assessment of its business case. The business case shows a discounted benefit-cost ratio of 1.9. That would compare very favourably with other infrastructure projects being considered around Australia. The Treasurer also listed Brisbane's Cross River Rail in the budget and we eagerly await the further planning work on that project and its business case, promised by the Queensland Premier a few weeks ago. Ultimately, Brisbane will need further capacity for both buses and trains, so I commend the work of Turnbull government ministers in collaborating with other levels of government and supporting all proponents to work together and ensure that public transport solutions in Brisbane are both complementary and integrated. Lalor Electorate: Young People Ms RYAN (Lalor-Opposition Whip) (13:48): I rise today to speak on behalf of young people in the electorate of Lalor, some of whom are fast becoming disillusioned with the world and their place in it. They care critically about the issues we discuss in this place but feel that they are not being heard. They care about climate change and are dismayed at this government's inaction, on the one hand, and obsession with fossil fuels at the expense of a fair transition to renewables on the other.

Lighthouse to Lighthouse Juvenile Diabetes Fundraiser Robb and Bridget Hansen on the start of their epic Lighthouse to Lighthouse charity event for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, a gruelling journey that will see them cover 900 kilometres between the Barrenjoey and Byron Bay lighthouses over two weeks. Gordon and Bridget will be running, kayaking and cycling to raise money for the foundation and raise awareness of type 1 diabetes. This journey is personal. Gordon's son Callum was only eight years old when he was diagnosed with the disease at Westmead Children's Hospital. It was a shocking new reality for his young family. Both Gordon and Bridget can get quite emotional recounting how hard it has been for the family to adapt. Twenty-four hundred people are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in Australia every year. It is one of the most severe chronic diseases affecting our children. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation helps to improve the lives of these children; they assist their families; and, vitally, they are searching for a cure. Today, Callum manages his disease brilliantly, with the help of a diabetes dog and a sensor attached to his bicep. Although it is still a daily struggle, Callum's family is grateful for all the support they have received and continue to receive. This journey is a way of giving back, and I wish Bridget and Gordon godspeed. Paterson Electorate: Men's Shed Ms SWANSON (Paterson) (13:51): Men's Sheds are terrific. TodayI want to congratulate Salamander Men's Shed, the 2322 Men's Shed at Beresfield and the Raymond Terrace Men's Shed for receiving funding under the National Shed Development Program. Salamander shed has a great spot at the Recycling Centre, so members can salvage items and materials that have been thrown out and bring them back to life, and then sell them-it is the ultimate in upcycling. In the community, they have built computer desks for the IT centre at Tomaree high, and an outside kitchen for Bobs Farm school. The 2322 Men's Shed at Beresfield is in the old Beresfield tennis clubhouse, but I know they would dearly love their own shed. Shed members fashion wood-turned toys for sale, mentor boys from Francis Greenway high, and help locals with odd jobs such as building ramps into their homes for walkers and wheelchairs. They have built a chicken coop for Woodberry primary, a display stand for Beresfield primary and cupboards for the bowlers at Beresfield Bowling Club.",76,Statements By Members

Blackwood Action Group Ms FLINT (Boothby) (13:52): I recently attended the Blackwood Action Group's public meeting and I want to acknowledge the wonderful volunteers who work so hard to look after the Blackwood area. Established in 2009, the Blackwood Action Group, fondly known as BAG, was formed because local residents were concerned by the appearance of the Blackwood shopping precinct and surrounding areas. Their mission was to enhance the natural, built, human and social environments of Blackwood and surrounding districts, and they have achieved this. Since its inception, BAG has contributed to the greening of Blackwood by providing planter boxes in prime pedestrian locations along Main Road, Blackwood. They also established Barty's Park, named after Mr Geoff Bartlett, one of their hard working members. BAG volunteers conduct monthly working bees at local railway stations and are active Clean Up Australia Day participants. BAG's history sub-committee has again contributed to South Australia's History Festival, with their dedicated members conducting walking tours around Blackwood and Eden Hills, with all tours fully booked. Each year BAG creates red bows to adorn properties for Christmas, which provides a unique and colourful facade for the festive season. And the entire district is still talking about their Christmas tree festival. These amazing volunteers, including President Mr Brian Ferris, Secretary Mr Geoff Bartlett, and Mrs Elisabeth Bartlett, work hard to keep Blackwood beautiful. The Blackwood Action Group promotes a strong sense of community pride and belonging and works tirelessly to keep Blackwood and also my electorate of Boothby beautiful. Broadband this side of the House are calling on the government to do something to help users of the NBN who are paying for a product that they are simply not getting. On a weekly basis, we hear stories that people are paying for a 12 megabit per second product and they are not getting five megs. They are paying for a 50-meg service and they are not getting 25 megs. They are paying for a 100-meg service and they are not getting a fraction of this. The tragic thing is that the government has the power to do something about this but it simply refuses. It could, for example, require that the NBN tell the service providers where the impediments are in the network and where they cannot be delivering these standard products. It could require the telecommunications companies to tell the customers, when they ask for a product that they cannot deliver, exactly what the problems are in the network. Of course, the problem with doing this is it is going to shine a big spotlight on the hopeless mess that is this government's and this Prime Minister's National Broadband Network.

Murray Darling Medical School with its aim of training doctors in the bush for practice in the bush. The big urban universities continue to oppose the Murray Darling Medical School out of a combination of what I believe to be a condescending elitism and also a desire to protect their nice little earner, which sees them training a large number of foreign students who pay for freight and then leave Australia when they graduate. Yet, on any objective view, the system they preside over has failed country Australia. Despite the rhetoric and years of trying, they continually fail to produce doctors willing to practice medicine in the country. For years, they have said that the Murray Darling Medical School cannot happen because the training places simply do not exist. Yesterday, that myth was exploded with the arrival of a new report into those clinical training places. It unequivocally shows that there is sufficient existing and future capacity to meet the needs of the Murray Darling Medical School. This report will be a real test into the medical training review that is currently underway. If the review is fair dinkum, it will not be able to ignore these findings. And the communities of the west are watching. The chronic shortage of doctors in country Australia needs to ends. This is a matter of equity between the city and the bush. The time for the Murray Darling Medical School has come. Broadband Launceston Australia's first one-gigabit city. That is something that my friend, the member for Bass, is particularly excited about. He has not been able to wipe the smile off his face. Launtel is using FTTP installed by Labor to offer customers 1,000 megabits per second. These speeds rival Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. This is only possible because of Labor. These speeds cannot be replicated statewide because the Liberals are installing FTTP, wireless and satellite at much lower speeds. Too many towns in my electorate are still waiting for connection under this government. We are not even getting 12 megabits per second, let alone 1,000. Telco founder Damian Ivereigh says the coalition has led to a bad outcome for Tasmania. He is not alone. Industry experts like Rod Tucker have called the NBN a national tragedy and a classic case of failed infrastructure policy. This national tragedy, this 'NBN fraudband', this classic case of failed infrastructure policy can be laid at the feet of one man-the Prime Minister, who broke the nation's NBN.

Budget Prime Minister. The Liberal Party's 2016 election policy document promised 'lower taxes for families'. So how is it fair that the Prime Minister has kept his promise for millionaire families but broken it for low-and middle-income families, who will have to pay more in tax due to this Prime Minister's budget? for Australian families. We delivered them! We did not just talk about them, we delivered them-tax cuts for Australians on middle incomes. And we have also delivered tax cuts for small-and medium-size businesses, which employ collectively half of the Australian private sector workforce. Three million businesses are enjoying tax cuts now and over the next couple of years as the threshold increases. They employ half of the Australians in the private sector. The Leader of the Opposition wants to roll that back-to claw that back! He is going to go to those businesses which are getting a break, which are getting a tax break and are able to invest more and to employ more, and he is going to say, 'We want your money!' A Labor government is going to put up their taxes-that is what he wants to do. That is his commitment. Our commitment is to deliver a budget that is fair, that defends the vital services Australians need and which provides the opportunity for them to get ahead. And we have done exactly that. We are delivering those tax cuts to Australian businesses which, as the Leader of the Opposition knows-because they are his own words-deliver more investment, higher productivity and more jobs. He said it. He said it very well! He was on message there, and he was right! We are delivering that. We are guaranteeing Medicare. We are funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme.

54,Mr Turnbull (Wentworth,"Prime Minister) (14:01): The coalition delivered tax cutstalk warmly and compassionately about disabilities but not to put the money there to pay for them? At some point you have to put up the money to pay for it. He failed to do that, but we have. Then, of course, we have seen their hypocrisy and the inconsistency with schools funding, where for years they talked about needs based funding and delivered the exact reverse. And now we are delivering on the precise vision that David Gonski represented-consistent transparency and needs based funding. We are delivering it! The Labor Party would of course like to have a top marginal rate of 49½ per cent. This is a party that condemned the temporary deficit levy when it was proposed. They said it was a deceit tax, then they finally voted for it with a sunset clause so that it ended on 30 June this year. Labor voted for it and the parliament voted for it. It is not being abolished; it is expiring in accordance with an act of parliament, which Labor voted for. Labor supported it! So that is yet another inconsistency and another hypocrisy from this mob opposite. Budget Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on what the government is doing to fully fund the services Australians rely on while growing the economy and generating jobs? Are there any threats to the government's approach? for his question. He understands very well the importance to the families in his electorate of the government delivering and securing the vital services they need-the National Disability Insurance Scheme, Medicare, schools, education-and ensuring they are paid for. And that is what we have done. Unlike Labor, which made wild promises and did not fund them, every commitment we have made in our budget is fully funded and paid for. We have taken the tough decisions to ensure that we bring the budget back into balance. There is no fairness in throwing a mountain of debt on the shoulders of our children and grandchildren. There is no fairness in putting our AAA credit rating at risk by running endless deficits. The budget has to be brought back into balance, and that has meant we have taken some tough decisions. And yes, we have imposed a new tax on the major banks. We have done that to raise the money to bring the budget back into balance. And we are increasing the Medicare levy by half a per cent to fully fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The same arguments of fairness and equity that the Labor Party addressed to the House years ago when Julia Gillard increased the Medicare levy to partially fund the NDIS by half a per cent are even more potent today-because this change will actually pay for it. We will be able to look into the eyes of parents and children with disabilities with compassion and love but also with the commitment that comes from knowing the money will be there, now and forever, to fund the services they need. The only consistency we get from the Leader of the Opposition is inconsistency. Every position he takes is a reversal of one he took before. He condemns, and wants to repeal, company tax cuts; only a few years ago, he said lower business tax increases productivity, investment and employment.

(Time expired) Budget Ms STANLEY (Werriwa) (14:08): My question is to the Prime Minister. How is it fair that, in this budget, a nurse earning $60,000 year gets a $300 tax increase while a millionaire gets a $16,400 tax cut? Leader of the Opposition said people who earn $180,000 are not rich. Now, apparently, people who earn $87,000 are millionaires! Now, apparently, he wants to back away from a commitment to a National Disability Insurance Scheme that is paid for by everyone who is eligible to pay the Medicare levy, which of course has protections for people and families on very low incomes. Nonetheless, that commitment was there. It is a National Disability Insurance Scheme. Everybody benefits. The half a per cent extra obviously represents a much larger amount for people on high incomes than it does for people on low incomes. The equity, the consistency and the transparency of our proposal were self-evident to the Labor Party a few years ago. Now, apparently, for no reason other than political convenience, they are not. The honourable member is not a member of the shadow cabinet-no doubt she will be, in due course-but I believe that, in her heart, if she had been there in the shadow cabinet, she would have joined the other three quarters of that group and told the Leader of the Opposition he was wrong, he was unfair and he was all tactics and no principle.

In particular, we have said yes again to extending the instant asset write-off, not just to companies with up to $2 million in turnover but to companies with up to $10 million in turnover. That is who we have said will get tax cuts and extra tax support as small businesses in this country. The Labor Party has said no to that. The Labor Party has said no to small businesses of up to $10 million having lower taxes and having access to the instant asset write-off. In addition to that, in the budget we said yes to cutting the red tape of state and local governments by entering into a partnership with those governments, with some $300 million to cut red tape to lower the costs for small business in this country. We said yes to that. The Labor Party said no to small business when it comes to cutting red tape. They want small businesses to pay higher taxes and they want small businesses to deal with more red tape. We said yes in this parliament to cutting the taxes for small businesses and medium-sized businesses with up to $50 million in turnover. As the Prime Minister has said, some 6½ million Australian employees work in those businesses, to whom we gave a tax cut in this parliament. What did the Labor Party do? They said no and they voted no in this parliament for those 6½ million Australians working in more than three million businesses. And it is worse than that, because we know the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition have fully backed it into their costings, reversing those tax cuts for small businesses. They are going to increase taxes on hard working small businesses if they ever get to occupy these Treasury benches, but they will not be up-front with the small business community about that. You will not hear from the Leader of the Opposition or the shadow Treasurer an honest statement that it is their intention to lift the taxes on small and mediumsized businesses that have been passed through this parliament. But if they do not say that, what they are saying is that they have a $30 billion black hole in their costings, because they costed all of those changes. So, what is it? Do they support small businesses and will they stand by the small business and medium-sized business tax cuts, or will they be honest and tell Australian small businesses that they are going to say no to them, as they keep saying no to a positive economic growth plan that is being pursued by this government?

Australian Federal Police the Australian Federal Police were withdrawn from Hobart Airport in 2014, even though the 2007 Glasgow Airport attack forewarned us of the vulnerability of attacks at second-tier airports. Moreover, your government concedes, especially after Manchester, that home-grown terrorists and soft targets are pressing concerns right now. In other words, the risk is not diminished for non-international airports. Prime Minister, now that you have increased the AFP's budget by over half a billion dollars, will you urgently remedy this alarming situation and reinstate the AFP's presence at Hobart Airport, or will your government continue to treat Tasmanians as second-class citizens? for his question. The Office of Transport Security is responsible for the categorisation of security at controlled airports and it determined, as the honourable member said, in 2014 that the threat environment did not require the presence of AFP officers there. That risk assessment was based on the advice of the AFP and the intelligence agencies.

Those men and women are in the front line, keeping us safe. They put their lives on the line. They are the best in the world. On Monday, we saw in Queensland the tragic murder of Senior Constable Brett Forte-a police officer who, like too many before him, lost his life in the line of duty. Our condolences and our love go to his wife, his children, his family and his colleagues. The threat of Islamist terrorism, the threat of this extremist violence, is here at home and it is right around the world. We saw last night a young 12-year-old Australian girl killed by a terrorist attack, an ISIL attack, in Baghdad. She was visiting Baghdad with her family during Ramadan to see her grandfather-another innocent killed by this violent terrorist movement that is gnawing away, seeking to destroy and pervert and blaspheme one of the great religions of the world. Our police officers and our intelligence agencies are on the front line of keeping us safe in that battle. Our allies, our best collaborators, are our Muslim leaders both at home and abroad, like President Widodo in Indonesia, who remind us, and say repeatedly, that they stand for an Islam that is moderate, that is tolerant, that is democratic. That is their commitment. They are our best allies in this battle. But at the forefront stand those police officers and those intelligence agencies. We have given them, and are giving them, more support both in law, in legislation, and in resources than ever before, and we will continue to do so to keep all Australians and all Tasmanians safe. was as the clock ran down to zero.

This happened at the end of day of fasting at Ramadan. Zynab, her mother and her uncle had gone to visit grandparents in Baghdad. The father was breaking his own fast late yesterday in Melbourne when he got a phone call which no parent could ever imagine receiving. He has now made his way to Baghdad. Our thoughts are also with her two brothers. Her mother was wounded, but not too seriously. The uncle has been wounded more seriously. Samir was able to inform me that little Zynab was very active in her faith community. She would work hard to clean the mosque and prepare the food. I have also spoken to the principal of Sirius College, where she attended school, Halid Serdar Takimoglu. Obviously, like all parliamentarians, I asked the obvious question: 'How are all the other kids coping?' He said, 'It's quite devastating. The school has put counselling in place.' It really leaves one to conclude: how do we explain to other 12 year olds that their friend will not be getting off the plane back from Iraq? How do we explain to our young this tragic death? It is not a conversation any of us want to ever have. SoI too want to applaud the AFP, because they do their very best to stop us having to have that conversation.",84,Questions Without Notice

He did rise on a point of order, as I said, as the clock ran down to zero. We cannot have a rule in this place where members have more than one question-okay?-unless the call is alternating. The member for Dawson has the call. Budget Tourism and Investment. Will the minister update the House on how the government's small business tax cuts are supporting tourism businesses in my electorate of Dawson and across the country? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies that would jeopardise the creation of jobs for hard working Australians? the member for Dawson for his question, because I know he is passionate about the 5,325 locals that are employed across some 1,545 tourism businesses in his electorate. They have been doing it tough. I had the opportunity to travel up to Dawson not long after Cyclone Debbie went through and caused the devastation that it did. I had the opportunity, together with the Queensland state government, to announce, at the behest of the member for Dawson, who had lobbied extensively, a $10 million package to help the industry recover, to make sure that the tourism industry had a strong future in Dawson as it sought to recover from Cyclone Debbie. Like me, the member for Dawson and indeed all members across the Capricornia coast, as well as those interested in tourism in the coalition, are focused on creating the right business conditions so that we can make sure that more Australians have the opportunity to have jobs in Australia's tourism industry. In fact, one of the key ways that the coalition is focused on making sure that there are more opportunities for Australians to have jobs in Australia's smalland medium-sized enterprises is by delivering tax cuts. That is why the coalition has delivered tax cuts for Australia's small businesses. The member for Dawson asks: are there alternative approaches? There are alternative approaches. The alternative approach is the position that has been adopted by the Australian Labor Party, because Labor's approach is to tax small businesses more. Labor's approach is to say to small businesses: 'We don't think that you should actually be investing more money into your business. You should be taking that money and handing it over to the Australian Labor Party, because we'll take those decisions on your behalf.' The fact is that only the coalition has the track record on delivering tax cuts not only for small business but for average Aussies as well in terms of the personal income tax cuts that we have delivered. So it is tax cuts for small business; it is tax cuts for personal income tax. It stands in contrast to the Australian Labor Party's approach, which is to say, for example, to Hamilton Island, who employ some 1,100 locals, that they should see higher smalland medium-sized business taxes. It is say to Cruise Whitsundays, who employ over 200 locals in the member's seat, 'You should pay more tax.'

Ms BANKS: My question is to the Minister for Social Services. Will the minister update the House on the government's commitment to ensuring a fully funded National Disability Insurance Scheme with appropriate safeguards to ensure that participants receive quality services? Are there any alternative approaches? Chisholm for her question. As she is aware, today is actually a very significant day for upholding the rights of Australians with disability to high standards of care with the introduction of a bill which will create the National Disability Insurance Agency Quality and Safeguards Commission. We will soon have an independent Commonwealth commission with $209 million worth of funding and 300 staff to uphold the standards participants deserve and to ensure clarity on the rights and responsibilities of participants, providers and their staff. The commission will have very significant powers in registration, complaints handling and compliance, including deregistration powers, banning orders, civil penalties, injunctions and powers of entry, search and seizure. I am asked about alternative policies by the member for Chisholm. Of course, the Labor policy is to refuse to fully fund the NDIS through a 0.5 per cent increase in the Medicare levy and so refuse to give certainty to all the families who will use the NDIS or who may need the NDIS. The voices past and present who support this levy as a very fair way to fully fund the NDIS grow every single day. Today we can add to that growing list the member for Jagajaga. This is what the member for Jagajaga said directly to the then Leader of the Opposition in 2013, very simply and very clearly: 'Do the right thing by people with disability, support the increase in the Medicare levy.' I ask those opposite: how is it that you can oppose a funding policy as unfair when you also so vigorously support the exact same funding measure? How is it possible to both support and oppose the same policy? Some have called it hypocrisy, but it has actually gone to the next level. It is now what Orwell called doublethink-the truly remarkable ability to simultaneously hold two completely opposite concepts in your mind and convince yourself that both are equally true.

In fact, the terribly irony under this Leader of the Opposition is that doublethink is the only consistent policy position that Labor has. So we say to the member for Jagajaga: drop the doublethink and just do the right thing by people with a disability.

Labor's plan to keep the budget repair levy and protect lowand middleincome workers from a tax increase is fairer and raises more money. Does the Prime Minister object to Labor's plan because it raises $4½ billion more revenue over 10 years than the government's plan? Or is it because under Labor's plan millionaires do not get a tax cut? for the question. For reasons that the Treasurer will expand upon in a moment, our objection to the plan-if you can call it that-of the Leader of the Opposition is not simply that it is a reversal of every position he has taken on these issues in the past, not simply because it is dripping with hypocrisy but that, far from raising more money, it involves raising money that he has spent multiple times. You can only spend it once, as the Treasurer will explain. opportunity to add to the answer. Since when in this country is someone who is earning $87,001 a rich man or woman? Since when has that been true? Talk about out of touch. This Leader of the Opposition thinks that a hard working Australian out there every day earning $87,001 is some sort of Google CEO.

On this side of the House, we delivered real tax cuts for some 500,000 Australians so that they would not go up into the second-top tax bracket. That is what we have done. But the Prime Minister makes a very important point. At the last election the Leader of the Opposition took to the election the policy of the deficit levy. He has already spent all the money on all the commitments he made at the last election. Mr Porter: He can't spend it twice! out, you cannot spend the money twice! That is how you get the $55.7 billion black hole for the NDIS. This mob spends money twice and they tax twice, and their numbers never add up. That is why they took to the last election a $16½ billion higher deficit. What do they think is going to pay for that if they are in government? Higher taxes! This mob is all about higher taxes, and if they think $87,000 is a rich person(Time expired) Medicare National Disability Insurance Scheme Will the minister outline to the House how the government is guaranteeing Medicare and fully funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches? the member for Robertson. I am delighted that we are able, through the course of the budget, to help deliver stronger and guaranteed Medicare services in her electorate, in particular by providing $12½ million for the Central Coast Medical School and Medical Research Institute. At the local level, that guarantees Medicare by guaranteeing training of more local doctors, who will inevitably stay in the local area. Real services will have a real impact in the area. At the national level we are also guaranteeing Medicare, not just through law by giving it the first call on the budget but also through ending Labor's freeze, and also by investing $2.4 billion and $10 billion, not just in Medicare but across the entire health budget-including hospitals and the PBS. One other thing that we are doing, though, is that we are guaranteeing the NDIS. And we are guaranteeing the NDIS not just today through the activities that the Minister for Social Services has done with the introduction of legislation but by funding the NDIS, because if you do not fund the NDIS you do not believe in it. You are a fraud! You are a sham! A charlatan! You are a political con job! And how do you know that? Because it was the opposition that told us that when they introduced a half a per cent Medicare levy right across the board for Australians. What was it that the opposition leader said?

They are now opposing the NDIS by opposing its funding. They are political frauds, they are NDIS(Time expired) Budget Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (14:44): My question is to the Prime Minister. The National Foundation for Australian Women has warned that some women will be hit with an effective marginal tax rate of 100 per cent because of this government's tax increases, its cuts to family payments and its increases to university fees. Why is the Prime Minister shouting about millionaires paying a top marginal tax rate of 49½ per cent but saying nothing about the women who will pay an effective marginal tax rate of 100 per cent? doubt favour us with the assumptions that provide the alarmingly high effective marginal tax rate she speaks about. The honourable member should bear in mind too that one of the arguments that were advanced by her party when in government for the increase of 50 basis points, half a per cent, on the Medicare levy to go to the funding of the NDIS was that it was universal and it did not create the effective marginal tax rate problem that introducing an additional threshold in the course of middle incomes would, as is apparently now the recommendation. The government's proposal is consistent, it is fair and it is equitable. As far as the 49½ per cent top marginal rate is concerned, the member for McMahon has again and again in his capacity as shadow Treasurer denounced the idea of increasing the top marginal rate. His hero, Paul Keating, has said it is too high as it is. The reality is this: honourable members opposite can talk about millionaires as much as they like. What we need is a tax system that provides incentives to invest, to employ and for people to get ahead. Having a top marginal rate where somebody earning somewhat more than two times average weekly full-time earnings is paying half of every additional dollar in tax is hardly an incentive for people to work harder, to invest and to build their business. So it is a question of getting the balance right. We have. Our budget is fair. It provides the security for those vital services the honourable member has always cared about and it provides the incentives and the opportunities to invest and employ.

Is the minister aware of any obstacles? thank the member for Durack for her question. She holds the biggest electorate in Australia, home to some of the most major resource projects in Australia, like the Gorgon facility, which will soon see a major carbon capture and storage project. She, like all those on this side of the House, welcomed the Turnbull government's announcement that we will amend the CEFC legislation to allow carbon capture and storage-a proven technology which has an application not just for thermal generation, coal and gas but also, importantly, for industrial processes: for steel, for cement making, for chemical processes to reduce emissions by up to 90 per cent. It has been endorsed by the International Energy Agency, the IPCCMr Perrett interjectingyesterday, BHP, BlueScope, the Business Council of Australia, Energy Networks Australia and Shell. Many others have welcomed the Turnbull government's announcement. SoI was surprised, when we announced that we were amending the CEFC legislation, that the Leader of the Opposition, who now turns his back, put out a tweet. The tweet said, 'You've got to be kidding'. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, 'Who is kidding?' I want to play a game of 'guess who'. Who said, 'Carbon capture and storage projects are occurring throughout the world'? The member for McMahon!

Wholesale electricity prices have doubled under this government, so how is it fair that this Prime Minister is ripping away the $365 energy supplement from pensioners to pay for his tax cut for millionaires? Mr Robert interjectingreferring to the budget measure that he incorporated in his own election policy. Those are savings that the Labor Party appropriated themselves. Compensation for a tax that is no longer present is being removed for new entrants. It is an equitable and balanced budget saving and it represents a fair approach that the Labor Party appropriated themselves in the lead-up to the last election. That is the fact. The Labor Party has done more than anybody to contribute to the rapid increase in wholesale electricity prices. We have seen some extraordinary conduct by the Labor Party. The member for Port Adelaide is over there drawing attention to himself. He is a representative of the state that managed to create a situation where it had a wind resource that at any given time could contribute more than 100 per cent of the state's electricity demand or zero per cent, in which case it would rely instead on a long extension cord to the Latrobe Valley in Victoria. This is a political party that has put a prohibition on gas exploration and development in the state of Victoria-the state that has the largest demand for industrial gas has put a ban not just on unconventional gas exploration and not just on fracking but also on conventional gas exploration. The biggest driver in very recent times of the increase in wholesale electricity prices, as all honourable members know, has been the increase in gas prices, driven by a shortage of supply. It was under the Labor government that the big deals were done to export gas from Queensland without any thought to domestic gas security. Presented with this problem, we saw from the Labor government a combination of ideology and complacency-Left ideology and Labor complacency. What we have done is act, and we have put in place the measures that will ensure that the Australian domestic gas market will be fully supplied. We have already seen reductions in the netback price at Wallumbilla. I am sure the honourable member for Port Adelaide is aware of that. We have seen some reductions, we have seen some effect, and we are determined to ensure that domestic supply for the east coast gas market is adequate. We have taken the tough decisions to ensure that it is-yet again cleaning up the energy mess left by the Labor Party.

123,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry) (15:02): Icommitment to our largest military build-up in our peacetime history. The Turnbull government will ensure, including through our record $200 billion investment in defence capability, that our ADF can continue to apply the lethal force required to defeat terrorists abroad. Australia continues to make one of the largest contributions to the campaign in the Middle East. Up to 760 ADF members are currently deployed, including 300 members in Task Group Taji, training Iraqi army troops; 120 members of the Special Operations Task Group, providing advice and assistance to the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service; 300 members of the Air Task Group, conducting airstrikes in Iraq and Syria; and 55 members embedded in coalition positions in Iraq. Since October 2014, there have been more than 2,300 ADF airstrike sorties over Iraq, delivering 1,900 weapons into Iraq and Syria. Let us not forget that it was this Prime Minister who altered our approach to targeting enemy combatants in Syria and Iraq so that our forces are empowered to act against ISIS in Iraq and Syria-no matter where they are or what they are doing, so long as they belong to the group of terrorists that we seek to eliminate. It is also in Australia's national interest to ensure Afghanistan never again becomes a haven for terrorists. In response to a NATO request, the Australian government has agreed to increase the Australian Defence Force's mission to Afghanistan by 30 personnel, from around 270 to around 300. These additional personnel will further develop the long-term capabilities of the Afghan security forces as part of our current train, advise and assist mission. They will not be in combat roles. The Chief of the Defence Force remains in discussion with NATO officials regarding the task allocation for these additional forces which will be confirmed in coming weeks. An increased Australian contribution to the Resolute Support Mission is part of Australia being not just a supporter of the war on terror but also capable of taking part in it in an effective and meaningful way. I thank the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for defence for their continued bipartisan approach to these matters in support of our ADF serving overseas. Schools Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:05): My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, how is it fair that under this government public schools get a cut but these elite schools get an increase-SCEGGS, Pymble Ladies' College, Presbyterian Ladies' College, Shore, Cranbrook School, Knox Grammar, Geelong Grammar, Scotch College and Brisbane Grammar, just to name a few? for Education. say to the member for Sydney: the state school students in Victoria, under the Turnbull government's plan, will get an extra 5.2 per cent over the decade.

And in the ACT, under the Turnbull government's plan, state school students will get a 5.8 per cent increase over the decade. In the Northern Territory, they will get a 1.3 per cent increase over the decade. The member for Sydney has 40 schools in her electorate. On average, in the member for Sydney's electorate, the schools will be better off under the Turnbull government's plan by $2.5 million each. St Andrew's Cathedral School, in the member for Sydney's electorate, will get over $6 million more under the Turnbull government's plan. Newtown High School of the Performing Arts, in the member for Sydney's electorate, will get an increase of over $8 million over the next 10 years. In the member for Maribyrnong's electorate, there are 54 schools and over 30,000 school students. Every single school will benefit under the Turnbull government's plan-an average of $7.2 million extra for those schools. SoI look forward to the member for Maribyrnong going to Ave Maria College and saying to them that, under the Turnbull government's plan, they will get an extra $14 million over the next 10 years. St Christopher's School, in the member for Maribyrnong's electorate, over the next 10 years will get an extra $12 million. Maribyrnong Secondary College, in the member for Maribyrnong's electorate, over the next 10 years will get an extra $10 million. And St Albans Secondary College, in the Leader of the Opposition's electorate, over the next 10 years will get an extra $13 million. Only the Turnbull government will deliver more money for the schools in the electorate of the Leader of the Opposition, in the electorate of the member for Sydney and for 9,000-plus schools across Australia. National Security Immigration and Border Protection. Will the minister update the House on the importance of maintaining Australia's strong and consistent border protection policies? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches? thank the member for his question and thank all of my colleagues on this side of the House for their consistent support in backing a strong border protection policy. The Australian public knows not only that the Turnbull government has stopped boats but also that we are determined to keep that policy into the future, because the threat of people smugglers has not dissipated. It has now been 1,039 days since the last successful boat arrival, but Australia is still burdened, I am sorry to say, with the disastrous legacy of Labor's border protection policies. All Australians know that 50,000 people came on 1,800 boats and 1,200 people drowned at sea. And we know that 8,000 children went into detention. But I do not think all Australians know this figure: so far, to date, Labor's policy failure on boats has cost the Australian taxpayer $13.7 billion. But it does not stop there, because the meter is still running. It is now costing the taxpayer of Australia $1.9 billion every year, and it will take us years to clean up Labor's mess. You would have thought that Labor had learnt their lesson, but the reality is that they have not.

129,Mr Dutton (Dickson,"Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (15:09): Ithat resulted in this policy outrage. We know, for example, that the member for Watson was minister when 83 boats arrived carrying 6,634 people, and 1,103 children were detained under his watch. We know that the member for Gorton was minister when 184 boats arrived. Those boats carried 12,800 people, and 200 children went into detention under his watch. But let's come to the crescendo: the member for McMahon, this man who wants to be the Treasurer of this country-he presided over Fuelwatch and GroceryWatch, but his greatest work as a minister in the Gillard government came when he was immigration minister, when 25,000 people arrived on 398 boats. Bur, worse than that, over 4,000 children went into detention. He can pretend to be in conversation with the member for Sydney over there, but the reality is that we need bipartisanship on the issue of boats policy and stopping people coming into our country illegally. The fact is that the Labor Party has not learnt its lesson. There is not bipartisanship in this country when it comes to boat policy. Labor has not learnt its lesson in relation to recent mistakes, and this Leader of the Opposition has failed the test. Mr Turnbull: I ask that further question be placed on the Notice Paper. Federation Chamber: Appropriation Bills Representatives Practice and the references there to question and answer sessions during debate on budget appropriations. I ask whether you would be prepared to review proceedings in the Federation Chamber earlier today, when agriculture department appropriations were under consideration. Further, I ask that when you do so-or if you do so-you further consider a reference to the procedure committee, which might be in order, to consider whether the capacity of private members to hold ministers to account could be further improved. Practice in that regard. I will point out to him a couple of things before I do that and I will report back, probably in writing, to him. But many of us have had experience in the Federation Chamber during consideration in detail. The obvious point I would make-and I will look at the Practice-is that, whilst there are certainly conventions that questions are asked as part of the five-minute contributions, it is not question time. And with respect to the procedure committee, certainly that is something that, if the procedure committee wishes to take it up, they are more than welcome to, in examining these sorts of matters all the time. But I will certainly undertake to examine the matters raised by the member for Hunter.

Taxation McMahon proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The government’s unfair priorities on tax. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their placesby saying how grateful we are on this side of the House to the Prime Minister for highlighting the differences in our approach on taxation today. He was down at CEDA, doubling down he was, in defence of the government's tax plans. And he was highlighting the difference in approach between the government and the alternative government, and we welcome that very much. We welcome the opportunity to debate the competing tax plans between the government and the alternative government, because they are different. The Australian people do face a choice at the next election between the plans of the government and the plans of the opposition. It is very clear that the government's plans are inconsistent, incoherent and, most of all, unfair. They are unfair and they are completely inconsistent with everything they have said previously. We used to hear how the Liberal Party was the party of low tax. Just a few weeks ago we heard about how they were the party of low tax. In fact, they even tried it at question time, somewhat unusually, like those $20 billion worth of tax rises in the budget just did not happen. But in the spirit in which I started, I give credit where it is due. We try to be fair on this side! The government is half right: they are the party of low tax for high-income people. They are half right! And they are the party of high tax for low-income people. That is where it goes wrong. There is a rather important caveat now, a rather important little footnote on the slogan 'party of low tax'-footnote: 'but not for low-income earners'. We need to make sure we have truth in advertising; there has to be a caveat every time they say it. We even saw it in question time. The Treasurer was asked about plans to reduce tax and asked about alternative policies. Well, he could have said, 'Yes, there are alternatives,' like his own! Like his own, which increases tax on people earning $21,000 in Australia today. The Treasurer got himself into all sorts of bother during question time because he was outragedoutraged!-at Labor's policies. He said that Labor believes that if you earn $87,000 you are rich, and that Labor will increase the tax on people who earn $87,000 and more. And he is right. The trouble is that so will he, by the same amount, for $87,000! The difference is that",98,Auditor General S Reports

134,The Speaker (15:15,I have received a letter from the honourable member for,99,Matters Of Public Importance
135,Mr Bowen (Mcmahon) (15:15,"I might start this contribution perhaps a little unusuallyhe will also increase tax for Australians earning $21,000 and more. On the logic that the Treasurer applied he thinks that people on $21,000 are rich! That is the only logical conclusion that you could reach from the Treasurer's remarks at question time. The fact of the matter is that there are 10 million people in Australia for whom the government wants to increase tax while we do not. That is the fact of the matter. That is the key choice for the Australian people. Somebody earning $60,000 will pay $300 more under this government but high-income earners will get a tax cut. They say, 'Yes, but the deficit levy was only ever meant to be temporary.' It was also meant to exist while there was a deficit, and the deficit now is 10 times bigger than what it was predicted to be in Treasurer Hockey's first budget. Remember him? Treasurer Hockey? I will come back to him in a little bit. It is 10 times bigger than it was predicted to be in his first budget and yet they find it within themselves to lift the deficit levy and give high-income people a tax cut. Somebody earning $190,000 will get a $200 tax cut, somebody earning half a million dollars will get a $6,400 a year tax cut and somebody earning a million dollars will get $16,400. We asked the Prime Minister in question time: how many people on $60,000 a year will have to pay increased tax to fund the tax cut for one person earning a million? He could not answer; he did not answer. We will answer it for him: 55. Fifty-five people earning $60,000 will pay more tax just to fund the tax cut for one person earning more than $1 million. It is not just about the Medicare levy. It gets worse. They did not stop there when that is comes to tax rises for low-income earners. It has not received as much attention, but the government wants to change the arrangements for people who commit the crime of going to university in Australia. That is what they want to do. They say: if you work hard and get yourself into university, you should start paying more tax at $42,000 a year-the princely sum of $42,000 a year. So, if you are a graduate, for example, on $50,000 a year, you will pay $250 more on the Medicare levy increase and you will pay $1,000 more on the HELP repayments. So much for a housing affordability plan if you happen to go to university! That is what the government's contribution is. For those people who went to university, it is more debt. As the old saying goes: if debt is the problem, more debt is not the answer. They could apply that to university graduates as well. We saw this as the centrepiece. The Prime Minister was out again this morning. Taking his glasses off and putting them back on again-spirit and passion, arguing against an increase to the top marginal tax rate. It was going to be a prosperity killer and the of end Western civilisation if the tax rate went up to 49½ per cent. It is fine at 49 until July 1, but on July2 when we proposed taking it to 49½ per cent, it is a prosperity killer. That is a problem for the government. Again, we saw the government arguing that the deficit levy was only temporary. That was their intention. When it comes to low-income earners, the pension cuts were permanent. When it comes to family tax benefit cuts for low-income earners, they were permanent. When it comes to unemployed people, those cuts were permanent. They managed to make the only measure which applies to high-income earners temporary. Well, in this situation it should not be temporary. In this situation, where we have the government at sixes and sevens-they have lost $2 billion since budget day on the bank tax, and yet they say they can afford to find the money for a highincome tax cut. Again the Prime Minister was out today saying the government will take half your money. I thought I had heard this before, this confusion between marginal tax rates and average tax rates. I thought 'I've heard this before'. I thought, 'Who said that?' It was our old friend Joe Hockey. He is back! The former Treasurer is back. He argued this and he got pilloried. Commentators put it out that the Treasurer did not understand the difference between marginal tax rates and average tax rates. The fact of the matter is that under Labor's plan, for somebody on, say, $200,000, their average tax rate would be 34 per cent. That is not a punitive tax rate. That is the average tax rate. And the Prime Minister, I suspect, understands that. When the Treasurer says something like that, you are never quite sure if he understands or if he is being dishonest. But with the Prime Minister we have a better idea; he actually does understand it but he chooses to misrepresent. That is not even taking into account the tax concessions which benefit high-income earners, which this side of the House will reform in government-like negative gearing, like capital gains tax, like superannuation, like accountants' fees and lawyers' fees, which this side of the House will reform and that side of the House simply refuses to do. Again we see the Prime Minister crying crocodile tears for high-income earners, saying how terrible it is to have a marginal tax rate of 49½ per cent. But the member for Jagajaga quite correctly asked the Prime Minister about women in particular on $50,000, who, as a result of this Prime Minister and this Treasurer's decisions and policies and as a result of their budget, will have an effective marginal tax rate of 100 per cent. The Prime Minister clearly had not worked this out at question time. He had no idea, not the foggiest idea did the poor old Prime Minister have. It was his budget and he clearly simply did not understand. I will tell you what: 100 is a bigger number than 49½. And an effective marginal tax rate is a problem if you are talking about incentives to work. So this government, if they are fair dinkum, will go back and review their policies and fix that effective marginal tax rate. But I do not like our chances, because these are women on $50,000 and they just do not cut the mustard when it comes to the priorities of this Prime Minister and this Treasurer. So here we have this government that comes in here and says, 'Let's have a debate about tax', and we say, 'You betcha! You betcha, we will have a debate about tax.' While we are at it we will have a debate about your $65 billion worth of corporate tax cuts. They say they cannot afford $22 billion for schools. They could not possibly afford that. But $65 billion for a corporate tax cut? No worries! 'Where do we sign?' say government members opposite. It is completely unfunded and completely unaffordable. This government has its priorities wrong. On1 July they are happy to see penalty rates cut. On1 July they are happy to see workers who work on a Sunday go backwards, losing money, losing their pay for working on Sundays. This government is happy to see it happen, just as they are happy to see millionaires get a tax cut. That says it all about the values of this government. They are values which are wrong, twisted and not right for Australia's future. extraordinary MPI! I say to the shadow Treasurer: yes, we have different priorities on tax to you. Yes, we are not the party of higher taxing, higher spending and bigger deficits. We are not the party that believes that people who are earning $87,001 should be treated as millionaires, as this litany of ridiculous questions in question time prove. We do not believe that small businesses with a turnover of between $2 million and $10 million should be taxed and treated like Google or Apple. Every time they talk about multinational tax, with reference",99,Matters Of Public Importance
136,Mr Sukkar (Deakin,"Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (15:25): What anto small businesses between $2 million and $10 million turnover-no, we do not believe that they should be treated like Apple and Google. So we have very different priorities on tax. I say to the shadow Treasurer, the failed former immigration minister, the failed former Treasurer with his Bowen's black hole of $18 billion-go to the next election with a commitment to raise personal income taxes, and make those arguments. Keep arguing that 49.5 per cent is apparently a very low and generous tax rate bestowed on Australian income-earners by the shadow Treasurer. You keep making those arguments; we are the party of small business and lower taxes, so our priorities are very different. We are also the party of integrity in our tax system. We are a party, unlike the shadow Treasurer, that will impose the bank levy, which will raise $6.4 billion over the forward estimates. No matter how many ridiculous arguments the shadow Treasurer raises, it will raise that money. The attacks on Treasury in that regard have been disgusting. But we will ensure integrity in our tax system. We will ensure that banks, who enjoy a place in our system with the four pillars bank policy, with a regulatory regime which is really the envy of the rest of the world in a financial services context, that they pay a little bit more to contribute to budget repair. We have the shadow Treasurer and the opposition leader, who come in here every single day parroting the lines of the big banks. They were all hairy-chested in here for months, talking about a banking royal commission, and now that we are trying to get a fair additional contribution out of our large banks to assist with budget repair, to assist in guaranteeing the services that Australians deserve, we have the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition parroting these ridiculous lines that the big banks have presumably put them up to say in this place. Also on integrity, we believe in lower taxes, of course, but we also do not believe in a selfhelp system. We think there must be integrity in our tax system. That is why it is quite extraordinary that last year, led by the shadow Assistant Treasurer here, the Labor Party voted against laws which improved multinational tax avoidance in this country. Just this week, in Senate estimates, it was confirmed that an additional $2 billion has been raised in connection with the multinational tax avoidance legislation that the Labor Party voted against. In Senate estimates it was confirmed that there was a direct connection between raising that money and the change in law. Unlike the Labor Party, we do not believe that rhetoric, trying to bash Apple and Google in this House, and voting against laws, the toughest anti-avoidance laws seen in the OECD, is consistent with that approach. So we will continue to advocate for lower taxes, but not a selfhelp system-taxes where there is integrity and where every single company, from the small milk bar to Apple and Google are paying a fair contribution of tax in this country. But the biggest disgrace of the Labor Party's approach on tax is their approach to small business-their callous disregard of small business. Do the Labor Party realise that there are literally tens of thousands of businesses in this country with a turnover of between $2 million and $10 million who should not be treated like Apple, Google, BHP Billiton or Rio Tinto? These are businesses where every single dollar in tax that they save gets reinvested into the business, gets reinvested into employing more workers and gets reinvested into increasing salaries for their workers. For so many small businesses, it is like a family. In recent years we have seen that small businesses have been the engine room of growth in jobs in this country-the absolute engine room of growth. So, when members of the Labor Party go to their electorates, they should go into those cafes and small businesses with one or two employees and tell them that they do not deserve a tax cut. Tell them that they should be treated like some big, evil multinational-as the Labor Party would say. Go into those small businesses and tell them, 'You don't deserve access to the instant asset write-off'-the $20,000 instant write-off that will now be available to businesses with a turnover of between $2 million and $10 million. You go and tell them that they do not deserve that. I can tell you right now that there are businesses with one or two employees who will have a turnover of over $2 million. And, according to the Labor Party and according to the shadow Treasurer, they should be treated like large businesses. We disagree. Perhaps the reason we disagree is that on this side of the House we have people who have come out of small businesses. Perhaps it is because we have people on this side of the House who have actually stumped up their own hard-earned-who have perhaps taken out a mortgage against their own family home to take a risk, to be entrepreneurial-to set up a small business, and they know that every single dollar of tax that they save goes to strengthen their business, and we see the benefits throughout the economy by assisting small businesses in that way. That is perhaps the most tawdry aspect of the Labor Party's approach-that they would deny tax cuts to small businesses with a turnover of between $2 million and $10 million, not only on the headline company tax rate but also the access to the small asset write-off. It is an absolute disgrace. I repeat: we on this side of the House have very different priorities from the Labor Party. We do not think it is appropriate that, for every additional dollar that somebody earns, one dollar should go to the government and one dollar should go to yourself. We do not think that you should work one day for the government and one day for yourself. We believe that, in order to incentivise people to work harder, to strive harder, to do more and to provide for their own familiesDr Leigh interjectingmoney. I know the Labor Party think that.

It is surprising that, as to that legislation, the Greens showed more economic rationality than the Labor Party. But I suppose that that just indicates how far to the left the Labor Party has gone. I would say to those sensible members of the Labor Party: take back your party, because you are now the party of high personal income tax and high corporate income tax. AndI would say: take that to the next election, shadow assistant Treasurer. Take that to the next election-tax increases for every single Australian-and I know which way the Australian people will answer. Dr LEIGH (Fenner) (15:35): Last week we saw an orgy of self-congratulation as the Liberal Party of Australia recognised the 75th anniversary of Robert Menzies's 'The forgotten people' speech. But, sadly, those opposite appear to have forgotten to read the speech, because in that speech the founder of their party says: 'The rich can look after themselves.' Those that Sir Robert Menzies was concerned about were 'salary-earners, shopkeepers, skilled artisans, professional men and women, farmers and so on'. They have forgotten the forgotten people speech. I do not have time today to refer to issues such as the fact that the party that once talked about homeownership is now the party of housing investors or that the party of schools and universities is now the party that brings down a budget cutting them. Let us just look at how Robert Menzies's forgotten people are being treated under the tax plans of those opposite. A member of parliament, who, according to the tax office's most recent statistics, earns an average of $215,000, will receive a $700 tax cut, but a flower-grower on $32,540 will receive a $162 tax rise. A cardiologist on $408,000 receives a $4,571 tax cut, but a fitness centre manager on $50,500 receives a $252 tax rise. A gastroenterologist on $380,000 receives a $4,000 tax cut, but a kindergarten teacher on $47,000 gets a $230 tax rise. A surgeon on $330,000 receives a $3,000 tax cut, but a nurse on $44,000 gets a $220 tax rise. While a magistrate on $250,000 receives a $1,400 tax cut, a hospital pharmacist on $68,000 gets a $344 tax rise. And there are those who claim that this is progressive. It is anything but. The Medicare levy is a flat tax. When you ask a hairdresser and a surgeon to each pay 0.5 per cent of their income, that is a flat tax. And Senator Scott Ryan-who has, in the past, thundered that this measure is 'highly progressive'-is dead wrong. Labor wants to retain the deficit levy because the deficit has increased tenfold and debt has increased by nearly $4,000 per person since the coalition came to office. More than nine-tenths of this-the maintained deficit levy-will be paid by the top one per cent of adults, a group that has seen a doubling in their share of national income over the last generation. With inequality at a 75 year high, it just is not fair to be raising taxes on average workers and cutting them on millionaires. Over the medium term, Labor's proposals raise more than that of the coalition. We heard this morning from the Prime Minister at CEDA that he is concerned about work disincentives. Well, if he was, he would not be concerned primarily about the work disincentives for the top two per cent, a group primarily comprised of men. He would be worried about the 10 million people that Labor is shielding from paying his increased Medicare levy. And he would be worried, too, about effective marginal tax rates. Helpfully, a report from the Australian National University prepared by David Ingles and David Plunkett goes through some of these effective marginal tax rates. For someone on a single disability support pension earning between $10,000 and $50,000, they are paying effective marginal tax rates of up to 80 per cent. For a couple with children in child care earning between $5,000 and $50,000, they are paying effective marginal tax rates between 60 per cent and 120 per cent. For an age pensioner couple earning between $20,000 and $80,000, they have effective marginal tax rates from 70 to 90 per cent. For a single person on the Newstart allowance earning between $10,000 and $25,000, they have effective marginal tax rates from 50 per cent to 100 per cent. The work disincentives are real. There are many Australians paying effective marginal tax rates of between 50 per cent and 120 per cent. Because this coalition government axed the women's budget statement, we do not have the sort of analysis that we had for 30 years. Women are going to pay higher taxes under the coalition. The women's budget statement, if it still existed, would have clearly demonstrated that. Mr Hill: Ask all the women over there! finally read the Forgotten People speech. I am sure he is recommending it to his colleagues, for at the end of the day what Robert Menzies stood for, what he fought for, and what the Liberal Party continues to fight for with its coalition colleagues in the National Party, the former Country Party, is to ensure that small business is looked after, to ensure that the small people in Australia are looked after. Yet the Labor Party, who purport to represent the workers, go against its very principles. The Labor Party are in the game of getting anything they can get their hands on. The Labor Party wish to tax the everyday household with higher electricity prices, evidenced by their 50 per cent come 100 per cent target with renewables. Labor are happy to tax the household. Labor are happy to tax the unemployed by denying them opportunities for work. By ensuring that major international investments such as the Adani project are thwarted, they are by default taxing the unemployed, denying them opportunities for work. The Galilee Basin alone is offering 15,000 jobs, yet the Labor Party are not interested in that, because they are happy to tax the unemployed. They are more than happy to tax the mum and dad investor, with a negative gearing plan that ensures that you cannot offset against personal income. They are more than happy to have the wealthy on investments, but not mum and dad investors. So the Labor Party are also happy to tax mum and dad investors. The Labor Party have made it very clear that they will change the existing legislation to hike taxes up for small businesses. So, for any business out there which has a threshold below $50 million a year in turnover, the Labor Party has already guaranteed they will increase company tax rates. By imposing and continuing to prosecute the case against the coalition's Enterprise Tax Plan, the Labor Party are guaranteeing they will increase taxes for small and medium businesses. These are 3.2 million businesses across the country, employing 6½ million Australians. The Labor Party are saying that their priority with tax is to ensure they are paying more. We know what happens with small businesses when they have to pay more tax: there is less opportunity for them to create more jobs. This is what the Labor Party",103,Matters Of Public Importance

142,Mr Ted O'brien (Fairfax) (15:41,"I am delighted that the member for Fenner hasrepresent today. They are more than happy to tax people's take-home pay and they are more than happy to oppose multinationals paying more tax. Here we have a situation, in this very term of government, in which the Labor Party has opposed a major instrument from the government to ensure that multinationals cannot avoid tax. Already in this financial year we are going to see $2 billion of tax clawed back to the Commonwealth government. That is tax that otherwise would have been avoided by multinationals. So, the Labor Party, who purport to represent the worker, are more than happy to stand there with all their rhetoric but when push comes to shove they stand for multinationals above small businesses. How does that make sense? Instead what we have from the Turnbull government is a government that is prepared to ensure an extension of the $20,000 instant asset write-off, a government that is prepared to reduce company tax, a government that is prepared to ensure that we are more competitive in the international economy so that we can attract capital. Attracting capital creates jobs, and that is what this government does. The opposition stands for nothing but taxing everything in sight and looking after the union movement, looking after the multinationals and leaving behind the people Menzies and the coalition stand for-'The Forgotten People', and I am delighted, again, that those opposite are starting to read that speech. Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (15:46): I am very pleased to speak today on this MPI on the government's tax priorities, and I thank my colleague for putting it on the agenda. The other side has a problem, and it is a stench around this budget that is lingering from 2014. In 2014 the smell of unfairness in the budget created such a backlash in the community that the government is now trying to pedal away from it. The problem they have is that there is the same smell in this budget, and it is a smell of unfairness. AndI can guarantee to those opposite that if there is one thing the Australian population are really good at it is sniffing out unfairness, and they can sniff it very clearly in this budget. The government is attempting to, if you like, Air Wick over that smell. How are they doing that? First of all, they are trying to make out that somehow they have had a road-to-Damascus conversion on the delivery of services-in particular, things like health and education. You can imagine the discussion in the lead-up to budget night: 'Let's work out the bare minimum we can do to try to say we are doing something about these issues and change the conversation, because we know we're suffering politically because of it.' So, they introduce a proposed Gonski 2.0, which is not only a $22 billion cut on what was promised in the first version but a structurally different funding proposal. At its heart, it is unfair to the vast majority of Australians. And you can see that because of all of those who are out there raising their concerns and campaigning against it, as recently-as my colleague the member for Whitlam would know, as we share an area where the New South Wales parliamentary secretary for education is very active-as when the New South Wales Minister for Education, a Liberal minister, in case it has escaped anybody's notice, shortly before question time was out there jointly with the Labor shadow minister, the Greens spokesperson and the Teachers Federation saying: 'This is a dud deal for New South Wales and the kids I represent. Give us back the money you cut.' That is what your New South Wales Liberal minister said before you came back into this place. Mr Rick Wilson interjectingMs BIRD: The member wants to know whether I will back what they say on education. Yes, I will. And we have said that publicly, because they are right: you are cutting from every one of their schools. And if you are worried about what we are saying, I would suggest that you be more worried about what your New South Wales Liberal colleagues are saying on this Gonski hoax. Secondly, on health: 'Let's say we are winding back the freeze-except we will just extend it for so long, and then, as we've subsequently discovered, we'll cover as minimal a number of Medicare items as we can', so that, as my colleague indicated, a significant number of people in life-threatening circumstances are not going to see the freeze wound back for years. It stinks and the general public know it. That is why they are having so much trouble with it. The second Air Wick tactic they are rolling out with this budget is to launch a personal attack to get stuck into the Leader of the Opposition about what his position is on issues such as the NDIS. I have to say that I think it is disgraceful of the Prime Minister to stand at the dispatch box and attack the Leader of the Opposition for having a debate about how we fund the NDIS and to use that to question and to accuse him of not caring about people with a disability. Mr Speaker, you can tell when the Prime Minister is panicked because he goes way down the low road. I would suggest he does not do it naturally, and therefore not very effectively. He is going to grab that stick every time he can because he is in panic about his own leadership. So we get an attack from the person who is now the Prime Minister, saying to the Leader of the Opposition, 'What do you stand for?' You have got to be kidding me. This Prime Minister is struggling in the polls because nobody knows what he stands for. Gone is the leather jacket. Gone is his commitment to same-sex marriage. Gone is the idea, 'I won't lead a government that doesn't take strong action on climate change.' If anybody has a problem with consistency it is this Prime Minister. I would suggest to him, as much as he wants to go on the low road and attack the Leader of the Opposition, he ought to look in the mirror first because he has no legitimacy on that. This is a dud budget. It smells and the people of Australia know it. spouting about unfair taxes. I am sure he knows more about unfair taxes than any other member of this parliament-maybe the member for Lilley knows about them as well. 'Taxes, taxes and more taxes' is a phrase I am almost certain headlines the Labor Party's national platform and constitution. We sure did see some unfair taxes during those haunting Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. I am sure those on the other side have a very short memory when it comes to unfair taxes. Those are years tainted by exactly what the shadow Treasurer is claiming yet again here in the chamber. Perhaps he has forgotten it is 2017 and those days are behind. Perhaps he has wiped them from his memory. We can all breathe a sigh of relief that the government is now in the hands of the coalition, who have continued to deliver on our priorities and deliver on our promises. It is the Labor Party that on one hand will tell the Australian people they support the bank levy, but then seem to walk in here every day spouting the big lines from the big banks and what Anna Bligh seems to give them the night before so they can stop the levy. In fact, Labor never seemed to support the concept of fairness; they simply supported whatever made the big",105,Matters Of Public Importance
143,Mr Irons (Swan) (15:51,"Isn't it ironic that the member for McMahon is in here again,business and union monies flow into their election campaigns, all the while telling everyday Australians that they were standing up for them. I would like to take the House and members present on a brief walk down memory lane with regard to unfair taxes, particularly those imposed by those opposite when they were in governmentMr Rick Wilson interjectingfrom Western Australia. Let's start with the mining tax. We all remember what the mining tax did to the Western Australian economy. If we look back, it started its early phases with the minerals resource rent tax. It passed the House on 23 November 2011 and passed the Senate on 19 March 2012. Mr Speaker, can you believe a total of $22.5 billion was expected or proposed by those on that side to have been raised over the first four years of the tax, to be spent on pensions, tax cuts for small businesses-which went into the ether and they blamed us for that when it was their own fault-and infrastructure projects. There was a promise of $100 million to the Western Australian economy which never materialised either. In the May 2012 budget, the government said this tax would bring in $3 billion for the financial year. In October 2012, that figure was reduced to $2 billion. On 14 May 2013, it was announced that the receipts were expected to be-can you guess, member for O'Connor?-from $22.5 billion down to less than $200 million. How successful was that unfair tax that was imposed on the Western Australian economy and the Queensland economy by those opposite while they were in government? Mr Perrett interjectingchair. there, claiming credibility that they are the greatest economic managers the world has ever seen. Still paying back the prepayments of the taxes with regard to the mining taxes is what we are doing. The tax also proved to be complex and expensive to operate. It cost more than $50 million to set up, with estimated running costs of $20 million a year, and advertising came to nearly $40 million. And we cannot forget that other tax which was anti Western Australia, the carbon tax. Again, this was a very unfair tax and we got rid of it. When the coalition came into government we got rid of those unfair taxes that everyone in Australia knew were unfair. Yet, here they are telling us we are imposing unfair taxes. It is the coalition government that is securing our nation's future. We are the government that has delivered a budget that secures the essential services that Australian's rely on, a budget that delivers fairness in ensuring our education and disability services are paid for, and a budget that is supporting economic growth and generating opportunities. I would like to run through some of the ways this government is doing just that. In fact, just today this House is debating our decision to extend the $20,000 instant asset write-off for small businesses by 12 months. We will also pass tax cuts for businesses with turnovers of up to $50 million, legislating the entirety of the smalland medium-business tax cut we promised to deliver under our Enterprise Tax Plan. This effectively allows businesses to grow, invest and employ more Australians, which I am sure every person in this House would support. Our tax cuts",107,Matters Of Public Importance

146,Mr Irons,"They seem to forget that they were imposing unfair taxes and they now sitwill affect 3.2 million small and medium Aussie businesses. If anyone can call that an unfair tax or say that it is imposing taxes on the business sector, they are getting it totally wrong. Swan, and I want to return to one of the things he said in his speech. He said that this budget-the Turnbull government's budget-is all about delivering on the coalition's promises. It is not delivering on that promise of no new taxes-the promise of no new taxes that was delivered by the member for Warringah, the banker of the backbench, right before the 2013 election. Instead, we have a budget that Treasurer Morrison has delivered that is going to basically ask hard working people to pay for a $60 billion tax giveaway for big business. I remember when the deficit levy came in-the temporary levy, as it is now called by those opposite. They call it the temporary levy, forgetting that its title is actually the deficit levy. They are saying: 'We can't change anything, because it's got the word temporary in front of it. Therefore, we have to give all these millionaires a tax break from 1 July, in 30 days time.' But, really, it was all about fixing the deficit. We still have a deficit. In fact, the deficit is even worse than the one delivered by smoking Joe Hockey in his 2014 budget. It is actually 10 times worse. How can it be fair to cut the tax of high-income earners from 1 July while at the same time increase the tax for lowand middle-income earners-in fact for 10 million Australians. The member for Swan did not mention that in his speech, I note. It is unfair to cut the take-home pay of 700,000 shift workers by up to $77 a week. These are the people who need it most, but, instead that is what the government has made a priority. These scenarios are not scenes from a tin-pot dictatorship; this is Australia, under the Turnbull government, announcing this in its budget three weeks ago. It is an inherently unfair budget. Even though the Treasurer mentioned the words fair, fairer and fairness 10 times during his speech, we know what his approach to 'fair' really is. He is all thesaurus and no heart when it comes to fairness. This government is so out of touch. The deficit is out of control under them, and we are about to have a coalition government start its fifth year in office. There comes a time when you have to say, 'We are in control of where the ship is located.' Eventually, the bridge of the ship of state has to be grabbed by the coalition. I know they govern like they are in opposition, but the reality is they are about to start their fifth year. We know that budgets are always about choices, and haven't we seen the Turnbull government's values crystallise in this 2017 budget? What have we seen? They are looking after big corporations, including foreign corporations, and conglomerates, the millionaires and billionaires. This is fundamentally unfair and, dare I say, un-Australian. It is un-Australian if you are going to be attacking working Australians-10 million of them-at a time when the real wages of Australians have actually gone backwards. We have had the lowest annual wages growth on record since the ABS first published data in 1997. We have real increases of 1.9 per cent, not enough to actually cope with the cost-of-living increases. So, if you earn $60,000 a year, you will be paying an extra $300 in tax; but, if you earn a million dollars, you get to pay $16,400 less-not more; less. That might sound fair in Point Piper, but I can tell you it sounds fundamentally unfair in Sherwood, in Fairfield, in Oxley, in Meruka, in Coopers Plains and in Runcorn. The reason millionaires will be paying less is that this government says, 'No, we can't continue this deficit levy, even though the deficit has",108,Matters Of Public Importance

Finance minister Senator Cormann said that the levy would 'ensure higher income Australians contribute to the budget repair'. Well, the budget still needs to be repaired. As I said, the deficit is actually almost 10 times worse than the one handed down by Joe Hockey. It is ridiculous. chosen to discuss the issue of tax for today's MPI. As I understand it, the idea of the MPI is for oppositions to raise issues that are favourable to them. And, on tax, the opposition's policies are absolutely appalling. There are so many examples to run through it is a very odd strategic choice. I know the shadow Treasurer has had a rough few weeks; he has been fluffing around on the bank tax, effectively running the lines of the banks and really failing to make any headway there. Maybe he has said, 'Look, we'll have the MPI about tax; it'll be really good for us.' But that was a really bad calculation, because the Labor Party's policies on tax are appalling. One of my personal favourites of Labor's appalling policies is their extraordinary policy on capital gains tax. You will recall they said that, because of the housing affordability issues in Sydney and Melbourne, they want to raise capital gains tax by 50 per cent on everything. So the Labor Party, those opposite, propose to increase capital gains tax by 50 per cent on everything-not just housing investment, but also investment in farms, investment in factories, investment in cafes. They want to increase tax on all of those investments by 50 per cent because of issues to do with housing affordability in Sydney and Melbourne. That is an extraordinarily stupid policy and the impact of it would be to reduce investment. That is the last thing we want. What we want is more investment, particularly in small and medium businesses. So we say, let's reduce the rate of company tax for small to medium businesses from 30 per cent to 25 per cent and, happily, the Senate agreed. The Senate, to its credit, supported that legislation. But what those opposite say is: 'No. That is bad legislation and it should not be allowed to occur for businesses with turnover of more than $2 million.' What that meansand this is very clear-is that those opposite are advocating a $30 billion tax increase on small to medium businesses in Australia. If my characterisation of that is not right, I would welcome any of the members on the opposition benches to say so, or perhaps the shadow Treasurer could come into the chamber and say that that is not the case and the opposition will not be increasing tax on small to medium business by $30 billion if elected. But he will not do that, because that is their policy. You cannot oppose a tax decrease without supporting a tax increase, and that is what they do. They also think that businesses with more than $2 million of revenue are not small. I think a lot of them over there do not understand the difference between revenue and profit. Of course, there might be a business with revenue of, say, $2 million but its profit margin might be three or four per cent. There are a lot of small businesses with very small profit margins. So that business with $2 million of turnover might in fact be making $100,000 or less. It might be making the average wage. Labor says that is a vast corporation which must be treated in a different way to small businesses and, as a consequence, should not be allowed to claim the $20,000 instant asset write-off. That is just an absurd policy, because plainly those small businesses of between $2 million and $10 million need that support. It is a very effective policy, the instant asset write-",109,Matters Of Public Importance
148,Mr Coleman (Banks) (16:01,"I cannot believe that those opposite have actuallyoff. It encourages investment in local communities and those opposite say it is a bad idea, again betraying their lack of understanding in this area. We also know that they oppose the government's sensible measure to fully fund the NDIS through an increase in the Medicare levy. They left us with this $55 billion hole in the NDIS system. They say that if someone is earning $85,000 they should not be asked to contribute to the National Disability Insurance Scheme funding, but if someone is earning $87,000 they should. So someone earning $87,000 is apparently rich and able to contribute and someone earning $85,000 or $86,000 is not. That is an absurd policy; it makes no sense at all. It is entirely appropriate for all Australians to contribute. We know, of course, about their failure on the multinational tax legislation, where they shamefully voted against the legislation which the government has passed and which has already raised more than $2 billion. So it was a very bad choice to raise this issue as it is of great vulnerability for the opposition and a great strength for the government. (Time expired) Ms LAMB (Longman) (16:06): We have all heard members on the right claim that they are all for lower taxes. Their advertising often uses this as a single-minded proposition. In their latest budget, handed down recently by the Treasurer of course, that is absolutely what they did-but only for the highest-income earners. For everyone else-for the true, ordinary hard working Australians-guess what? They are getting a tax hike. This is clearly a budget that is designed to make the rich richer and the poor poorer. It is what can only be described as a simple-minded proposition. This is an unfair budget, not a fair budget. This is a budget that makes life harder for ordinary Australians and it could not come at a worse time. It comes at a time when the latest ABS figures show that wage growth is at its lowest-ever levels-1.9 per cent wages growth. It comes at a time when the general cost of living is increasing by 2.1 per cent. So there is low wages growth of 1.9 per cent and the cost of living is 2.1 per cent. It does not take much to do the maths there, does it? And it comes at a time when this government makes a cruel and senseless attack on workers by cutting the take-home pay of 700,000 Australians. Come1 July a retail worker earning $60,000 a year could have their pay cut by up to $77 a week, thanks to this government's slashing their hard-earned penalty rates. And due to this very careless budget, not only will they get an extra $77 pay cut a weekMr Pasin interjectingMs LAMB: they will get an extra $300 in taxes under your government-under your government! At the very same time as they are getting slugged an extra $300 a week, a millionaire will be getting a tax cut of $16,400. Mr Sukkar: It's rude to point! Ms LAMB: Let me tell you, there are not too many millionaires in my electorate. I would like to know how anybody could even consider this as fair. How could anyone consider this budget, that is seeing every single Australian who earns less than $180,000 a year worse off, fair? Instead of making life easier for people who are really struggling to get by, this Prime Minister decided to attack them with $21 billion in taxes-$21 billion! Instead, he is letting money flow overseas, with a huge $65 billion tax cut to big business. Instead, he is lining the pockets of millionaires with over $16,000 a year-$16,000! Let me tell you what $16,000 is in my electorate: that is 60 per cent of the median personal income of the people in Longman-$16,000. One thing Australians know is where their Prime Minister's priorities lie. They lie with the rich and the wealthy, and so do the other members of this government. We cannot go too hard at all on this Prime Minister, because I do not think he knows any better. I do not think he has ever had to struggle to pay and go without a meal. If he has, I would like to hear about it. I do not think he has ever had to wonder about being able to afford to pay his rent. I wonder whether he has ever done that. I think people would expect our Prime Minister to listen to them, to find out what is going on, to try and understand how tough life can be on the other side of the coin, when you cannot afford to pay your rent and you cannot afford food. Instead, people know who has their ear, and that is us-the Labor Party. We are listening to people, because when you listen you hear things. Mr Pasin interjectingMs LAMB: Member for Barker, you might be well advised to take some advice there. When you listen you hear things. We are hearing that people are saying they do not want the Turnbull government to give huge tax cuts to big businesses. That is what people are telling us. They should be paying their fair share-that is what people are telling us. On this side of the chamber what we hear is that Australian people know that this is an unfair budget. It is riddled with unfair priorities and it does nothing to further increase income equality in Australia. I can tell you that not once have I been stopped in the main street of Caboolture by someone who said, 'Please give my bank more money. Please make sure that they get a tax cut.' Not once! But let me tell you that the 85,000 people in Longman earning less than $52,000 a year need a break. in this debate. She said that people in her community, Caboolture, do not want her to give banks a tax cut. What she needs to do is speak to the member for McMahon, because he comes in here, day in day out, arguing the case on behalf of the big banks, saying, 'No, no, no! We can't afford a levy. Please don't levy us! We are just humble Australian banks.' It might behove the member for Longman to work out that this government in this budget made a commitment to ask the banks of this country, the five big banks who have been the major beneficiaries of 26 years of unbridled and continuous economic growth, to put a small contribution to the economic welfare of this nation into the community chest. That is our position. She might want to speak to her shadow Treasurer, because he comes in here day after day giving us the banks' lines. How far the once proud Labor Party has moved from that time under Hawke and Keating, when they were principled and fought the good fight. There is time for governing and there is time for politicking. Unfortunately, what we see on the other side now is this constant barrage of politicking. They have dropped the pretence of fairness in favour of political expediency. If they were truly concerned about what was fair they would look at this budget and say, 'It's a fair cop-you've looked at what has been the needed, you've made some serious concessions, and we'll meet you in the middle. We'll extend a hand over the gap.' They would come to us on things like Gonski and say, 'For a very long time we've been arguing in favour of Gonski. We've been asking you to give a Gonski. In fact you have given a Gonski and we're prepared to meet you in the middle.'",110,Matters Of Public Importance
149,Mr Pasin (Barker) (16:11,"I think the member for Longman has got a little bit confusedBut that is not what we see here. They would be saying that a fair and reasonable way to fund the NDIS is a one-half of one per cent increase to the Medicare levy on all Australians earning above the appropriate threshold. But they do not do that. They come in here and try to engage in the kind of class politics which, quite frankly, denigrates them and runs down this whole place. At one stage they ran a campaign saying that we need to maintain the universality of Medicare. Those of us on this side of the House understand how important the universality of Medicare is. But in the very same breath they say, 'This NDIS, which we want to be great champions of-and, by the way, we didn't fully fund-we only want certain segments of the community to make a contribution for that.' That is running down the concept of universality in this space and it is not fair. And what they do not say in this debate, of course, is that the millionaires they like to speak of would pay a half of one per cent additional levy on their full income; they would be making a disproportionately significant contribution to meeting the needs of everyday ordinary Australians who, sadly, suffer from a disability; or indeed they would be making provision for those who may one day become disabled-and there, but for the grace of God, go I. In the time. I have left, I want to make an observation about small business. There is a constant debate in this place about who is here to represent small business. Well, I do not know whether I represent small businesses but I come from a family who runs small businesses and I have run a small business in partnership with my wife. The member for Longman said that some on the other side do not know what it is like to go without. Well, let me tell you, in my small business there were times where I went without because I had to make sure the wages were paid.

Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation For Small Business Entities) Bill 2017 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms PRICE (Durack) (16:16): I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation For Small Business Entities) Bill 2017. It is worth noting that I follow the member for Barker. I believe he is a true champion of the small business sector, even though he may not believe that himself, so it is timely that we are talking about what is great about small businesses and how we are supporting them. This bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to enable small businesses with aggregated annual turnover of less than $10 million to claim an immediate tax deduction for eligible individual assets costing less than $20,000 first used, installed or ready by 30 June 2018. This bill extends by 12 months the popular and successful 2015-16 budget measure 'Growing Jobs and Small Business-expanding accelerated depreciation for small businesses'. This is welcome news. This legislation was introduced in 2015 after extensive stakeholder consultation, including with the Australian Taxation Office, small business stakeholder",112,Matters Of Public Importance
150,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Irons,"The time allotted for this discussion has nowgroups and professional tax and accounting bodies. There has been very strong stakeholder support for extending this measure in addition to all the other hundreds of small businesses around the country. Extending the time in which small businesses can depreciate capital expenditures at the higher threshold will improve cash flow and business activity by releasing those funds back to the small business owner that would otherwise be tied up in depreciating assets. This is good news for small business. So why are small businesses so important? A strong and successful small business community means simply more jobs for Australians and more opportunities to build vibrant local communities right across the country. Small business employs by far the highest number of Australians when compared to any other sector. We all know that. We hear that almost daily in this place. There are more than six million Australians employed in small businesses across Australia. Small businesses create employment and pay tax at a rate not seen by any other sector in our business community. That is why it is so important for all of us in here to support small business, to support those people in this country who are simply having a go. They are putting their own money at risk. As we heard from the member for Barker, sometimes they do not get paid because the staff have to be paid first. My electorate is known for its big business-the miners, the oil and gas companies. Those big businesses generate billions of dollars into our economy and we are all very grateful for that. But there are also 16,000 small businesses in my electorate of Durack. Those small businesses drive our regional economies, they drive regional employment and, by extension, they drive regional growth and development. Without small business, our regional economies would simply fall in a hole. We have seen that especially with the downturn of the construction of the various mining projects. The small businesses have really been the glue that has held many of our regional communities together. You and I both know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that governments do not create jobs, but they do create opportunity, and that is indeed what the private sector does with our supportenterprising Australians who have a work ethic and a propensity for risk, who start their own business, who identify a gap in the market, who work day and night to get themselves ahead. I want to applaud all of those thousands of small businesses in Durack, people who get up every morning and then go to bed at night knowing that they are going to have to do it all over again the next day. These are the people who create opportunity, and they create jobs. Government merely creates the policy to support these people, and we should be backing small businesses every day. That is why I and many other members on this side of the House are proud to support those people. I am proud to say that we come here with a policy agenda that aims to cut the red tape and cut the costs involved in investing in a small business. Sadly, we know that those opposite have shown a complete lack of interest in supporting these types of measures that will really support the engine room of Australia and some of the other policies this government is seeking to push through this parliament in order to secure jobs and secure growth in the future. Those members opposite have instead sought to fall back on the usual rank hypocrisy, as is their wont, and instead are criticising, as we have heard numerous times over the last couple of weeks, our government's corporate tax cut initiatives. And that is in spite of comments made by their leader, their Treasurer, their Assistant Treasurer and their Minister for Finance. These four are all on record as supporting a cut to company tax-and we will get back to that particular issue shortly. We have heard from many of our small business contacts throughout the electorate that the extension of this depreciation initiative is one of the highlights of the federal budget. And why wouldn't it be? This is very easily one of the most popular small business incentives and encourages the almost 3.2 million small businesses in Australia to invest in themselves and create job opportunities for their fellow Australians. This government has a proven record of supporting the small business sector by building up the engine room of the economy. We can guarantee growth, we can guarantee investment, we can guarantee lifestyle and we can guarantee jobs if we back the small business sector. But I am not sure that those opposite understand this simple concept. They seem to think that jobs simply fall from the sky. Well, maybe in the various jobs they have worked in that is what happens, but you and I both know that it takes hard work and it needs a good policy agenda to ensure that small business is supported so it can grow, so we can create the jobs of the future and make sure our grandchildren have a job. But those opposite seem to think our 25 consecutive years of growth is something that just happens by accident. But, put simply, if a business owner is given an incentive-and they are, in this legislation-to invest in their business, to receive a tax break, then they will. That investment allows them to expand, and hopefully that expansion will create a job or two. That can then be repeated across the 3.2 million small businesses in Australia. This feeds into this government's holistic approach to job creation, wage growth and training. We have committed to cutting small business tax as well as the corporate tax rate to keep us economically competitive. Make no mistake: as global economies become more interconnected and capital flows across jurisdictions far more than it used to, we enter a new era of corporate competition. Australians are no longer competing for jobs against those who studied for the same degree as they did, perhaps at UWA or Curtin; they are competing with graduates from around the world. And for Australia as a nation it is no different. We need to be creating the perfect conditions for foreign investment, because to do so ensures that our young people have good jobs to move into once they finish their degree of choice. That means that a variety of measures, including a lower maximum income tax rate and a lower corporate tax rate, are of benefit to us. We know that, by doing all of those things, we will get growth and we will create jobs. By and large, this is just a sensible approach to ensure the jobs are created. The hypocrisy, time and time again, displayed by those opposite on this issue is as breathtaking as anything that we have seen previously. The following is a direct quote from the Leader of the Opposition when he was Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation back in 2012: Any student of Australian business and economic history since the mid-80s knows that part of Australia's success was derived through the reduction in the company tax rate. Those words are direct from-we will not say the horse's mouth because that might sound unparliamentary. This is simply one of the arrows in this government's quiver that we are aiming to bring to bear on the issue of joblessness and slowing growth. But there are many other measures in the budget that we have just brought down recently which are going to lead to improvement in growth. This government has introduced several programs that will address issues around unemployment and, by extension, address our rising welfare bill, our slowing growth and our rising debt. We are aware of these issues, as you are, Mr Deputy Speaker Irons, and we are, no doubt, putting our shoulder to the grind and developing some policy that is actually going to help. Rather than follow the example of those opposite and throw money at our welfare bill and, sadly, our ballooning debt, we are sticking to the simple concept that the best form of welfare anyone can have is a job. AndI know that you know that only too well, Mr Deputy Speaker. When someone gets a job there are a large amount of flow-on effects that come with it. We know that their health improves, resulting in less public spending on health. We know that these people are then able to afford rent and, maybe if they are lucky, afford to save for a deposit, together with the new-it is such a great initiative that I have forgotten the words! We have the assistant minister down here. It is relating to helping people get into their first home. I have forgotten the words! Ms PRICE: That is it. It is good that we have a lot of these initiatives that are going to help young people get into their first job. We all know that people with jobs experience a boost to their self-esteem, meaning they have more drive and motivation to apply for, and continue in, employment. And, hopefully, they will be able to proceed along those lines. There is no government welfare program that can deliver those benefits. There is no welfare program that can benefit anybody quite like a job can. That is why the employment programs that we have introduced are so important. It is why I am proud to stand on this side of the House with a suite of employment programs aimed at mobilising the unemployed and getting as many as we can into an appropriate job. You may have heard, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we have just recently rolled out the Youth Jobs PaTH program, which will benefit those in the largest city in my electorate, Geraldton. I have to say: I just saw a media release before I left. The City of Geraldton itself has taken on a couple of interns with respect to this program. That was literally before I came here. That is, indeed, good news. The reason why it is good news is Geraldton, at the last assessment, had an unemployment rate of about 8.5 per cent, which is some 2.5 per cent above the state average. So they need all the help they can get. So good on the City of Geraldton for taking on a couple of young interns. My electorate of Durack, as a whole, has 3,700 young people aged between 15 and 24 who are not currently employed. This needs to stop. This has to be addressed. This is urgent. This is what this government is aiming to address. Geraldton really needs more employment programs just like I have described. I am very glad to see that this program has been rolled out. The other thing that I would like to touch on is the shipbuilding program and the benefits that Western Australia will get from defence spending. This is why we need to be supporting our businesses and our industries, so there is actually a job available for young jobseekers to take. We need to promote those industries that encourage the employment of our jobseekers. In Geraldton, I recently hosted the Centre for Defence Industry Capability and the Department of Defence, and I represented the Minister for Defence Industry, Christopher Pyne, in detailing how the important $89 billion naval shipbuilding program could provide opportunities for the city and the region, and more broadly for regional Western Australia.",113,Bills
151,Honourable Members Interjecting,"We know that there is a tremendous degree of skill in Geraldton and more broadly in the Mid West with respect to the marine industry. But there is also a high degree of engineering capability in the city, coming off the back of the mining industry, which could be diversified into the shipbuilding, maintenance and sustainment work. In the Mid West there are several companies involved in the commercial boatbuilding industry and several more with potential to be involved in the supply chain for these vessels. This is really great news and a fabulous opportunity for anyone who is looking to diversify their business, because we know that the potential for a student currently studying in year 12 to spend their entire life working in the shipbuilding industry and also in Western Australia is now a real possibility, and it is something that we should celebrate every day we come into this place. I am almost out of time, but to round out all the opportunities in the budget I just want to give another shout out to the Geraldton Universities model, which is going to allow regional kids to stay at home. This is what we strive for in regional Western Australia and in Australia more broadly so that a young person does not need to pack their bags and be a financial impost on their family. It is something I am particularly proud of. We got a commitment of $15 million in the budget, and it is certainly going to help young people to get the education that they deserve. Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) (16:31): I think it is interesting that yet again from the member for Durack we hear claims that nobody on this side of the House has any idea about small business, yet there are people here who have been in small business for much of their career. There are people who have partners in small business. It really behoves those opposite to take a look at the expertise on our benches. You are going to be looking at it all too soon from the other side if you are lucky enough to still be here. Labor will support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation For Small Business Entities) Bill 2017 to extend by 12 months to 30 June 2018 the period in which small business entities can temporarily access expanded accelerated depreciation rules. AndI am not going to have to switch this speech into a speech about jobseekers and universities, because I will be able to talk about small business and what we want to see for small business for my remaining 14 minutes and five seconds. Labor recognises that Australia's small businesses make a huge contribution to our national prosperity, including providing a livelihood for millions of Australians. Over two million businesses-sole traders, partnerships, trusts and small employers-have helped underpin more than 25 years of continuous economic growth. In my electorate of Macquarie, there are around 11,000 businesses, with around 5,000 of those employing one person or more locally. Until July last year, I ran a small businesses. Those opposite look a bit surprised: 'Gosh-are people who support Labor allowed to run businesses?' In fact that is how I came to appreciate the benefits to the economy that a Labor government brings. I started a business when things were definitely tough for the country, but we had the right policies in place to take us through. I grew up in small business. My father was a newsagent. I looked at what it takes to be a good employer, to know that you are making money out of your staff but that you are treating them as family. Then you have a loyalty-something those opposite have no comprehension of. Labor is very proud to have led the debate in this policy area. I believe that in recent years in particular we have offered really practical policies to support Australia's industrious small business sector. Above all, we know that if people do not have cash in their pockets to spend in their local businesses, those local businesses will not survive. And that is one of the key things those opposite do not understand. They do not appreciate the impact that taking penalty rates out of someone's pocket is going to have in my electorate from 1 July. Last year, we took a comprehensive suite of small business policies to the federal election including a responsible plan to cut company tax for small businesses with turnovers of less than $2 million. As a small-business person, I struggle to understand how you can justify a $10 million turnover for a small business. Once you are turning over $10 million, unless you are doing something really, really clever that I am not sure would be legal, you really have to question whether you are running as a medium-size business, with all the supports that your staff need, or whether you are simply running as a small, do-it-all-yourself business. I would argue that once you start to get up past $2 million, you should be putting in the supports of a medium-sized business. We are very firm that businesses with under a $2 million a year turnover definitely deserve that extra incentive for the hard work that we all know they do. We also took to the election a plan to level the playing field for small businesses by ensuring that multinationals pay their fair share of tax. There is nothing worse, as a small business, than seeing this uneven playing field where these gods up here seem to get away with blue murder and you, the small-business person working seven days a week, often 15 or 16 hours a day, giving up your Sundays to do your MYOB, can see the unfairness of that situation. We also took a plan to help small businesses incorporate without additional red tape, because we recognise that a lot of businesses do miss out on some of the tax benefits by not being incorporated, yet they do find it daunting to go through the current process. We also took a range of other innovative policies to assist small businesses better access finance and help entrepreneurs start their own businesses. I am pleased to say that Labor has continued to fight for small business in this parliament, and I am pleased to have been part of that fight. We continue to develop and advocate for policy that will benefit Australian small businesses, helping them to grow and prosper. I just want to talk about a couple of those policies. In February we introduced into the Senate the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017. These access to justice reforms would help small businesses take cases of anticompetitive behaviour to court. Can you imagine what it is like as a small business when you are up against one of the big guys? It is bad enough in the advertising war, let alone when there is a legal issue at stake. We know small businesses are less likely to take up private litigation against anticompetitive behaviour. It is just too daunting. There is too much at stake-often their home. It is because big businesses have deep pockets and armies of lawyers, so the risk of small businesses being overwhelmed and having to pay the big business's legal fees is a significant obstacle. The Productivity Commission and the government's own competition review say that small businesses are disadvantaged in the court process. But the Turnbull government has refused to address this inequity. Labor's bill will restore the balance by letting a small business request a no adverse costs order very early in the court case. This will help level the playing field, give them confidence to pursue cases and encourage more small businesses to take on anticompetitive behaviour. The other policy area that we have done a lot of work on and have announced is a package of reforms to tackle illegal company phoenixing, a practice that often leaves small businesses-tradies, people who have put in the blood, sweat and tears-ending up with no money. They end up with unpaid debts that they are never able to recover. They have bought the materials, they have done the work, they have paid their staff but no-one is paying their bills. I draw the House's attention to some comments that were made just yesterday by the Australian Taxation Office commissioner, Chris Jordan, who confirmed that there really is a need for action on dodgy phoenix operators who deliberately burn companies in an attempt to avoid their obligations to employees, taxpayers and honest businesses. The tax commissioner told a Senate estimates committee: 'This is not a new issue. Phoenixing is a big problem, especially when you have these people that are unassociated with the principles. You cannot keep track.' There we have the ATO telling us how difficult it is to keep track of people intent on doing the wrong thing. When speaking about how easy it is to become a company director in Australia, Mr Jordan said this to a senator: 'I could appoint you as a company director without you even knowing and me then controlling the company.' That shows you the holes that there are at the moment. The tax commissioner also noted: 'In other countries proper identification checks are required for anyone wanting to become a director.' Apparently, here, you can almost register your dog as a company director because there are no checks required. Illegal phoenix activity costs our economy billions of dollars annually, and that is why we have announced the following measures. First, we want to require all company directors to obtain a unique director identification number, with a 100-point identification and check. We expect this of so many other people. If you are on Centrelink you have to have a number. If you are receiving a Medicare benefit you have a unique number and it does not change. If you are registering for any other government facility or service you need a number. Yet, for some reason, you can set up a business and not be identified. So the 100-point check is a really good step. It is only as hard as getting a bank account. Second, increasing penalties will also be associated with phoenix activity; third, we want to introduce an objective test for transactions depriving employees of their entitlements; and, fourth, we want to clarify the availability of compensation orders against accessories. These measures are based on recommendations from the Melbourne Law School/Monash Business School Phoenix Research Team recommendations. They are well thought through and they are very much needed. It is just not us calling for a director identification number; among the people who think it might not be such a bad idea are the Productivity Commission, the Australian institute of Company Directors, the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Master Builders Australia, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Restructuring Insolvency and Turnaround Association and, of course, the Phoenix Project. So you do have to wonder why, when it is such a sensible idea, that is not the legislation that we are discussing right now. But let me turn to the instant asset write-off. It was Labor who first identified the value for Australian small businesses in increasing the immediate deductibility threshold. I remember when Labor was in government in 2012 that the threshold for small businesses to write off capital purchases increased from $1,000 to $6,500. That increase meant that it became a bit easier to buy, say, the $3,000 piece of equipment and receive deductibility in the same financial year. That was a good move for a small business that wanted to become slightly bigger. I first became aware of the whole cost-of-growth issue as a fledgling business in the early nineties. As a journalist I had reported on the issue of cost of growth in the eights from Old Parliament House, but I had not really understood it until I experienced-the issue being, of course, that if you want to grow your business there is often a significant leap of faith that you have to take to hire more people, rent bigger premises or buy a new piece of equipment. A higher instant asset write-off does not solve all those problems at once, but it does mean that the cost of an asset is defrayed more quickly in one go rather than by using depreciation over several years. As a small business operator, I was pretty shocked that, among the many horrors of the 2014-15 budget, the Abbott wound back this successful Labor initiative. It reinforced my view that Liberal governments might pay lip-service to small business but, at their heart, they are a friend of big business every single time. They only come to the side of small business when they are dragged kicking and screaming. And, thankfully, they were dragged. Just 12 months later, the Abbott government belatedly recognised the error of their way and appreciated the value of Labor's instant asset write-off policy, reinstating and extending it to $20,000. While Labor does welcome the Turnbull government's decision to extent the small business instant asset write-off, we also note that this measure is expected to cost the budget almost $1 billion in 2018-19. With this expense on the budget, Labor wants to ensure that the predicted economic benefits are being delivered. And we call on the government to evaluate and release the evaluation in full prior to any further extension. That is a sensible measure. I think small businesses would also like to see what the economic benefit is. They are frugal with their money. They know you just cannot throw it around. They would appreciate knowing that an initiative has not just been for their benefit but has also been for a broader economic benefit. Regrettably, this budget has failed to address many other significant issues facing Australian small business. Small business owners right across the country have talked to Labor and, in my electorate of Macquarie, have talked to me about rising energy costs, inadequate broadband infrastructure and late or delayed payments as key priorities for them and some of the things that they want the government to address. Waiting for payment-and I speak from experience-is debilitating for a small business. Getting the cash flow right is one of the biggest challenges that you face as a small business, because the first thing you do is pay your staff and your overheads; the last thing you do is pay yourself, let alone put anything aside for super. This budget contains no effort to address the payment terms problem exposed in the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman's recent report into the practice. This is another issue we need to see addressed. The NBN-it is hard to know where to start. The hopelessness of the NBN rollout in the electorate of Macquarie has really put pressure on small businesses. The reliance on fibre to the node in the upper Blue Mountains is a major issue for all sorts of professionals who run their businesses from home or who like to work from home some of the time. For an architect, for an engineer, for the accounting firms shifting large volumes of data or for the creatives in my electorate who want to upload amazing video and digital data, it is really difficult. In fact, one of my small businesses has had to relocate from the Blue Mountains down to the bottom of the mountains in Penrith, in the seat of Lindsay, where, thanks to Labor, he can access fibre to the premises. NBN should have been a game changer and a way to improve the economy in regions like mine, which are a long way from the CBD. Sadly, that is not going to be the case. This budget was an opportunity for the government to prioritise small business and for the Prime Minister to prioritise small business over his best friends at the big end of town. Yet, again, the Prime Minister and this government failed. Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation For Small Business Entities) Bill 2017. This bill provides for the extension of the instant asset write-off provision, which was introduced in the May 2015 budget. The provision allows small businesses with a turnover of up to $10 million-it has been increased from $2 million-to claim an instant deduction on capital equipment up to the value $20,000. I thank the member for Macquarie for her support for this terrific initiative. It is good to see the member for Paterson here as well supporting small business. I suspect that these members will be trotted out fairly regularly when the opposition talk about small business. Their entire contingent is here, I think. It is good to see you are here supporting small businesses. Mr Deputy Speaker Irons, if I may, I would like to use you as an example of a small businessman who has carved out a very successful career. I know that you were described as a 'privileged white man' during the election campaign, but I happen to know that you did come from humble beginnings. You got a trade and developed a very successful business. That, to me, embodies the story of small business-people can come from any type of beginning and if they have some initiative, are prepared to work hard and are prepared to take a risk, they can carve out a successful business and a very good life for themselves and their family. I take my hat off to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the success that you have made of your life and your business. BeforeI get into the detail of the legislation and how it impacts on my electorate, I want to thank Minister McCormack, who visited my electorate of O'Connor several weeks ago, just before the budget was handed down. We held a series of forums. They were very well attended by very well-engaged small businesspeople across the electorate. The minister was accompanied by Kate Carnell, who is the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman; Dr Michael Schaper, who is the Deputy Chairman of the ACCC, and Les De Wind, who is an Assistant Commissioner with the ATO. I know that the small businesspeople across my electorate found those forums very useful. They were well attended. It was a worthwhile exercise. Once again, I thank the minister. Just prior to the 2016 election, I was reading the Fairfax newspaper. The Treasurer had just announced a better than expected growth figure. Of course, our friends in the media-as we can always rely on them to do-were trying to find a negative spin on that particular number. I think it was about 2.75 per cent. It was about 0.5 per cent above expected growth. Fairfax were running a story, asking: 'Where is the poor growth? Where is the growth not happening?' This was so that they could identify some areas and go to town on us about that. SoI thought I had better read this story because I just wanted to know where my electorate of O'Connor sat in the scheme of things. I opened the story online and had a look at the table, and there, right at the top of the 150 electorates, was the electorate of O'Connor and of course the electorate of Durack, represented by my dear friend Melissa. There was 11.6 per cent growth in the case of O'Connor and I think 11.7 per cent growth in the case of Durack.",116,Bills
152,Mr Rick Wilson (O'connor) (16:46,"I rise today to speak on the Treasury LawsPeople may say, 'Well, these electorates have large mining interests in them.' At that point in time, in 2015-16, we were seeing a significant contraction in the mining industry. So where was this growth coming from? I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker Irons, that there is only one source where that sort of growth could have come from: the 18,765 small businesses across my electorate. SoI salute them and I acknowledge their achievements. I say to them here in this place that this government is here to support them going forward. I want to bring the conversation back to the instant tax write-off. I will use the example of a business which does not actually operate in my electorate, but which certainly sells an enormous amount of product into my electorate. It is the Heiniger company, which is run by a very good friend of mine Garry Lyon. They produce shearing gear, among other things, and also wool presses. The TPW wool press is the most-recognised brand of wool press around the country. They are far and away the best, and designed and manufactured in Western Australia down at Bibra Lake. As I said, that is not in my electorate but it is a wonderful business. I asked the managing director, Garry Lyon, about 12 months ago, 'How's the instant tax write-off working out for you guys?' It just so happens that a wool press is about $19,990. He said that they just could not keep up. They could not keep up; they were putting staff on and trying to train people up but they just could not keep up with the demand. That is exactly what this scheme is about. It is about generating more jobs, more investment and more economic activity. This is one side of the equation. The other side of the equation, of course, is to allow other businesses which need equipment or which need to upgrade equipment to purchase that equipment and get the tax deduction effectively up-front. So those are the two sides of the equation-stimulating demand for those businesses that produce assets in that price range and also for the businesses that require assets in that price range. Those may be new display cabinets in a deli or some new shelving in a newsagency. It is those types of investments back into the business, to stimulate demand for that business and to bring forward jobs. I want to run through some of the different types of businesses across my electorate of O'Connor, because it is a wonderful and varied electorate. I am very proud that we have such a diversity of businesses. Of course, agriculture is a very important business across the electorate. I am a farmer myself so that is the industry that I understand the best and it is the industry that I am very proud of. Agriculture across the electorate of O'Connor produces around 40 per cent of the Australian wheat crop in an average year. We do dry land farming better than probably anywhere else in the world. I have been learning a lot about irrigated farming on the east coast as part of the agriculture committee and with the member for Paterson, and I am thoroughly enjoying that, but when it comes to dry land farming we are as good as any there is in the world. The free trade agreements that the government has signed are seeing a real impact in our export activity, particularly in the areas of meat, wool and grains. That area of my electorate, that industry, is certainly going extremely well. There are subdued grain prices at the moment, admittedly, but there are record high beef prices, record high sheepmeat prices and record high wool prices. So we are going pretty well. We just need it to rain, and I am sure it will sooner or later. We have a very significant horticultural sector down in the south-west part of the electorate-down around Manjimup and Pemberton. There are some wonderful businesses down there in the southern forests producing world-class produce. I know that people like the Newton Brothers and Harvey Giblett are exporting some of the best apples you will ever eat into South-East Asia. The Bendotties are exporting from their potato plant, once again into South-East Asia and doing great work. Those businesses are the sort of businesses that will be out there at the moment looking at their end-of-year financial figures and thinking, 'We can pick up a bit of new gear before the end of the financial year and write that off pretty quickly.' Tourism is a very important sector in my electorate. There are thousands of small tourism operations, whether they be hotels, motels and cafes along the south coast and up through the Goldfields. They have been doing it pretty tough in many respects, but we are starting to see the wheel turn. Those businesses are well run and will make a big contribution going forward. Forestry is a growing industry. We saw a lot of plantation going on 10 to 15 years ago, we are now moving into the harvest phase. There are some big businesses involved in the harvesting. The transport of those chips to the port is a very important aspect of that business. There are a lot of owner-driver small-business operators involved in that sector. With road transport, Southern Transport and Esperance Freight Lines are businesses that probably do exceed the $10 million, because they are very big businesses now that they have grown into substantial businesses. They have been extraordinarily well run in a very competitive environment, and those businesses have really outcompeted the competition from the bigger metropolitan areas. They are based in the electorate and I am very proud of them. Certainly everyone would associate Kalgoorlie and the Goldfields with the mining industry. The mining companies are big businesses for the most part. Some of them started as small businesses. That is the great thing about the mining industry, particularly around the Goldfields: you can start off with a tenement, drill a few holes, find a bit of gold and all of a sudden you get to the share market, you get some capital and all of a sudden you can be a big business. There are a lot of people out there having a go at that. That is what I love about the mining industry, particularly the gold mining industry. But the mining industry requires a lot of support services. Those support services are mainly based around Kalgoorlie. They include engineering businesses. I have visited Harlsan Industries and taken the minister for industry there. I have been to Newlands engineering and taken the minister for resources there. These businesses are world leaders in what they produce. They are producing mining technology that we are exporting to the world, bringing in much export income to this country. They are world leaders. Engineering is only part of it. We have tyre supply places. We have mechanics, we have hydraulic fitters. The number of small businesses around Kalgoorlie that service the mining industry is extraordinary. Those fellas up their work very hard. They work 12-hour days as a minimum, a starting point, and they work longer if they have to. Those businesses work very hard and they do deserve a tax break. That is what brings me next to cutting the company tax rate to 27.5 per cent this financial year for businesses earning up to $10 million. I think that is a great initiative of this government. Those hard working small-business people are out there growing our economy, contributing to that 11.6 per cent growth in O'Connor. They need a reward for their effort, so they are made to feel like the government does not just have its hand in their pocket taking the bulk of their hard-earned revenue. I fear for those small businesses, because the opposition, it would appear, will reverse those tax cuts. It does not appear that they have accounted for that loss in revenue to the budget through the tax cuts in any way shape or form. SoI fear for those small businesses that at the next election the opposition will be taking a tax hike to those small businesses. Of course, over time we are going to extend that 27.5 per cent tax cut to a 25c in the dollar rate. That could all be in jeopardy at the next election. But if we continue to govern and win the next election we will be extending the reduced tax rate to companies over $25 million and from 1 July 2018 that will be extended to businesses over $50 million. So that will pick up most of those businesses across my electorate, bar those very large mining companies. There are a couple of other tax issues that I just want to touch on while I am speaking on the issue of small business. There is the tax reform delivered in the agricultural white paper, and that is: the immediate write-off of new water infrastructure, uncapped. So irrigators who might be upgrading irrigation equipment, dams, storage et cetera can write that off almost immediately, uncapped. I want to touch on one last issue before I wrap up, and that is the PaTH job program. This program, I think, will be very well received across my electorate of O'Connor. I do not know how many times I have been told by young people looking for work: 'I can't get a job because I've got no experience. But how do I get experience unless someone gives me a job?' The PaTH program will allow an internship for three months. It will allow an employer-one of those great small business people in my electorate-to take somebody on at no cost to the business. The employee will get a top-up of $100 on their normal job search payment. And, after three months, they can then move into full-time employment, with a subsidy from the government. That will give a lot of young people an opportunity to get that work experience and get into the workforce. Even if it only lasts nine months, they will then be able to go and apply for their next job, having had some work experience. I want to wrap up by saying that I am proud to support the fantastic small businesses in my electorate. This government is recognising the hard work and enterprise of this vital sector of the economy, and I welcome these tax incentives that will give small businesses in my electorate reward for their hard work. I commend the bill to the House. Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation For Small Business Entities) Bill 2017 today because, quite simply, it is the government supporting Labor policy that was first introduced by the member for Lilley, and, unlike the government, the Labor Party has been consistent in backing Australian small businesses, rather than flip-flopping around with this policy. We have heard speaker after speaker lecture everyone about their credentials around small business. When it comes to this policy, they have not been consistent; they have been inconsistent with small businesses in Australia. I am proud to be someone who grew up in a family deeply invested in small businesssomeone who learnt from an early age the importance of running a payroll and of looking after workers in my father's small business. When he came out of the war, my father traded as a butcher and ran a number of butcher shops with his brother, Milton Dick Sr, and Dick Brothers Meats was an institution across Brisbane.",121,Bills
153,Mr Dick (Oxley) (17:01,"It gives me pleasure to speak on the Treasury LawsSoI am very proud to say that I am from a family of small business-because far too often we hear, from that side of the chamber, untruths about where Labor sides as to business. TodayI am going to put very clearly on the record, on behalf of the businesses in my electorate, that I back them 100 per cent. Small businesses need our support and they need policies which back them, because we know that, when Labor was in government, originally we recognised the value of an increased immediate deductibility threshold for small businesses and increased the threshold from $1,000 to $6,500, as part of a broad package of tax reforms contained in the Tax Laws Amendment (Stronger, Fairer, Simpler and Other Measures) Bill 2011. This broad package was introduced and, as I said, lifted the threshold. I may add, for the record: it was opposed by those opposite. That bill was actually opposed. AndI am going to place on the record today the name of the person who introduced this measure, which somehow the government wants to be patted on the back for, and somehow wants somehow to be congratulated on, despite the flip-flopping that we have seen. It was introduced by the member for Maribyrnong-who, at the time, was the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation-Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition. In the speech, the leader said: These changes improve cash flow for businesses and makes investing in and growing their business more achievablewhich is precisely what they did. The increased asset threshold was embraced by the smallbusiness community across Australia, who saw tremendous value in this policy. But, despite the support shown at the time, and despite all the lectures that we have heard today, what did the government do when they came to power? They scrapped it. That is right-the government scrapped this measure. We know it was unfortunately part of the 2014 budgetthat toxic 2014 budget that seems to live on and on throughout Australia and keeps coming back to haunt the government. I believe that the inconsistency we have seen from the government has continued on from that moment. So rather than supporting small businesses with the competence those opposite like to talk about, the Liberal-National government tore up the increased threshold and scrapped it. I may add that members on this side of the House opposed them every step of the way. Then, like they always do, the government performed a U-turn when the Abbott government reversed its position the following year and proposed a temporary two-year increase in the deductibility threshold to $20,000 in the 2015-16 budget. Of course, this side of the House was happy to support that. But so much for providing the confidence and business confidence we hear about in lectures from members of the government today. It is a little galling to hear the government wanting to be congratulated for this measure when for the last four or five years they have not been consistent. In fact, we know business investment looks set to slide for a fifth consecutive year under this government, with total business investing falling to 2.1 per cent in the December quarter alone. That is more than double what was forecasted by economists. This includes plans for mining investment down 20 per cent and plans for manufacturing investment down 1.2 per cent over the past year. But we should not be surprised when we have an incompetent government like this, flip-flopping around on small business policy and trying to introduce measures which are simply supported by the Australian community. Labor, on the other hand, recognise the importance of consistency for businesses, which is why we will support the bill today to extend by 12 months to June 2018 the period in which small businesses and small business entities can temporarily access expanded, accelerated depreciation rules. This extension is also supported by small business groups across Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce. The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, Kate Carnell, said, 'a healthy small business sector is a prerequisite for a growing economy with high employment opportunities'. Of course, there are also a number of other key groups. Labor recognises the importance of supporting the two million genuine Australian small businesses that represent 83 per cent of Australian companies. In my electorate there are 8,748 small businesses who provide thousands of jobs to local residents and inject millions of dollars into our local economy in the south-west of Brisbane. Quite simply, small business is the backbone of our local economy in the south-west of Brisbane. In my local area small businesses are supported strongly by some terrific chambers of commerce. The Centenary and Districts Chamber of Commerce and the Greater Springfield Chamber of Commerce are two I am proud to work closely with. Led by presidents Steve Pollard and Neil Coupland, the chambers provide advocacy, support and particularly support for new members who join our growing local economy. From the centenary suburbs of Jindalee and Mount Ommaney all the way to Australia's fastest-growing region, the Greater Springfield area, small businesses make a huge contribution by employing local young people, giving people their first job and also giving opportunities to people getting back into the workforce. Just a few short weeks ago I had the pleasure of visiting Little Tokyo Two, a hub for local start-ups in the Springfield area with the shadow minister for trade and investment, Jason Clare, where we saw first hand the spirit of small businesses and the boundless opportunities that are finding their way through the Springfield corridor. Small businesses contribute so much to our national prosperity, including providing a livelihood for millions of Australians. Whether they be sole traders, partnerships, trusts or small employers, they have helped underpin more than 25 years of Australian economic growth. Labor's commitment to supporting these small businesses is unwavering. Labor is proud to have led the debate in this policy area in recent years by offering practical policies to support Australia's industrious small-business sector. In 2016 Labor took a comprehensive suite of small-business policies to the federal election, including a responsible plan to cut company tax for small businesses with turnovers of less than $2 million, a plan to level the playing field for small businesses by ensuring that multinationals pay their fair share of tax, and a plan to help small businesses incorporate without additional red tape, along with a range of innovative policies to assist small businesses better access finance and help entrepreneurs start their own businesses. Labor has continued to fight for small businesses in the 45th Parliament. We continue to develop and advocate for policies that will benefit Australian small businesses, helping them grow and prosper. In February of this year, Labor introduced into the Senate the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017. These access to justice reforms would help small businesses take cases of anticompetitive behaviour to court. Currently, small businesses are less likely to take up private litigation against anticompetitive behaviour. This is because big businesses have deep pockets, as we know, and armies of lawyers, which means the risk of small businesses being overwhelmed and having to pay the big businesses legal fees is a significant obstacle. Despite this, the government has refused to address this inequity in the face of the Productivity Commission and the government's own competition review saying that small businesses are disadvantaged in the court process. I am proud to see that Labor's bill will restore the balance by letting a small business request a no adverse cost order early in a court case. This will help level the playing field and encourage more small businesses to take on anticompetitive behaviour. Labor has also announced a package of reforms to tackle illegal company phoenixing, as my friend and colleague the member for Macquarie was talking about in her contribution earlier today. As we know, this is a practice that often leaves a small businesses on the hook for unpaid debt that they are never able to recover. Labor will crack down on dodgy directors who engage in phoenix activity where they deliberately burn companies in an attempt to avoid their obligation to employees, government and honest businesses. The package will see employees and business owners benefit from new enforcement tools for the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, tightened laws protecting employee entitlements, and harsher penalties to deter and punish insidious phoenix activity. Currently in Australia, it is easier to be a company director than to open a bank account, yet the government has barely raised a peep about phoenix activity. Rather, the coalition has chosen to continue its narrow, ideological agenda. We know their priority is not looking after the little guy, not looking after the battler, and not even looking after the small-business operator. We know their agenda isfront and centre, first, second and third-delivering large multinational companies tax cuts. We know that is their agenda. On this side of the chamber, we have a different view. Labor's new plan will require all company directors to obtain a unique director identification number with a 100 point identification check, increase penalties associated with phoenix activity, introduce an objective test for transactions depriving employees of their entitlements, clarify the availability of compensation orders against accessories, and consult on target integrity measures based on the recommendations of the Melbourne Law School and Monash Business School phoenix research team's recommendations. I acknowledge the good work and the hard work of our shadow minister, Andrew Leigh, in this area. Estimated in 2012 to cost up to $3.2 billion annually, fraudulent phoenix activity hurts employees, small businesses, subcontractors and, most importantly, families-families and small businesses right across Australia. With respect to the instant write-off, it was the Labor Party that first identified the value for Australian businesses in increasing the immediate deductible threshold. We know, on this side of the chamber, it was Labor who increased that threshold for small businesses from $1,000 to $6,500. We know it was one of the poorest decisions under the Abbott-Turnbull government to junk this. So, whilst we hear a lot of platitudes from those opposite saying, 'We're the champions of small business,' look at what they have done, not what they say. Let's remember that one of the first actions they took on coming into government was to reduce that from $6½ thousand down to $1,000. We hear a lot from those opposite saying, 'Look, we support small business', but, when it comes to the record, in this particular policy area they are found to be wanting. I understand that the government then realised that this was a huge mistake, that they got it wrong. But the consistency is important, as I said in my opening remarks. While we welcome the decision to extend the small business instant asset write-off, we note that this measure will cost the budget around $1 billion in 2018-19. We want to make sure that, with a large expense on the budget, the predicted economic benefits are being delivered, and we are going to call on the government to evaluate it and release the evaluation in full prior to any further extension. That is a measured response. That is a sensible response that the Australian community understands. So there is no doubt of the enormous contribution that small business makes to Australia. Accounting for 33 per cent of Australia's GDP and employing 50 per cent of the workforce, small businesses really drive our economy. Labor, including me, as the local federal member for Oxley and Brisbane's south-west, will continue to support small businesses. We support this bill to extend the instant asset write-off to encourage small businesses to grow and prosper, to see those jobs of the future, particularly in the corridors that I represent-the highgrowth corridors-to make sure that our young kids get jobs and that they continue in the future. Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation For Small Business Entities) Bill 2017. The bill implements one of the great measures announced in the 2017 federal budget in recent weeks. It is a very important measure that will help small businesses right across the country, particularly in my electorate of Berowra. The bill extends by 12 months, to 30 June 2018, the period during which small business entities can expand their accelerated depreciation rules. There are around 15,000 small businesses in my electorate of Berowra, and they employ tens of thousands of people. Berowra businesses know that they can spend their own money better than the taxman can. Those small businesses in my electorate of Berowra keep telling me that they want tax relief. They want tax relief so that they can invest more in their businesses. They want tax relief so that they can employ more people. They want tax relief so that they can turn their small businesses into bigger businesses that have glorious nationwide reputations. This government has a strong record of backing small businesses, helping them grow and deliver more and better-paying jobs. We have done this by cutting small business taxes, reducing the corporate tax rate to 27½ per cent for small businesses that have a turnover of up to $10 million, and that takes effect from 1 July 2017. And we are going to further reduce that to 25 per cent by 2026-27. We are increasing the number of businesses that are eligible for a range of small business tax concessions by raising the small business entity turnover threshold from $2 million to $10 million. Only those opposite, in the Labor Party, believe that a business with slightly over $2 million turnover-that is turnover, not profit-is somehow a big business. We on this side of the House have a greater appreciation for small business. Many of us have run small businesses. Many of us come from small business families. Many of us are in electorates like mine where the small business community is the absolute backbone of the electorate: it is the small business people who get involved in the P&Cs; it is the small business people who get involved in the charitable organisations; it is the small business people who employ people and give them an opportunity.",124,Bills
154,Mr Leeser (Berowra) (17:16,"I am delighted to speak on the Treasury LawsOur party understands that the best thing governments can do for small businesses is to reduce the regulatory burden and get out of their way. The coalition government has maintained its focus on simplifying small business paperwork and has committed to cutting red tape costs by $1 billion every year since we were elected. Our party has reduced the annual regulatory burden on small business and the community by more than $5.8 billion since coming to government. That exceeds our target every single year. And we are continuing to reduce the complexity and cost of complying with regulation. The National Business Simplification Initiative will tackle the burden of unnecessary regulation, particularly where there is duplication across the different levels of government-federal, state and local. It will improve access to government information and services for businesses by providing them in one place and with streamlined service delivery. We are developing a simplified business activity statement solution to save small businesses time and money on bookkeeping and reporting. These changes will allow small business owners to spend less time reporting to government and less time on their paperwork, and more time growing their business and with their families. Let me talk a little bit about the instant asset write-off contained in this bill. Through accelerated depreciation, the 2017 federal budget delivers additional support to the nearly 3.2 million small businesses across Australia. All businesses can claim the cost of most depreciating assets if they are used for work purposes. The instant asset write-off measure allows small business with a turnover of up to $10 million to claim an instant deduction on capital equipment with a value up to $20,000. Prior to 12 May 2015, the immediate write off was only $1,000 for any asset purchased. If the asset was over the $1,000 cap, it would be depreciated over a set period or pooled in a small asset pool. This meant it could take up to 10 to 15 years to obtain the benefit for any large asset purchase. This measure was due to finish on 30 June 2017, before its extension in the 2017-18 federal budget. Smalland medium-sized businesses will now have more certainty that they will be able to immediately deduct the purchase of these assets first used or ready to be used by 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2018. Additionally, assets that cost more than $20,000 and costs of $20,000 or more relating to depreciating assets can be allocated to a small business's general small business pool and deducted at a specific rate for the depletion of the pool. The rate of deduction is 15 per cent in the year they are allocated and 30 per cent in subsequent years. If the balance of the small business' pool is less than $20,000 at the end of the income year, the business can claim a deduction for the entire balance of the pool. As the pool depreciates all assets in the same way, small businesses do not need spend valuable time tracking each individual asset against different depreciation rates over time. The extension of the instant asset write-off will improve cash flow for small business. This will boost productivity and help small-business owners reinvest in their business. Improved cash flow will also give businesses the flexibility to hire more employees and pay staff more. It will also encourage small businesses to bring forward capital investment from future years to the current income year, renewing their capital base. That is something we so often see business generally in Australia underinvesting in. This bill is a great boom for Berowra businesses. For example, hairdressers in Berowra could claim deductions on new flooring or equipment in their hairdressing salons. Take Real Men's Hairdressing-a great name-in Pennant Hills and its owner and operator, Aman Hamid. This is an example of a great Berowra small business in my electorate that stands to benefit from this measure. If you want to see how good he is, you only need to look at my haircut, because this is the place I get my hair cut. They will be celebrating their third year of operations in June this year and they will benefit by being able to depreciate the clippers that they use every time to shear my head. It is not just hairdressers that will benefit from this; tutoring business can benefit from instant deductions. For instance, they could deduct an interactive whiteboard, as so many more of our tutoring businesses are using. I want to talk to you about one of the great businesses in my electorate that does tutoring. Sponge Education is a business started by a remarkable 26-year-old woman, Sarah Carmen. She had an idea for a tutoring businesshaving had her own experience of the HSC and having done a science degree at universityrealising that part of the success of tutoring was not just the technical tutoring but also looking after the mental health of those students who are under the pressure of doing HSC. Sarah Carmen has now taken this business to employing 50 tutors and providing services to 200 students across my electorate. She tutors in maths, English, science, geography, history and music, and I think her business is so important because of her understanding of the important mental health aspect. If a student has good mental health, they will do well at school. I look forward to seeing the way that Sarah will use the instant asset write-off to help her business. This is a great boom for architecture firms. Great architecture companies like Stanton Dahl, which was started by the great Phil Stanton back in the 1980s, a resident of Pennant Hills in my electorate. He is a person who has designed and built so many of our community's institutions, from churches and school halls to aged-care facilities, automotive businesses and homes for people. He has been in practice for over 30 years. It is a really extraordinary business. He and his firm can claim deductions on new drafting tables and equipment, for instance. I spoke recently to Geoff Lloyd of Hardwood Mills Australia in Hornsby, which provides small portable sawmills in my electorate. He said to me that he saw huge benefit in the instant asset write-off. He said many businesses lost a lot of confidence during the global financial crisis, and having this measure promotes confidence in the community that businesses can make decisions and buy assets and invest in their businesses with greater certainty. He said: 'This supports our business. I think it is great and it should stay. We agonise over every spending decision. I have bought many assets for our business, because of the asset write-off, that we would not have otherwise.' He also outlined that, when small businesses purchase more or better assets locally, communities and other businesses directly also benefit from a flow-on effect of the purchases. Hardwood Mills recently installed a crane on one of their trucks. Geoff Lloyd explained that he does not have a licence to install the crane, so, in addition to the purchase itself, Hardwood Mills hired a business to install it. This shows the clear flow-on effect in stimulating our economy, increasing investment, growing businesses and creating more jobs. This is a purchase they would not have made without the asset write-off of $20,000. As the son of an accountant, I know how important accountants are in helping small businesses; and I know that accountants, more than anyone else, know the health of our economy and the health of small businesses. Accountants are not just there to do tax; a good accountant advises you how to build and grow your business. And so I talked to a couple of accountants in my electorate to find out what they thought of these particular measures. I talked to Craig Lawton, an accountant from Glenorie in my electorate. Craig said: 'This policy is really useful for many small businesses and I hope it carries on. It has got a very strong endorsement in the accounting community.' Pedro Sasso, the director of Shuriken Consulting at Hornsby, another one of our great accounting firms and a small business as well, said: 'The higher up-front deduction will allow small businesses to lower their tax bill. In a low-growth environment the immediate write-off incentive allows small businesses to purchase assets with the immediate write-off helping to stimulate a growth. Not only does the immediate write-off benefit existing businesses, but it also benefits start-ups and innovation companies as it increases deductions and helps to lower tax to be paid, allowing greater funds available for business growth. This will allow an increased chance for these start-ups to succeed in business.' So we have great practical endorsement from a range of Berowra businesses, Berowra accountants and small businesses more broadly. This is a very important measure to allow businesses to invest in their business and to do so more quickly. It stimulates not only the growth of that small business but the broader economy around it. It is a really terrific proposal and I am delighted to be here to speak on it today. And what have those opposite had to say whenever we talk about small business? I think they see small business as not that important. The Labor Party almost see small business as part of a class war. They have constantly had a go at the small business tax deduction that we gave earlier in the year because they think a business with a turnover of $2 million or more is a large business. Well, as most of the businesses in Berowra, which have turnovers a little bit larger than that, can tell you, they are not large businesses. A $2 million turnover makes you a microbusiness. We need governments to understand the position that small business is in, we need governments to support small businesses, we need governments to be in a position to understand that small businesses are better to deal with their own money themselves. Small businesses know how their businesses run and we should give them the incentive to invest now and to grow their business. That is what this particular measure does. That is why I am delighted to support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation for Small Business Entities) Bill 2017 and I commend its passage to the House. Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation For Small Business Entities) Bill 2017, which for convenience I will call the TLAB. Obviously Labor support this bill-of course we would. It is basically our bill. There is only cheap politics involved in the coalition playing ducks and drakes with this sector in the first place. This bill extends until 30 June 2018 the period in which small business entities can temporarily access expanded accelerated depreciation rules. I know that small businesses make an enormous contribution to the Australian economy. There are around 18,000 to 19,000 small businesses in Moreton. I see the great work that they do and how much of a struggle it is and how much sweat so many people have often invested in setting up a small business, and I know the heartache that can come with a small business going belly up. Sadly, nearly a third of them do that. In my time as a lawyer I worked in commercial law. In fact, I still see some of the buildings that have leases that I helped draft as a young lawyer. SoI know how hard and how difficult it is to start a small business, with all the associated red tape. And Labor understand that I saw that in our time in government from 2007 through to 2013. I know the valuable contribution that the thousands of businesses",128,Bills
155,Mr Perrett (Moreton,"Opposition Whip) (17:29): I rise to speak on the Treasuryin my electorate of Moreton make-the sole traders, the partnerships, the small employers. They keep the economy ticking over and employ numerous people. Labor has led the debate in this policy area. In fact, I remind those opposite that Labor introduced the instant asset write-off. I say that again, because from the speeches preceding mine you would think that this is a coalition initiative, but it was the Labor government that introduced the instant asset write-off. When in government in 2012, Labor increased the threshold for small businesses from $1,000 to $6,500. The coalition government, on the other hand, wound back that very successful Labor initiative in its horror 2014-15 budget, again reducing the threshold to $1,000. So, for all of the platitudes and the narrative put forward by those opposite, I need to remind them that those of them elected at the 2013 election got rid of Labor's increased threshold of $6,500 for small business and the opportunities that came with that increased threshold. In what is becoming a trademark of the coalition government, just 12 months later they reinstated the instant asset write-off and extended it to $20,000. Labor welcomes this extension of the $20,000 threshold for instant asset write-offs until 30 June 2018. However, at a cost of $1 billion in 2018-19, I know that this measure should be evaluated to ensure it is delivering the predicted economic benefits and that people are taking advantage of stimulating the economy. I call on the government to prudently evaluate this measure and release that evaluation before there is a further extension. If the benefits are there, obviously Labor will support such policies. We do understand small business. As I said, I have worked as a lawyer with clients who were small businesses. We know that the Labor Party has produced practical policies that will nurture small businesses and help them thrive. At the last election one year ago we had plans that included a responsible plan to cut company tax for small businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million, a plan to level the playing field for small businesses by ensuring that multinationals pay their fair share of tax, a plan to help small businesses incorporate without additional red tape, along with a range of other innovative policies to assist small businesses to better access finance and help entrepreneurs start their own businesses-something that Australia does not do as well as we should. Labor is still working with small businesses across the country, listening to their needs and developing policies that will benefit them. This year, Labor introduced into the Senate a bill to help small businesses take cases of anticompetitive behaviour to court. The Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017 would level the playing field so that small businesses who challenge a large business for anticompetitive behaviour would not risk having to pay the often very large legal fees of the large business if they lost. Remember that competitive behaviour is what best benefits the Australian public. The prospects of a costs order sadly often deter small businesses from making a claim of anticompetitive behaviour against the top end of town. Small businesses could request a no adverse costs order early in the court case, giving them the confidence to pursue their claim. I am hopeful that the government, the self-proclaimed champions of small business, will support the Labor legislation. The member for Fenner has also recently announced a package of reforms to crack down on phoenixing. Labor believes that we need stronger laws to make sure that directors cannot simply strip the assets out of a company and then set up a new one, often to the detriment of employees and creditors. Illegal phoenixing activity costs the economy billions of dollars annually. I know that it can be legitimate, that companies do make bad decisions or markets change and people want to start again. There is no problem with legitimate businesses failing and then trying again-that is not a bad thing at all. But illegal phoenixing is what this legislation is about. Among the measures announced by Labor are requiring all company directors to obtain a unique director identification number with a 100-point identification check, so we would know if people are repeatedly doing this; increasing penalties associated with phoenix activity; introducing an objective test for transactions depriving employees of their entitlements; clarifying the availability of compensations orders against accessories; and consulting on targeted integrity measures based on the recommendations of the Melbourne Law School and Monash Business School phoenix research team recommendations. As one expert said recently, under current laws it is almost possible to register your dog as a company director. Currently, setting up a bank account requires a much more rigorous process than becoming a company director. At Senate estimates this week, the tax commissioner noted that in other countries proper identification checks are required for anyone wanting to become a director. We need to have the same rigour applied to prospective Australian company directors. Small business owners know that rising energy prices are having a devastating impact on small businesses right across Australia. Rising energy prices are the result of the failure of the Turnbull government to put in place an emissions intensity scheme. Just this week the energy minister has again confirmed that the Turnbull government will not be imposing an emissions intensity scheme on the power sector. An EIS would send a positive signal to investors encouraging them to renew our ageing electricity infrastructure. An emissions intensity scheme is supported by experts, industry and the states. It will cut electricity costs by up to $15 billion and will support new investment. But what do we get from the Turnbull government, after four years? We have, horrifically and horribly for business, wholesale electricity prices that have doubled since the member for Warringah became Prime Minister. Try as they might to duck and weave, the Turnbull government is ultimately responsible for these price hikes and costs for small business. Another topic associated with small business is the NBN. The Turnbull 2017 budget has brought no joy to businesses still waiting for the rollout of this second rate NBN. The member for Wentworth promised in 2013 that the Liberals would deliver the NBN to everyone by 2016, but it will still be years before businesses in my electorate of Morton are hooked up to this second rate NBN. In 2013, during that election campaign, businesses on the south side expressed concern that a change of government would delay the rollout of the NBN. It was actually the number one topic at the business forum organised by the local Quest papers. The local media said in an article that business owners in Rocklea, in my electorate, were worried about this possible delay. They were right to be concerned, despite the assurances given by the LNP candidate. The NBN company's website shows that the rollout of the NBN has not even started in Rocklea yet, and will not start until next year at the earliest. In 2013 I had no idea how badly the member for Wentworth could wreck the NBN. That is what he was asked to do by the member for Warringah, and he did it. In the two years that the member for Wentworth, our now Prime Minister, was communications minister he did not connect a single paying customer to his second rate fibre-to-the-node network. Where his second rate network has now been switched on, sadly it is not working properly. The member for Wentworth's management of his NBN as communications minister and now as Prime Minister, where the buck stops, has been an absolute disaster. Because of the Prime Minister's dastardly deeds, the productivity gains and business opportunities that would have flowed have not eventuated. I have been contacted by people all over my electorate who tell me how disappointed they are and tell me about the business opportunities they have missed out on. The NBN is behind schedule, over budget and not designed to meet the future needs of Australian businesses. Businesses need access to high-speed internet to compete in a highly competitive global market. In my electorate, being particularly multicultural, many people have business connections with the rest of the world, and they would benefit from an NBN but instead we get a rollout that is slow and speeds that are even slower. The 2017 budget has not provided any solution to this crucial problem, which is preventing businesses from growing and selling their products and services around the world, particularly in South-East Asia. Small businesses will continue to struggle with one of the slowest and most expensive internet services in the developed world. When medals are handed out for being connected, Australia is not even in the stadium. We are going further and further back while governments in other countries have been forward-thinking enough to invest in the digital revolution. The member for Wentworth's failures are bad for productivity, they are bad for our economy and they are bad for businesses-and dare I say, as someone who comes from country Queensland, there has been a betrayal of the bush as well. That is where the great opportunities lie. Agricultural producers could be hooked up with markets around the world, particularly with that expanding middle class in China, India and the like, and our near neighbours. Labor supports the measures in this bill because Labor supports small businesses. We do not just say we do-we have shown our support while in office. The Turnbull government have looked up at the top end of town in their 2017 budget but they have failed to address the real concerns of small businesses. They have been so focused on delivering an uncosted $65 billion tax giveaway for big businesses that they have forgotten small businesses. They have failed to address rising energy prices and the fact that they impact on businesses all over Australia. As I have pointed out, prices have doubled under the coalition government. They are about to start their fifth year of government, and prices have doubled. I was in the 42nd and the 43rd parliaments, and I heard promise after promise about a sensible price on carbon and what would eventuate, and instead we have seen a complete betrayal of those utterances. The payment terms problem exposed in the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman's recent report has not been addressed by this government. Obviously a most pressing issue, the one raised more often with my office than almost anything else, is that small businesses, when they go to set up, do not have access to high-speed internet. Moreton is in the southern suburbs of Brisbane-not out the back of Burke-but we are still not getting the benefits of the National Broadband Network that the then shadow communications minister promised would come. It has been a great betrayal, and a great productivity gain has been missed. The 2017 budget was a missed opportunity in so many of these areas, and sadly that has impacted on small businesses. The small businesses of Australia do the heavy lifting when it comes to employing, when it comes to taking risk and when it comes to participating in their local communities, and small businesses deserve better. I wondered where the rot set in, and I can see that it was perhaps when they got rid of Bruce Billson from the cabinet table-someone who was a champion for small business. We had a new Prime Minister come in and he got rid of Bruce. Bring him back. (Time expired) Ms LANDRY (Capricornia-Deputy Nationals Whip) (17:44): Time and time again we hear of the need to cut red tape to make it easier for small business. Thanks to the coalition government, action is catching up with the rhetoric. The government's efforts to support small business are being felt across the nation. I applaud the Minister for Small Business for making a real difference to the businesses of Capricornia. Throughout Capricornia, small businesses have been suffering, with continued delays in new mining approvals and a lack of support for major new infrastructure projects from the Labor state government. But in the resilient spirit that is Central Queensland, small businesses persevere. Running a small business is tough in an ever-evolving economic landscape. I think back to the days when my own parents ran Lucky Daniel News& Casket Agency in Rockhampton. It was hard enough then to make a decent income-so much so that, on occasion, I would have to step in and help out when my mother would go to work the night shift as a nurse. As hard as it was then, my parents did not have to navigate the complex system we simplistically label as 'red tape'. They did not have to worry about BAS statements. They did not need to worry about social media strategies and ensuring their business had an appropriate digital presence. They did not have to worry about competition from online suppliers and competition from major internationals. They did not have to worry about how they were going to pay staff members double time and a half and still be able to feed their family at the end of the day. Running a small business today is just that-running. It is running from union pillar to taxation post and back again, via digital trenches and gutters of compliance. The steps the coalition government is taking have real and measurable outcomes. An immediate business tax deduction of $20,000 for purchasing assets can make a big difference. It is the difference between buying the computer that will allow them to better manage their online presence. It is the difference between being able to afford opening on a Sunday in the hope of countering losses from 24/7 online competitors. Extending the instant asset write-off program is the highlight of the budget for small business. The measure has proved to be one of the most popular government small business incentives. It encourages Australia's 3.2 million small businesses to invest in their business. Based on current lodgements of the 201516 tax returns, as at the beginning of May 2017, around 220,000 business have reported that they have utilised the IAWO. That is around $1.9 billion in deductions for the 2015-16 financial year. This number is expected to increase as more businesses lodge their income tax returns. What does this mean for small businesses in Capricornia? It was just last week that Minister Fiona Nash and I walked through the main street of Rockhampton. We visited Stewarts, a department store operating since 1862. Bruce Woods praised the efforts of the coalition government and the efforts to support small business. When Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was in town two weeks ago, we were fortunate to visit a number of new small businesses, including Dingles Cafe& Bar and Headricks Lane. Both of these businesses have shown confidence in the measures being made and confidence that the measures will push the economy in the right direction. The instant asset write-off will improve cash flow for small-business, providing a boost in productivity and helping small-business owners to reinvest in their business. Improved cash flow will also give businesses the flexibility to hire more employees and pay staff more. When small businesses purchase more or buy assets locally, the community and other businesses directly benefit from the flow-on effect of that purchase. They have that little bit of extra cash to support the local hockey team or to take on a new apprentice. What we are hearing is that small businesses around Australia feel energised by the smallbusiness measures in our budget. We are hearing that it has given them the confidence to carefully invest in growing their business. Rockhampton chartered accountant Ms Sarah Becker, from James Becker& Co, has said that the $20,000 immediate tax deduction for small business purchases is being taken up by a number of her clients in order to get their businesses up to date and ready for increased future capacity. Mr Chris Harris from CT Harris& Co, who is also in Rockhampton, has applauded the small-business tax package. He explained that many of his clients have already take up the $20,000 immediate tax deduction by bringing forward the acquisition of items that were previously only on the wish list. These small businesses will use the purchase of assets to generate income and boost struggling regional economies. By allowing small businesses to purchase both old and new items, the continuation of this package is boosting not just the market for new products but the second hand market, which benefits even more small businesses. Mr Harris has said that this ensures there will not be a negative effect on the second-hand market and has commended the government for this foresight. Every dollar spent in a small business is an injection of confidence into that business and the local community. Small businesses and industry groups have been vocal in their calls for an extension to the program. This has been well received by small business stakeholders following the budget. The extension of the package has also been welcomed by rural communities. Ken McCaffrey, a well-known livestock agent in Queensland, was saying that he has been talking to a number of property owners. Overall, he says, the fact that farmers can deduct the cost of water facilities and fencing in the year that they are purchased and deduct the cost of fodder storage assets over three years has meant a boost not just for those farmers themselves but also for related businesses in rural communities that will be supplying the fencing materials and other equipment required. Capricornia is home to 12,927 registered small businesses. The instant asset write-off supports businesses to reinvest in the local economy. For example, if Olive Catering wants to expand its operations and purchase a mobile kitchen or buy a new coffee machine, they can take advantage of the generous incentive. Design+Architecture may need a new drafting table so that they can better prepare designs to bid for the Mount Archer redevelopment; they can now write that off, too. The figures speak for themselves. As at 4 April 2017, with 60 per cent of the 2015-16 returns counted, over 200,000 claims have been made. This is an increase from 153,000 in 2014-15 and 117,000 in 2013-14. The average claim size in 2015-16 was $8,547. Finally, I would like to touch on the importance of the depreciation deduction. Allowing pooling for assets costing more than the $20,000 threshold will allow for longer-term financial planning and cash flow. The pooling arrangements are available to small businesses to provide greater simplicity for their tax affairs. As the pool depreciates all assets in the same way, small businesses do not need to spend valuable time tracking each individual asset against different depreciation rates over the time. Almost Anything, a web and graphic design business in North Rockhampton, is a perfect example. Almost Anything have a high turnover, but the profits are marginal. They can now benefit from an increase in turnover to $10 million. They can purchase a new printer so that they can perform die-cut printing services and better compete with online companies. The printer costs over $50,000, which is above the threshold, so they are not able to claim an immediate deduction. However, Almost Anything can depreciate the asset through their general small business pool. If the value of the pool falls below $20,000, the entire pool balance can be immediately deducted in that income year, providing an additional cash flow benefit. Because the business is not limited to just one purchase, and thanks to the forward cash flow, they can also purchase branded vehicles for staff, to help promote their business. It falls under the $20,000 threshold, so they are able to write it off instantly. The extension of this budget measure will build on the tremendous success already achieved. The measure has proved to be one of the most popular government small business incentives, and encourages Australia's 3.2 million small businesses to invest in their business. A strong small business sector means more jobs for Australians and more opportunities to build vibrant local economies across the country. Small business is the backbone of our economy and the backbone of Capricornia. Most small businesses do not have a team of accountants, ongoing administration support or marketing departments; they do the work themselves, and they have to continually navigate an increasingly complex business world. Every new compliance requirement and government regulation means less time to focus on growing their business and employing more people. This continues the government's strong record of backing small business to grow and deliver more and better-paying jobs by helping them replace or upgrade their machinery and equipment. By continuing to reduce red tape the coalition government is proving its commitment to the working class. Making business easier for Australians will deliver more for everyday families than what union-driven compliance will ever achieve. Thank you, Minister, for your work to support the small businesses of Capricornia. Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro) (17:55): This is just another area where we see the same policy drift and clueless approach from this government, not only their approach to economic issues but their approach to just about every aspect over the four years of chaos of this government. They have flopped about like a flathead in a tinnie. Really, if we are talking about 'vibble bobble' we have seen so much on this side that it just defies belief. Will they ever achieve some kind of policy coherence? Here is an area where I can at least congratulate them for having adopted a Labor policy. When we talk about benefiting small business and what will actually mean something on the ground to small businesses, Labor's policy of loss carry-back and instant asset write-off is something that meant something to every small business in Australia. Whereas, if we talk about the government's tax reform proposals, it just does not actually achieve anywhere near that kind of impact to small businesses. If you look at Eden-Monaro as an example, I have around 5,000 small businesses in my region and there are only a handful of them that are actually incorporated that would even benefit from this tax relief. So, effectively, this does nothing for the vast majority of small businesses in Australia, and that is the first essential point that we should communicate here. Those sole traders and those partnerships do not get any benefit out of the tax reforms or tax cuts that the government is proposing. But, yes, instant asset write-offs and loss carry-back really help. But when we talk about the record of this government on assisting small businesses in this country, we have seen a record of devastation. The car industry has collapsed; a couple of hundred jobs are going there. We have seen what they have done in naval shipbuilding. I have talked about this in a couple of speeches already. Labor built the shipbuilding workforce up to over 4,000 in this country and we had a program ahead of us of building supply vessels and going into rolling shipbuilding that would have grown that workforce even further. Instead, what we have seen is over 3,000 jobs lost in that space. We have seen the great shipyards of Newcastle and Williamstown, which were playing such a vital role in that plan, now rotting on the vine. To really reinforce this downward spiral that has been created these last four years, there was been the massive casualisation of our workforce. Permanent jobs are just a dim, dark, distant memory from this government's way of dealing with the economy. Really, when they talk about creating these tax deductions and the effect that this will create and the trickle down tradition, we know it will not happen. It has never happened before and it has never worked before. If it was going to happen with the record profits we are seeing in some sectors now, it would be reflected now, we would be seeing it now. Instead, what we are seeing is record low wages growth. So it is just a complete myth that that will happen. They talk about encouraging investment. All we know that will happen with this $65 billion tax giveaway is that all of that money-or the vast bulk of it-is going to go overseas. We will see very little of that benefit come here. When you take into account all the benefits that are already here in our imputation regime, there really is no impact that is going to be felt here in relation to those massive tax giveaways to those big overseas companies. If you wanted investment, what you would have done is continue Labor's Clean Energy Future framework, because that was encouraging massive investment in the renewable energy industry, one of those growth industries that we could have been playing such a vital role in. We could have been getting the benefit of being at the ground floor of so much developing technology in that area and marketing it to the world. Instead, we saw reports like Bloomberg's report, which was evident in reporting in 2015, saying that investment in large scale renewable energy had fallen by 90 per cent in 12 months. My region was one of the regions to suffer the most from that fall-off. In the period when I was the member from 2007 to 2013 we had over $1 billion in investment in just renewable energy projects coming into just Eden-Monaro. We managed to negotiate to get wind farm components brought in through the port of Eden, which created local jobs for our stevedoring company there. We had the trucks stopping in towns like Bombala, putting money into the town and all the small businesses, with the retail and hospitality sector gaining from that, particularly through the successful Boco Rock project. That had a phase 2: there was a wave energy project; there were all sorts of projects that we were going to see come from the flow in investment that would have happened from maintaining that policy framework. All of it disappeared. We have seen some kicking to life of investment through what the states and territories, the ACT, has done in this space, but effectively now we are moving into another phase where uncertainty is killing off any further flow of investment. This is an area where we could have seen investment flowing, but it has not. It has been killed off by the coalition. Then you look at the other side of that story, the impact of climate change, which the government is doing nothing about, and the impact on it on small businesses. I am not just talking about farmers and those who depend for their livelihoods on some of the more open environmental business enterprises. It also affects cafes and small businesses in Queanbeyan. During the last massive heatwave we saw cafes like Hotch Potch and many small businesses around Queanbeyan completely shut down because all their vital machinery, their refrigeration and the rest of it, broke down. A small business like Hotch Potch was not in a good position to be able to replace that machinery. Obviously you can talk about storm damage as well and the effect that that is having on many small businesses. They are ignoring all these issues and impacts-what would encourage investment, what would take away serious effects on small businesses-at the same time as trying to make this huge tax giveaway, which is not going to achieve jobs and growth in Australia. In fact, they are looking at completely the wrong policy settings to achieve that. There have been so many reports and commentaries by economists on the fact that this tax cut will not achieve jobs and growth. One example from the MacroBusiness website from February this year stressed that there was no evidence at all to support the notion that this would create jobs and growth, if you actually were aware of what is going on in the world in terms of where jobs are created and where industry is going to grow. They said: An alternative approach, which would be much more likely to have positive effects on employment, investment and innovation, would be to tax new companies at a lower rate. OECD research shows that young businesses are the primary drivers of job creation. And new companies are more likely to be at the frontier of productivity growth … Confining preferential tax breaks to new businesses – for example, by prescribing that a lower tax rate is only available to a business for the first (say) three years after its incorporation – focuses the assistance on those businesses which are actually likely to innovate, and to create jobs. Effectively this government has lost the plot on focusing on putting policy settings in place to create start-ups, support start-ups, support innovation and to support new businesses. That is where the job growth in Australia will come from, not from this flawed tax proposal by the government. You also need to look at how we can properly commercialise research and development, look at our tertiary institutions and how they relate to business, how we commercialise and market the research and development from the tertiary sectors, and how we develop a proper venture capital industry in this country. We have seen no policy initiatives from this government that have addressed that really critical issue. It is a great shame for this country not to have the sort of mature venture capital industry that really is essential in this day and age, when you have $2 trillion sloshing around in our managed funds not working hard enough to get behind new businesses. We need policy settings that achieve that. An example of the sort of possibilities in this start-ups space, and particularly in rural and regional Australia, where we are not really taking advantage of the human resource that is out there or enabling them to take the ride on these new economies that is possible with good information infrastructure and good skills and training-an example is the Birdsnest business in Cooma, south of Canberra. Jane Cay managed to wander off from the farm-she is married to one of the local farmers there-into town, bought a shop and started a business. Now her business occupies an entire block in Cooma. She is employing 110 local women. It is a very creative workplace environment with incredibly flexible work hours so the women can get their kids to school and do what they need to do on the farm. NowI think that company is in the top seven online companies in Australia. It is enormously successful, underpinned by communications infrastructure that she has there in Cooma. Of course that can be amplified much more widely with a greater spread of successful NBN technology, which we know this government has made an absolute mess out of. I had an NBN forum in Queanbeyan last week. Over 100 people came in just from the near surrounds of QueanbeyanMr Champion: I heard it was very cold. Dr MIKE KELLY: It was cold but they were fired up, so it was quite warm in that building! They were outraged at what has been going on-and the attempts by this government to save money by putting more people onto satellite than were ever intended. It is holding back so many people in their small business operations. They are just outraged at the impediments to their development that have been created by the flawed NBN approach by this government. What we need is a much more imaginative approach. I must also refer to the government's attacks on penalty rates in this context, because we are now coming very close to the situation where those penalty rate cuts will take effect on 1 July. This is absolutely critical to rural and regional Australia. We know that the McKell Institute's analysis shows that workers in rural Australia will be losing between $370 million to $691 million a year through the partial abolition of penalty rates in the retail and hospitality sectors. We are going to lose disposable income of between $174 million and $343 million in rural and regional Australia through this measure. This is the big economic impediment right now. This is the thing that is the weak link in the government's own budget-wages. There is not enough money circulating in this economy to drive small business and to drive growth. It is this government's contractionary policies, through things like penalty rate cuts and through advocating at the Fair Work Commission for no rise to the minimum wage, that are really hurting our economy. In New South Wales that penalty rate situation means that we are going to be losing somewhere between $118 million to $220 million, with a loss of disposable income of between $53 million and $106 million. In my local Monaro economy alone we will lose $16 million. This is going to have a serious impact on small businesses, and that is where they need the help. Consumer volume is the single biggest issue for a small business, which wants to have that going through the door. I also want to talk a little about the impacts on broader small businesses of the approach to the defence industry by this government. We have seen, as I mentioned, the shock that has been created in the shipbuilding yards. We have seen small businesses, like Taylor Brothers in Tasmania and J&H Williams in Adelaide, who make the ducting for these vessels, have a drop-off in work created by not building the supply vessels here and continuing the Future Frigates. This has caused tremendous to disruption to so many small businesses around the country. In the process of Land 400 we are also seeing small businesses like Elphinstone in Tasmania, which does a great job in bending metal, being ignored in that. Across the border here, in Queanbeyan, EOS does world-class remote weapons station technology. They were not even allowed to compete in the Land 400 process. We have the US Marines in Singapore and all these other countries looking at their technology, but their own country slammed the door in their face. There is no proactive marrying up of Australian SMEs with the primes in any of these projects. And by cutting and destroying what capacity we had within the DMO and by cutting the programs Labor had, we just are not seeing that proactivity in growing Australian businesses in our defence procurement processes. And we have seen, for example, the killing of the Skilling Australia's Defence Industry program, SADI. It has gone; it went last year. We had 2,600 apprentices supported through SADI. Every aspect of the employment chain was supported through that program. There was the Defence Future Capability Technology Centre, which spawned the Defence Materials Technology Centre; the Australian Industry Capability Program that we started; the Defence Export Unit helped those companies to export; and the Global Supply Chain Program was really the key forward for a lot of our businesses. We may not be making whole units of products; the key now is to get into global supply chains with componentry. That would have been the future for the car industry if we had really seen some imagination from this government in that respect to save it. The Defence Industry Innovation Centre, and all of these programs, including a Priority Industry Capability Innovation Program and a Priority Industry Capability Development Fund, were helping Australian businesses. We need to get this country on track, to exploit the potential of the new economies, to grow the jobs of the future and to then make sure it is supported by the infrastructure that will deliver those skills-not cuts to universities and not smashing up the TAFEs. We need this government to really look at what supports small business. about small business, because it highlights their lack of understanding and, indeed, a great dichotomy that has occurred in Australian politics in recent times. As you would well know, Deputy Speaker Georganas, there has been a general belief on both sides of politics now for three decades about the importance of small businesses and making them competitive, because both sides of politics, up until now, have realised that every single taxpayer dollar that we need for health, every single taxpayer dollar that we need for education, every single taxpayer dollar that we need for welfare, every single taxpayer dollar that we need for defence, or any other thing that the Australian federal government needs to spend money on, comes from the private sector. From the ramblings of the other side, you would believe that the more you tax them the better, because we are going to get more money out of them. That has not been a belief on both sides of politics for about 30 years, because what Bob Hawke and Paul Keating realised was that we needed a competitive and vibrant private sector, and it began with them. It began with the Labor Party who cut taxes not just for small business but for all businesses, including big business. Why did they do that? They did that because they knew that we needed to have a competitive tax structure that made us competitive with other countries throughout the world, because we cannot take our bat and go home-we are playing in a global economy and all our industries need to be competitive on the global scale. So Hawke and Keating cut taxes.",131,Bills
156,Mr Hogan (Page) (18:10,"It is never more interesting than to hear a Labor MP talkThey knew that was the way you had to go, and they did it. And they did not just cut themthey slashed them. It continued under the Howard-Costello governments, where we continued to move tax rates for companies and small businesses down. If you were to believe the Labor Party right now, you would say 'What happened? We started getting less money, did we, in corporate and company tax collections?' No, that is not what happened. Because when you lower tax rates it encourages small businesses to develop, it encourages the cash flow of small businesses, and it encourages more businesses to establish and come here. What happens has been statistically proven by the ABS-and I wish I had brought the figures in. I will talk about the accelerated depreciation for small business in a minute, but I did not know I was going to talk about company tax rates. I feel as though I need to, though, given the dismal contribution from the previous member. What happensevery time we have done that since the 1980s-is this: when you cut company tax rates ,within two or three years-guess what?-you are collecting more money. You are collecting more money from companies than you did previously. That is not only because the economy is growing. It actually improves and is bigger-the actual tax collection as a percentage of the total size of the economy increases. That was believed by everybody until populist Bill Shorten arrived as opposition leader and felt he needed to oppose small business and company tax rates. This is going to put us in a perilous position if we do not keep up. Deputy Speaker, I am sure you are aware that Britain's company tax rate is below 20 per cent, the US has proposals to drastically reduce their company tax rates, and within the OECD, which is not competitive by a world standard, we are near the top of the list. I think we are about sixth or seventh in the level of our tax rates. If you were to look more widely around the world, especially within our region, we are even more uncompetitive with our tax rates. The good member who just spoke talked about startups. I tell you what: when you have the choice, as a start-up, of opening up in Australia with high tax rates or going to a country close by with a lower tax rate, guess what? You do not go to the higher tax rate. He can talk about start-ups all he likes; if we do not have a competitive structure that is ongoing-if it is just for a few years-they will not do it. I leave this part of my contribution on tax rates to say-and we say it all the time, but I say it for the benefit of the other side of politics-unfortunately, you cannot tax your way to prosperity. However, we can certainly help our businesses, our small companies and, indeed, our large companies to be competitive and to compete on a world scale. The more we encourage and help them and the easier we make it for them, the more successful they will be. And then, not only that, we will get more money from them to fund all of our public measures. There is another measure that I am very happy to talk about in relation to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation For Small Business Entities) Bill 2017. You would remember, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, that this accelerated depreciation measure was introduced a number of years ago. I cannot walk the streets of any of my towns without someone in a small business saying, 'This is one of the best things they have ever seen.' They like the tax cut, but I think they would put this measure up there as an equal. You know how it works, Mr Deputy Speaker. If you are a small business-and it has double whammy effect for some-you get a tax write-off on any capital purchase of less than $20,000. This obviously encourages you to go out and spend, and it improves your cash flow situation. A lot of businesses benefit not only from that measure but also from people coming to buy things from them, with the idea of getting the tax write-off. When this measure was first announced, some of the businesses I spoke to in the agricultural sector-businesses who sell machinery to farmers, such as big ride-on mowers and that type of stuff-they said that sales of those types of items just went through the roof straight away. For some businesses, it is a double whammy. They get the tax write-off when they buy something and then they have people coming to them to buy something. Their business has expanded and boomed because of this injection to their cash flow. It was most unfortunate that in my region in the last two months-on 31 March, in fact that the CBD of Lismore was flooded. It was a devastating blow. I recall the images of the flood from when I was walking around the town. The levee over topped in the very early hours of Friday morning. The place was literally flooded for two days. You could not get into the CBD until the Sunday. I will always remember that Sunday, walking the streets of the CBD as all the owners went into their outlets to clean up. For many it has been a huge blow, because in some cases they had six foot of water and even higher come into their shops and destroy a lot of things. Some people had time to put things up; some people did not. Not that it is important for me, but my own office also flooded. The floods have caused great havoc for small businesses in the town of Lismore. A couple of things have happened from that. The Lismore Chamber of Commerce and Industry did a great job. We had a meeting just a few days after the flood. We were applying for category C funding. The chamber got very mobilised. We got a lot of forms to small businesses at this public meeting, which was on, I think, a Thursday morning at the university. We had 600 people fill out this form and return it to us. Within two weeks of the flood, we had category C funding declared and a grant for small businesses to help them go out and recapitalise. It was a $15,000 grant, which for some was great, for some it helped and for some it will not go close enough to helping but at least it has assisted in a way. That has been a great help, and so is the depreciation on the purchase of capital goods helping them. Not only are they getting a grant; but they know that when they go out and spend the money it is tax deductible. They can write it off their taxable income straight away. We need every bit of help we can get in order to get the economy and the people out there turning things over again. I will just to go through some of the specifics of the legislation. We know that, based on current lodgements of 2015 to 2016 tax returns, 220,000 businesses have reported that they have used this measure and claimed nearly $2 billion in deductions. I actually think this number will get even bigger. I am still a little bit surprised. I go to a lot of business chamber meetings and talk to a lot of tax accountants especially in my region, and some of them are still unaware of this-not so much the tax accountants, but certainly some of the small businesses. In fact, I was doing a radio interview this morning and someone asked me about this and how it worked, and I was explaining to them what it was. They had read about the fact that we were doing it in 2017, and I told them we had been doing it for a number of years. A key benefit of the $20,000 threshold, as we know, is that it encourages businesses. The whole idea of this is to give economies a boost, and it brings forward any type of capital investment that people have been thinking of making, because previously, as you know, if you bought something, although you could depreciate it, you could depreciate it only over time, at a certain percentage, depending on what it was, over a number of years. The fact that we have said that they can write it off straight away has significantly brought forward capital investment, and that was the whole aim of this. Another thing obviously has been very beneficial, and here I want to talk about pooling. Accelerated depreciation has two arms, the immediate depreciation for an asset less than the threshold but also the pooling of assets costing more than the threshold. The pooling arrangements are available to small businesses to provide greater simplicity for their tax affairs, as the pool depreciates all assets in the same way-15 per cent in the first year and 30 per cent each year after that. So, if you have a good that is worth more than $20,000 you can start to pool the goods together, and, again, it is an accelerated depreciation. Also, if the small business is registered for GST, the exclusive amount is taken to be the cost of the asset when calculating the depreciation amounts, and the immediate deductibility threshold is $20,000 exclusive of any GST. Where the entity is not registered for GST, then the GST-inclusive amount is taken to be the cost of the asset in the depreciation calculations and the immediate deductibility threshold of $20,000 inclusive of GST. I want to give some examples so that people understand exactly what you might be able to do and what you could buy. Some of my neighbours have done this. For example, if you are a courier service then obviously you can go out and buy yourself a van. Neighbours and friends of mine who are farmers have gone out and bought themselves a second hand ute, the sole use of which is for their farming activity. A book retailer could go out and buy things like bookcases or any capital equipment that they might need. Or it could be flooring-if you have to put new flooring into your retail outlet-or refrigeration or cooling equipment, or you could get a car in addition to a ute, if it is less than $20,000. Restaurant and cafe owners have so much capital equipment, and, as I said, a lot of this has been damaged recently in Lismore. You could go out to buy ovens, dishwashers and those types of things. And the great thing is that it is not capped at $20,000, so if you were to go out and buy an item, as a lot of local cafes and restaurants in Lismore are doing at the moment, such as a refrigerator for $15,000, you might also go out a bit later and buy an oven for another $15,000. It is not capped at $20,000. You can keep this. As long as the capital item is less than $20,000, it is not limited as to how much you do that, which, again, has given a great boost and brought forward many capital purchases. So, again, I think this government understands small business. There are many people I know on this side of politics who have run a small business, and that is why we understand small business. I think one of the flaws of the other side of politics, with all due respect, is that there are not enough people over there who have run a small business, who understand small business. It is a cellular thing, when you wake up in the morning and you know not only that you have to pay or make your own salary from the activities but that you potentially have to do that for other people. At a cellular level you understand what it means to make a small business successful and the challenges you face when you run a small business. We on this side of politics understand small business. The other side, unfortunately, do not. The previous speaker spoke about an economist who did not think the small business tax cuts were a good idea. I am an economist. I do not always advertise it; I do not necessarily treat it as a claim to fame. But I do treat as a claim to fame the fact that I have also run a small business. And while they may well find economists who do not think this is a good idea, I would say, with all due respect: go and find me an economist who has run a small business who would think this is not a good idea. AndI think they would be struggling to do that. While they may well find economists who think this is not a good idea, there is not a small business in this country that does not think the instant asset tax write-off is a good idea-and the tax cut that the previous member said is not a good idea. Small businesses know it is good for them, our country and our economy and, therefore, good for the public services that we can provide if we encourage small businesses to succeed. Ms MARINO (Forrest-Chief Government Whip) (18:25): There are over 12,000 small businesses in my electorate of Forrest, so that is over 12,000 instances where people have literally had a go. They have invested their own money, they have taken a huge risk, they have mortgaged their house or property and are working their hearts out in their small business. The Turnbull government is backing these courageous small business people. These are the small businesses who employ almost half of our country's workforce and pay significant tax. We know our economy grows when the small business sector is strong and doing well. We also know every small business started with someone's idea, someone's dream, someone's passion-along with the sheer hard work, dedication and sleepless nights that it takes to make it all happen. To the small businesses in my electorate of Forrest and those right around Australia: this bill, and this government, backs you. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation For Small Business Entities) Bill 2017 amends the tax law to help small businesses invest and grow. It is a continuation of a series of measures the Turnbull government has introduced to offer genuine support for small businesses. On any day, 5.6 million Australians are at work in small businesses across the country. They are earning a wage from one of our 3.2 million small businesses. These same small businesses make up 99 per cent of all Australian businesses and annually contribute $380 billion to our national economy-that is big business from small business. Many of these small businesses are the heart and soul of rural and regional towns and communities, and many of us on this side are small business people. My husband and I bought our small business, a dairy farm, on the day we got married. Like most small businesses, it was head down and tail up for many years. We had a massive debt, a rundown property that needed developing and a very limited income. I am sure many small businesses that may be listening to this tonight can really identify with this start in business. And that is how I know that one way the government can assist small business is to cut small business taxes and red tape and introduce the instant asset write-off measure in this bill. It will reduce the burden of tax on small businesses, directly encourage growth-you can invest in yourself-and increase their ability to employ even more Australians. As I have said repeatedly, how often it is that the small businesses in a small regional community offer young people their first job and sometimes offer older Australians their last job. They support the fire brigade, the local service clubs and the local sporting clubs, and they are always there when we need them in those small communities. The measures in this bill are part of the 2017-18 budget. Prior to the budget, the Turnbull government achieved a significant milestone to help small businesses by reducing the company tax rate on businesses with a turnover of $10 million or less-and that is turnover, not profit. Some small businesses, in spite of that turnover, actually make relatively small profits. That is because of the nature of their business. Those businesses owners have to work overtime themselves to pay for and retain their staff. These are the same people who often work in their businesses during the day and on their businesses at night-in particular, small family businesses. This can mean doing your accounts, BAS and ordering at night. This is exactly what happens in my own family business. Because of the Turnbull government, the tax rate for small business is now at its lowest level in many, many decades, and small businesses have more money to invest in their business today. That change in the law also means more than 90,000 additional businesses have access to tax concessions with the redefinition of small business to those turning over the $10 million per annum. The bill continues the government's plan to back small businesses. Whether it is the local small-business owner in Dunsborough, the mature age worker in Bunbury or the young jobseeker looking to start their career in Busselton, the bill is full of opportunity. In the 2015-16 budget, the Turnbull government increased the small business immediate deductibility threshold from $1,000 to $20,000 from 12 May until 30 June 2017. Well, this bill extends that measure by a further 12 months. Businesses with a turnover of less than $10 million can immediately deduct purchases of eligible assets, each costing less than $20,000. And they are doing it, Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan. You have referred to it yourself. And it is welcomed by many organisations that represent small business-do not worry about those economists that you spoke about-as well as by the smalland family-business owners themselves. The Council of Small Business Australia CEO, Peter Strong, said: For the third year in a row, the Federal Governmentthe Turnbull governmenthas demonstrated a genuine commitment to small business. There is a big difference between talking and action, and I think we have proved it. Any logical person knows that the best form of welfare is a job. Often that job is in smallbusiness. I visit small businesses constantly. I recently hosted the Minister for Small Business, and we visited a number of my small businesses. The overwhelming sense we both got was that small businesses see the instant asset write-off as a genuine opportunity. Businesses like Hot Weld Fabrication in Bunbury are the types of businesses who now have access to the instant asset write-off. A number of businesses have been nominated for the very prestigious 2017 South West Small Business Awards. It is going be held later this month in Bunbury. There are too many of these nominated businesses to mention them all, but there are a few that I would like to mention. In the industrial area of Bunbury out at Halifax, the Warehouse Cafe feeds many mouths every day from the early hours of the morning through to the afternoon. This is an excellent small business employing eight people and offering products that are renowned for being really top notch. The cafe's service is exceptional. When you walk into the Warehouse Cafe, Barbara and her team will do everything they can to make sure that you get the food and service that you want and need. The south-west is home to many very efficient businesses across a number of different industries. In over 30 years, Southern Car Care has built a strong reputation. From window tinting to electrical goods, including cruise control and stereos, Southern Car Care even installs tinting for homes, as well. The business employs six people and offers good old-fashioned service, personalised to the customers' needs. What a great way to go. It is another very sound south-west small business. Other finalists in the small business awards include Balingup Heights Hilltop Forest Cottages, Bartercard South West, Built Right Approvals from Busselton, Heatseal Double Glazing, who do double-glazed windows and doors, Laser Electrical in Bunbury, Rando& Associates and Salon Sugar, a beauty salon in Bunbury-I think it is a great name! For those of us who have actually run a small business, we understand exactly how tough it can be. As I said, small-business people are time poor. Under our measures in this bill, the business does not have to keep track of the item records and can use the extra cash flow to reinvest in the business. Assets valued at $20,000 or more can continue to be placed together in the small business simplified depreciation pool and depreciated at 15 per cent in the first income year and 30 per cent each income year thereafter. Once assets are placed in the pool, there is no requirement to track each item's depreciation over the multiple income years. In practical terms, for that small business and for those people at home at night doing this work, this really seriously reduces the burden of paperwork so that they can actually get on with the next day and do what they do best-employing people and contributing to the economy. The instant asset write-off has proven to be one of the most popular small business incentives by the Turnbull government. It encourages every one of those 3.2 million small businesses to invest in their business. I cannot let this opportunity pass without calling out the opposition. As recently as last year the shadow Assistant Treasurer said: … if you look at the current situation in terms of the corporate sector, you've got 28.5 per cent for small business and 30 per cent for big business. It makes sense to get them on the same level doesn't it? Very logical. The member for Lilley even spoke approvingly of our plan, saying: Reducing company tax will create new jobs and grow the economy right around the country, to the ultimate benefit of all Australians. The chief of hypocrisy himself, the Leader of the Opposition, said on lowering the tax on small business: Any student of Australian business and economic history since the mid-80s knows that part of Australia’s success was derived through the reduction in the company tax rate. The Leader of the Opposition says: We need to be able to make life easier for Australian business, which employs two in every three Australians. What a turnaround! Now those very same people rail against the government daily about these measures. It is blatant hypocrisy-it is breathtaking. And, it is very risky for small businesses. Labor is determined to increase taxes for those small businesses with turnovers of up to $10 million. We are about creating more jobs-that is what this government are aboutand that is why we have continued to back small business in this year's budget. Extending this instant asset write-off is a highlight in the budget for small business. Every time we walk in the door, that is a great message to deliver to a small business: 'We are backing you. We are giving you a chance to invest in your business and your people and to continue to grow.' That is what we are saying. Whether you are a trucking or a transport business, no matter what business you are, this government is backing you. If you are watching, we are backing small business. I am sure every time we do that we increase business confidence. As we have seen, small businesses, industry groups and business leaders right across the country have been vocal in their calls for an extension to the program-and we have responded to that. Our government is getting on with the job. I congratulate the Minister for Small Business for also putting together what I call the small business tool kit-an invaluable resource for small businesses. I am very pleased to say that the minister responded very positively when I suggested this initiative so that small businesses are aware of the opportunities they can take advantage of. One important thing is the ability for small businesses to get online and arrange for the Australian Taxation Office to call them at a time that suits the small business. Isn't that a fantastic thing? I've talked about the fact that small business people work in their businesses during the day and often on their businesses at night dealing with the paperwork and the practicalities. If you have an issue or want to call the Australian Taxation Office, they can call you when it suits you and your small business. All small businesses need to know about this. There are times when you need to ring the ATO, so get online, sign up and they will call you when it suits you. There is no doubt on this side that small business is the engine room of our economy. Family businesses are very much a part of that, from our farmers to every form of industry that we have in this country. I encourage small business every day. I know they are taking a great risk, I know the hard work-I have lived it and still live it. I congratulate the Treasurer on bringing this measure before the House and I encourage and implore the opposition to get behind this. Who in their right mind would not want to support small business in Australia? Perhaps only the Labor Party. (18:39): I rise tonight to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation For Small Business Entities) Bill 2017. Let me start by paying tribute to small businesses throughout Australia for their perseverance and tenacity which sees them wake early and leave late every day, every week and every month of the year. You truly are the engine room of Australia's economy. Following the successful and popular initiative in the 2016-17 budget, this bill will enable small businesses with an annual turnover of less than $10 million to claim an immediate tax deduction for eligible assets costing less than $20,000 first used or installed for use by 30 June 2018. In fact, assets do not have to be brand new-second-hand assets are eligible to be immediately deducted if they cost less than $20,000 each. The highlight of the 2017 budget for small business was this extension of the instant asset write-off program, as it is most widely known, for a further 12 months. Testament to the coalition, a pro-small-business government, this measure continues our strong record of backing small business. It will benefit approximately 3.2 million small businesses in Australia to grow and to deliver more and better paying jobs by helping them replace or upgrade their machinery and equipment. We know very well that a strong smallbusiness sector equates to more jobs and job opportunities for Australians and is key to the success of local economies. Recognising that the small-business sector in Australia employs approximately 5.6 million Australians, the coalition stands behind them and is providing hard working small-business owners with every opportunity to think big and succeed. The coalition's side of the House understands that businesses, not governments, employ people. However, smart people can lead to smarter commercial outcomes when backed by smart",141,Bills
157,Mrs Prentice (Ryan,"Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services)government policy. I know many smart businesses in my electorate of Ryan which appreciated these depreciation rules when they were first introduced in 2015. It is government policy providing a hand up, not a hand out. In the Ryan electorate there are approximately 13,200 small businesses, which employ locals and support the local community. When I travel around my electorate, I am frequently inspired by the creative spirit of new small businesses and their owners-businesses which benefit from a supportive coalition government. Take, for example, Kenmore Plaza Seafood. Known by families in the area as the place of 'Charlie's Chips', Kenmore Plaza Seafood is thriving-so much so that the owners, a family business, have improved their eat-in dining options. Another community hub is the Pullenvale Marketplace. This microcosm of small businesses is home to a medical centre, a pharmacy, a restaurant and a cafe. As an employer of many local residents in Pullenvale and surrounding suburbs in the Ryan electorate, it is another prime example of investment in Australian small business. A further success story of business innovation and entrepreneurship in the Ryan electorate is that of Opengear-an innovative leader in next-generation smart solutions to protect and manage critical ICT infrastructure. Beginning in 2004 with two employees at ilab in Toowong, Opengear now employs 64 staff worldwide and has offices across Australia, the USA, the UK and Europe. From humble beginnings, Opengear now boasts customers including tier 1 companies, DFAT and the Queensland Police, and they have been recognised with many product and technology awards. I know the Minister for Small Business, in his second reading speech, mentioned his visit to a local Greek cafe in Parramatta. In my electorate I am fortunate to have a Greek cafe, Briki Espresso and Gelato Bar, located on Hawken Drive in St Lucia. Briki typifies the success that local small businesses have achieved through measures of the coalition government. Through incentives from then Treasurer the Hon. Joe Hockey's budget, Sav and his family were able to expand their business and grow it into a favourite Greek institution known throughout Brisbane. They will now reap the rewards of measures like the instant asset write-off and small-business tax cuts. There are many other businesses in my electorate which will benefit directly or indirectly from the amendments contained in this bill. Small businesses are the lifeblood of Australia's economy and provide employment for young, old and, importantly, those with disability. When you consider that these businesses across Australia provide 42 per cent of the private non-financial sector jobs and around one-third of production, it becomes very clear that supporting them and their operation is vital. We all hear of the challenges faced by businesses, but it is the small business end of town which faces additional challenges in competing with larger entities. Economies of scale are not easily achieved. Access to finance is invariably more difficult. It is unfortunate that because of these many challenges the failure rate of small businesses is considerably high within their first year of operation. Year on year these businesses take risks and must brave and clear the inevitable hurdles that will arise. The burden of red tape and compliance is proportionately greater for time-poor business owners, so it should be a confidence booster for them that the government has committed $300 million to states and territories to remove unnecessary regulatory barriers. Small business should not be about mindlessly completing unnecessary bureaucratic paperwork. Small business should be about employment, growth and ultimately profit and reinvestment. What astounds me-and as a former small business owner myself I speak with passion-is that the opposition leader and his cohort are quite literally business destroyers. Consider the opposition leader's budget in reply speech, when he announced that Labor plans to reverse tax cuts for small business. As Minister McCormack said recently, just as businesses receive the confidence injection to invest, grow and create more jobs, thanks to our small business tax cuts, Labor has now confirmed that it will hike small business taxes. Does the opposition leader really intend to deny more small businesses and their hard working employees access to further investment and growth opportunities? Do they really want Australia to be uncompetitive on the world market? The next time the opposition leader is visiting his local corner score, perhaps to purchase a pie, please consider how the business owner, already fearful as to how they struggle to pay employees or how they often go without to ensure that the shop door actually opens, can open the next morning. Let me be clear with sentiments that are shared widely among my small business constituency. Labor's cynical, opportunistic politics is the greatest threat the Australian economy. It is a threat to all manner of businesses, from butchers and bakers to local mechanics and cafes. The coalition government believes in small business because with a combination of good luck, good management and good government policy, the small business of today can become the big business of tomorrow. It is inevitable that Labor will harp on about cutting tax rates or providing relief to businesses. Their hypocritical big on small business, short on understanding is the same BS we have seen for a number of years in this parliament. I would seriously question whether the businesses in those seats held by Labor are particularly fond of the opposition's track record when it comes to not supporting Australian business. Labor is a threat to jobs and simply cannot be trusted. The opposition leader says one thing and does another, so how can Australian business trust them? There is a well-known adage in small business that the harder you work the luckier you will be. I am a great believer in working hard to get ahead. I am also a great believer in government providing the right foundations and pathways to support those with aspirations. It is the policy in amendments like those contained in this bill that demonstrates the commitment that the Turnbull coalition government has to the businesses and people of Australia. We have a strong record when it comes to supporting small business. Given that this measure applies from 1 July, the successful passage of this legislation is critical to ensure certainty and confidence for small businesses. The Turnbull government continues to commit itself to unleashing Australia's business potential to invest, to grow and to pay their workers to support the economic future of all Australians. At the end of the day a business's business is business, and by providing the right foundations the coalition is supporting a path to success, rather than impeding their ability to undertake what they do best. I commend this bill to the House. rise in this House and speak about small business, the engine room of our economy, and I take the opportunity to speak today on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation for Small Business Entities) Bill 2017 and to applaud this government's unwavering commitment to supporting one of the most crucial elements of our national economy. Before coming into this place, I had the joy of running a small business, along with my wife, and I also came from a family of small business people. And it is interesting that I now",148,Bills
158,Mr Van Manen (Forde,"Government Whip) (18:49): It is always a great pleasure to see our two sons seeking to venture the small business arena on their own. While they are still working, they are trying to build their own businesses on the side. As many on this side have experience, it gives us a good understanding and a good appreciation of the trials and tribulations of those hundreds of thousands of men and women who strive every day to build their small businesses right around this great country. There are many, many people who have today put everything on the line to build their business for not only their family's wealth but also the wealth of future generations. They put it all on the line. Their house supports the mortgage that supports the small business and supports the overdraft. That is where all their wealth is tied up. As a government we are seeking to support these people who are prepared to put everything on the line every single day. These people not only put their future on the line but, due to the fact that they employ nearly 50 per cent of the workforce in Australia, also support the hopes and dreams of many, many other Australians-not just their own. Such people give their absolute all to their work in order to give their children and the children of their employees a brighter future. In doing so, they are also sustaining and strengthening a sector that creates more jobs for Australian workers and more opportunities to build a vibrant and inviting community across our country. Many of these small business people also contribute enormously to the communities in which they live by being involved in various community organisations, such as Rotary or Lions, or being involved in and sponsoring their local sporting clubs-righting sponsorship for the team so that they have their jerseys, training equipment and footballs or soccer balls. This is what we see our small business people right around this country do so very, very well. It is for this reason that I am proud to be part of this government, which is continually seeking to deliver for our small business sector. In my electorate of Forde, there are more than 14,600 small businesses that have built the foundation of our local economy. Several of these businesses have already taken advantage of our instant asset write-off program, and they welcome the extension of this program in the 2017-18 budget. The instant asset write-off program, which first started back in May 2015, has become instrumental for our small business community to help them replace or upgrade machinery and equipment with ease. The program improves cash flow for our businesses, which in turn boosts productivity, giving our small business owners chances they may not have had to employ more staff or to pay their existing staff more. Furthermore, when small businesses purchase more or better assets locally, communities and other businesses directly benefit from the flow-on effect of that purchase. This is because every dollar spent in a small business is a confidence boost for that business itself and for the community as a whole. In addition to the instant asset write-off program, the government is also delivering a tax system that supports enterprise, by backing small businesses to invest and helping ensure that Australia continues to be an attractive place to do business. Such a move will secure our future and create jobs for hard working Australians, also managing our transition to a more diversified economy that can continue to expand and create job opportunities for the employees of the future. We see many businesses, as I travel around my electorate, that you would not think are necessarily competing in the global marketplace. There are many like Poppys Chocolates, who are doing tremendous work around the country. Like every small business, they go through their ups and downs, but they continue to build and grow and develop and look for new market opportunities. That is where these programs and these tax cuts give them the direct incentive to do that. This government is backing small business through a tax cut to 27.5 per cent for those with a turnover of less than $10 million from 1 July. This will deliver a lower tax rate for over 870,000 companies, who employ some 3.4 million workers, including more than 15,000 businesses in my electorate of Forde. This is not all this government is doing for the small business sector. We all know that our small business owners and their staff are time poor. This is why we are working hard to develop a simpler business activity statement that will help our small businesses save time and money when they are completing the GST reporting, allowing them to focus on things that really matter in the day-to-day running of their business. Alongside this, we are also seeking to abolish further red tape. In that regard we are providing some $300 million to the state governments in order for them to find ways to reduce the red tape that small businesses face every day. Reducing the complexity of regulation for our businesses makes it easier for business to get on with the job of doing business. As the member for Ryan quite rightly pointed out in her contribution, proportionately the impact of red tape is far greater on our small business sector than it is on our large corporate sector, because our small business sector does not have the capacity to manage the red tape burden. They do not have the accountants and the advisers and the inhouse people that can manage all that red tape process. It is the owners of those businesses and their staff that have to manage that on a day-to-day basis. That is why reducing red tape for small business will be such an important achievement for those businesses, because the less time they are spending on red tape, the more time they can spend working with their customers, suppliers and potential new customers to build their businesses. We are levelling the playing field for Australian small business retailers online by applying the GST to low-value imported goods. The $1.1 billion National Innovation and Science Agenda announced in December 2015 also contains a range of initiatives and programs to support small business to be more innovative. We believe that small businesses are where dreams and big ideas begin. This agenda will give them better access to finance and help them prepare to have a go at something new. I see that in businesses around my electorate on a regular basis. We are talking to people about getting new ideas off the ground and how we can assist them. As part of this we are creating the modern digital marketplace to make it easier for small businesses to compete for the government's $9 billion information and communications technology contract. We will also require government agencies to pay invoices for contracts valued up to $1 million within 30 days. The government has made it easier for small business to access Commonwealth contracts under $200,000 and made credit and debit cards the government's preferred payment method for purchases up to $10,000. We are opening up new forms of financing for small business by legislating the crowd-sourced equity funding framework for public companies, and in establishing the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman we are providing a strong voice for small business. All of these measures prove the coalition government is showing great leadership in managing and assisting the small business sector by helping to create a framework for small businesses to grow and prosper into the future. This government is about improving small business confidence, and we see this as a great way of encouraging Australians to support the sector whenever and wherever they can. The more Australians shop locally and access services locally, the more opportunity there is for business to create jobs and wealth for the future. I am looking forward to seeing the small businesses in my electorate continue to thrive over this coming financial year thanks to the support and dedication of this government, which is determined to give them every opportunity to do so. I commend this bill to the House. (Accelerated Depreciation For Small Business Entities) Bill 2017. I would like to begin by thanking the Minister for Small Business for introducing this bill and including the extension of the instant asset write-off as a key budget measure. I thank the minister for all the work he puts into his portfolio, the work that assists almost 20,000 small businesses in my electorate of Swan alone. I know the minister was a small-business owner himself, as I am. In fact, a large number of members on this side of the House have been small-business owners. That is why we know just how much of a positive impact bills like this will have on hard working everyday Australians. Across our great nation there are 5.6 million Australians-almost a quarter of our population-working and earning a wage from one of the 3.2 million small businesses. In my electorate of Swan, this includes businesses in the Kewdale-Welshpool industrial hub and the Belmont Business Park. It includes the extensive cafe and restaurant strip along Albany Highway in Victoria Park, in which my electorate office is located, and where there are more than 100 car yards. In fact, I started my own business in Anvil Way off Division Street in Welshpool all the way back in 1988 and continued to work in the air-conditioning and refrigeration sector for more than 25 years, after spending seven years as the state manager for a national air-conditioning company. The 2017 budget extends the $20,000 instant asset write-off for a further 12 months to 30 June 2018 and the turnover threshold will be lifted to $10 million, actively improving cash flow for small businesses, helping them to reinvest in their businesses and to replace or upgrade their assets. I have listened to the speeches of people on the other side of the chamber today, who talked about going to the last election with their definition of small businesses as being $2 million. If you know anything about small business, you will know that, across the sectors, including government, insurance companies, and various NGOs and not-for-profit bodies, there are different definitions of a small business. For me, the definition of a small business goes to the amount of people they employ, and $10 million is a reasonable level to classify a small business. When I was running my business, there were only three people working in it and it had a turnover of in excess of $6 million. The problem for the Labor Party is that they think the $2 million is profit. They just do not get that there is a difference between turnover and profit. That is why they are saying that a small business is $2 million. Their definition of it is totally incorrect. There are a lot of companies out there with only three to five people or maybe even 10 people-which is a small business by a lot of definitions throughout different sectors-that turn over far more than $2 million. But, because the Labor Party do not know anything about small business, they come in here and say, 'We have people who work in small business,' and they educate people on how to deal with media. Giving lessons to union people on how to do interviews with the media is not a small business. It is not creating anything and it is not employing people; it is just pretending to be a small business.",150,Bills
159,Mr Irons (Swan) (19:00,"I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws AmendmentThe 2017 budget extends the $20,000 instant asset write-off, as I said before. So how does this actually work? For the benefit of those opposite, let me break it down further. Accelerated depreciation has two arms: immediate depreciation for each asset less than the threshold of $20,000 until 30 June 2018; and pooling for assets costing more than the threshold which cannot be immediately deducted under other provisions. The pooling arrangements are available to small businesses to provide greater simplicity for their tax affairs. As the pool depreciates all assets in the same way-15 per cent in the first year and 30 per cent in each year after that-small businesses do not need to spend valuable time tracking each individual asset against different depreciation rates over time. Anyone who has run a business would understand that the depreciation tracking and depreciation schedules have been maintained over many years. I know, having been in business before there were tools introduced by the coalition, this particular process was very time-consuming-particularly for accountants, who charge a fair amount of money. As to the GST, if the small business is registered for GST, then the GST-exclusive amount is taken to be the cost of the asset when calculating depreciation amounts, and the immediate deductibility threshold is $20,000, exclusive of any GST. For those on the other side who might not know-as the Premier of Queensland did not know-the GST rate is 10 per cent. So you can actually buy, as a business which is registered for GST, an item worth $22,000, and the actual write-off is the $20,000 threshold. Where the entity is not registered for GST, then the GST-inclusive amount is taken to be the cost of the asset in the depreciation calculations, and the immediate deductibility threshold is $20,000, inclusive of any GST. As a proud Liberal, I see it as our duty to nurture and encourage our citizens through incentives, rather than to only impose limitations. The role of government is to provide an environment in which private enterprise will thrive. It is our duty to provide opportunity for all Australians to facilitate wealth, so that all may enjoy the highest possible standards of living; to foster an environment in which the people we represent can achieve their goals; and, perhaps most importantly, to promote individual freedom and free enterprise-arguably, most evident in the small businesses across this nation. Ninety-nine per cent of all Australian businesses are small businesses, and they collectively contribute $380 billion to our gross domestic product annually. As we, on this side of the chamber, understand, small businesses are the backbone of Australia, and to help them grow and succeed will mean greater employment opportunities and better opportunities for all Australians. I have heard those on the other side today saying that Labor is the party of small business. In the whole 25 years in which I ran a small business, I never once thought that Labor were the party of small business. AllI ever saw was that, whenever Labor came in, they made it tougher for us; they imposed more restrictions on our freedom to operate; they imposed heavier taxes. They also imposed on us the '93 difficulty. I know that in my business I went without pay for 10 months, purely because of the fact that Paul Keating's policies made for a terrible onslaught on small businesses, which suffered dramatically. As the minister would know from his own experience as a small business owner, the rules around depreciation of tools and equipment are complex and variable. If something like this measure had existed back when I was running my business, I would have saved hours and hours of accountancy time over the course of the 25 years I was in business. Every dollar that is spent in small business is an injection of confidence into that business and, by extension, into the local community. It creates a chain reaction that extends from our small businesses. While those on the other side of the House seek to further make our small businesses less competitive, we, on this side of the House, are giving the backbone of our country the tools necessary to expand and compete in the global economy, and ensuring that we live up to our word on backing small business. $5.8 billion in red tape has been abolished by the coalition government. This means saving business owners time so that they can focus on growing their small businesses and not on complying with some bureaucratic process that does nothing to deliver for the greater community. We on this side of the House have small business experience. I know how hard my good friend the member for Wright worked in running his trucking business. I know that the member for Gilmore worked tirelessly to ensure her fudge-making business was successful. I know that the member for Fadden had a big business before he came into parliament. He had an IT business that employed 160 staff. I doubt whether anyone on that side of the House would ever have gone near employing 160 staff. They might have worked, through their union processes, to make sure that 160 staff were pushed off sites or sacked from companies-or, when they drove businesses into the ground, they got rid of 160 staff. I can remember when I was on a building site as an apprentice. I see that the Minister for Small Business is here; he would get this. The first thing that happened to me as an apprentice was that the union shop steward, who was Scottish and had red hair, came onto the site and, while I was up on a scaffold, insisted that I produce my union ticket. Unfortunately, after 20 minutes of abusing me-because I said 'I'm working and I'm not coming down'-he walked off and said he was going to shut the site down. I must admit that I did wait until he got about 50 metres away and then I called him back and said, 'Sorry, but I'm an apprentice.' His disgust in that situation at missing out on an opportunity to shut the site down was palpable; you could see that he was so disappointed. As someone said a long time ago, if we got rid of all the Scottish Unionists in Australia we would probably be in a much better place. Mr Conroy: Faux racist! Why do you hate Doug Cameron?

We understand what it is like to be forced to reach into your own pockets when times are tough just to keep people in work.

163,Mr Irons,"Accepted. The list goes on and on. It is a rewarding job running a smallto ensure that they keep their jobs, to ensure that they still receive their wages and to ensure that they feed their families. For too long, the pressure on small business owners has been mounting. For too long, we have taken their hard work for granted. Our small businesses need our support. That is why this government is cutting small business taxes from 1 July 2016, reducing the corporate tax rate from 28.5 per cent to 27.5 per cent from 1 July 2017, further reducing the corporate tax rate to 25 per cent by 2026-27 and increasing the unincorporated tax discount rate. That is why this government is increasing the number of businesses eligible for a range of small business tax concessions, with the small business entity turnover threshold being increased from $2 million per annum to $10 million per annum as previously noted. That is why this government is introducing a national partnership on regulatory reform providing up to $300 million over two years to states and territories that remove unnecessary regulatory barriers. It is not only those on this side of the House that can see the benefits of measures like this. The Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, James Pearson, said: Small businesses are particularly pleased to see the highly successful instant asset write-off extended to June 2018, reflecting our Pre-Budget Submission, and made available to businesses with a turnover up to $10 million. We are confident this will encourage restaurants to buy more kitchen equipment, landscape gardeners to buy more lawn mowers and tech companies to buy more hardware. He continued: Extension of the instant asset write-off is terrific. We heard first hand from small businesses during our roadshow tour with the Minister for Small Business and the Australian state and territory chamber network for the instant asset write-off to be extended, as well as the call for more reductions to regulation and red tape. One of the key benefits of the temporary $20,000 threshold is that it encourages businesses to bring forward key capital investment from future years to the current income year, renewing their capital base. When we first introduced the $20,000 instant asset write-off a business in my electorate called Print Ezy, based in Victoria Park, went out and purchased a new printing machine for his business. That measure allowed him to instantly write it off. The actual result of that-and I know the Minister for Small Business will be interested to hear this-when I spoke to him two weeks ago, he said that machine has created so much business that now he has to go out and buy a $100,000 machine. That instant asset write-off was a bonus to his business and now he has to go out and buy a machine that is capable of producing far more printing for his customers and his clients. So it has a positive effect. The coalition can see that. We understand that. We understand that providing incentives, providing instant asset write-offs, to businesses all across Australia gives them the ability to buy equipment that will improve the efficiencies of their business. Another benefit is that this measure does not only apply to tangible assets but to intangible assets also, such as computer software and intellectual property, provided that the cost is under $20,000 each. I have a short time left and I would again like to congratulate the Minister for Small Business for his efforts in implementing this bill, and I commend this bill to the House. on from the member for Swan. His was a captivating speech. AndI see the member for",155,Bills
164,Mr Mccormack (Riverina,"Minister for Small Business) (19:16): It is great to followBrisbane in the chamber as well. Certainly, those two understand small business and I very much appreciate and acknowledge the roles that they played before they came to parliament in the small business space. I would also like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. With 3.2 million small businesses employing 5.6 million Australians and contributing $380 billion to the economy annually the small business sector plays a critical role in the Australian economy. To make sure that the Australian economy ticks along nicely, the government is committed to backing small business each and every day. By implementing the policies that give small businesses the confidence to invest and grow and to employ-to hire more Australians and create more jobs. This bill amends the tax law to extend the $20,000 immediate deductibility threshold for another 12 months, until 30 June 2018. This will allow small businesses with turnover less than $10 million to immediately deduct purchases of eligible assets, each costing less than $20,000 first used or installed, ready for use, by 30 June 2018. Assets valued at $20,000 or more can continue to be placed into the small business simplified depreciation pool and depreciated at 15 per cent in the first income year and 30 per cent each income year thereafter. This extended measure will improve small business cashflow, encouraging small businesses to invest in their business for another year. The Liberals and Nationals understand that, when small businesses get just a bit of additional money, they reinvest it back into their own business to enable them to grow and to, as I said before, hire more Australians and create more jobs. This 12-month extension continues the government's strong record of backing small businesses, supporting them all the way; to grow, and to deliver more jobs and better-paying jobs, including by helping them replace or upgrade their machinery, their capital equipment. We know the benefit is felt economy-wide, in metropolitan cities, in the outer suburbs, in rural, remote and regional Australia. A small business recently informed us that the instant asset write-off had a chain reaction through the local economy. That was the lovely Alana Laliotitis in Parramatta. She owns Kouzina Greco restaurant, and she said it created a chain reaction when installed new kitchen equipment for her very popular restaurant-I visited that restaurant with Senator Marise Payne, the Defence Minister, after launching the two-dollar ANZAC commemorative coin recently. Alana told us how she went and bought new kitchen equipment. She used a local electrician to install the equipment and it created a chain reaction through her business. It created greater efficiency in the kitchen, which then created greater productivity. Her staff, she reported, even got a boost from it. 'Staff morale improved,' she said. But, most importantly, more customers came through the door. And that is what all small businesses want-more customers. The results from purchasing an asset locally, arranging for locals to install the asset and having happier staff due to the new equipment ultimately produces a better product for customers. Over the past few months I have met with and heard from hundreds of small business owners who have told me how they have used the instant asset write-off to grow their business. The instant asset write-off has proved to be a very popular small business measure, and was the highlight for small business in this year's budget. Indeed, 9 May was a red letter day for small business. In fact, I would almost describe it as more black than red, because it is enabling them to get more profits, and all small business want to be in the black, not the red. Coincidentally, the morning of 9 May was when the 27½ per cent tax rate was installed for businesses with a turnover of up to $10 million. So those measures provided for in the previous year's budget were in fact enshrined in law. That enabled the instant asset write-off, introduced that night-and hopefully this bill will be passed tonight in the lower house-now enables businesses with a turnover of up to $10 million to take advantage of this instant asset write-off. Another great example was Anna Mitsios, the founder of Edible Beauty in Sydney. She needed the instant asset write-off to be extended so that she could buy a forklift to keep up with the demand for her products in Asia. She is taking advantage of the free trade agreements that we have been able to broker with South Korea, Japan and China. She said: We need to palletise our warehouse as we get bigger orders from Asia. I used the write-off to finance a car last year. It's been a huge help. In the member for Swan's electorate, small business owner Dina Otley, who runs Nosh Gourmet Food and Gifts, told of how she has used the instant asset write-off to invest in a small kitchen and equipment, which led to her employing new staff. She said: More than long-term tax cuts, this has an immediate effect of helping us to keep investing in the future of our business. As a small business it is always difficult to maintain a competitive offer against larger rivals with more resources and buying power. A great quote. Mechanic Tery Wallace wanted to see the instant asset write-off extended this year. The owner of Boyd's Garage in Surrey Hills said: We need all the help we can get in small business and that tax incentive was a great idea which should be continued. I would be a bit worried if it wasn't continued to be honest-because we need people to invest in small business. Through the passage of this bill, we are delivering the extension which Tery, stakeholders and many small business owners have called for. These are real stories of the men and women at the forefront of small business, who have explained in practical terms how the instant asset write-off is benefitting their business operations. In conjunction with our plan to provide tax relief for small business-down to 27½ per cent; the lowest it has been for many, many decades-and a turnover threshold of up to $10 million, this government is supporting small businesses to create new opportunities and boost productivity to secure Australia's future. For those who have run a small business-and there are many on this side of the Housewe know that every little bit counts, every little bit makes a big difference. We understand the daily pressures and demand in managing staff, balancing cash flow and meeting reporting obligations. That is why this side is also getting on with the job of cutting through red tape. The member for Swan mentioned the fact that $5.8 billion annually has already been cut from that burden which is such a pressure on small business. Of course, in the budget-that excellent budget produced by the member for Cook-$300 million was put on the table to incentivise states and territories to see where they could further cut through some of that red tape which is bogging down business. The member for Reid, in his role as Assistant Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, last year in Parramatta rolled out the national business simplification incentive, which helps the hospitality industry cut through that red tape between federal, state and local government-breaking down the silos so that, for instance, a coffee shop, rather than having an 18-month wait from go to whoa, would have that time reduced to just three months. We have listened to small businesses so that we could deliver the best support they need to get ahead and to get on with what they do best. We know Australia's 3.2 million small businesses are central to keeping our economy strong. They look to this government for support and action. A strong small business sector means more jobs for Australians, more opportunities to build vibrant local communities across the country. We are extending the instant asset write-off so hard working small businesses can continue to get ahead. A few stakeholder quotes: Derek Schoen, the President of NSW Farmers, said on 9 May: 'The association is particularly pleased to see the $20,000 immediate asset write-off provisions for small businesses continue for a further year.' James Pearson, the CEO of the Australian Chamber Of Commerce and Industry, said: 'Extension of the instant asset write-off is terrific. We heard first hand from small businesses during our roadshow tour with the Minister for Small Business and the Australian state and territory chamber network for the instant asset write-off to be extended as well as the call for more reductions to regulation and red tape.' Innes Willox, the CEO of the Australian Industry Group said: 'Critically, the budget provides a substantial boost for smaller businesses by lowering tax burdens, extending asset write-off eligibility and cutting red tape.' Kate Carnell, the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, who is doing a fantastic job, said: 'It is great to see another budget focused on small business. This gives small business a level playing field with a capacity to grow.' Geoff Crouch from Wagga Wagga, the chair of the Australian Trucking Association, said: 'The government's decision to extend the instant asset write-off to 30 June 2018 will benefit many eligible businesses.' He would know, because he and his industry keep goods moving. They are the lifeblood of getting goods freighted across the country. Geoff certainly understands the instant asset write-off and its advantages. Melina Morrison, who is the CEO of the Business Council of Co-operatives and Mutuals, said: 'Any assistance which is given to small businesses, such as the continued $20,000 capital write-off and small business company tax cuts, will be welcomed by BCCM members.' There you have it: very much appreciated by stakeholders and by real small business owners right across the nation. With that I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time.",156,Bills
165,Mr Mccormack (Riverina,"Minister for Small Business) (19:27): by leave-I move:That the House do now adjourn. Defence Procurement line of the economic vandalism that this government has embarked upon during its history, with two prime ministers, three defence ministers, multiple other ministerial changes and the like; but also, accompanying that, an assault on our industrial capacity and our manufacturing workforce. We have seen this most starkly in the automotive industry, which is facing a devastating closedown. I am right on the front line of that with Holden in my electorate. I have also seen it in the steel industry in places like Whyalla and, of course, we have also seen it in shipbuilding in South Australia, with government's inability to build the two supply ships in Australia and, with that, that terrible wind-down of our shipbuilding workforce. We have seen that not just in South Australia, but around the country in places like Forgacs and in Williamstown with BAE. It is a tremendously regretted diminution of skills, skills formation and the technical ability of the country. Increasingly, in South Australia we are looking at the shipbuilding workforce being diminished even further. At the moment, ASC in South Australia has 1,500 employees1,100 permanent, 23 apprentices, 345 contractors. There have been 1,000 or so jobs lost in recent times. As the last air warfare destroyer is completed, we are looking down the barrel of an estimated 500 or so manufacturing jobs and white-collar technical jobs going out of those yards. So it is of enormous concern, I think, when we read the government's Naval shipbuilding plan, which is being touted by the government every question time, during the visits to South Australia by the Prime Minister and by the member for Sturt, who is the minister in this area. If you read their shipbuilding plan, in particular their chapter on the naval shipbuilding workforce, on page 67 it states: South Australian shipbuilders will need to increase their workforce by some 3 600 staff from anticipated minimum levels in 2021, with a strong concentration on the skilled trades. It goes on to mention fabricators, welders, electricians, carpenters, pipe welders and professional staff, including managers and naval engineers, and the like. Later, it says there will be a further increase from 2022 when you get the combination of future frigates and future submarines, peaking at a figure of around 5,226. So what we are looking at is an enormous increase and an enormous sudden demand for skilled workers. One wonders where these workers are going to be sourced from. This report gives us little confidence that the government is preparing properly, I think. There is a lot of language in this report about using automotive workers and about, perhaps, using workers from the mining and gas production industries, or rehiring former naval shipbuilding workers. But there is no real plan. There is a real guts behind all this. There is no talk of exactly who might employ the apprentices. Startling enough, on page 77 there is a clause which actually recommends the government is going to talk to the ACTU and the relevant unions in this area about those workforce requirements.",159,Bills

My great worry is we will wake up after this terrible, devastating economic famine in South Australia and find that these skilled workers have not been trained and that we face desperate skill shortages just as we, in 2020 to 2025, are looking for a shipbuilding workforce. (Time expired) Ryde Area Supported Accommodation for Intellectually Disabled organisation called RASAID, the Ryde Area Supported Accommodation for Intellectually Disabled. This group was formed six years ago by 19 local families who were struggling to secure accommodation and support for their 20 adult sons and daughters with intellectual disabilities. All of them required a high level of care and some required it around the clock. Like many other parents of children with a disability, the families of RASAID lived their lives as a rollercoaster of emotion and fatigue. Most of them are aged 50 and above, with their most senior member still a full-time carer at 87 years of age. The families of RASAID have supported each other for decades. Their adult children have grown up together, attending school, day programs, work placements and social groups together. With more that 600 years of combined carers' experience, these parents are best positioned to advocate for the individual care and accommodation needs of their dependent children. When I first spoke of this dedicated group, they were a community-a small support group with great aspirations for a communal home. And they were just that-aspirations. What a difference seven years has made. Last month I was over at their state-of-the-art facility where each resident has their own room surrounded by a devoted staff and the love of their families. The residents clearly benefit from the social interactions with their neighbours and the roundthe-clock care has allowed their parents to live their own lives for the first time in decades. The smiles on the faces of everyone involved show how this situation has improved lives across the board. This perfect state did not come about by accident-it needed perseverance, tenacity and strength. Thanks go to politicians from both sides of this parliament, as well as the New South Wales parliament. Local state member Victor Dominello has been a determined supporter. But the efforts of politicians have been nothing compared to the tireless work of the families involved. This project is a success only because of these great families. Last month, though, all this was put in peril by a bombshell from NDIA. Issues with supported independent living funding left eight families out of pocket to the tune of many thousands of dollars. They clearly did not have this money, and there was just eight weeks to act before the centre may have had to close its doors, just one year after the joy of opening them. The well-oiled campaigning machine then jumped back into action. Within days I was at the home, alongside representatives from Victor Dominello's office. Hours after, I had the assistant minister, Jane Prentice, on the phone. Advisers, help lines and people throughout the department were mobilised. Thanks to the assistant minister, a new tool kit, which was to be launched in the new financial year, was brought forward especially for this home. Assessments were carried out but, when the decision making process looked like taking longer than the June deadline, the assistant minister and NDIA brought it forward so that",160,Adjournment

This is a truly excellent result. I would like to thank the assistant minister and her office, as well as the representatives of NDIA who helped me and my office. Again, I would like to applaud the tenacity and care of the RASAID families. Back in 2011, I ended a speech about RASAID by making a pledge of support. The words are as relevant today as ever, and I would like to end with those same words: I strongly applaud the tireless efforts of the parents of RASAID and all the carers of those involved in disability services in Bennelong, and I pledge my ongoing support. Congratulations to the families of RASAID-you represent the best example of a close-knit community. May this funding and Australia's commitment to the NDIS keep you safe and secure for many years to come. Sport Dr FREELANDER (Macarthur) (19:38): On this day of the first State of Origin rugby league match for 2017 I would like to say a few words about sport. Unlike others in this place, such as the member for Murray, Damian Drum, an AFL legend, and the member for Bennelong, John Alexander, an international tennis legend, if ever there was a member whose own sporting prowess, seasoned by advancing years, ill-equips him to talk about sport, I am your man. I am not a sports nut but I am a fan-a modest one who has every right to stay modest. But State of Origin goes beyond sport. It is, in an odd way, part of our national psyche. Millions watch it, and not just those from the maroon and sky-blue states. Origin has become a phenomenon akin in many ways to the Melbourne cup. People who usually do not take much of an interest in rugby league are for three nights a year glued to their sets, absorbed in the latest struggle between the Cane-toads and the Cockroaches. I suspect that is down to more than a triumph of marketing and a top-of-the-shelf television coverage-it appeals to something deep within us all, in the same way that the best of the best in any field or calling will have something that grabs us, something that tells us a bit more about ourselves. It is almost as if Australian sports fans have become as attached to State of Origin as British historians and dramatists have been to the Wars of the Roses. Sport, even viewed from an armchair, has lots going for it. It can be as beautiful as ballet or as poignant and instructive as King Lear-especially off the field. And let's not forget some of this country's finest writing has been about sports by wonderful and prolific all-rounders like Gideon Haig, Roy Masters, Spiro Zavas, Evan Whitton, Peter FitzSimons and Peter Lalor. And Australian sports broadcasters and their crews are amongst the finest in the world. The Channel9 team, headed by the incomparable Ray Warren tonight, is world class-something we tend to forget simply because they have been doing it for so long and so well. Anyone who has ever heard a race called by an American broadcaster will know just how good generations of Australian race callers have been. The technology employed and those who deploy it-much of it pioneered in the days of the late Kerry Packer and coinciding with the birth of World Series Cricket-is of course 'simply marvellous'. To quote another unlikely sports fan, the musician Neil Young, 'Tonight's the night,' if ever I were going to say something about sport. So here I am, possibly a bit underdone, but ready to make some hard yards on three important issues. Sport is good for our mental health. Sport binds us together; it integrates us into this society, provides us with social contacts and improves our self-esteem. Sport allows social mobility, and can help support education and the stable environment which is essential in any child's development. Secondly, sport encourages exercise, exercise patterns and healthy lifestyles which are very important in combatting our epidemic of childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes. Thirdly, sport and regular exercise are very important for our ageing population-for continuing mental agility and preventing the onset of some of the diseased of age, such as cardiovascular disease. I am lucky that I represent an area which has a large culture of team sport. In Macarthur, sport is embedded in our community, with over 80 varying sporting clubs. We have sporting groups that start at age 4, like the Campbelltown Cobras Soccer Club, and groups that have divisions for the over 70s, like the Macquarie Fields Swimming Club. We have AFL, basketball, dance, Little Athletics, netball, rugby league, rugby union, soccer, softball, swimming, a Special Olympics team, tennis, touch football and baseball as well. There is no greater social mechanism to breakdown divides and to bring the community together than sport. We have had a lot a fantastic talent in Macarthur-names such as Israel Folau, Jarryd Hayne, Jim Piper, Brett Hodgson, Alyson Annan, John Skandalis and Brett Emerton hailed from our region at some point in their busy lives, amongst many others. Of course, I cannot forget the great Campbelltown institution, the Wests Tigers rugby league team. Sport has been very important to me. My father was President of West Harbour Rugby Union Club for many years, my wife is an active netballer and I have seen the way that Sport transforms the lives of some of my patients. I wish both teams well tonight. I hope it is a great game-but go the Blues! Deakin University: ALLPlay Dance Ms BANKS (Chisholm) (19:42): Last FridayI had the pleasure of hosting the Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services, Jane Prentice, in the heart of Chisholm at Deakin University in Burwood. Together we announced that Deakin University was one of the successful recipients of the recent information linkages and capacity building national readiness grant round, a vital component of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. A wonderful Chisholm institution, Deakin University has been awarded a $627,000 grant for their ALLPlay Dance initiative that aims to build awareness and skills in the dance community to increase access for people with disability to mainstream dance programs across Australia. The ILC building program is centred on the concept of community inclusion. As the program's director at the National Disability Insurance Agency, Mandy Baxter, said, 'You don't change the person to fit the environment; you change the environment to fit the person.' Indeed, ALLPlay Dance is a fantastic initiative that addresses some of the current barriers to social participation and community connectedness for people with disability, particularly children, by fostering high-quality inclusive dance experiences and opportunities. The establishment and success of AllPlay Dance lies with the passion of Chisholm resident Tabitha and Deakin University Professor in Clinical Psychology, Nicole Rinehart. Together, Tabitha and Professor Rinehart identified a significant gap in the opportunities available for people with a disability, such as Tabitha's wonderful daughter Bianca. Tabitha shared her struggle to find a dance school for 10-year-old Bianca, who has Mowat-Wilson syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. Like every parent, Tabitha wanted to find a dance school where Bianca would be treated and catered for the same as everyone else. As I witnessed on Friday morning, Bianca has a fabulous passion for dance, and like every child in Australia she deserves the opportunity to be supported to thrive in an inclusive environment, as she is able to now. Sadly, however, Tabitha's and Bianca's experience is not an isolated one, which is why it is so important for us to invest in both community and personal capacity building to ensure communities, people with disability and their families have the skills, resources and confidence they need to participate in the community and access the same kind of services as other people. The ALLPlay Dance initiative is one of the 39 Turnbull government grants totalling just over $14 million that have been provided to organisations across the country to make the community more accessible and inclusive of people with disability. There is a wonderful spread of projects targeting key cohorts across the community, with initiatives spanning across education, employment, social participation, cultural awareness, sport and health. Many of the projects involve engaging with community and mainstream services to design and develop strategies to improve awareness and competency to meet the needs of people with disability and to be inclusive in all mainstream settings, just as Bianca is able to enjoy the benefits of dance classes at ALLPlay Dance. I congratulate Deakin University and encourage other organisations to consider applying for future grants to ensure all people with disability can lead an ordinary life, including participation in education, getting a job, accessing their community and enjoying the company of friends and family. In particular, I extend my sincere congratulations to Deakin University vice-chancellor Jane den Hollander, clinical psychologist Professor Nicole Rinehart and Mandy Baxter, Director of Information, Linkages and Capacity Building at the NDIA for their important work in building an inclusive community in Chisholm. A big thankyou also to the student dancers from Presbyterian Ladies' College, or PLC, as it is known, in Burwood, who supported Bianca's dance showcase on Friday morning. It is examples such as the struggle of Tabitha and Bianca that demonstrate why the Turnbull government's actions to close the NDIS funding gap are so integral. I am proud to be part of a government that is helping all Australians who are impacted by disability, whether directly or indirectly. Another example of the Turnbull government's fair and inclusive support for Australians is our fantastic Quality Schools funding reforms. Yesterday in question time the member for Wills erroneously used the example of the wonderful Aurora School in Blackburn South in my electorate. Those on the other side are playing politics, to the detriment of students nationwide. Aurora School is a marvellous school providing learning opportunities for deaf and deafblind children in Victoria. As part of our funding reforms, the school's excellent work will continue to thrive, with an increase in funding of $1.5 million over the next 10 years. Like all Chisholm's 23,000 students, the students at Aurora will benefit. I am proud to be part of a government that supports all Australians to have equal opportunities to succeed, whether that is by closing the NDIS funding gap or building inclusive communities. (Time expired) Cunningham Electorate: Volunteers Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (19:48): Like, I am sure, many of my colleagues in this place, when we are not here but back in our electorates we are often going out to a variety of groups in our community, participating in special events with them. In this past month, as is quite often the case, it particularly struck me how many of those organisations that we were visiting, either to celebrate an occasion or to talk to them about grant funding opportunities, were driven by volunteers. It is quite extraordinary when you look across your electorate and see the organisations that are in the community doing the job of supporting their fellow local community members. I often reflect that, if governments had to fund the work that so many volunteers do, we certainly would have a significant budget challenge on our hands. I want to take the opportunity tonight to talk about one of those groups. On 19 May I attended our local Vision Australia office, and they were having a morning tea to thank their volunteers. What was so extraordinary on this occasion is that many of the volunteers working for Vision Australia were doing a wide variety of tasks-some of them were doing radio programs and some of them were doing day-trip assistance-and many of them had a vision impairment themselves. So, while they have a vision impairment, they are looking at ways they can use their skills and abilities to help other people with a vision impairment who may not be able to do those particular tasks. It was very inspiring. I want to take the opportunity to put on the record the people we celebrated at that particular morning tea. Sally Thompson, Mary Gillis and Sue Smart all marked five years of volunteering. Sally, Mary and Sue are audio describers who completed the training together in March 2011. They have described in theatres, in art galleries and on group outings. I was very pleased that we were able to get a grant for our local theatre, IPAC, to put hearing assistance support into the theatre so people with hearing challenges can also enjoy theatre locally. John Costello, Tony Sarkas, Vicky Curran and Keith Rutherford received their one-year service pins for volunteering. John and Tony are both community group support volunteersJohn at the Gwen Booker Centre for Vision Impaired in Corrimal and Tony at the Central Vision Impaired Group in Wollongong. And Vicky assists at the monthly walking group; they call themselves the White Cane Wanderers, and I understand it is a very popular activity. Keith works alongside the adaptive technology specialist to assist clients make the most of what technology has to offer. A very expansive and interesting video was presented to us about the significant difference that technology advancements have made for people with vision impairment and their capacity to help them participate in the community. What really struck me, as I reflected to the group, was the fact that the combination of technology and support from such an extraordinary organisation like Vision Australia, its full-time staff as well as its volunteers, does not mean we are asking the question: 'What can people with a vision impairment do?' It actually means we are asking the question: 'What can a person with a vision impairment not achieve?' It is really significant in terms of the sorts of activities, engagement and participation they are enabling. Many of those who volunteer are people who did not have a visual impairment for most of their life; some of them have progressive illnesses that have impacted on them. Having that support around them is very important. I want to congratulate all those who celebrated this year at Vision Australia. I thank the volunteers for the work they do and I also thank the organisation for the great contribution they are making to our community. We all benefit from having those wonderful people that I met-along with my state colleague the member for Keira, Ryan Park, who was also there. It means citizens are able to fully participate in our community regardless of disability. I think that should be the aim of all of us in government as well as in our communities. A big thank you to those wonderful volunteers. Asia-Pacific Region the stability and security of the broad Asia-Pacific region. When Australia's Defence white paper was being crafted in 2015 it noted that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the DPRK, would continue to be a major source of regional insecurity and instability. The white paper noted: North Korea's threatening behaviour includes its nuclear weapons program, its ballistic missile tests and its proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. North Korea's behaviour especially threatens its immediate neighbours, particularly South Korea and Japan. That assessment from 2015-16 has been proven by the events since. The recent DPRK missile launches have ratcheted up already simmering tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the surrounding region. Defence commentators quickly observed that the regime would soon have the ability to launch a ballistic missile against the United States. Indeed, one commentator noted that Australia itself could be a target. But the more likely targets are closer to Pyongyang-South Korea and Japan. With the impeachment of President Park, South Korea is experiencing the considerable political turmoil of an election campaign without a national leader. Interestingly, the candidate most likely to be elected as the new President of South Korea, Moon Jae-In, fled from the north and still has extended family there. The election of a president where there may be less assertion towards the north could in fact embolden the hand of Pyongyang. Also closer to North Korea is Iwakuni and Sasebo in Japan, where American forces are based, including their stealth fighters. North Korea's actions compounded existing tensions in the region, especially in the China Sea. Japan, which has deployed its largest naval ship to the South China Sea, is wary of both China and North Korea. Indeed, tensions between the two nations have simmered in the East China Sea for years. They are now spreading to the South China Sea, where pressures already exist over China's militarisation of disputed reefs and its refusal to abide by international tribunal rulings. Indeed the Japanese government has been quietly moving military personnel to the south-west of the country, a sign that they anticipate the tensions in the region will escalate. Indeed, it was reported in the Japanese media that the US had deployed 'Gray Eagle' drones armed with air-to-ground missiles to South Korea. This follows reports that B1 and B52 bombers had been moved to the country. While this is part of the Foal Eagle exercise, it ratchets up pressure in the region. If Kim Jong-un was to draw China into a regional conflict with South Korea or Japan, the US would have little option but to respond. The US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, has already voiced a tougher approach to China than the previous administration. This would have immediate ramifications for Australia and other allies.",161,Adjournment
169,Mr Andrews (Menzies) (19:53,"An important subject. I want to talk about tonight isChina is the key to the resolution of the issue. It has considerable influence over the rogue North Korean state. It can influence behaviour, better behaviour, through economic sanctions and indeed other means. Indeed, we had as a special guest of this parliament this week Senator John McCain, who stressed that Australia and the US and allies must take a steadfast approach in relation to these tensions and pressures that we may well face in coming months and years. Historically we have known that conflict in the region has tended to occur quickly and unexpectedly, so Australia needs to be ready, politically and strategically, for the unexpected. Tensions in the region are likely to compound in the coming weeks and months, and we need to be prepared for whatever event may occur in the spirit of time. National Indigenous Youth Parliament Indigenous Youth Parliament and I want to speak about how important this initiative is and to thank the organisers of it, including the Australian Electoral Commission, and to congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your role in overseeing their adjournment debates on Sunday. I hear they were very excellent contributions. I particularly want to pay tribute to the representative from my local area, Phoebe McIlwraith from Halekulani on the southern edges of my electorate. She is a passionate young woman who, besides going to high school, works one day a week volunteering as a literacy tutor in the local primary school. She is passionate about education. She was telling me about her dream to go to university to pursue a course in either education or communications and to start up a company focused on new media, but also to continue her education role. That is one of the many stories that people witnessed from the youth parliament attendees. It fills my heart with joy to see so many passionate Indigenous kids who are really trying to make a difference. But I want to talk about something sad briefly in the moments left to me. I was told by the member for Newcastle, who has had a long connection with them through her work with the Indigenous community, that every year the Indigenous Youth Parliament is interrupted with news of a family member committing suicide, and that is a tragic story. It is a tragic incident. And the member for Newcastle was telling me that it is almost normalised, they almost expect it, such is the plague of suicide in some Indigenous communities around this country. It is a horrible symbol of the challenges that everyone in Australia and everyone in this chamber faces to really provide justice to Indigenous Australians. I want to compliment everyone involved in the Indigenous Youth Parliament. I will be very happy to see them again next year and, hopefully, it will lead to bigger and better thing for everyone involved in such a worthy initiative.

171,"Mr Mccormack: To Present A Bill For An Act To Amend The Law Relating To Corporations,","Wednesday, 31 May 2017 Medicare Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (10:00): TodayI rise to talk about one element of this very unfair budget brought down by the coalition, and that is the continued refusal to reverse the Medicare indexation freeze. Residents in my electorate have been raising this as an issue for some time. They are telling me-and this is backed up by facts-that bulk-billing numbers are down in my electorate; out-of-pocket costs are up; it costs more to go and see a specialist; it costs more for vital tests and scans; and it costs more to visit allied health professionals. Unfortunately, these cuts to Medicare that Tony Abbott held in and Malcolm Turnbull has continued are leading to significant issues around accessing medical care in our community. Residents in their thousands have contacted me through our Medicare petition, saying that they absolutely want to see action. Despite what the government and the Prime Minister have said about ending the freeze on medical services, this is absolutely not the case. It is not the case, because the impact is still happening. Only last month I was contacted by a staff member at a local medical centre. This particular medical centre services a large number of disadvantaged people within the community and bulk-bills 80 per cent. It prides itself on providing affordable and accessible health care for vulnerable people and their families. This rebate freeze has now left the centre in a position where it must charge higher fees and reduce bulk-billing. The staff member said that many other centres in the networking group are in the exact same position. They are concerned that these cuts are making quality health care out of reach for so many Australians. They are concerned that it will stop people going to see a GP. We know that going to see a GP is effective preventative health care. We know that it costs a whole lot less in the system to go and see a GP than it does to end up in hospital. While the Prime Minister and the government may not care about the impact they are having on state governments and hospital systems, I do, because this is not just about cost-shifting. This is not about who pays for what. This is about ensuring that my community and communities like this right around Australia have the best quality health care. It starts with early intervention. It starts with good primary health care. With this Medicare freeze continuing, out-of-pocket costs and access to GPs and other specialists are only going to get worse. Armenian-Australian Community an electorate which is home to one of our nation's largest Australian-Armenian communities. Those of Armenian heritage reflect all of the best features of our history of migration and multiculturalism. While the first Armenians arrived during the gold rushes of the 19th century, it was the post World War II era, particularly the 1960s, which saw the largest influx of Armenian migrants, most of whom settled in Melbourne and Sydney. Often arriving with little, Armenian migrants worked hard to establish themselves in a new land and succeeded, with their commitment to family, enterprise and community.",170,Notices
172,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Buchholz) Took The Chair At 10:00.,,171,Constituency Statements
173,Mr Zimmerman (North Sydney) (10:03,"I am fortunate to represent in this parliamentBe it in business, culture or public life, so many Australians of Armenian heritage have gone on to become leaders of our community. For those of us in politics, this is amply demonstrated by the example set by my predecessor, Joe Hockey, whose father was of Armenian stock, and of course the leadership being provided to the people of New South Wales by a Premier with an unmistakably challenging Armenian surname, Gladys Berejiklian. Part of the reason for the success of the Australian-Armenian community has been two traits deeply interwoven in the history of the Armenian people. The first is resilience, borne out of centuries of domination by its neighbours and the tragic attempt of the Ottoman Empire to commit genocide against its Armenian population. The second is the faith of Armenians in community, family and church. That faith is found in Armenian communities across Australia, and today I want to acknowledge in this parliament the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Australia. It has a proud history, and I know many in my local community will join together for the celebration events this year, including a special concert to be held in Chatswood in August. The first Armenian Apostolic Church of Holy Resurrection was consecrated in Surry Hills in 1957. Nine years later, in 1966, the church was relocated to Chatswood in the municipality of Willoughby, which was fast becoming a focal point for Armenians moving to Australia. The church has had many fine leaders since its establishment. I particularly want to acknowledge the role of Archbishop Aghan Baliozian, who served the church in Australia from 1975 until his untimely death in 2012. I also acknowledge the leadership currently being provided by His Grace Bishop Najarian, who is serving his community with such distinction. During its history in Australia, the church has met the spiritual needs of its adherents-its primary mission. It has also done more than that as a centre for maintaining the rich legacy of Armenian culture and a symbol of national identity and language. I am confident the Armenian Apostolic Church will continue to be a beacon of light in the lives of so many who have made Australia their home and those who understandably cherish their Armenian heritage. It is an important milestone, and I look forward to participating in many of the celebrations during the course of this year. National Reconciliation Week Reconciliation Week, a time to reflect on two significant anniversaries in Australia's recognition journey: 50 years since the 1967 referendum; and 25 years since the historic Mabo decision. Last Friday in our community of Kingsford Smith, I was honoured to attend the unveiling of the Stolen Generations Memorial at the Eastern Suburbs Memorial Park in the suburb of Matraville on the land of the Bidjigal people. We are blessed to have a strong local Aboriginal community, particularly in the suburbs of La Perouse and around Botany Bay-or Kamay, as it is known in the Indigenous language. Many of them are surviving members of the stolen generation and were present at the unveiling. It was a solemn and meaningful occasion that brought to mind former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's 2008 apology to the stolen generations. In that momentous speech on that day, Kevin Rudd said the following:",171,Constituency Statements
174,Mr Thistlethwaite (Kingsford Smith) (10:06,"This week is NationalLet it not become a moment of mere sentimental reflection. Let us take it with both hands and allow this day, this day of national reconciliation, to become one of those rare moments in which we might just be able to transform the way in which the nation thinks about itself, whereby the injustice administered to the stolen generations in the name of these, our parliaments, causes all of us to reappraise, at the deepest level of our beliefs, the real possibility of reconciliation … reconciliation across all Indigenous Australia. Although our First Australians were brave enough to accept the apology and found it in their hearts to put aside their bitterness and their anger at what had had occurred over many generations, discriminatory policies such as this have left a stubborn and often deadly legacy across our nation and in the community that I represent. If you are a young Aboriginal boy growing up in our community at the moment, you are more likely to leave school and go to Long Bay jail than to the University of New South Wales as a student. Still today, an Aboriginal Australian on average will die 10 years younger than a non-Aboriginal Australian. There have been recent suicides of young Aboriginal people in our community, each one a tragedy, and, despite the apology, 35 per cent of Aboriginal children are in out-of-home care away from country, kin and culture. It is not enough just to say sorry. Kevin Rudd's words, expressed on behalf of our nation, must have meaning. This Reconciliation Week let us remind ourselves of the fact that it is not merely about saying sorry for injustices done but committing to restoring dignity, respect and better living standards for our First Australians. O'Connor Electorate: Aged Care working in the aged-care sector throughout my electorate of O'Connor. I am proud to say that I have visited almost every aged-care facility in my electorate and witnessed first hand the outstanding care afforded to our senior citizens. I take my hat off to these unsung heroes who work hard maintaining the dignity and quality of life of our community elders who can no longer live independently in their own homes. To keep O'Connor families in the region, our parents and grandparents need to be able to age in place surrounded by loved ones in the community they have lived in and contributed to all their lives. Earlier this year, the Minister for Aged Care, Ken Wyatt, visited O'Connor, and I was pleased to host important discussions with our aged-care providers around the challenges unique to delivering quality residential care in the regions. Julie Christensen is one of O'Connor's most innovative and compassionate facility managers. She is currently overseeing a multimillion dollar upgrade to the Karinya Residential Aged Care centre in Narrogin. Thanks to last year's ACAR bed allocations, Karinya Residential Aged Care is currently expanding to dementia, bariatrics and palliative care capabilities in Narrogin, improving outcomes for aged care in our southern Wheatbelt region. Meanwhile, the Esperance Aged Care Facility has turned the first sod on their upgrade thanks to a $3.1 million ACAR grant and the provision of an additional 30 aged-care bed licences. On completion, they will be able to house 114 residents, with three new wings, including a 12-bed secure dementia unit. I take this opportunity to congratulate the retiring director of nursing, Kathie Carey, for her tireless dedication to providing the best possible regional residential care for seniors of the Esperance district and surrounds who would otherwise face their twilight years living away from their loved ones over 600 kilometres away in Perth.",172,Constituency Statements
175,Mr Rick Wilson (O'connor) (10:09,"I rise today to give a big shout-out to thoseIn the south-west of my vast electorate, there is a small but highly regarded 16-bed facility-Geegeelup Village Hostel in Bridgetown. Despite having waiting lists of up to 40 people at any given time, it has been difficult for them to raise the capital needed to grow and expand. TodayI am pleased to report that Geegeelup Village Hostel will receive more than $7.5 million of federal capital funding, paving the way to double their residential bed capacity and provide secure dementia accommodation, palliative care and respite services for the regions expanding ageing population. I first visited Geegeelup Village Hostel and met manager, Dyan Dent, in 2013 when I was still a candidate. Helping the facility find the money for expansion has been a priority of mine ever since. I have visited Geegeelup many times and have always been impressed by the drive and vision of Dyan, her board and her dedicated team. I am thrilled to see that their efforts have been rewarded, and the benefits will flow to not only Bridgetown but the wider communities of Greenbushes and Boyup Brook, ensuring the viability of Geegeelup Village Hostel well into the future. I will finish by again thanking those who work tirelessly to care for O'Connor's ageing citizens. (Time expired) Mayo Electorate: Schools Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) (10:12): One of the things that I enjoy most about being a member of parliament is having the great privilege of visiting schools in my electorate and then meeting again with students when they come to Parliament House for their Canberra trip. I have 66 schools in my electorate. They are all different, and yet they are all doing their utmost to educate our next generation. For our children and young people, nothing quite brings our nation's story more alive than visiting our capital and spending time in our parliament. I am passionate about civic education. It is why I chose to nominate to be a member on the Parliamentary Education Office advisory committee. Visiting Parliament House makes the lessons of our civic history tangible and relevant to how we live our lives as Australians. It engages our young people in the political process; however, I am concerned that, of the students coming to Canberra in the next month, less than one per cent will be from low-SES schools, disadvantaged schoolsthat is, schools with an SES lower than 800. The My School website shows that, of the 248 schools scheduled to visit parliament between 22 May and 23 June this year, 80 per cent will be above average on the socioeconomic index and approximately 34 per cent will be significantly above the socioeconomic average. As I said before, less than one per cent, so 0.82 per cent, of those schools will be from disadvantaged areas. It also makes it incredibly challenging for schools from regional areas to come to Canberra. Calculations made, as the crow flies, do not show the true distance of schools that are trying to come here. We all know that there are very few direct roads to Canberra, and certainly very few direct flights. Of the 66 schools in Mayo, 18 will be coming here this year, and they receive just $60 per student in federal support. This is not enough if you are from a low-SES area or if you are from a remote region, like Kangaroo Island in my electorate. Those children have never had the opportunity to come to Canberra to visit our nation's capital. We need to find a fairer funding mechanism to help bring our disadvantaged young people to our nation's capital. We need this because democracy needs this, and it is important that we engage with young people. It encourages them to take part in our politics. As I heard a senator say to a group of young people last year, you can choose not to be interested in politics, but you cannot choose to be unaffected by it. Mallee Electorate: Broadband electorate of Mallee. The four things that are most important to the people of the Wimmera Mallee are that they can drive on a decent road; that they can make a mobile phone call and have access to adequate telecommunications; that, when they go to a doctor, there will be a doctor there and they can get treated; and that there are good education opportunities for their children-including preschool. The federal government has just contributed funding to preschools so that children get 15 hours a week. That includes funding for schools, and the 119 schools across the Wimmera Mallee will all get more under our current funding arrangements. It also includes access to university, which is a great challenge for people who, frankly, cannot access from home many of the courses they want to access, and they have to shift away. The National Broadband Network is an initiative of the previous Rudd government. It has been rolled out under our government, and there is a level of expectation within the community that is probably above what the technology will deliver. I see that the private sector is also going to be delivering greater things with 4G and 5G in our mobile phone network, which is really quite extraordinary. But there is one town that I want to touch on: the town of Kaniva. Kaniva is a fantastic and vibrant town on the main road between Adelaide and Melbourne. It was originally flagged to get fibre to the node, but then it was flagged to get a fixed wireless service, and now it is only flagged to get satellite service. The data loads are probably okay if you are trying to access a movie or two from home, but if you are trying a run a business, you do have to have at least fixed wireless to get an adequate level of data. My premise is that not having a fixed wireless service in Kaniva will limit investment in that town; why would a business set up in that town? I am saying that, for the sake of $400,000 or $500,000, the federal government should pay for a fixed wireless tower in Kaniva. The population is big enough, the economic activity is strong enough, and the future of the town is vibrant. But if we do not deliver this level of technology, I think that would be a very poor outcome. I am meeting with Mitch Fifield to put the case. I have written to NBN Co several times, and I have made it very clear to them that it will be cheaper to put a tower in Kaniva than it will be to take the time, and the stamps, to respond to my strong advocacy. I am not going to give up on this. Northern Territory young people are 'not willing to have a bit of an adventure' and move to Darwin. I think he was referring to the difficulty of getting staff to certain departments. Mr Fraser's comments were noted by the NT News, who, naturally, put these lines on the front page next to a picture of a crocodile. I want to send a message to the young people of southern Australia: not only are we young and free in the NT, but we are also young and fun. There is heaps of fun to be had in the north, and it is only when people get up there that they get to experience that for themselves. We are a young population. The 2016 census showed the Northern Territory has a median age of 34, which is four years younger than the national median of 38. But I know that Solomon is even younger. Darwin and Palmerston's median age is even younger than the NT",173,Constituency Statements

Unfortunately, there is a bit of a perception that we are a quiet country town, miles from anywhere else, but in fact we are actually many thousands of kilometres closer to where all the action is in South-East Asia and to our north. As anyone who has ever lived in Darwin will tell you, it is a great life. There is plenty to do. In fact the defence department has found that it is often difficult to get people to want to deploy to Darwin, but when they survey them, once they have been in Darwin, they actually want to stay, because they realise it is a great lifestyle for their families, and for young people it is heaps of fun. It is actually a more popular destination for those people who have experienced it, so I again welcome any member to get up to Darwin and have a look around. Not only is there a lot of fun to be had in the North, but we also have serious industrial and intellectual talent in the Northern Territory, something we are always talking about. Also, we are having Darwin business leaders come down to Parliament House to talk about our capacity. In September, we will be hosting a 'Taste of the Territory' event in Parliament House, to bring the Territory to Parliament House, so that members can see, smell, hear and taste our great Northern Territory. I look forward to welcoming all members to that event in due course. contribution and the open invitation to go to the Northern Territory. I am sure some members will take that up. Chisholm Electorate: Monash Medical Centre Ms BANKS (Chisholm) (10:21): I am so proud to rise today to talk about medical research and the Turnbull government's commitment to medical research. Recently, I went to Monash Medical Centre, together with the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt. We announced there a further cash injection boost which will support best-practice medical research and clinical trials taking place by Monash Partners, a world-class collaboration of members including Monash Health and Monash University, leading to better patient health outcomes. This injection of health funding is the first of its type in that it is a translational research centre. It is a coming together of university academics and industry and indeed patients. Ultimately, its key objective is better health outcomes for patients. Monash is evolving to become one of the southern hemisphere's leading medical precincts, and I am so proud that Monash is in the heart of Chisholm. For us to contribute funding is to make it better and to allow for more medical trials, and it means better health for patients and better outcomes for the local community. I am delighted to see that the Turnbull government is delivering on genuine support and research that will lead to better patient outcomes, not just for the people of Chisholm but for the people of Australia. To that point, I would like to also talk about the developing of a promising new treatment for peanut allergy in children. The Turnbull government has announced the first project, where $10 million in funding will go to the biomedical translation fund. The Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, and the minister for innovation and science, Arthur Sinodinos, announced this first investment commitment under the Biomedical Translation Fund, the BTF. The BTF combines $250 million of Commonwealth funding, to be at least matched by private capital, secured by independent licensed fund managers, to realise a substantial $500 million fund. The BTF is designed to change and improve the lives of Australians. This innovative solution",175,Constituency Statements

The Turnbull government funding commitment is about providing better health outcomes for Australians everywhere, so that Australians can live longer and feel better and be healthier. But for our funding, this research would not be progressing as well as it could be. Seniors Ms O'TOOLE (Herbert) (10:24): I rise in this place today to talk about the scourge of elder abuse and a wonderful Townsville flash mob-Seniors Creating Change-whose music and singing are an innovative way to educate the community about elder abuse. Seniors Creating Change is supported by the Townsville Community Legal Service. I also rise to deliver a message about the cuts that are affecting older persons which can create an environment where elder abuse can occur. Bill Mitchell, the principal solicitor of the Townsville Community Legal Service, also sits on a working group for a UN convention for the rights of older persons in Geneva. The principles of the United Nations around older persons focus on independence, participation, self-fulfilment, dignity and care. I had the great pleasure of witnessing Seniors Creating Change perform on 18 May 2017 when I opened the new office space for Everglow community aged care in Townsville. Everglow is a not-for-profit, community based organisation that aims to bring out the best in its clients so they can remain at home with their community. Seniors Creating Change has a very clear message for this government. In fact, they have written a song to the tune of Nancy Sinatra's These Boots are Made for Walking called The Seniors Funding Song. I will not be singing it because I cannot sing, but I will read the words. It goes like this: We were promised, if we paid our taxes, That we'd get the pension but confess You've been messin' where you shouldn't have been messin' Now seniors are getting' less and less. Our voice is made for singin' and that's just what we'll do, And one of these days our voices will be listened to by you! You keep cutting what you ought to be increasin', You keep takin' what you oughta not touch, You think sendin' Seniors to the poor house Is the only way to kowtow to the rich. Our voice is made for singin' and that's just what we'll do, And one of these days our voices will be listened to by you! You keep changin' what you shouldn't be changin', You keep thinkin' that we'll just sit back … Ha! You just found out that we ain't gonna take it, And what we know is right is gonna be heard. Our voice is made for singin' and that's just what we'll do, And one of these days our voices will be listened to by you! We need respect … for what we give! We need respect … for how we live! We need respect … because we vote! We need respect … We live in hope! Our seniors deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. They deserve to live in peace, be safe, have access to quality health care and certainly to live above the poverty line. In order to assist seniors to prevent elder abuse, the Townsville Community Legal Service has also developed a prevention plan with four key pillars: structural and social change; capacity building and early intervention; legal casework, social work advice and assistance; and harm reduction and rehabilitation. We must do better for our seniors. Diabetes monitoring devices, which have now been funded by the government and subsidised for type I diabetes for children under the age of 21. Two years ago I met Donna Meads-Barlowe. She had started up a program of advocating for these constant glucose monitoring devices because she had lost her 17-year-old daughter Danii. Just before she was due to do her Higher School Certificate, she was dead in bed from a hypoglycaemic episode. This absolutely tore me apart. ThenI found out there were parents with children with type I diabetes in my region-Brad with his daughter India, Julie with her daughter Brianna and Pieta with her son Caleb-and that they lived with this fear every day. They had to get up at night to check on the sugar levels of their children. A couple of them are firefighters. If they were out, they had no way of knowing that the grandparents could cope with the problems that their children were going through. This device has become life-changing. For two years I lobbied two different health ministers, saying, 'We need to put funds aside for this constant glucose monitoring device.' This is life-changing. This means that parents can go to bed after checking their children just after they have read them a story and know their children will be alive the next morning. This is a game changer for these people. Margaret, from my region, wrote to me and said: 'Anne, thank you so much for all the work that you've done. I'm really happy with that. But, you know what? You've got more to do. It's not good enough just to have these devices available for people up to the age of 21. The complications that people can endure after that age are pregnancy complications, health issues where bones won't mend as quickly, kidney failure-there are a whole stack of complications. Can you please, please work with the Prime Minister and the health minister and get funding for type 1 diabetic adults to also have access to this constant glucose monitoring device?' Well, I worked pretty hard for a long, long time in order to get the pensioner concession cards back. Just before the budget, I was thinking, 'Well, I'm not sure that worked.' Well, it did. Being a constant nuisance to the minister at the time worked. Let me tell you, Margaretand let me tell all the other type 1 diabetes sufferers in my region and the rest of Australia. I will also lobby and advocate to get this device subsidised for adults. If we can get these trials with the young people and we can ascertain a better result, a better quality of life for you, then hopefully we can extend this to every other type 1 diabetic in Australia and make all your",176,Constituency Statements

You are worth fighting for. time for members' constituency statements has now concluded. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2017-2018 Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2017-2018 Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2017-2018 Second Reading Cognate debate. Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms McBRIDE (Dobell) (10:31): A federal budget is more than just a financial statement. Any federal budget should be about national priorities, fairness and a better life for all Australians, whoever they are and wherever they live. As much as commentators might be captivated or captured by the budget's headline numbers, the most important focus of any budget must be how those big numbers and big changes affect people. I am proud of my community-of how we have faced the challenges and transformations of the last 30 years and how, as a community, we have decided it is our time to thrive. We are now well on the way to becoming the ninth-largest urban centre in Australia, with a population of nearly 400,000, including 21,000 local businesses, a university, major teaching hospitals and a growing number of new homes. Like every other part of Australia, the Central Coast looks to the national government for a fair deal, and where there are special problems, such as those associated with rapid population growth, we expect that the Commonwealth will help in addressing special areas of difficulty or disadvantage. For much of the Central Coast, rapid population growth, the proximity to Sydney and its overheated property market, lack of infrastructure, long commutes, aboveaverage rates of youth unemployment and relatively poor high school completion rates are enduring concerns. Those too ought to be a top priority for any government-state and federal, coalition or Labor. As my colleague the member for Macarthur remarked, this budget spruiks better times ahead whilst doing very little to assist their arrival. Yes, world economic conditions are expected to improve over the next year or two, and our domestic economy may benefit from that-let us hope so-but this budget does little to stimulate domestic growth. Outside of reannouncing old programs or promising yet more feasibility studies, there is little new in this budget to address the chronic problems experienced in our regions. The housing policy unveiled on budget night is no more than a collection of rats and mice nibbling at the edges of real community concerns. Total business investment levels are flatlining and, worryingly, there is already some fall-off in housing construction and retail sales. The government seems disinterested in our burgeoning levels of private debt, which are being pushed to record levels by a combination of low interest rates and overly generous, and budget-draining, federal taxation concessions. Treasury, though, expects that private debt levels will rise further, notwithstanding its own seemingly optimistic predictions that wages",178,Constituency Statements
180,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Buchholz,"In accordance with standing order 193, thegrowth will nearly double by 2020-21. Unemployment is expected to remain at around 5.5 per cent nationally, well into 2019. On the Treasury's own numbers, this government will have made no dent whatsoever in the unemployment rate. Underemployment now stands at an all-time high, and the proportion of workers who have been continuously unemployed for longer than a year remains stubbornly high. Youth unemployment nationally for 15to 24-year-olds is just over 13 per cent, higher than when Labor was last in office. In my community, where there are more limited job options for young people, youth unemployment remains at 16.6 per cent, several points above the national average. Those with healthy memories will recall that, for much of the last 30 years, various coalition figures have argued for greater labour market flexibility. Many of their fellow travellers have been even bolder and called for cuts to real wages, the argument being that people were pricing themselves out of work. We hear less of that now. Wages, including minimum wages, have been growing slowly, and the wages share of the economy continues to slide, while the profit share continues to climb. Both those trends have accelerated in the last two years. Neither has produced a jobs bonanza. What we now have is a harsher, less fair and less accountable labour market than the one I joined in the 1990s. It is a hard slog, and predatory training providers are not making it any easier. Maggie was 19 when she moved from the South Coast to the Central Coast. Maggie searched for months for work, sending hundreds of job applications. Separated from her friends and her old life, she was lonely, but, worse of all, her self-esteem suffered. One day, when browsing online for jobs, she was approached by Careers Australia. Almost unknowingly, she found herself signed up to a course. At the same time, she finally landed a job. She emailed the college to advise that she had no intention of undertaking the course and, when she did not get a response, she thought nothing more of it. That was until her first tax return came back with a notice of thousands of dollars of debt for a course she did not do. I have also heard from Brendan, a keen musician who is vision impaired. He was enticed to study with Evocca College, but the coursework was clearly not designed for people with disability, and after a short period he withdrew from the course. Years later, he was shocked to discover that the experience had left him with a debt of $18,615. Even those who completed their studies are adversely affected. The collapse of Evocca and, more recently, Careers Australia has left too many Central Coast students without a credible or complete qualification. Penalty rates are under threat; the workforce is more casualised; and many, many more of those studying have taken up part-time jobs just to stay afloat. At the same time, student fees are being increased, and the threshold for the repayment of HECS-HELP debts is to be dropped to $42,000. Many young people just entering the labour market will find themselves struggling to meet these big new retrospective taxes. It is worth noting that in many cases students now pay up to 85 per cent of course fees. We have moved a long, long way from the days of free tertiary education under the Whitlam government or even the early years of HECS, when I was studying and the student contribution was on average about 20 per cent of course costs. Nor have young people been the only ones caught in the crossfire. The decision to launch the umpteenth crackdown on welfare recipients will now be extended to older workers too. This too is based on the false premise that Australians are work shy. Over the last 30 years, we have seen massive increases in labour force participation amongst 55to 59and 60to 64-year-olds. The numbers involved have almost doubled in the 60to 64-year-old age group. Employment amongst young people has grown too because many of those studying are now also balancing work. We have close to the highest rate of unpaid overtime in the developed world. But what we have seen from this is a redoubling of the populist rhetoric of so-called mutual obligation. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, and despite the cost to the budget of close to $900 million over the last three years alone, the government persists with schemes such as Work for the Dole and now proposes new job activity measures that have a poor track record here and elsewhere. This government seems to have conveniently forgotten that its primary responsibility is to create the conditions in which employment will grow. There are presently around 750,000 Australians who are unemployed and a further million or so who want and need more hours. That compares with about 155,000 job vacancies. On those numbers alone, this government should stop blaming the victims and start worrying a bit more about how to create more employment opportunities here and now. That does not necessarily mean more job creation schemes, but it does mean paying closer attention to labour market weaknesses and identifying worthwhile infrastructure projects where population pressures are highest. My community needs a government that is committed to creating job opportunities, not a government that cares more about providing tax cuts for big business. Labor has always supported tax cuts for small businesses with a turnover of $2 million or less. Almost every business on the Central Coast, in my region, is in that category. But with this budget the government has confirmed it is committed to a company tax plan that will cost around $65 billion, which is money that could be invested in schools, hospitals and infrastructure and not just handed to overseas multinationals. Worse, the government is happy to allow a cut to penalty rates for around 15,000 Central Coast workers, who face a pay cut of up to $77 per week from 1 July. Cutting penalty rates when the Central Coast is already seeing a slowdown in wage growth is a reckless decision that will cut deep into family budgets and hurt our local economy. There is little evidence that cutting penalty rates will create the new jobs needed to offset the reduction in take-home pay and purchasing power lost to employees. In the electorate of Dobell, around 62 per cent of people of working age did not complete high school. Of those, the number who left school to take up a trade is significantly higher than in other areas. In Dobell, 58.6 per cent of people have vocational education qualifications, compared to the national average of 46.7 per cent. But this pathway, learning a trade and getting a job, is not well supported by conservative governments at a federal or state level. Overall, this government has cut over $2.5 billion from skills and training, and Australia has shed 130,000 apprentices. In the last 12 months alone, trade apprentice commencements have dropped to 10.5 per cent. The National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform, funded and delivered by the former Labor government, provides vital funding to states and territories to support TAFE, apprenticeships and skills programs. The agreement expires on 30 June this year, and the Turnbull government's own budget papers show that there is nothing to replace it. This will mean a cut of over $500 million in TAFE, apprenticeships and skills every year. In New South Wales this means a cut of $165 million a year. This will have a direct impact on local students. Wyong TAFE has already seen a number of courses cut, including the HSC, and staff placed under enormous strain. TAFE must be protected. Labor will do so by returning TAFE to its place as the backbone of our skills and training, guaranteeing two-thirds of that public funding for TAFE. This is in line with a similar commitment made by Labor in New South Wales. State and territory governments across the country would argue, and not always without just cause, that federal government cuts to health and education have forced harsh savings measures on their budgets. Under this government, New South Wales public hospitals are $630 million worse off. The New South Wales Liberal government is pursuing a publicprivate partnership for Wyong hospital, despite it being against the community's needs and wishes, and without their say in the future of our community hospital. The federal government has a direct stake in Wyong hospital. Last year, around $111 million in federal funding was provided to Central Coast Local Health District, yet, as we have seen this week, leaked official documents show the government's task force looked at a proposal to combine current Commonwealth funding into a single pool covering public and private hospitals. This would see funding provided by the Commonwealth for public hospitals decrease and funding for private hospitals increase. Would Wyong hospital be slated for privatisation if the federal government were committed to funding public hospitals properly? Our community wants Wyong hospital to stay in public hands. Around 25,000 people have signed petitions and more than 2,000 people have attended rallies, candlelight vigils and public forums. I have received dozens of phone calls, emails and letters. I heard from Bill, who worked with the Ambulance Service of New South Wales for 18 years. Bill wrote: This hospital in many ways was funded by the community through its efforts of fundraising over a long period of time, so it should stay in the hands of the government and not be privatised. People are not fools. Promises made in the beginning that there will be no or little change are rubbish. Private operators want huge profits to pay executives and shareholders. Let's not be fooled again. Budgets do many things. They set priorities and coordinate policies. It seems unbelievable that no-one seems to have taken stock of how this budget will impact millennials. If you are in search of a failure of policy coordination, you need look no further than this budget's treatment of anyone aged 15 to 35. They have the highest rates of unemployment and underemployment. They have amongst the highest effective marginal tax rates, on account of the proposed increase to the Medicare levy and lowering the threshold for the repayment of student loans. They have the most rapidly falling rates of home ownership of any age group, combined with stagnant wage rates, high levels of casualisation, a Newstart allowance that remains highly inadequate and the umpteenth crackdown on unemployment benefits. If you are a millennial, you would have to start wondering if this budget were something that the Centrelink robo-debt computer dreamt up while it was enjoying some downtime. There is a strong argument for reinstituting a budget statement for women. One for young people might not be a bad idea either. Saying a budget is fair does not make it so. Communities like mine deserve a fair budget. They deserve a budget that meets their needs. They deserve a budget that is in the interests of our community. I will stand for our community each and every day to fight these harsh cuts that affect our schools, our hospitals and young people's training. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (10:46): I am quite saddened to speak on this budget. I did not become a member of parliament to watch our country push the pause button for as long as it has. There is a lot of work to be done. I was actually quite hopeful that we would see some of that begin in this budget, but, unfortunately, there is no vision in it. We have seen a lot of slogans in past budgets from the Liberal government. I suspect the most accurate description now is 'storyboards'-plans of how the government is going to sell itself as fair, as caring about education and as caring about health. When you strip away the glossy words and look at the reality, the vision is simply not there. I ask myself: how long can this go on? I have said to this parliament before that when Prime Minister Turnbull first rolled Prime Minister AbbottI had a moment of hope that the pause that Australia had been in for so many years might be over and we might actually start dealing with the extraordinary challenges and opportunities that our country faces in the world as it is. It is extraordinary change. It is no less than an age change. There are massive opportunities and massive risks. We can already see that there will be great winners and great losers, and we cannot afford to let year after year go by without facing the reality of the modern world in this place. This budget does nothing for that. It has no vision. It does nothing to position Australia for the future. We must do that because every year we delay makes it harder for us to do that. I used to make a chemistry joke among people who understood chemistry, and not everybody does. I used to refer to Prime Minister Abbott when he was opposition leader as a 'political halogen'. Halogens are the group of elements second from the right end. They are highly volatile. There is fluorine, bromine and chlorine. Fluorine is so volatile it cannot even be stored. It reacts with glass. They are so volatile. They are one electron short of stability. For that reason they bond with the first thing that comes along. When they do bond they cannot be moved. When fluorine bonds with carbon it makes Teflon, for example. It is so strong and it bonds so fast that you use it in the hottest parts of jet engines. Once it bonds nothing breaks it apart. I used to watch Tony Abbott as opposition leader and then as Prime Minister cling to something-the idea that debt was bad, for example. Once he had bonded to that he was so fixed nothing would move him. I used to refer to him as a 'political halogen'. People got it, strangely enough. The minute I called the government of the day a halogen, people who understood chemistry got it, so accurate I think was that description. The government we have now is not a halogen. I think it has moved one step further to the right, and it is now in the noble gas territory. Noble gases are completely opposite to halogens. They are completely stable. Nothing changes them. Nothing touches them. They are called noble gases for a reason. They exist as one atom at a time; they are monoatomic. They are extraordinarily stable things: nothing touches them. When I look at this budget, that is what I see. I see a government that are untouched by what happens around them, that are untouched by the furnace that young people face-the combination of unaffordable housing, a declining job market, an extraordinarily rapidly changing world, climate change-and we have a government that do not seem to notice. They are the gas that you put in the light bulb, because when you heat something up to an extraordinary level they do not care, they do not give a stuff, they do not react-they just sit there like a noble gas. So we have gone from halogens a step to the right to noble gases. I will talk through some of the things that are happening in the world today in our communities in Australia that this government does not seem to notice. BeforeI do that, I am going to talk about one of the biggest ideological bombs that the Abbott-Turnbull government has had for a long time and which they now seem to have ignored. That is debt. The Abbott government fixed on debt as bad and spoke about it every day. Joe Hockey, the then Treasurer, came out prior to his first budget, made a few increases to expenditure and then projected what would happen if the entire parliament went to sleep until 2026 and said, 'Oh, terrible! The debt will be $680 billion.' I remember it because it was a quite precise figure: $680 billion, how terrible this would be. For week after week, year after year, we heard the cry of 'Debt, terrible! Debt, terrible!' from this halogen who had bonded to the notion that all debt is bad. Now we have a quiet increasing of the debt ceiling to $600 billion by this government. It did not take until 2026, which is what Tony Abbott said it would take for the Labor debt to reach $680 billion. We have quietly increased the debt ceiling now to $600 billion, because we are going to go over it very soon. Yet where is the response from this government to what everybody sees is a growing problem, everybody except the government, who are now silent on it? Certainly, they are approaching the dreadful peak that they thought Labor would reach if we all went to sleep for 10 years, but they are reaching it about five years earlier, and suddenly it is not a problem. The flame does not matter. The AAA credit rating? Not a problem; nothing touches us. They are the noble gas of economists: nothing touches them. It is extraordinary. It was the same with the bank levy. When Labor introduced a levy one-tenth the size, in response to a request from the Governor of the Reserve Bank that we do that to improve financial stability in the sector-it was going into a financial stability fund-the cries from the then opposition as they bonded to that notion that this was an increase in tax, the cries from the parliament that we were trousering the pensioners' money, that we were sticking our hands in the pockets of pensioners, the outcry from that was phenomenal. It was going to destroy the world, so firm were they in their conviction, the halogen Abbott government. Now it is 10 times the size, but it is not actually going to affect anything. It is just going to raise money for the government. It is not going to affect anything. They are untouched by the consequences of this. They are untouched by whether it will be passed on. Suddenly it is 10 times the size-just like the debt is so much greater-but certainly it is not a problem, because they have moved to the right. They have moved into the field of noble gases and nothing touches them. They are just sitting there-no problem at all. Jobs and growth: they latched onto that phrase like it would never be broken. Jobs and growth are two really good words, by the way, which we actually do need. We do need jobs and growth. There are good words, a good objective. Where are they now? Where are even those words now, let alone the policy? We have record underemployment. We have fewer hours worked per Australian than in longer than living memory. We have higher rates of casualisation and insecure work. We have record slow wages growth. But it is: 'Oh, no problem. It doesn't touch us. It doesn't touch the government. No problem. No need to address it. No need to do anything.' Show me anything in this budget which is actually about growing jobs. We know it is not, because the budget papers show that there are nearly 100,000 fewer jobs forecast for this year compared to the last budget. Not only have they stopped talking about jobs and growth; they have stopped doing anything about jobs and growth, and they are openly predicting fewer jobs in the coming years-and there is not a word. They are untouched by that. They are untouched by the consequences of that out in the community. There is a consequence. There are people who are having the Bunsen burner held to them. They are losing their jobs. They are working fewer hours. They are not getting pay rises. They are suffering cost-of-living pressures. And from the government there is nothing. There is nothing there. There is no narrative. There is not even a storyboard for jobs and growth anymore. There is nothing. It does not touch them. There is no jobs plan at all-none. On taxes: under the Abbott government, tax was bad. Labor was the party of taxes. Anytime Labor got in, Labor was going to raise taxes, but the Liberal government never did that. They never did that. Their firmness, their conviction, that they simply would never raise taxes because Liberal governments did not do that-that is gone. Suddenly we have $21 billion in new taxes-$21 billion in new taxes-from the government, which now have a taxto-GDP ratio at one of the highest levels we have seen in living memory. It is quite extraordinary. It is going up and up and up. Again, it does not touch them. This dreadful thing called tax, for them a year ago, would destroy the whole world if you increased it. Suddenly there is $21 billion more of it. Suddenly, there are no consequences for what they do. It seems that there are no consequences even if you increase the tax for the lowest paid through the Medicare levy. There seem to be no consequences for the government. They are completely untouched. On housing affordability: the median house price reached a billion dollars in my electorate last year-a billion dollars in my electorate. Let us be honest about this. Even if state governments and federal governments got together and managed to do things that took the heat out of the housing market-if they took the heat out of it and stopped it from rising as fast-how many decades would it be before a person on the median wage, around $70,000, could buy a house anywhere near where they work in Western Sydney? It would be decades. And where were the government on this? 'Nothing to do with us. Housing affordability? We've got a few little things, but essentially it's a state matter, nothing to do with us. It doesn't touch us.' There are people out there suffering rental stress at higher levels than we have seen in decades, and the government are untouched by it. They are not out of touch; they are untouched by any of the consequences of their actions or their lack of action. The cost of living is going up. The cost-of-living pressures are amazing, yet what do they do? They cut, because there are no consequences for the government. They do not see any consequences. It is as if what happens out there because of their actions does not actually matter. A family on $65,000 will pay $325 more in tax in two years time. Changes to family tax benefit A will mean that a family with an income of $80,000 will lose nearly $730 per child. Axing the energy supplement for pensioners and people with disability will cut $14 a fortnight, or $365 a year, from single pensioners. These are not small numbers if your earnings are $400 or $500 a week or less, which many are. These are not small numbers. Fourteen dollars a fortnight is not a small number if you are on Newstart. It is not a small number. There are consequences for these decisions. And there are consequences in education. In this year's budget we have seen another $600 million cut from TAFE. We have had $3.8 billion cut from universities and $22 billion cut from schools. We already have 130,000 fewer apprenticeships and traineeships than when the Liberals were elected. Again, are they touched by this? Do they show concern? Do they have anything to say about this? No. What they have is a storyboard-a storyboard that says, 'We're increasing the funding to schools.' Well, they can only call it an increase because they cut it first. If you cut $30 billion from schools and then you put some more back in, you can claim an increase and do a nice storyboard and hold it up. It is a storyboard. It is not the truth. It is a marketing exercise. That is all it is. All we are getting from this government is a marketing exercise. 'We care about health. We're going to unfreeze the rebate, which we put on four years ago,' but not for a few more years-they do not tell you that. 'We're funding infrastructure'actually, less than it was funded, but it makes a nice storyboard. There is no reality and no vision. It is a government that does not see the consequences of what it does. It does not see the consequences of its lack of action in these areas. It is really letting this country down. We face a time in the world when governments have to act and respond. Governments have to prepare our country to make the changes that it is going to need to make at the end of one age and the beginning of a new one. This government is ill equipped to do so, in terms of both its capacity and its caring. This country deserves much, much more. Ms STANLEY (Werriwa) (11:01): I rise to make my contribution to the debate on the appropriation bill (No. 1) 2017-2018 and related bills. This is my first budget as the member for Werriwa, and I rise today to speak to you about how the 2017 budget will impact my constituents in south-west Sydney. Overall, this is an unfair budget that delivers tax handouts for multinationals and millionaires while hurting every Australian family. People in Werriwa are often doing it tough. We have above-average unemployment, lower than average incomes and long commutes for workers to job centres across Sydney. This budget is so unjust because it places the greatest burden on those who can least afford it at a time when cost of living continues to rise unabated. This budget attacks those initiatives that are designed to reduce inequality and help those most in need: Medicare, social security, education, housing affordability, jobs and infrastructure. TodayI want to outline how this government's cuts in each of these areas will affect my constituents. This year's budget included an announcement that the Medicare freeze will remain in place across the health system. This means that Australians will have to wait more than 12 months for relief, and some will be left waiting more than two years for the freeze on specialist procedures and allied health services to be lifted. This includes GP and specialist consultations, which are frozen till 2018; specialist procedures, which are frozen till July 2019; and allied health services, including psychologists and social workers, which remain frozen until July 2019. For people in my electorate, already struggling to make ends meet, the continuing freeze on Medicare services means there are fewer bulk-billing doctors and specialists available. This puts further strain on household budgets and means people avoid visiting the doctor. It also means that many people who cannot afford doctors' fees are forced into overcrowded waiting rooms in emergency departments in our public hospitalsdepartments that have already been neglected for too long by the O'Farrell, Baird and Berejiklian New South Wales governments. It is not enough for the Liberals simply to place the provision of universal health care on the backburner so that big business can get a tax cut that will never trickle down to our workers. The 2017 budget also attacks those people receiving social security benefits. Not only does the budget maintain the pension age at 70, which is the oldest pension age in the developed world; the Liberals are also axing the energy supplement to new pensioners, including people with a disability, carers and Newstart recipients. That means, for single pensioners, a cut of $14.10 per fortnight or $365 per annum, and it leaves couples $21.20 a fortnight worse off, which equates to $550 a year. A cut of $14.10 per fortnight may seem modest to some, but it fails to take into consideration just how tough it is to make ends meet on a pension when rent and energy costs keep rising. Average rents in Werriwa have increased from $310 a week in 2011 to an average of $370 a week in 2016. That is a 16 per cent increase. The budget introduced new cuts to the family tax benefit, which will leave another 100,000 Australians worse off, while delivering tax cuts to companies and to big business. Perhaps the biggest impact from the budget in my electorate will be the cuts to needs based funding proposed by the Liberals. The importance of education in an electorate with a higher than average unemployment rate cannot be overstated. The extra funding provided by Labor has already delivered tangible benefits to the schools in my area. This includes Lurnea High School, my alma mater, where Labor's needs based funding has delivered a speech pathologist to ensure that students beginning year 7 are not left behind compared to their peers. However, this budget will unbelievably cut nearly $1½ million in funding from Lurnea High School in 2018-19. Who is going to explain to these kids who were benefiting so greatly from the speech pathologists, extra teachers and support that, as a country, we felt it was more important to cut the tax of giant multinationals than help the children of migrants receive a proper education that will provide untold benefits to that child, their family and our society broadly? The $22 billion cut from schools will hit classrooms across my electorate, with seven schools losing over $1 million in 2018-19. They include Ashcroft High School, Bonnyrigg Heights Public School, Casula High School, Cecil Hills High School, James Busby High School, Lurnea High School, Lurnea Public School and Miller Technology High School. They will all lose funding, from $914,000 up to $1,464,000, over that time. This list is just the start. Every single school in Werriwa loses out under these cuts to education, with a total amount of funding cuts in my electorate of over $28 million. In case you missed it, the Liberals are cutting $28,263,169 from Werriwa's public schools. Despite these staggering numbers, it is the human cost that really worries me the most. This means that targeted literacy and numeracy programs and one-on-one support for students in the upper years of high school will have to go. It also means that principals will be forced to choose between funding individual support for students with a disability or funding a speech pathologist to help children who are lacking. What do they cut? It will leave poor and disadvantaged communities, like some of the areas I represent, without resourcing to give children a decent, proper and equitable education. Whether they live in those poor and disadvantaged communities or in Wentworth Point, we need to give kids in Werriwa the same opportunity. The Liberals and the Greens, of course, were not satisfied with cutting funding to public schools, so they have ensured the Catholic parish schools will also face significant funding cuts. Last night I visited a forum of Catholic schools in my electorate. Over 200 teachers, parents and school leaders were there expressing their concerns about the changes to needs based funding for the Catholic systemic system. I thank Mark Turkington and his team for their warm welcome and insights into their school model. This is a system that has, by investing its funding as a sector, improved year 3 NAPLAN results for students exponentially over the last 10 years and improved results for HSC students over the same 10 years, from approximately 30 per cent of students receiving band 5 and 6 results to 75 per cent receiving band 5 and 6 results in 2016. The Catholic school system also supports Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students with scholarships and supports many students with special needs. Students and teachers are concerned that they are being penalised, despite delivering a value-for-money education system which continues to deliver exceptional results. The take-out message from the meeting was the need to retain the right to distribute funds based on need to the students who require them. This is a process that has been working exceptionally well, as exemplified by the continuing improvement and great results across both primary schools and high schools in the Catholic system, especially in Werriwa. Both the Sydney Catholic schools and the Catholic Diocese of Wollongong have warned that the cuts may force them to raise fees and, in some cases, close schools, further disadvantaging students throughout my electorate who are being educated by the Catholic system. I will continue to oppose the education cuts being proposed by this government, as they will never be tolerable to me or the people I represent. Another major issue for young people and families in my electorate is that of housing affordability, yet the package proposed by this budget is a complete sham. The only measures proposed by the Liberals in the budget will not impact the key drivers of housing affordability, which are generous tax concessions, such as negative gearing and capital gains tax exemptions, given to investors. Their proposal to allow salary sacrificing into super to allow first home buyers to save a deposit risks stimulating further demand, which will ultimately drive house prices higher. The first home saver packages also fail to take into account the possibility of an economic downturn, which could see a first home buyer lose a substantial amount of their savings. Whilst the more volatile investments in superannuation funds are less problematic when the investment is made for the long term, such as 20 or 30 years, first home buyers could be cheated out of their savings if there is a significant equities market downturn prior to the withdrawal of their additional savings. Labor is the only party with a plan to increase affordable housing and tackle the demand issues associated with these generous tax concessions. This budget does little to address the substantive issues that are creating the housing affordability crisis across Sydney, something that is particularly acute in my electorate, where many young families come to settle down. Ten years ago, workers on an average wage could save for a house deposit in six years; now it takes them over 10 years. For young people, the situation is made even worse when you consider that a recent university graduate earning about $50,000 a year will be looking at $1,250 more in Medicare and HELP repayments. Add on the rise in childcare costs, and that means that entering the housing market is getting further and further away. The issue of infrastructure is not unique to my electorate, but the site of the second airport at Badgerys Creek is. Whilst the airport promises to bring new jobs and investments to my area of Sydney, which has long been neglected, the airport will not benefit local residents if it is built without appropriate infrastructure in place from the day it opens. The airport is projected to service five million passengers a year at its opening, which will double within the first five years of operation. Without alternative mass-transport options, this is simply going to result in more cars on local roads. That is why the Labor Party has committed to building rail to the airport from day one. Without this, our roads will simply become more congested, making it harder for people to go about their daily lives. An airport without a rail line will also restrict the economic benefits of the airport, and businesses will be less likely to invest. I also note the emphasis that has been placed on the funding allocation in this budget to progress work on a rail link to Tullamarine, in Melbourne. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport identifies that corridor as one of the most heavily congested in Melbourne, stating that the congestion is 'reducing the amenity, liveability and commuter experience of the surrounding suburbs'. That is a good justification for a project well overdue. However, if things are that bad because the transport infrastructure was not in place early, why are we repeating the same mistakes for Western Sydney? Unfortunately, planning is not the government's strength, and now the cost of the short sighted way they have approached things is becoming apparent to the public. Just ask constituents living in Long Point, who continue to wait, without an internet connection, for national broadband that they were told would be connected in March this year. Nobody can tell them when it will now be connected. The people of Werriwa are also rightly concerned about jobs. We already have aboveaverage unemployment, and there are 100,000 fewer jobs in the Australian economy right now than at last year's budget. Weaker growth and fewer jobs mean more Australians cannot find enough work to make ends meet, let alone consider saving for a house deposit. People living and working in my electorate have seen no real wages growth but will pay $300 more in taxes. Saying that this budget is fair is cold comfort for them when they hear that people earning over $1 million will receive a tax cut of $16,400 a year. The pay cut does not include the amount that they will lose when penalty rates are cut from 1 July. Police, nurses, baristas and any other shiftworkers in my electorate stand to lose $77 in take-home pay. That means, of course, that there is less money to spend in businesses across the region and elsewhere, further hurting my electorate. Nothing in this budget delivers good jobs right now, when they are needed, and as this government has no plan for jobs I am not sure when they will come. Finally, the people of Werriwa deserve better than what has been delivered by this budget. They deserve proper funding of Medicare services; they deserve a pension that does not force them into poverty; they deserve a chance to buy a house for a price that will not cripple the family budget for ever, one that is in an area with decent infrastructure and public transport; and, most of all, they deserve a properly resourced schools system that gives their children the best start in life, the best chance for good jobs for their future and their children's future. infrastructure, but it does not seem to be walking the walk. Yesterday, the member for Grayndler, in an excellent speech on infrastructure, gave the minister credit for his chutzpah, his cheek, in talking about infrastructure. He said in here that Victoria is getting 8 cents in every dollar in the national infrastructure budget, when we have zero dollars this year, zero next year, zero the year after, zero the year after that, and zero the year after that, right through to 2021. The member for Grayndler argued that this budget means that the minister",179,Bills
181,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (11:15,"This government likes to talk the talk oncame in here to speak about Victorian infrastructure without there being any content to what he was saying, or without any real contribution. The member for Grayndler pointed out that this is a budget that cuts $1.6 billion from infrastructure investment this year. It is a budget in which it was said it would be $9.2 billion, but instead it is $7.6 billion. After that it falls off the cliff. It cuts out $7.4 billion in actual infrastructure investment over the forward estimates, down to $4.2 billion. That is why the peak body Infrastructure Partnerships Australia says, 'The budget confirms the cut to real budgeted capital funding to its lowest level in more than a decade, using a mix of underspend, re-profiling and narrative to cover this substantial drop in real capital expenditure.' The former Prime Minister the member for Warringah talked about wanting to be known as the infrastructure Prime Minister. He failed, instead being known as a failed Prime Minister. The current Prime Minister and his Treasurer are now holding the purse strings and are continuing the Abbott-Hockey tradition by cutting $1.6 billion off total infrastructure spending in this financial year alone, as the member for Grayndler said. From there it only gets worse. Over the next four years it plunges to $4.2 billion, in 2020-21. This will be the lowest level of infrastructure spending in more than 10 years. On 11 May I spoke in the House on the Turnbull government's apparent vendetta against Victoria when it comes to federal transport infrastructure spending. Since the budget, the unfair allocation of funds from the Sydney-centric government of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer has become even more apparent. It is no wonder the Victorian Treasurer, Mr Tim Pallas, said in an article entitled 'Turnbull Government's infrastructure spending short-changes Victorians'-which has been strongly supported by the Herald Sun, which is not necessarily a friend of the opposition: At Budget estimates this week, the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development confirmed that the federal Budget did not include a single extra dollar for Victorian infrastructure. This is despite Morrison claiming he'd made $1 billion available for regional rail and infrastructure projects in Victoria. This is a terrible situation, where we have 37 per cent of national migration coming to Victoria. Victoria has 25 per cent of the Australian population and Melbourne is moving towards being the biggest city. If you stand on a crowded tram or train in Melbourne you will think very fondly-not-of the current government. Perhaps it is why it looks very unlikely that the current government will win any support in Victoria. Commuters are being encouraged to come to Victoria. There are lots of economic prospects there, but we are being deliberately short-changed on infrastructure spending by the current federal government, and you can tell it as the population grows in Melbourne. There is a lot of expenditure by the state government on removing level crossings, improving the rail service and the tram service. As the city grows to more than four million people, of course we have got to have more public transport, but we cannot do it without federal government support. I applaud the Victorian government's decision to sell the Port of Melbourne, particularly since it was done with some sensitivity to overseas strategic interests. They managed to get $9.7 billion for the sale of the Port of Melbourne, and the Victorian government is ploughing that back, as it should, into public infrastructure, and in south-east Melbourne people can tell. It has been very intensive in some areas around some stations, but those level crossings have been removed. I can tell, you for instance, that the McKinnon shopping centre has been absolutely transformed. Not only has it given a great boost to local traders but traffic and trains move quicker and more efficiently-that is the whole idea of spending money on public infrastructure by the Victorian government. It is underlined by the transformation of that very important Frankston line from the city down to the far south-east. In the year leading up to 2016, the Bureau of Statistics estimate that a third of Australia's population growth has settled in Melbourne. Currently, Victoria's share of interstate international migration is 37 per cent. Given Victoria's population growth-some people would call it an explosion-it would be reasonable to expect that a fair share of Commonwealth infrastructure funding would match this clear need for transport options to keep pace with population. The Victorian government, as I said, has done its part: fifty dangerous level crossings are being removed; they are widening the Tullamarine, Monash, Westgate and Western Ring Road freeways; and building the Westgate tunnels linking the Port of Melbourne to the freeway system-a very important thing in my area. Most importantly, we want to extend the Melbourne Metro Rail project with $2.9 million of tunnels and five new stations. This is where the federal government should be coming in, and this is what we are not getting. This is Australia's biggest city. We are not talking about the future, like the Deputy Prime Minister talks about the Inland Rail boosting inland cities which may be a worthy project in itself; we are talking about the here and now, with Australia's biggest city being completely underdone by this government. They will pay the political price for it, as they should. According to its own budget papers in the Infrastructure Investment Program and the amount allocated under 'Victorian Infrastructure Investments', the amount of federal funds allocated to Victoria in 2016-17 is, as the member for Grayndler said, zero; for 2018-19, zero; and for 2019-20, zero. And, in news that will probably not surprise anyone: for 2021, it is, again, zero. The Turnbull government, in its budget, raises infrastructure funding projects that have Commonwealth funding attached. However, these are for projects that have already been funded. There is no new funding at all for Victoria, with the Commonwealth rivers of gold all running to Sydney it would seem. New South Wales is served up a healthy 39 per cent slice of the infrastructure spending pie. It is not our fault in Victoria that successive New South Wales governments-including, I might say, the hopeless Carr Labor government-failed to spend money on infrastructure in New South Wales. We have been spending it through the years as population has increased, and Victorians should not be penalised for the incompetence of the New South Wales state governments, and now their allies in the Liberal federal government are trying to make up for the incompetence of their state colleagues. To its credit and despite the Turnbull government all but starving the state of funding, Victoria has continued with its ambitious infrastructure agenda, planning for our population to reach eight million by 2040. Public Transport Victoria's annual report shows that, over the financial year ending 2016, passengers on Melbourne's V/Line grew by an amazing 19.4 per cent in one year, while trams saw a passenger increase of 12 per cent. I know the most popular tram route in Australia runs through my electorate: route 96, which is like a ring-road, or ring-tram-track, which goes from one side of Melbourne Ports right across the member for Melbourne's electorate, linking people through the CBD right across the city. Public Transport Victoria projects an increase in public transport users by 2050 of 80 per cent. These levels of passenger growth are simply unsustainable without huge investment in the state's transport infrastructure, something that the current federal government refuses to address. The Prime Minister, under pressure on this issue, told David Koch on Sunrise that he 'loved Melbourne' and he 'loved trams'. However, these are hollow words when he refuses to put his money where his mouth is and fund either. Days before the federal budget, we even saw the Victorian opposition leader, Matthew Guy, forced into the admission that his federal Liberal counterpart was leaving Victorians stranded on transport infrastructure spending. Earlier this month, I held a press conference with Labor shadow transport minister Anthony Albanese at the proposed Domain interchange of trams and trains-with a large shopping centre South Korean-style, three storeys down, underneath it-to highlight the unfairness of Mr Turnbull's lack of support for our great state. The member for Grayndler put it quite simply: the Prime Minister does visit Melbourne. When he visits, he takes selfies on trains and on trams. What Victorians want is for him to fund trains and trams, not to take selfies on them. The member for Grayndler is a New South Welshman, and he is taking a more objective view of how our national infrastructure ought to be spent. This was the contract underlying Federation: that all states would be treated fairly and be given a fair amount of the national tax-take for infrastructure. This is persistently disadvantaging Victorians, who make up 25 per cent of the population and the fastest growing state. Victoria is the state that is standing up and taking responsibility for 37 per cent of national and interstate immigration. We just want, as a former Prime Minister used to say, a fair suck of the sauce bottle. It is not fair that Victorians are being so short-changedAn honourable member interjectinghumanise him by making him use sayings that appealed to the average Australian. Anyhow, the federal government still owes Victorians $1.45 billion under the coalition's own asset recycling scheme after the lease of the Port of Melbourne. Because the Victorian government managed to get more money from the lease-$9.7 billion rather than the projected $6.5 billion-it was penalised by the current federal government and did not get the asset recycling money that is mandated to come to state governments that sell infrastructure and redeploy it for good infrastructure uses. There is an incentive offered by the federal government that was not fulfilled for that extra portion of the sale price that Victoria got. Infrastructure spending futureproofs our nation on population growth and provides employment for thousands. I remember when the Prime Minister used to say 'jobs and growth' all the time. Now it is abundantly clear that he has abandoned that strategy. Sydney is a wonderful city, and New South Wales is a great state. It is silly to have interstate rivalries that go back to Federation. But people in Victoria will naturally feel this rivalry if we are getting eight per cent of expenditure when we have 25 per cent of Australia's population and 37 per cent of national migration coming to Melbourne. We are a very cosmopolitan city. People are willing to stand up; it does not concern them at all. But we want a fair slice of the national tax pie. This current federal government is undermining the contract implicit in Federation. Australia is the nation of the fair go. Victorians just want a fair go on infrastructure.

182,Mr Danby,"Well, he was imitating Bazza McKenzie! Some people were trying toacknowledge my Senate colleagues-Senator Xenophon, Senator Griff and Senator Kakoschke-Moore-for the collective effort that the Nick Xenophon Team has made to negotiate and lobby particularly hard for specific measures to be included in this budget. And to outline those specific measures that the Nick Xenophon Team negotiated for, I am pleased that we have secured $100 million for the advanced manufacturing growth fund targeting South Australia and Victoria to assist with the industrial transition and transformation of our two great manufacturing states in this nation. While Australia has shifted towards a more service centred economy, the Nick Xenophon Team has not given up on the critical role that manufacturing, particularly advanced manufacturing, plays in the heart of our Australian economy. This fund will provide $47.5 million over two years for grants to South Australian and Victorian manufacturers to undertake capital upgrades that make their businesses more competitive. It will provide $24 million over two years for advanced manufacturing research projects that stimulate the development of new products and manufacturing methods. It will provide $13.5 million over five years to reduce tariffs on imported vehicles and components to boost design and engineering activities for the development of global platform vehicles, and will provide $10 million over two years for two advanced manufacturing innovation labs that will test new manufacturing products and services and will build the capabilities of manufacturing businesses. Finally, this funding will provide $5 million over two years for student research scholarships to ensure that Australia maintains a pool of automotive design engineers for its automotive components businesses to draw upon. These measures will reinvigorate the innovation and design prowess for which Australian manufacturing been known in the past. It will help to support and create real 21st-century jobs in Australian advanced manufacturing. Sadly, the end of Australia's car manufacturing will happen this October, with the last Holdens rolling off the production line. With that closure, the work at the advanced manufacturing growth fund will become even more critical. However, the Nick Xenophon Team recognises that this is just the beginning of a journey that Australian manufacturing must take, and we will continue to advocate for the government to adopt an integrated and collaborative model for the manufacturing sector, which creates active partnerships between industry and engineering universities, their research teams and of course Australian manufacturing businesses. I am proud that our team was able to advocate for the reinstatement of the apprenticeship mentoring program. We secured $60 million of funding, which will provide 45,000 apprentices with valuable mentoring to support them to complete their apprenticeships-their qualifications. Past mentoring programs have improved completion rates from around 50 per cent to an impressive 91 per cent. My Senate colleague, Senator Griff, incisively highlighted that axing the program in 2014 was a 'dumb choice'. As Senator Xenophon further commented, it was 'the worse form of false economy', because we saw plummeting apprenticeship rates. The decline of group training for apprentices, coupled with less training done by trades schools, the person-to-person contact for apprentices meant that it was very hard for them to see the light at the end of the tunnel of their apprenticeship. This mentoring will provide great support. It will help businesses. It is a win for businesses and a win for young people. A budget measure that is very close to my heart-and one that will greatly support regional South Australia and my electorate of Mayo and one that I personally fought very hard for-is the reinstatement of the supplementary road funding for South Australia. Again, this was cut in the 2014 budget. South Australia has 11.8 per cent of the local road network nationally. We have 7.1 per cent of Australia's population but we were only receiving around five per cent of the nation's road funding. The resumption of the supplementary road funding for South Australia is a big win. It is worth $40 million to my state over the next two years. This will help bring back some equity to our local roads. In my electorate I have the following councils: Adelaide Hills, Mount Barker, Victor Harbor, Yankalilla, Kangaroo Island, the Barossa, Alexandrina, and the city of Onkaparinga. They will use this money on their 5,500 kilometres of local road networks that are in my electorate. The Nick Xenophon Team has also argued and fought very hard for the solar thermal plant in Port Augusta, and through our negotiations with government we have secured a $100 million equity loan to help get this project off the ground. The project is a win-win-for the environment, for advanced manufacturing and for jobs in regional Australia. The current projections are that it will create just over 1,000 jobs in the construction phase and a further 3,000 jobs through the multiplier effect. It is a sign of the possibilities for both South Australia and Australia and a sign that the legacy of the coal-fired power plant in Port Augusta can be transformed through solar technology. It will power, I believe, over 100,000 homes, so this is incredibly exciting. Another exciting announcement in the budget is for proton therapy. This was something that we advocated very strongly for. With our support, South Australia will receive the first proton therapy unit in the Southern Hemisphere. This will be at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, known as SAHMRI. As I said, it will be the only unit in the Southern Hemisphere, and it will assist people who are undergoing advanced cancer treatments with highly targeted, high-energy proton beams. Currently, people needing this treatment are flying to other parts of the world. This will assist greatly not just the people who will be working there, in the extra jobs from it, but children who are undergoing treatment for rare cancers, cancers in the spine and cancers close to the heart and lungs. This will save lives and is a tremendous part of the budget. We are very, very excited about the $68 million that was announced. I would like to talk about something that my colleague Senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore has been advocating for tirelessly, and that is to assist Defence Force members who are victims of sexual and physical abuse. I commend the energy of Skye Kakoschke-Moore in advocating for victims of sexual and physical abuse in the Australian Defence Force. Her efforts have secured $30 million for the Defence Force Ombudsman to continue the fund that was previously set up by the Defence Abuse Response Task Force. The extension of this fund will allow victims of abuse who missed the arbitrary cut-off dates to apply for compensation. Money alone will not make up for the horrendous acts of sexual and physical violence against them that these Defence Force victims experienced, but it will go partially to redress and provide formal recognition of the wrongs that were perpetrated. Another great win for South Australia and for Australia has been supporting nuclear test veterans. Senator Xenophon has long been a campaigner for nuclear test veterans, those who were at Maralinga, Montebello or Emu Field-those who were in the presence of nuclear tests-as well as those veterans who served in post-World War II occupation forces in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The culmination of Senator Xenophon's tireless advocacy for these veterans has meant that these veterans will now receive the gold card, finally reversing the burden of proof that they have struggled against for years in paying their medical bills. This measure is worth $139 million, and it is long overdue. I wish to personally thank the government and Senator Xenophon for working on this and particularly my colleague for not giving up the fight. These veterans were exposed to nuclear radiation, and at last they now have some meaningful support with the gold card. Community radio is very close to my heart because when I was in my twenties I was actually on community radio for years, and it provided me with a great deal of confidence. I do not think I would be in this place if it were not for community radio. We had a great win for community radio in the budget. Funding is now going to support those 600 Australians who are employed by community radio and also the 20,000 volunteers who are connected with community radio. If you are in an electorate in regional Australia, you know that community radio is the lifeblood of your community. This is an excellent training ground for young talent. The $6.1 million that has been allocated to community radio over the next two years is an excellent spend by government. With respect to the legislation, obviously we are still going through it line by line, detail by detail, as the measures come through the parliament. Of course there are a number of things that are not in plain view. There are a number of cuts, so we need to look very carefully at it. We are very supportive, however, of the government's bank levy. We support this additional contribution from Australia's most profitable sector and feel that the bank levy will go a long way towards assisting budget repair, but it should be applied not only to the major banks but also to international banks. Why should major foreign banks be exempt from this levy? I have heard the argument that foreign banks provide more competition to the Australian market; however, the super profits currently enjoyed by Australia's financial and banking sector are so enticing for foreign competitors that they will not be deterred by a level playing field. This levy should also apply to major foreign banks that operate in Australia. That is only fair. As someone who, alongside my Senate colleagues, has spoken to so many victims of financial malpractice, I believe that there needs to be a compensation scheme from the funding that could come from these foreign banks. It will be around $800 million over the forward estimates, which could provide a last-resort compensation scheme for victims of such financial mismanagement and fraud. Lastly, I would like to talk about infrastructure. The federal government has touted their budget as a nation-building budget and as an infrastructure budget. I would like to know why the federal government does not consider South Australia to be part of its infrastructure nation. Why were we forgotten? Of the $70+ billion headline spend over the next 10 years, South Australia will receive just $3.1 billion. This is less than our population's share, and none of it is new funding for new projects. South Australians appear to be the forgotten people. How ironic that the federal coalition government has forgotten us! We are getting neither the infrastructure share nor the rail that we deserve. Australian steelmakers are an obvious place to start. The new Commonwealth Procurement Rules negotiated with government by the Nick Xenophon Team came into effect on 1 March. The new rules will apply to government tenders over $4 million and will go some way towards ensuring that the local social, environmental and economic benefits from Commonwealth procurement will assist South Australia; however, much more needs to be done. This government is failing older Australians. Despite the massive increase in demand due to the rapidly ageing population, there appear to be no new policies to meet the rising need for aged care residential places. Worse still, the Aged Care Financing Authority has concluded that we are providing only enough funding for half the required number of places. There are no new measures for in-home care and support. These are issues that I, as part of the Nick Xenophon Team, will be strongly advocating for in the months ahead. I would also like to say I am deeply concerned about the cuts that are going to happen to volunteer management: 10 out of the 12 volunteer management groups in South Australia will cease to operate. This is just over $500,000 worth of funding. This provides $5 million into our economy just in South Australia, $290 million nationally, and is being cut. It beggars belief. In conclusion, if I were a student, I would give this budget a B minus. On its report card I would say it has made great strides since the 2014 budget, but that there is still significant room for improvement. We will work together with government, as we always have, from the sensible centre. We will work tirelessly and constructively with government, and with all of the other parties that are in this great place, for the benefit of our country. We never oppose things for political gain, we base ourselves on evidence, not ideology, and we look forward to working with government for the betterment of all Australians. Question agreed to.

During 18 months of online contact and phone calls, Carly fell in love with Brandon, but there was no Brandon Kane, just a 50-year-old predator and paedophileGarry Francis Newman, who was pretending to be Brandon Kane. He eventually convinced Carly to meet him on a secluded beach at Port Elliot in South Australia. He assaulted and suffocated Carly and then threw her in the water to drown. When detectives found Newman he was online as Brandon Kane once again, talking with a 14-year-old girl in my state of Western Australia. Newman was sentenced to life in prison. In her sentencing remarks, the judge said: Garry Newman deserves a life behind bars for his grossly perverted plan to deceive, seduce and murder Carly… It was a terribly cruel thing you did to this beautiful, impressionable 15yr old child.

The internet is the most fabulous tool for most of the 3.4 billion people who use it, but we need to know how to protect our children from Garry Newman and other online predators and paedophiles. I was concerned to read that there was a 47-year-old man charged with child sex offences online, involving 28 children. He was grooming them online. He was even offering children money. There were kids all over the country, including in my state of Western Australia. The AFP in that article said that online child exploitation increased by 54 per cent in the last 12 months. The online predators are the ones who wait and watch Facebook pages and other social media sites for potential victims. They are the ones who groom and manipulate children online. They do everything they can to gain that child's trust. They offer, as we heard, money, free iTunes cards, a free phone-one that mum and dad do not know about-and other gifts to create a sense of obligation in the child. They ask them how old they are and where they live. They make comments like, 'You are cute,' 'You are sexy,' 'I care about you more than anyone else in your life,' and, 'I love your pictures.' The offender will ask the child for more photos and may then even send them provocative or sexually graphic photos telling the child to hide them away, perhaps in a decoy app like the Secret Calculator. They ask whether the child or children can stay away from home overnight and whether they can keep a secret. At some point they will ask to meet in real life. Like Garry Newman, they will create a fake online profile with fake photos. They will appear to have similar interests to the child. They may seek to use a fake ID to join groups like Kik Messenger. I suspect others will create fake identities to use Facebook's Lifestage, a video-sharing social media app aimed at young people under 21. I understand that to start an account you need only your phone number, and every video children post is fully public. There are other apps like a Spotafriend using GPS locators which allow young people to connect with strangers. This is Tinder for teens-Tinder, of course, being the dating app. Yellow is another app that uses GPS locators to connect teens with strangers. It is used by more than five million teens globally-a prime hunting ground, I would think, for online paedophiles. These continuous and rapidly evolving technologies and the anonymity that the internet provides have resulted in unprecedented opportunities for the harm and sexual exploitation of children. In 2015 the government passed the Enhancing Online Safety for Children Act, creating the Office of the Children's eSafety Commissioner, a one-stop shop for online safety, for everything from reporting serious cyberbullying-and there are resources for educators and parents as well-to the reporting of illegal content, how to protect your privacy online and how to have image based abuse removed. There are a range of resources available on the site, and I encourage every person to use these resources. In addition to this, the AFP's ThinkUKnow program helps educate parents, teachers and kids about issues such as online grooming and cyberbullying and how to keep themselves safe when they are using the internet and how to use the AFP's 'report abuse' button. Members know that I have given hundreds of cybersafety presentations to schoolchildren, and I am no longer surprised at what the children are doing online. One of the reasons I am so supportive of this bill is that I actually know first hand that children are going to meet people in person whom they have only previously met online. How do I know? It is because I ask them and they say so. In one class alone, seven 11-year-olds had the courage to admit to me that they are doing exactly that. My office received a phone call from a mother of an 11-yearold girl who, after listening to my presentation, went home to say, 'I realise I am being groomed online for sex.' That is at the age of 11. SoI am deeply concerned at the sheer number of primaryand early-high-school-age young people who admit to meeting people in person whom they have previously only met online. In my most recent classes for year 8, there were six and eight in each class who had the courage to admit that. Our kids love the internet. They love their devices. It is their world, and they are brilliant with technology. Probably that is why I am out there saying to them, 'This is how to help keep yourself safe.' This is their world. They love it. They are great with the technology. They need to know who to go to when they need help and when they need to know about the online risks and challenges. With research showing that 92 per cent of teens are online daily, including 24 per cent who say they are online almost constantly-and the kids tell me that they have their devices 24/7-protection and deterrence are essential. I know why this legislation is so important. I hear directly from young people about what is going on online. This bill is the next step the government is taking to protect Australian children from those who would seek to do them harm online. It will not be the last step. This bill's purpose is the prevention of harm and exploitation of children. It will improve the protection of children by creating a new offence that complements existing online child sex offences for preparatory conduct. This will include grooming or procuring a child for sexual activity. The bill also extends the criminalisation of the use of the internet and social media as a forum for predators to groom or procure children to engage in sexual activity to a broader range of conduct. This offence builds on the proactive policing of online sexual offences, allowing law enforcement to take action against online predators sooner and with greater consequences. That is very good. The bill introduces a tough new offence-and I am very happy about that-that criminalises acts done using a carriage service, any of the devices, 'to prepare or plan to cause harm, procure, or engage in sexual activity' with a child-that is, someone under the age of 16. It will allow intervention by law enforcement agencies prior to sexual activity or other harm. People found guilty of this, and I hope those who are doing it are found guilty, may now be punished by up to 10 years imprisonment. Importantly, this will also include those who misrepresent their age, like Garry Francis Newman and all the rest out there doing this. I know from discussing this issue with local and federal police that they are particularly concerned about children's safety online. This year, as I said, represents the 10th anniversary of Carly's death, and this legislation is Carly and her mother's amazing legacy. Her mother, Sonya, has put an enormous amount of energy into the Carly Ryan Foundation, and I pay tribute to her for that. I want to mention Carly's quilt, that we saw here in the parliament recently. I was with Minister Keenan at that launch. To see the beautiful hearts on that quilt that were made out of Carly's clothing was profoundly moving. It showed great courage by Sonya to tell her story at that gathering. Given the rapid changes in technology, and the way that the predators are using it, this will not be the last piece of legislation to come before this House. This is very important legislation to help with the online protection of our children. I congratulate the minister and the government for bringing this into the parliament. I want to encourage parents-I do parent presentations as well-to be involved before the first device is given to their child. I am disturbed at the age that young people have access to the internet. I met a little girl of three who was allowed to download things from the internet. The age is getting younger and younger. Legislation like this is even more important than ever given the age of these young people. Young people often do not want to admit to what is happening online. I want to refer to the fact that frequently we found that young people often do not talk about the sexual abuse they suffer at the time it is happening. Often it is not until later in life, when a particular incident then provokes that memory, that they deal with the problem. What is worrying me, particularly in this space, is: how many of these young people who are going to meet people in person that they have only met online, are the victims of a form of sexual abuse that we do not know about because they are not talking about it? How many of them later in life will have to deal with this-it will be a problem in their mental and physical well-being? I see that as a latent problem out of the numbers of young people that I know are going to meet people online that they have only met first online. When I talk to parents, one of the things I ask them is: right at this moment where are your children, what are they doing and who are they with? Most parents can answer that question as to where their children are at that moment. But I then make the comment that when they are online we need to be able to answer those three question. We are not going to be with our children all of the time, and all of the time they are online, and that is why the young people need to know how to be as safe as they possibly can be when they are online. I want to commend, in my last moments, the eSafety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, and her team for the work they are doing to help protect our children online. I also encourage every parent and everyone in this House, if they have not had a look already, to look at the resources that are available online. The school in my electorate that got in touch with the Children's eSafety Commissioner was able to have some very damaging content removed quite quickly. Quite often, one of the most important things for the individual to lessen the harm, the hurt and the damage is to get the content removed quickly. That is where the Office of the Children's eSafety Commissioner comes along. I am very proud that our government is being so proactive in this space, and I commend this bill to the House. Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) (12:00): I commend the government for working with the Nick Xenophon Team to bring the Criminal Code Amendment (Protecting Minors Online) Bill before the parliament. In my electorate there is a picturesque seaside town called Port Elliot, which is located on the perfectly curved shore of Horseshoe Bay. However, it is also the place where a great tragedy occurred-the murder of a beautiful young girl who had just turned 15. Her name was Carly Ryan. She was a young girl in my electorate in the Adelaide Hills. Ten years ago Carly was lured to her death on the beach by a 47-year-old paedophile, who had lied about his age online. His name is Garry Newman. He was described by the judge in sentencing as 'an overweight, balding, middle-aged paedophile with sex and murder on his mind'. He murdered Carly because she refused his advances. He suffocated her by pushing her face in the white sand of Horseshoe Bay, before throwing her in the sea. I am here today to speak in support of this legislation, which we in the Nick Xenophon Team call Carly's law because of that meeting on the beach and because, at the time, none of Newman's behaviour online was illegal. No law was broken before he murdered her. Nothing could have been done by police to intervene if they had been alerted. So this legislation is designed to close that loophole. Newman began grooming Carly when she was only 14 years of age, chatting to her online by pretending to be 20-year-old Brandon-a sensitive young man who played the guitar. I spoke to Carly's mum, Sonya, my constituent, who has the Carly Ryan Foundation based in my electorate. I asked her if I could have her permission to tell her daughter's story. Sonya told me she was not an absentee parent when it came to monitoring Carly's internet use. Sonya followed the guidelines. Carly could only use the computer in the main living area when her mother was supervising. Keep in mind that this was a decade ago, when, arguably, there were fewer social media sites and apps children could use to talk to strangers online. Sonya watched her daughter fall in love with fictitious Brandon, communicating with him over the internet, by telephone and by email. Carly invited Brandon to her 15th birthday party. Brandon could not make it obviously-because he did not exist-but his adoptive father, Shane, went in his stead. When Newman, pretending to be Shane, turned up on the doorstep and began trying to insinuate himself into the household, Sonya was deeply suspicious and warned her daughter, but it was too late. Newman continued to use his internet alter ego to manipulate Carly, convincing her to go to Horseshoe Bay to meet Brandon in person. When detectives tracked Newman down in his Victorian home 11 days after Carly's murder, they found him logged online as Brandon Kane. He had been chatting to a 14-yearold girl in Western Australia. Brandon was one of 200 fake online identities Newman had created for the purposes of meeting young girls. This bill will make it an offence to prepare or plan to cause harm and to procure or engage in sexual activity with a person under 16 years of age. This includes a person lying about their age to a child under 16 as part of that plan to harm a child. Earlier versions of this bill were introduced by my colleagues Senator Xenophon and Senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore. The government's version of Carly's law, which has been achieved in consultation with the Nick Xenophon Team, aims to avoid any unintended consequences raised during the Senate inquiry process into those early versions. This version addresses those unintended consequences, so it achieves its aim, and that is to criminalise the preparative nature of online behaviour intended to cause harm to children. Legal academic Associate Professor Gregor Urbas from the University of Canberra referred to these changes in his submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The Senate committee is currently examining this bill and is due to release its report on 13 June. Along with the Law Council of Australia and the Australian Lawyers Alliance, Professor Urbas noted that there are existing laws that criminalise online behaviour, including preparatory conduct. However, the professor advises that these offences are relatively recent and their precise scope is not always clear, leaving gaps. For example, prosecutors cannot prove grooming for a sexual purpose. This legislation aims to close these gaps. This bill complements existing online offences, extending criminalisation of the use of the internet and social media to a broader range of conduct. Carly's law takes a precautionary approach by criminalising the grooming of children at a much earlier stage, capturing those predators who misrepresent their age to set up a meeting. I cannot think of any legitimate reason for an adult to lie to someone under age, pretending to be a minor in order to build a relationship and build trust that leads to a physical meeting. Early intervention is what Sonia Ryan is seeking, and it is what the 90,000 people who signed her change.org online petition are also seeking. The advice Sonia received from detectives in South Australia is that if Carly's Law had been around a decade ago police would have been able to charge Newman for his predatory online grooming behaviour. It gives power to the police to detain an individual before a child has to go through something horrific. Sonia sees Carly's law as a meaningful legacy for her beautiful, kind, loving daughter. Choice was taken away from Carly and from Sonia, but we can do something to help prevent this tragedy happening again. In a digitally connected world, Carly's law aims to give children in Australia opportunities to live a life free from predatory behaviour. including many that target children as young as or under the age of two. More than 200 new pornographic images of minors are circulated every single day. Last year the Australian Federal Police reported that the number of referrals it had received for child exploitation material had more than doubled from 4½ thousand in 2014 to 11,000 by the end of 2015. This is becoming an epidemic. The authorities who hunt these online predators say that paedophiles can gain access to children faster and more easily, making volumes of social networking avenues available to them. These avenues include Facebook, Facebook Messenger, YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram, World of Warcraft, Moshi Monsters, Minecraft, Pokemon Go-and that is besides basic Skype and email. One of the latest ones parents need to know about is called Yellow, which I have also heard described as a bit like Tinder for teens. Yellow is a location-based social networking app that helps young people between the ages of 13 and 17 connect with each other in the locality where they live. Yellow combines Snapchat, Instagram and GPS technology. Young people between the ages of 13 and 17 become friends with one another in their locality by swiping right on their profile in a design similar to Tinder. But, according to the Office of the Children's eSafety Commissioner, the safeguards to verify your age on Yellow are not robust enough for their liking. There is nothing to stop adults pretending to be under 18 years of age, which makes this an ideal tool for predators. This app really is a predators' paradise. Social networking apps like Yellow are one of the reasons the length of time it takes paedophiles to groom children and to make contact with them is getting even shorter. Back when Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton was Deputy Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police he said the length of grooming time between first contact online and physical meeting could be as little as two weeks. Technology is evolving so rapidly that it is hard for parents, let alone law enforcement agencies and the legal system, to catch up, so when we recognise a problem we need to act quickly. Our young are often more comfortable with these new forms of communication than are those charged with their protection, leaving our children open to exportation. The Office of the Children's eSafety Commissioner reports that teenagers spend 33 hours a week online outside of school. Parents might be able to control who comes in and out of their front doors but they cannot always control who comes in and out of their homes via the internet, even with supervision and sophisticated computer filters. A briefing hosted by the eSafety Commissioner in Canberra this week pointed out that the average household has about 15 internet connected devices available at any one time. With the vast majority of teenagers today having smartphones, it is even more challenging for parents to monitor who their children are communicating with. Carly's law, as I like to call this, is an early intervention tool for when parents, friends, teachers and law enforcement agencies become suspicious of a potential online predator trying to sneak in through the back door, but it is just one tool. I cannot finish this speech without commending Sonya for her work to protect children through the Carly Ryan Foundation. Since her daughter's death she has tried to bring some good out of this evil by dedicating herself to raising awareness of young people to online dangers. She set up the Carly Ryan Foundation in my electorate in 2010. It is an organisation run entirely by volunteers. I was recently at a school where Sonya gave an online safety presentation to a group of teenagers. You could hear a pin drop when she told her family's story. Something powerful happens when a human opens up about their inner pain. Sonya is not some nagging adult who does not know a thing about technology or who is telling children how to run their lives. She is a mum who lost her daughter. Sonya told me that after her education talks she is often approached by young people who want to share their bad experiences online, who want to confide with her. They know that something is not quite right but they do not always know exactly how to pinpoint that. She does what she can to support them, and steers them to appropriate help. Sonya could not protect her daughter but she can to what she can to protect other children. Her efforts led to her being nominated as South Australia's Australian of the year in 2013. But that is not why she works so hard for online safety and why she has advocated so long for changes to laws. Our children deserve the best and, as my colleagues have said in the past, if Carly's law, this legislation, can stop just one young person from becoming a victim then we have done our job, and it is worth it. Amendment (Protecting Minors Online) Bill 2017, which strengthens the laws keeping children safe online. I acknowledge the contribution by the previous speaker, the member for",196,Bills
185,Mr Llew O'brien (Wide Bay) (12:12,"I rise to support the Criminal CodeMayo, particularly because of its personal nature for her and how close to home this is for her. I also acknowledge the Nick Xenophon Team for the strong stance they have taken on this. As its name suggests, this bill is about protecting children, which is fundamentally what we are here for. Every law we pass, everything we do is done either to benefit or to protect our kids. The internet has brought about much change to the world. We can access almost any information within a few clicks of a button. The internet has been a great tool for education, particularly for students learning by distance in regional Australia, like my daughter. Children have a wealth of knowledge at their fingertips. They were learning in ways that were not possible a few years ago. Kids today are sharing like they have never shared before. Many of us have children who seem to spend every moment texting or otherwise using their phones or watching videos on laptops. Eighty per cent of teenagers have a social media account. Half of them have been using it since the age of 10. Over 80 per cent of teens use the internet three or more times a day, mostly during the hours from when they get home from school to when they go to bed. Ninety-six per cent of Australian households have wi-fi, giving children the ability to use the internet from their bedroom. While mobile phones and computers are good if used for the right reasons, they make our children more vulnerable to unsavoury people who would never be let inside the family home. The nature of social media is that we can talk to people without truly knowing who is behind the screen. The anonymity of the internet has created new opportunities for predators to target innocent children. Every week, we see another report in the news of some perverted individual going after a child. Parents across Australia were horrified earlier this year when they read about a man pretending to be a pop star, who asked an eight-year-old for nude images, and the story of the 39-year-old man attempting to meet a 14-year-old girl at a Victorian public pool. Only recently, we saw that a convicted killer had lured a Sydney teenager, using the internet, to the United States. Social media can be a very dangerous place for children and young people. Internet safety groups warn parents to limit what they share about their children online, because they fear it could fall into the hands of sex offenders. These sites have few safeguards that prevent predators from finding and contacting potential victims. A survey conducted by the Office of the Children's eSafety Commissioner found that five per cent of kids aged eight to 13 and nine per cent of teenagers have been contacted by strangers online. Seventeen per cent of teenagers said that they had been exposed to inappropriate content while using social media. Worryingly, the internet makes it easier for predators to connect with each other. There are now sick communities on the internet that share images of child abuse and encourage others to do the same. These recent changes in technology require us to take a smarter approach to child safety. This is why the measures included in this bill are so essential. As I am a father, there is nothing more important than keeping my children safe. Like every parent across this country, I was sick to my stomach in 2007 when I heard about the case of Carly Ryan, a 15-year-old girl from South Australia tragically taken before her time. Carly was brutally raped and murdered by a 50-year-old man posing online as a teenage musician. Her story is beyond every parent's worse nightmare. Her mother, Sonya, has gone through an ordeal most of us can never imagine. Many of us would feel helpless in that event, but Sonya has shown a great deal of bravery and courage. Since her daughter's death, she has worked tirelessly to change the law for the better. I wish to acknowledge Sonya Ryan and thank her for all of her effort. Her advocacy is an inspiration and something we can all learn from. We owe it to her and to Carly's memory to do all we can to prevent this from ever happening again. The new offence, called Carly's law, will introduce tough new measures for people preparing to cause harm to a minor. This law will make it a criminal offence to prepare to procure or engage in sexual activity with a child. These measures are absolutely vital for police and law enforcement agencies. Police should not have to wait until it is too late to stop a cyberpredator. This bill gives them greater powers to intervene earlier, before the child is put in harm's way. Carly's law will allow law enforcement agencies the ability to investigate as soon as someone shows signs of being an online predator. The police can take action against these people sooner rather than later. There is no requirement to prove intent to commit the ultimate offence of harming or engaging in sexual activity with a child, only intent to prepare to do so. With this, we are sending a strong message to predators: if you plan to harm a child, you will receive the full force of the law. The maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment will be a strong deterrent to all who seek to prey on vulnerable children. But we know it cannot stop here. The community expects the government to do all it can to make sure our kids are safe on the internet. The Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice have announced tougher criminal responses and more support services for victims. I wish to thank the member for Stirling for his work in this area. The Australian Federal Police are partnering with international law enforcement agencies, like Interpol, to combat the scourge of child sex abuse around the globe. The AFP work closely with state and territory police agencies, under the Joint Anti Child Exploitation Team, to direct anti-child-exploitation efforts across Australia. The ThinkUKnow program is an education initiative run by the AFP that teaches school students and parents about cyber safety. Topics covered include online grooming, sexting, privacy, identity theft and fraud. In 2015-16 they delivered 386 presentations to more than 10,000 parents, carers and teachers across the country. The federal government is taking a leadership role in combating online safety. In 2015, the Attorney-General established the Office of the Children's eSafety Commissioner to provide education to Australian children and young people. There is currently legislation before the House to expand the role of the commissioner to provide online safety support to all Australians. Last year, the government established the national working group on child sex offenders to provide advice on how to improve existing measures. The working group, in collaboration with the National Child Offender System, is examining ways to improve current operational procedures so there is a coordinated national response to child sex offences. Its members include senior people in the police and legal community, who have first-hand experience dealing with child sex crimes across the states and territories. Child sex crime is a national issue that requires a national solution. I look forward to reading the working group's findings. The Criminal Code Amendment (Protecting Minors Online) Bill 2017 sends a clear message: planning to harm or sexually exploit Australian children will never be tolerated. I say this as a former police officer and as a father. Just as in real life, kids should be allowed to be kids. They deserve to grow up in a safe community, free from predators trying to take away their innocence. These are sensible measures to tackle the new challenge for police and law enforcement agencies. Any improvement in the law that helps police detect what are the scum of the earth who walk amongst us, those who seek to take advantage of our most vulnerable and most precious, our children, is a good thing. We owe it to the memory of Carly to stop these depraved people from ever getting their hands on a child. I welcome this bill as part of the government's broader effort to tackle child abuse in all its forms across Australia. Dr ALY (Cowan) (12:23): I am very honoured to stand up and speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (Protecting Minors Online) Bill 2017, which I think is a very important one. I am very happy to support the bill, and I want to iterate Labor's commitment to ensuring children are safe online. As the previous speakers and my colleagues have mentioned, this bill is a response to the death of Carly Ryan, a 15-year-old girl who was murdered by an online predator in South Australia in 2007. It seeks to allow police to intervene in suspected grooming cases by broadening the range of preparatory conduct that is covered by offences in the Criminal Code. I would like to take this opportunity, before I get into the bill, to pay heed to Carly's mother, Sonya, who lost her daughter very tragically. From that, she established the Carly Ryan Foundation and has fought tirelessly to see this bill come to fruition and to ensure the online safety of all children and that other parents do not go through the grief and anguish that she has gone through. It takes a very rare kind of individual to channel such tragedy into something positive. I think that all of us in the House today and all of us in this parliament today can agree that Ms Ryan, Carly's mother, is an individual deserving of praise. We can all agree that we need to pay heed to her efforts in this space. This year is the 10th anniversary of Carly Ryan's murder. As I mentioned, Carly was tragically killed by an older predator, a man who preyed on her through social media, pretending to be a teenage boy. Carly's mother, Sonya, through the Carly Ryan Foundation, has worked tirelessly to campaign for the changes we are seeing here today. All Australians have the right to feel safe online, and all parents-and I am a parent myself-should be able to feel safe knowing that their children will not meet the same tragic fate as Carly Ryan. I think it is really hard for people of my generation in particular to understand just how hardwired our young people are. I remember the days that my son, at 15, came running down the stairs and said he had a hundred friends. I said, 'Well, where are these friends?' And he said, 'On Facebook, Mum. On Facebook!' We tend to think of the online world as separate to our offline world, but young people do not see it that way. Their online world is indeed a social reality. It is sometimes difficult for us to come to grips with how that social reality exists for young people and just how easy it could be for young people to fall into the fate of somebody like Carly Ryan unless we put in place the safeguards and protections to ensure they do not meet such tragic circumstances. Young people do live their lives online, and unfortunately that comes with a lot of risks and a lot of risky behaviour that we did not have to face. I certainly did not have to face those kinds of risks when I was a young person. Those risks are really around the protection of their personal information. I often find that young people have a very different view of the value of their personal information and just how much of it they can share online. They do not really see it the way that we do. WhereasI see it as a kind of window into our private lives and a window into our social world, they see it as an opportunity for sharing and for social connections. SoI think there is important lesson to be learned here for all of us, which is that we need to connect more. We need to better understand what the online world means to young people and how we, as the old generation, can connect with young people around those concepts, and also how we come together to protect young people. That is really something that this bill does. Labor, of course, is committed to ensuring that children are safe online. AndI would also like to take some time here to recognise the hard work of the Nick Xenophon Team in progressing the bill and acknowledge our parliamentary colleagues on the Nick Xenophon Team, who also have fought tirelessly for this bill. As I mentioned earlier, the bill will ensure that police have the ability to investigate behaviour that could lead to the harm and sexual exploitation of children. Importantly, it also sends a clear message to the community that the use of technology to harm children will not be tolerated. That is something that I think we need to be a bit more focused on. Last week I met with an agency that works in the area of what it terms trafficking. This is basically men who are outside of a country solicitingpaying for-the sexual exploitation of children as young as three months old in another country. These men get online and actually pay, through an online format, to watch young children. The youngest case this organisation has is of a three-month-old child in the Philippines performing sexual acts. It calls this a form of sexual trafficking. The truth is that we really do not have enough laws in place to protect these young children who predominantly are in countries overseas. If we are going to protect children as a priority, we should be protecting all children, no matter where they reside, whether they are in Australia or whether they are overseas. We should be protecting them from those online predatory behaviours, as does Carly's law. We need to further the laws that we have around online behaviours that prey on children and young people not just through sexual exploitation, not just by preying on their vulnerabilities, but by grooming them for radicalisation as well. We really need to be looking at this nexus between humans and technology and how we can regulate online behaviours. We need to accept that we can never regulate the internet. That is a big ask. But we can do much more to introduce laws to regulate online behaviours. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2017-2018 Consideration in Detail Consideration resumed. the schedule for consideration of the portfolios, I would like to remind all members of the purpose of the consideration in detail stage and outline the way it is expected to proceed. I believe all members are aware of the general arrangements that are being proposed. This will allow maximum participation in this stage of debate. Shortly, the Federation Chamber will be asked to agree to a proposed schedule for the times for consideration of portfolios. This may need to be varied, but it is a useful guide to assist ministers and members to arrange their commitments. Chairs will not be seeking to enforce this arrangement strictly. Consideration in detail is a debate, and the call will be alternated between the government and non-government sides as always. Even though this debate sometimes takes the form of question and answer, this is not question time.

Consideration in Detail Agriculture and Water Resources Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $904,828,000 Water Resources) (12:34): This has been a great budget that builds on the $4 billion agricultural white paper. We have been doing so much in agriculture within the coalition. It has been an incredible success. There is no-one who denies the fact that, to December last year, we had a 23.7 per cent increase in the value of agriculture. This has been spectacular. It is spectacular when you consider that, in the last section of the Labor-Independent-Greens alliance government, agriculture actually reduced by 0.5 per cent. We are really turning the show around. There are things that we have done. We have also invested in core funding requirements, such as biosecurity, and we are currently dealing with issues such as white spot disease. We had great success in areas such as Panama race 4, which was a threat to the half-a-billiondollars-a year banana industry of North Queensland. I know that the member for Capricornia is very aware of that. We have had some success, against all odds, in that space, and it just goes to show that investment in biosecurity actually brings real dividends. We have also included in this budget $4.1 billion worth of resourcing for the agriculture and water resources portfolio. We have had to deal with a whole range of issues, such as funding cliffs in the water section of the portfolio. We have managed to get these financed, and we are driving forward two agendas that will see the completion of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan-something that people were sceptical about when we brought water back into agriculture, but that is now delivering real outcomes and real delivery in this very serious portfolio section. We continue on our program of farm support. Well over 7,000 people have had access to the farm household allowance to try and help them through the tougher times. We are now rolling out well in excess of $600 million in concessional loans. That is working on the back of starting the process of establishing the Regional Investment Corporation, which we have now brought about. It will be based in Orange. It is a multibillion-dollar organisation. It just shows the dynamism that the coalition has in this area. We worked very closely with the infrastructure portfolio on the delivery of such things as the $8.4 billion into the Inland Rail. This will be a huge boon to the development of sections of Victoria-right up into Wodonga through Seymour; through western New South Wales; through Parkes; through Narrabri; through Moree; right up into Queensland; into Goondiwindi; through to Toowoomba; and, of course, to the bookends of Brisbane and",207,Unicef Estimates That There Are More Than Four Million Websites Featuring Minors

191,Mr Joyce (New England,"Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture andMelbourne. I know that you yourself, Deputy Speaker Coulton, are very aware of this major delivery that we have brought about and what a huge assistance it will be to the agricultural sector in those areas. It goes hand in glove with Roads to Recovery and the Bridges Renewal Program. All of these things are about refurbishment to assist the record turnaround that we have seen in the agricultural sector in Australia. We continue to stand behind the live export trade. We made sure that we worked very assiduously to get the Livestock Global Assurance Program in place. This has meant that we continue to see those record prices bring real prosperity to people up in the gulf and in Western Australia. This goes to show that we take this portfolio incredibly seriously and have definitely made it a pillar of government that is delivering back in spades. On agricultural levies, we have introduced a plant health levy of 0.1 of a cent per kilogram for avocados. We have increased the plant health levy on bananas and rounded up the banana marketing levy to 1.15c per kilogram. We have reduced the emergency response levy on laying chickens. As for seed cotton, we have introduced an export charge of $4.06 a tonne on seed exports. These show the matching funding of government and how we are investing continually in research and development-driving forward so that we not only have an agricultural sector that is one of the best in the world, if not the best in the world, but also continue to maintain it as one of the best in the world through the research we are doing. The thoroughbred-horse-breeding sector has also come into the levy system now. It has been a big fight, but we have managed to deliver a levy system there because we know how important that also is to regional Australia and to the racing industry. What a huge employer they are in our areas. As for departmental staffing, the level of staffing in the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources for 2017-18 will be 4,488 people. That is a slight decrease of 43 in the final figures, but it just goes to show the massive investment that we have made. (Time expired) interest in this area of portfolio responsibility and, indeed, the many staff members from the minister's office who work in challenging times. I just hope there is someone back there answering the phones! Minister Joyce, you and I agree, I am sure, that there is nothing more important in this portfolio than biosecurity, and I welcome a new initiative in the budget which has been described as 'the new national biosecurity initiative'. CanI ask you to explain how this new construct will work, and how much money has been allocated in the budget for the initiative? then answer them in a block or take them on notice. South Australia. As part of the agribusiness sector forestry contributes $1.8 billion to the South Australian economy and employs directly and indirectly some 22,000 people. In my electorate of Barker softwood and hardwood plantations, sawmills, and paper, tissue and particleboard mills employ over 5,000 people directly and 8,000 indirectly. The forestry sector is enjoying some of the best conditions in its history with an ABARES report showing that the volume and value of logs harvested reached record levels in 2015-16. Log harvests exceeded 30 million cubic metres and were valued at over $2.3 billion.

194,Mr Pasin (Barker) (12:40,"The forest industry is vitally important to the south-east ofharvest reaching 16.3 million cubic metres. This growth is due in part to strong export demand for our products, in particular woodchips and round wood logs. Export of these products contributed to an overall rise of 7.8 per cent in the first quarter of this year. for Australia's sustainably managed timber and wood products resulted in a record harvest of softwood. Demand for wood fibre in the Asia-Pacific region continues to expand, creating huge potential for our sustainably managed forest industries. Australia is well placed to take advantage of this demand for wood fibre. There is no question that livestock industries, specifically beef and sheep, are experiencing extraordinary growth, which is great news for my electorate of Barker. Relief from the drought and high prices, in part due to this government's three free trade agreements with the Asia Pacific, are providing significant opportunities for cattle and sheep producers. These critical trade deals are one of the driving forces behind latest forecasts that in 2016-17 Australia's agricultural production as a whole will surpass $60 billion for the first time ever. For example, a cattle farmer's cash income in southern Australia over the past two years have been the highest recorded in over 40 years. Cash income for sheep operators is expected to rise and increase to an average of $133,000 per farm this financial year, which is around 70 per cent above the average over the past 10 years. The volume of beef and sheep meat products exported is projected to rise from a whopping 1.36 million tonnes to 1.52 million tonnes over the next five years. Export earnings for livestock and livestock products are forecast to rise to $22.2 billion off a level of $20.9 billion. Farmers in my electorate of Barker are in pole position to capitalise on a growing middle class in Asia and their increasing demand for the high-quality goods and services that our region has to offer. Australia's food and wine industry is experiencing exciting growth, which is great news for my electorate also, which produces some of the highest quality food and wine products anywhere in this nation. Export figures show that in my home state of South Australia food and wine exports increased by $6 million in 2015-16, reaching $5.22 billion. Horticulture is one of our most valuable and important industries. It is Australia's thirdlargest agricultural industry valued at $9.13 billion and employs around 57,000 Australians across this great nation. This government's free trade agreements are supporting this important industry. China has now become Australia's largest market for agriculture, food and fishery exports, being worth almost $10 billion in 2015. Export of oranges, for example, are also up more than 56 per cent to $52 million into China. Horticulture exports to Korea have also grown substantially. In the first year of the Korean free trade agreement exports of potatoes for chipping have more than doubled to over $13 million following tariffs being slashed from 30 per cent to 12 per cent, and they were slashed even further to six per cent beginning at the start of this year. In addition, we have gained technical market access for new commodities into China and Korea. Australia sent its first shipment of nectarines to China in November 2016, and we have now seen over 150 tonnes of the fruit exported to China. Blood Oranges are now being exported in to Korea under new technical market access agreements. My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. What measures in the budget will help continue economic growth for the livestock, forestry and horticultural industries in my electorate of Barker? bloc. I appreciate that, because it is going to save time and allow members greater opportunity to put questions to him. In addition to my question about plant biosecurity, I foreshadow that I am going to ask the minister questions about the Regional Investment Corporation, the On the Regional Investment Corporation: Will it be obligatory for the chair and board members you are selecting to be based in Orange? Has any work been done to compare the cost of the Commonwealth's administering the farm concessional loans to the cost of having the states administer those loans, as is the case now? How many staff members does the minister expect to be working in Orange when the RIC is fully developed and operational? On the APVMA: How do you explain the difference between the roughly 200 staff working at the APVMA now and the 150 staff that we are told at Senate estimates are expected to be working in Armidale when it is fully operational? Are they staff lost to the McDonald's in Dubbo or whatever it might be? On 23 November, the minister wrote to the finance minister seeking agreement to additional funding for a digital strategy. Can you further expand on the digital strategy and on what you expect to be the cost of that digital strategy? What is the objective of the strategy? On your Armidale office, Minister: I am trying to determine the extent to which the Armidale office is being used as a ministerial office. To determine that, I would like you to inform the House of how many agriculture stakeholder, water stakeholder-portfolio stakeholder-meetings you have had in that office in the last six months. Ms LANDRY (Capricornia-Deputy Nationals Whip) (12:47): Rookwood Weir has been described as a game changer for Central Queensland. It has the potential to create 2,100 new local jobs in the region as well as to double farming output along the Fitzroy River. The Fitzroy catchment is the largest river system draining to Australia's east coast. That is thousands of potential jobs and investment flowing straight past Rockhampton's door. Rookwood Weir has the potential to double agriculture production in the Fitzroy Basin by a multiplier of three for additional service and secondary industries. It will guarantee water security for urban and industrial use in Gladstone, Rockhampton and Livingstone LGAs. In a further sign of the growth potential for regional Australia, farm production is forecast to leap 8.3 per cent during this financial year. But these opportunities will be lost to Central Queensland as Queensland Labor continues to drag the chain. The Turnbull-Joyce government has committed $2 million to the business case for the weir. It has completed EPBC approvals and has committed $130 million towards construction. We still have no commitments from Queensland. This is all for a project that, in 2006, Peter Beattie declared would be built by 2011. The final regulatory hurdle was approved in December 2016, when Queensland's Coordinator-General gave environmental approval to the Rookwood Weir. Business Queensland, the group that carries out economic evaluations on behalf of the state government, issued a statement in October 2016 saying the business case could not be rushed. This situation is the height of hypocrisy, because when it",209,Unicef Estimates That There Are More Than Four Million Websites Featuring Minors
195,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (12:45,"I note that the minister is going to take questions encomes to major projects like Brisbane Cross River Rail or Townsville stadium Queensland Labor asks for Commonwealth money without a business case ever being started. The Queensland minister for agriculture and member for Rockhampton has stated that the state government is now working on the business case for Rookwood Weir. This is the business case which the federal government committed to funding in 2016. In that time the Western Australian government has completed feasibility studies, committed its own funding and submitted two applications to the Commonwealth government for major water projects. It is the same in Tasmania, where the state government has completed business cases for their water projects and is now building them. Agriculture is delivering a record contribution to the Australian economy, with exports up 10 per cent and overall production at a record-breaking $63.8 billion. Central Queensland will again be missing out until the Queensland Labor government gets moving on vital infrastructure projects like Rookwood. Queensland Labor desperately wants funding for Brisbane's Cross River Rail without a business case. Why will they not apply the same urgency towards Rookwood Weir? Hundreds of people have signed my petition for the state government to get on with building Rookwood Weir. It is the No. 1 job-creating project for Central Queensland. The other states can do it; it is not hard. The Queensland government just needs to get on with it. Capricornia need dams and water infrastructure. We need a commitment from the Queensland state government. If former Labor Premier Peter Beattie maintained he could have the Rookwood Weir built by 2011, why is this current state government stalling? Will the minister update the House on measures the Australian government has taken to increase agricultural production and water security in Central Queensland? And will the minister explain to the House what is causing the delay of Rookwood Weir? minister: does he agree that it would be prudent to establish a business case for the project before proceeding with full planning and construction of the project? Does the project have any business whether it be in the area of urban infrastructure, industrial water, urban water or indeed agriculture water customers? On Shoalwater Bay, I welcome the fact that the government has agreed that there will be no compulsory acquisitions of agricultural land in the region. I ask the minister: what steps has he taken to satisfy himself that voluntary acquisitions will not be lead to a significant supply shortage in the beef supply chain? Because obviously whether they are compulsory or voluntary, it has the same impact on the supply chain, on the supply of cattle and therefore the same impact on the town if farmers in the region are not shopping in the town. I refer him to his contribution to the House not all that long ago on the issue of carp eradication. I ask: the minister, if the next steps in the research are completed and successful, when does he expect that project to come to fruition-in other words, when would he expect a significant reduction in European carp in our waterways? I ask him whether he realises now, having misled the House, that scientists are not proposing a venereal disease and, if he now acknowledges that, whether he is prepared to correct the record? I would advise him to correct the record.",211,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
196,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (12:51,"Given the contribution from Capricornia, I ask theOn the issue of white spot disease outbreak, I point out that the fisheries RDC has undertaken research on the economic impact of the outbreak. The cost has been to farmers and to the industry. It has been suggested it is nearly $50 million, which is very significant particularly given the proportional size of the contribution the minister has made. I ask the minister whether affected prawn farmers, those affected by white spot, who would be eligible for the extended or changed arrangements in farm concessional loans for farmers, would be eligible under that program as well? On the issue of concessional loans and the Regional Investment Corporation, I ask the minister: given the new criteria for the loans has not been determined and it was suggested in Senate estimates that in fact part of the remit of the RIC board will be to determine what these loans will look like-how they will be designed, shaped and who will be eligible for them and given that they are not coming into effect until 1 July 2018, what market failure is the minister seeking to address by reshaping the loans? If he has not identified a market failure-or, in other words, he does not really even know what they are going to look like-isn't it true to say that in effect the program will now become simply a lender of last resort for farmers? If that is not the case then I would welcome his contribution and explanation as to why it is not the case. the Deputy Prime Minister: horticultural biosecurity and, in particular, fruit fly control in the electorate of Murray and throughout the Goulburn Valley. As we know, the domestic value of the horticultural, forestry and grains industries around Australia is estimated at around $31 billion. In 2015, the value of export trade in all agricultural plant commodities that need a certificate of pest freedom-from any pest, that is-was approximately $1.6 billion in this area. More than 170,000 people are employed in the horticultural, broadacre farming and forestry industries. Within the electorate of Murray, the Goulburn Valley is often referred to as the food bowl of Australia, and around 25 per cent of all of Victoria's agricultural production is generated in the Goulburn Valley. We know that the GMID, the Goulburn Murray Irrigation District, produces over 82,000 tonnes of apples annually, 28 per cent of the Australian total; 105,000 tonnes of pears, which is 86 per cent of the Australian total; and 42,500 tonnes of peaches, around 70 per cent of Australian production. There is a burgeoning tomato industry throughout the Goulburn Valley. In the 2013-14 year, we had 223,000 tonnes. That has increased to around 286,000 and 274,000 tonnes in the last two years, generating around $30 million in value. Sometimes we forget about the flow-on industries that are associated with or hang on the back of our primary production. There are certainly the packaging, manufacturing and transport industries that only exist on the back of our horticultural and dairy industries. The amount of employment in those areas leads us to understand exactly how critical these second-tier industries are. Recently, of course, our free trade agreements have been driving primary production, opening up more and more opportunities for our producers and our exceptional horticultural and agricultural products. Two weeks ago, Deputy Prime Minister, you will remember you were able to visit one of our Shepparton orchardists, Mr Peter Thompson. Peter said:",212,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
197,Mr Drum (Murray,"Chief Nationals Whip) (12:55): I wish to put an area of concern toMarket access is critical to key export destinations like Taiwan, China and the United States. Pests limit our export markets. Working towards pest free zones will only enhance our export opportunities. In relation to biosecurity, we need to protect these markets, and biosecurity controls are obviously going to be critical in maintaining Australia's clean, green, safe reputation both domestically and internationally. One of the greatest biosecurity threats that we have-certainly throughout the Goulburn Valley-is fruit fly. Over 75 per cent of Australia's fruit and vegetable exports are susceptible to fruit fly, and it is estimated that fruit fly at the moment is costing Australia around $300 million in control costs and also in lost markets, with the actual losses to the fruit crops put at around $159 million per annum. We understand that some of the work that is going to be done with this new announcement that you have put forward, Deputy Prime Minister, will be on trials of automated fruit fly traps and on strengthening the fruit fly surveillance program and other programs that, we are hopeful, will lead to an area free of pests. I put this question to you, Deputy Prime Minister: how do you see this funding of $2.2 million for biosecurity benefiting the long-term future of our horticultural industries? chosen tie has reminded me to point out to the minister that he is wearing the wrong-coloured tie. I know he was a senator from Queensland, but I thought he had come down and joined the strength. I will be giving way to members of the government backbench to save time because I am sure the minister would like at least five minutes to answer the extensive questions I have put to him, and I would urge him to use his authority to make sure he does find himself at least five minutes. indicate that this debate will conclude at 1.15 pm. agriculture, but I just want to talk about some of the things that have been happening, because they do feed into my question, which is going to be about the instant asset write-offs in the context of agriculture and horticulture. One of the things that needed to happen was the facilitation of confidence in the agriculture and horticulture sector, particularly the agriculture and horticulture sector in Mildura. When I was VFF president I spent a lot of time walking around the corridors here, trying to advocate to Tony Burke, who was water minister at the time, about the value of the Sunraysia Modernisation Project, a project that was about investing significant amounts of Commonwealth money into our horticultural industry to really grow opportunities. I could not get anywhere with Tony Burke, the water minister at the time. In contrast, I have to say, has been the work of Barnaby Joyce, as shadow water minister and now as minister for agriculture, to see that project developed. There has been $103 million of federal money and $17 million of irrigators' money. There has been no money from the Victorian Labor government. This federal money has instilled confidence. So you have the first level of confidence, which is that the federal government is putting money into infrastructure. But the next step, the step that I want the minister to answer a question about, is the on-farm instant tax write-offs, the ability to deduct infrastructure, such as irrigation infrastructure.",213,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or

200,Mr Broad (Mallee) (13:00,"I have a really good question for the minister forWe are now building infrastructure that is letting people put water to their farms, but we have also created the tax environment on those farms so that those things-those irrigation systems, those trellises-are, I believe, going to be instant tax write-offs. The other thing is that when you grow these great vineyards and you produce these great table grapes-and, I might point out, table grapes that have great market opportunities because of the free trade agreements delivered by our government-you are going to need to pick those table grapes and you are going to put those grapes in one of those little four-wheel drive things they drive around. They call them mules, don't they? I believe they are under $20,000; you can get them for about $15,000. Under the tax regime that our government has delivered, they are currently 100 per cent tax deductible in the very year they are purchased. So, when you think about it, from the very first step of building the water infrastructure-for which Barnaby Joyce has delivered $103 million-to the tax deductibility of building these trellises and putting in the irrigation on the farm and then picking that fruit and taking it in your little mule, which cost less than $20,000, everything is about creating a strong economic framework. I will also add something about what we, in contrast to the opposition, are doing in the water space. There is now confidence that there will no longer be purchases above a 1,500 gigalitre cap. In my patch Penny Wong is regarded as the worse water minister that the country has ever seen. Not only did she require people to hand over water for five years; she required them to pull up the water infrastructure. That water infrastructure is now being put back into the same blocks from which it was pulled up by Penny Wong, largely under the administration of the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources. My question is to the man who is regarded as the most saintly agriculture minister to ever walk on the hallowed grounds of Sunraysia, the man who has delivered $103 million worth of infrastructure, the man who has given tax incentives to farmers to build trellises, the man who has allowed those farmers to deduct the value of their little mules to cart their fruit, the man who has been the strong advocate for selling their products overseas and getting good prices, the man who has put some confidence back into the water market. My question to the minister is: can you explain just how more asset tax write-offs are helping the people of Sunraysia, because they are obviously very, very happy and were very, very upset with the very poor management we saw on water under Penny Wong and the lack of infrastructure we saw under Tony Burke? That is my question. and ask a question of the minister in relation to the National Landcare Program. In my seat of Wide Bay, agriculture provides over $1 billion to the economy. It is very important that the National Landcare Program works in conjunction with these agricultural producers. I have beef production, forestry plantation, sugar crops, small crops and large macadamia farms throughout Wide Bay. On our side of the chamber, the government understand that when it comes to conservation and sustainability through land care no-one understands those things better than our rural producers. There are people on the other side in Labor and the Greens particularly pretending that that is what they are about, but we know that they are more about the extreme vegetation management type laws that were attempted to be introduced in Queensland recently. They are a 'lock it up and lose your land rights' approach to farmers, saying, 'Let's grow as many weeds as we can in that space.'",214,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
201,Mr Llew O'brien (Wide Bay) (13:05,"It gives me great pleasure to speak here todayThe federal government has announced $1.1 billion to fund a new National Landcare Program. The funding is made up of two components: around $1 billion over five years from 2018-19 for the second phase of the program and $100 million for four years from 2016-17, as was announced by the government in December 2016. This demonstrates that the coalition government has a strong commitment to Landcare and the volunteers across this nation. It also demonstrates that the coalition government's Landcare Program is about achieving productive environments. It supports the protection of and restores our soil, water, vegetation and biodiversity-the natural resources of our unique environment which underpin the productivity and profitability of agriculture and fisheries in local areas like Wide Bay. The producers in Wide Bay are already doing some great things when it comes to sustainability and the environment. I mentioned the macadamia producers before. We have the third-largest macadamia industry in Australia. It produces $20 million worth of macadamias each year. Those producers have entered into an agreement with Ergon and created an energy plant that provides through the combustion of the waste of macadamia nut shells enough energy to supply 1,200 houses a year. That is equivalent, in terms of reduction of greenhouse gases, to taking 200 cars off the road. This is what our agricultural producers are doing to improve our environment. Our sugar producers in Maryborough have environmental action plans in relation to water pollution, nutrient run-off and chemical plants. They are very, very active when it comes to trying to reduce the sediment and nutrient run-off into the Great Barrier Reef. RecentlyI was very happy to announce a grant for the Mary Valley under the National Landcare Program, which was really good. We cannot forget that Labor's greatest effect on the Mary Valley and agriculture was its attempt to put a dam there, which was basically going to kill the whole area. I must admit, though, that it was the Labor government that stopped the pain, so it was an interesting exercise in Labor bringing and then stopping pain-a little bit like hitting yourself on the head with a hammer because it feels so good when you stop. Anyway, my question to the minister is: can the minister provide some information on the measures that the coalition government has in this year's budget that will help my local agricultural producers regarding the National Landcare Program? Deputy Prime Minister, which today will be on decentralisation, but I will preface my question with a few remarks about decentralisation. Deputy Speaker Coulton, you would know that it is crucial that every part of Australia benefits from the economic growth that government agencies-and their jobs-can help deliver to our local communities. We in country Australia understand that. The only people who seem to complain about decentralisation are people in the big cities, who hate it-oh, and the member for Hunter; he does not like decentralisation either. We have just had a wonderful example of a new agency being decentralised, the Regional Investment Corporation, which is going to be based in the electorate of Calare. The RIC, as it is known to its many friends, was a key coalition government election commitment and is designed to improve the delivery of funds to farmers and to ensure greater national consistency in farm business loan assessments. It is going to be responsible for administering concessional loans such as drought relief and water infrastructure loans. Ultimately, the corporation will administer over $4 billion in loans.",215,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
202,Mr Gee (Calare) (13:10,"I certainly appreciate the opportunity to ask a question of theThere will be 25 new jobs in the set-up stage, with 31 to be delivered in the first two years. This loan book is going to quickly grow. You may well ask, 'What has the reaction been?' The reaction out there has been very positive, Mr Deputy Speaker. I draw your attention to the comments of Mr Reg Kidd, who is Deputy Chair of Regional Development Australia Central West. Listen and learn, Member for Hunter: This is great news for our region and surrounding communities. It means new jobs, more career pathways for regional people and greater regional investment opportunities. It not only benefits our regional communities, but it provides the government with much stronger regional partnerships and taps in to the expertise we already have here. That is a ringing endorsement if ever I heard one, but it gets better. This is what Fiona Simson, the head of the National Farmers Federation-herself a farmer from the Liverpool Plains-had to say about the announcement: It just make sense for an agency charged with administering concessional loans to farmers to be based in the regions where farm businesses operate. That is a lot of sense from Fiona Simson from the National Farmers Federation. She went on to say: At a state and federal level, monies are made available with the best interests of farmers in mind, however the red tape involved often actually defeats its purpose. In some cases the process for accessing financial help causes more angst for farmers at a time when there is already high pressure. It just makes sense for all farm finance support to be handled by one federal agency. Certainty over when and where the RIC will be operating is welcomed. We look forward to being updated as the project progresses. Those are common sense, very positive comments, in contrast to the very negative output on this topic from the member for Hunter.

209,Mr Chester (Gippsland,"Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (16:00): IWe believe-and I am sure that those opposite would agree-that good investment decisions and good infrastructure decisions can change lives and can save lives. They change people's lives by reducing congestion, improving productivity, getting our freight to markets, and providing economic prosperity through moving freight in a more efficient manner. They also saves lives by reducing road trauma, through investments in safer and better roads. I know the member opposite is appreciating investment in projects like the Midland Highway. That important stretch of road has seen a reduction in road deaths and serious injuries. The highlights, from the government's perspective, in this year's budget have been well canvassed publicly. I would like to raise them again here on this platform. The Inland Rail project, the National Rail Program and Western Sydney Airport are very significant projects that we are very proud to be delivering as a Turnbull-Joyce government. There is the Inland Rail project. For decades people have talked about linking Melbourne to Brisbane-linking our goods on the eastern seaboard and moving freight in a more efficient manner. This is the biggest rail project in the past 100 years. People have talked about it for decades. We are getting on with the job of delivering it. The $8.4 billion equity investment in the ARTC will see construction start later this year as we work to overcome the great freight task challenge as we see freight double in this nation by 2050. In relation to the National Rail Program, the Commonwealth is pleased to announce a dedicated fund which will allow us to work with the states to identify projects and deliver them. It will allow us to focus on being an early participant in the planning of these major projectsMr Albanese interjectingduring the construction phase, and we will be seeking to reduce congestion, improve productivity and save lives. The member for Grayndler will get his time. Mr Albanese interjectinghas been wandering around Australia over the last four weeks, racking up the numbers and trying to find out who will vote for him in a future leadership ballot. He spent about $150 billion over those past four weeks. There was $114 billion on high-speed rail. He said that he is just going to fund the metro project in Melbourne, Cross River Rail, the link to Sydney Airport and Perth Metronet. He spent about $150 billion in four weeks, which, even by Labor's standards, is a remarkable spending spree. The member for Grayndler will get his chance in a moment. I look forward to his contribution. This is a government which is getting on with delivering infrastructure that our kids and grandkids will thank us for. The Minister for Urban Infrastructure will talk in a few moments time. I am sure that he will mention the $5.3 billion investment to build Western Sydney Airport, which will be operating by 2026, creating thousands of jobs in construction and also revolutionising the huge growth area of Western Sydney. Complementing the new infrastructure announcements in the budget are the ongoing commitments to projects like the Bruce Highway, a project where we have committed $6.7 billion over 10 years-$1 billion more than Labor ever committed to the Bruce Highway. There is $5.64 billion to see the Pacific Highway duplicated by 2020. The duplicated highway",218,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or

211,Mr Chester,"His answer is, 'Just fund it.' I have noticed that the member for Grayndlerwill link Sydney and Brisbane, will cut travel times by in excess of a couple of hours and will also save lives. In the Western Australian package we will see 17 projects, worth more than $2 billion, delivered. Victoria will see an extra $1 billion, including $500 million for regional rail, on top of the $3 billion deal secured last year. This is a government that is getting on with the job of delivering the infrastructure that our communities are demanding across our nation. We look forward to getting on and building for our future. Those opposite, unfortunately, are just whingeing about it. the budget 'confirms the cut to real budgeted capital funding to its lowest level in more than a decade, using a mix of underspend, reprofiling and narrative to cover this substantial drop in real capital expenditure'. That is not people in the Labor Party saying that; that is the peak industry body on infrastructure for Australia. That is what they are having to say, and I assure you, Minister, that what they say in private is less polite than that. They have contempt for what this government has done. The funding is cut in the current year by some $1.6 billion. Last year the budget papers indicated that there would be $9.2 billion expended in the current year. The actual fact is $7.6 billion. Inconveniently for the government, they produce budget papers with figures on them. The budget papers indicated across the forwards that that declines to $4.2 billion in 2020-21. Budget Paper No. 2 has a story to tell. There is only one new investment mentioned$13.8 million for the Far North Collector Road near Nowra. I acknowledge that that is a new project. It is the only new funded project in this entire budget over the next four years-one road. There is nothing for the Nowra bridge but this Far North Collector Road does get $13.8 million. If you look at the details, it is a mix of a return of some funding that was cut in previous budgets, such as Infrastructure Australia. Let us look at the Infrastructure Investment Program. For Victorian infrastructure investments, page 134 indicates that there will be zero, zero, zero and zero. When you look at the Infrastructure Investment Program offsets, it shows a $1,631.6 billion cut in the year 2020-21. Let us look at Keys2Drive. I acknowledge that the government has put funding in that it threatened to cut. It is a good thing that that program has continued. Let us look at other funding in the budget. Supplementary local roads funding for South Australia has been put in-again something the government threatened to cut-but there is no new investment. When you look at other programs, including the Bruce Highway, it clearly indicates that there are zero additional dollars. That is all from existing funds. At a time when the economy needs support for infrastructure this is an appalling budget. The government will spend less next year than this year on the Bruce Highway. For the Pacific Highway this current financial year the allocation is $1.37 billion and next year it is $710.1 million. Again that is less. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport raised the quite farcical National Rail Program. It is a big announcement-a $10 billion program-unfortunately, there is not a cent while they are still in government in this term. There is not one cent because there is not a dollar this year, not a dollar next year and not a dollar the year after. For the next three years, there is not a dollar of new investment for national rail. Then, in 2019-20, there is $200 million. In 2020-21, there is $400 million. SoI acknowledge that they have established this program. Unfortunately, it is not for this generation. You could walk the length of the country",219,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
212,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (16:05,"Infrastructure Partnerships Australia have said thatuntil a dollar comes on track. It is pathetic. In this budget as well, Victoria will receive eight per cent of the national infrastructure budget.

This is not the Crocodile Farm Hotel on Liverpool Road; this is the Federation Chamber. Keep the interjections to a dull roar. Thank you. level of investment commitment to transformative national projects. I want to speak about two of them. One is the Inland Rail corporation. There is an $8.4 billion equity contribution to this transformative Inland Rail project-a project that will bring together three states: Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. It will enable producers in those states to access markets more quickly and efficiently. It will significantly improve the rail share of the freight task between Melbourne and Brisbane. As we all know, the rail share east to west is very high, but, along the eastern seaboard at the moment, it is very difficult for rail to match the timing and reliability of road. But, with the Inland Rail, it will be possible to meet a reliable, 24hour-journey time from Melbourne to Brisbane and vice versa. So this is a very important initiative. It is a nation-building initiative. AndI make this point: a project which links together three states is a project that no one state government can deliver. Only the national government can deliver a project of this scale. This is nation-building infrastructure, and so too is the $5.3 billion commitment, the equity investment, that the Turnbull government is making in Western Sydney Airport. For 40 years, governments of both political persuasions have failed to make the decision to proceed with a second Sydney airport. I want to acknowledge the work of the shadow minister, when he was the minister, in taking some important steps, particularly the joint study into the aviation needs of Sydney in 2012, which confirmed the need for a second Sydney airport. This government-the Turnbull government-has committed to a $5.3 billion equity injection into a new company to be established, WA Co, which will build this vital facility which will deliver the additional aviation capacity that Sydney needs and the nation needs. Let's remember that Sydney is Australia's international aviation gateway, with 40 per cent of international traffic coming to Sydney. The study that the shadow minister established when he was minister reported to the two governments-New South Wales and the Commonwealth-that by 2027 there would be no more slots available at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. The study reported that, by the midto late-2030s, there would be no additional capacity available at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, even with so-called upgauging-replacing smaller aircraft in a slot with larger aircraft. There is an urgent national need to build a second Sydney airport, and that is why this budget contains a $5.3 billion equity commitment to building Western Sydney Airport.

And, of course, it will deliver some 20,000 jobs by the early 2030s, 9,000 jobs directly and some 11,000 jobs indirectly. So this will be a major contribution to economic growth, jobs and opportunity in Western Sydney, an area where some one million additional people are expected to be living over the next 20 years. We are working very closely with the New South Wales government in relation to ground transport infrastructure, including the $3.6 billion Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan. We are working on urban planning around the airport so that we can maximise the economic and beneficial impact of Western Sydney Airport, this very significant project for Western Sydney and for the nation. This budget contains major equity commitments to nation-building infrastructure. That is what an infrastructure budget should be doing. That is what this budget does. National Party MPs wandering around the length and breadth of this country shouting the words, 'Decentralisation, decentralisation, decentralisation!' I am sure there is a pet shop in the main street of Tamworth and, if you go in there, there will be a galah sounding remarkably like Barnaby Joyce. It will be saying, 'Decentralisation, decentralisation!' An opposition member: It would probably make more sense than him. less florid! Given the amount of noise the National Party have been making and what they have called a campaign that they have been running about decentralisation, you would expect to find something in the budget which backs in their idea that they are going to move vast swathes of public servant jobs out of Canberra and into regional Australia. You would expect to see some money in there. We know you would need to have some money for it because we know the cost to the public purse of the failed experiment of moving the APVMA out of Canberra and into the Deputy Prime Minister's own electorate. We know that that has cost in the order of $130,000 per employee. It takes a lot of effort to move an agency from one town to another. It was a cost of $130,000 per employee, leaving half the staff who refused to go, including the agency head, and having to recruit almost half the entire workforce. We also know that over the time they have been in government this government has had an appalling track record on public sector jobs. Around 18,000 jobs have been cut out of the public sector. They have not spared regional Australia. Over 200 jobs, for example, have been pulled out of the tax office in the regional town of Townsville. The CSIRO has been shedding jobs hand over fist in regional places around Australia as well. And 150 jobs were lost out of other regional tax offices around the country. We expected to see something in the budget that was going to back in the plan that the government says they have about decentralising public sector jobs. There is nothing in the budget. The only thing we see in the budget about public sector jobs is a plan to axe nearly 1,200 jobs from the Department of Human Services. Anybody who knows anything about the Department of Human Services knows that it is the most decentralised department in the public sector. So my question to the minister is quite simply: is the government going to quarantine the regional offices of the Department of Human Services from the 1,200 job cuts?",221,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or

218,Mr Stephen Jones,"It would make a hell of a lot more sense and probably be a lotIf it is not going to quarantine the regional offices from these 1,200 job cuts, we know that this decentralisation campaign that the National Party is running is nothing but a cheap fraud on regional Australia. It is nothing but a hoax and nothing but a cheap fraud on regional Australia. It would be an expensive fraud if they put a dollar in the budget to back it in. But there is not a dollar in the budget to back it in, so we know it is a cheap fraud. While I am talking about cheap frauds, I would like to minister to respond to the impact of the freeze that the government have put upon financial assistance grants to local government. I note that they followed Labor in removing the freeze in this budget, but the cost to regional councils and other councils has been permanent. Nearly a billion dollars has been lost to these councils, and the councils that are suffering the most, the communities that are suffering the most, are regional communities like yours, Deputy Speaker, and like mine and other regional communities around the country. These are the communities that Gough Whitlam had in mind when he put in place the Financial Assistance Grants program: regional councils around the country that were struggling to meet their basic services. The National Party say they support them, but they have ripped a billion dollars out of their bottom line. There is nothing in the budget to put it back. So my question to the minister is: what are they going to do to ensure that councils around the country and the regional communities they support can catch up to the money that the government have cruelly ripped out of their budgets and have no plan to put back? They have no plan to put it back. What are they doing about decentralisation? Is it anything more than a cruel fraud? What are they doing to refund the local governments to ensure that they can provide the services that regional communities rely upon? in the Perth metropolitan area and a very important project to my electorate, the Perth Freight Link, a project that would create over 10,000 jobs in WA that we need right now. Minister, there has been a debate in Perth about this project, and there have been protests led by a very local minority who chose to misrepresent the facts about this project. Of course Labor, as they always do, have sided with the protesters and the green, left, latte drinkers, and they have moved away from the people and the jobs. They have given in to the noisy, trendy cafe set. I think that in WA it is important for us to remind ourselves about the Perth Freight Link project. As well as creating 10,000 jobs, the Perth Freight Link project would take 7,000 trucks and 74,000 light vehicles off local roads each day. These are roads like the Leach Highway, Farrington Road, South Street, Stock Road, North Lake Road, Beeliar Drive and other local roads. It would create east-west access across the Perth metropolitan area, servicing the Perth Airport, the Fiona Stanley Hospital, the St John of God hospital and Murdoch University. It will bypass 14 sets of traffic lights on the Leach Highway and Stock Road, and it will reduce traffic pressure on South Street and the Leach Highway. In relation to the construction, we have to remember the facts. Roe8 will impact on 0.49 per cent of the entire Beeliar Regional Park. It would save 450,000 tonnes of CO2 by 2031, and $45 million would be invested to accommodate environmental sensitivities and provide better access to the area. Infrastructure Australia are very supportive of the Perth Freight Link project. They say that the project aligns with Infrastructure Australia's strategic priorities to increase productivity, expand productive capacity and build on Australia's global competitive advantages through delivering a more efficient freight network.

219,Mr Morton (Tangney) (16:21,"I rise to ask the minister about a very important projectlikes to quote Infrastructure Australia when it suits him, but not always. He likes to talk about the costs that urban congestion will have for our nation if it is unaddressed. Yet, in the same vein, he ignores the advice and the position of Infrastructure Australia in supporting the very important Perth Freight Link project. WA needs the Perth Freight Link project. It needs Roe8 and Roe 9. And, yes, the state ALP have stopped it. They claim a mandate. The minister will be interested to learn that, in those areas directly affected near the construction of Roe8 and Roe 9, the Labor Party actually achieved a swing of less than averageLabor Party; I accept that. There was a change of government. But, if the Labor Party were really going to pretend that the people in the southern suburbs were against the Roe8 and Roe9 project, you would assume that there would be a greater than average swing to the Labor Party in those suburbs, and there was not. I am serious, Member for Grayndler. But I do accept the great work that the federal Commonwealth government and the state government did in renegotiating a whole range of other infrastructure projects in relation to Western Australia, and a big win for my electorate is that the Roe Highway will be extended. It will be extended across the Kwinana Freeway to provide access to the Fiona Stanley and the Murdoch Activity Centre. That extension of the Roe Highway is important, but the southern Perth community and WA need jobs now. My question to the minister is: what is stopping the Roe8 and Roe9 projects from commencing? Is there funding available in the budget? I understand there is a contingent liability, and I would like the minister to explain on what basis the funding would be made available. I understand from the Treasurer that, if the state government made a decision to proceed with this project, the federal government would allow that money to become available, supporting jobs, infrastructure and, more importantly, the people of Western Australia with the direct access they need east and west across our important city. was absent yesterday from the MPI. It is an utter disgrace that the coalition government has failed to invest in vital infrastructure in the Hunter and Central Coast communities. These regions in New South Wales have major significance to Australia's economy. In fact, their combined population is a million people and yet this government neglects them. My first question to the two ministers-the senior minister and the junior minister who gets him his sandwiches-is: why won't they fund the Glendale transport interchange? The Glendale transport interchange was identified by all 11 Hunter councils as the single most important project for the region. Every dollar of Commonwealth investment in that project will leverage $94 of private sector investment-94 to one. Private sector analysis has said that it will drive the creation of 10,000 jobs in the surrounding area and drive the construction of 6,000 sorely needed homes, yet this government refuses is to fund it. In fact, this government has taken one funding decision on this project in its four years in office: to cut funding to it by $1 million. So my first question to the two ministers is: when will they reverse their disastrous decisions and finally fund the Glendale transport interchange?",223,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or

HeSecondly, the intersection of the Golden Highway and the New England Highway in in the electorate of Hunter is incredibly important. It is one of the most dangerous traffic blackspots in the Hunter region. SoI ask again of the ministers for infrastructure: when will the government fund this important project to eradicate a very dangerous blackspot. Thirdly, is the Singleton bypass. Singleton sees over 25,000 vehicles pass through the town every day, and around 3,750 of these are heavy vehicles. With traffic volumes predicted to grow over the next 25 years, the Singleton bypass would reduce traffic volume by an estimated 30 per cent, easing congestion in the town. Ministers, when will you fund this vital bypass that will reduce traffic in Singleton by 30 per cent? Another bypass that will reduce heavy-vehicle traffic through a town is the Muswellbrook bypass. This would improve traffic times around the New England Highway, and in 2013 the Gillard government allocated $10 million to make the project shovel-ready. The New South Wales government already allocated $3.1 million in 2016-17 to continue planning, so when will the ministers fund this important bypass? The next project of vital importance to the million people that live in the Hunter and Central Coast regions is a link between the M1 Pacific Motorway and the Pacific Highway, which would improve connectivity, improve traffic flow and provide more reliable traffic times for motorists and freight operators. The New South Wales government has already provided $7 million to continue planning for the extension, but where is the federal money? These bypasses are incredibly important. We have a great piece of infrastructure-the Albanese-Fitzgibbon expressway. That was a signature piece of infrastructure of the last Labor government, but we need to build on it. The member for Dobell has written to the Minister for Urban Infrastructure about the urgent need for a footbridge over Sparks Road, which is an incredibly busy road with a GP superclinic and MacKillop Catholic College nearby, and there have been too many near misses. Why isn't the government funding a piece of infrastructure that will make the community safer? Finally, there are a group of projects in Robertson that have been announced, and I ask the minister for information about funding time lines and funding sources. The member for Robertson has announced $7.2 million for a number of road projects around Ryans Road in Umina Beach, Oceano Street in Copacabana, Murray Street in Booker Bay, Davis Street in Booker Bay and the intersection of Langford Drive and Woy Woy Road in Kariong. In fact, that was a 2013 promise that has not been delivered. My questions are: where has the funding come from for these projects, and what is the time line for the delivery of those projects? These are really important questions. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know the one project in the Hunter and the Central Coast that this mob have actually funded, the one project they have supported in a region that has over a million people living in it? It is $1 million of funding for a billycart race road in Gresford. They have put aside a million dollars to fundAn honourable member interjectingthat has a million people: to fund billycart races rather than black spots and the Glendale transport interchange, which is the most important project in the entire region.

223,Mr Conroy,"Exactly-a billycart race. This is their level of commitment to a regionendeavour to respond to some of the contributions that we have already had. The member for Grayndler expressed a great deal of interest in new projects. He has expressed a great deal of interest in new jobs. We all know that he has a project of his own underway: he is only creating one new job as he seeks to become the new Labor leader. That is his vision for Australia. The member for Grayndler in his comments said, 'I never let my junior speak,' which I found quite bizarre, but it does explain why the member for Maribyrnong never lets him get a question anymore in question time. We have so much work underway right now. The Minister for Urban Infrastructure and I have $75 billion over 10 years to deliver projects right across the nation. The member for Grayndler managed to find one group that reacted in a negative sense in some way to the budget, but some of the other reactions to the budget are quite illustrative. The Australian Logistics Council's Michael Kilgariff said: The Government should be commended for making clear commitments to two significant infrastructure projects crucial to the freight and logistics industry … Pacific National CEO David Irwin said: Inland Rail is a true game-changer and we commend the Government for its commitment to such an important nation-building project. Fiona Simson, from the National Farmers Federation, said: $8.4 billion for the Melbourne to Brisbane Inland Rail is the real crown jewel of tonight's budget for the farm sector. We are getting on with the job of delivering infrastructure that our kids and our grandkids will thank us for right across this great nation, from our cities to our regional areas. The member for Grayndler raised the infrastructure spend in Victoria. CanI just make one simple point to the member for Grayndler. He may have forgotten that his friends in Victorian Labor, with Premier Daniel Andrews, actually paid $1.2 billion to not build a road. Imagine the roads we could have built in Victoria with that. We could have built the East West Link, to begin with. But, in the past 12 months, we have reached an agreement with Victoria to spend $3 billion on a range of projects. That $3 billion will see a billion dollars spent on the Monash upgrade. It will see the Murray Basin Rail Project undertaken. There will be $690 million in regional roads. There are projects right across Victoria as a direct result of the Minister for Urban Infrastructure and me working with the Victorian government to deliver a $3 billion commitment, which is $1.5 billion from the federal government and $1.5 billion from the state. But, in this year's budget, there is an additional $1 billion. Of that, there was $500 million committed to regional rail and $30 million for the Tullamarine planning workfinally, some planning work to link the great CBD of Melbourne to the Tullamarine airportand we are still negotiating with Victoria on other projects that we can undertake with the additional funding that has been made available. The member for Whitlam raised some concerns about the government's agenda in relation to decentralisation. I find it quite extraordinary that a member who purports to come from a regional area is now against regional jobs. The Labor Party in its past used to have bipartisan support for decentralisation.

What is wrong with this government seeking ways to move more Public Service jobs out of Sydney, out of Melbourne and out of Canberra and into our regional centres? The government are embarking on a long-term agenda for regional Australia where we want to see an ambitious decentralisation plan delivered. We are taking a leadership role; those opposite are simply whinging about it. If it was not their idea, they do not want to have a part in it. The member for Whitlam, who pretends to represent a regional community, is now telling us he is against regional jobs. We will continue to pursue the decentralisation agenda. He asks why there is no money in the budget for any of these decisions. Well, quite simply, it would pre-empt the process. There would be no point prescribing an amount of money before we even determined what was in scope. Decisions around the first tranche of agencies to be decentralised will be made in the 2018-19 budget, and the member is well aware of that. We will continue to pursue our decentralisation agenda. In relation to local government funding, the member asked some questions regarding indexation. The coalition government will resume indexation of the Financial Assistance Grant program from 1 July 2017, and indexation will result in an extra $836.5 million to be delivered to councils across Australia over the next four years. This is a government that is getting on with the jobMr Stephen Jones interjectingelection and more. interjecting. major projects, like Melbourne and Brisbane Inland Rail, Western Sydney Airport and the National Rail Program, and projects right down to the level of Roads to Recovery projects, Black Spot projects and the Bridges Renewal Program.

Not once in the budget speech was Tasmania mentioned. In the intervening weeks, the minister has been up on his feet a few times, like an angry chickenhawk, extolling the supposed virtues of this so-called infrastructure budget, and I have waited yet again to hear about all the wonderful projects that this government is doing in Tasmania. But there has been no mention of Tasmania. A quick look at the budget papers explains why. Out of the $75 billion those opposite boast about, there is nothing for Tasmania. In fact, over the course of the last 12 months the government have cut investment in Tasmania's infrastructure by $26 million. At budget time last year, Tasmanians were promised $173 million in 2016-17; however, the",226,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or

230,Mr Brian Mitchell (Lyons) (16:36,"I think it was four weeks ago that the budgetlatest budget reveals our state will get $147 million-a $26 million cut in a budget that is supposed to be all about infrastructure. Well, thank you very much! Funding cuts nationwide are $1.6 billion; in Tasmania, they are $26 million. Let's look at the list to see where the cuts to these programs are happening. For Black Spots-areas that require more funding, if anything-$2.9 million was promised in the 2016 budget but actual is $0.7 million. It will not even make it to a million dollars. There has been $2.2 million cut from Black Spots. Road projects: promised in 2016, $114.3 million; delivery, $91.3 million. The minister was on his feet earlier talking about how we welcome the investment in the Midland Highway. I remind the minister that the Midland Highway project was started by Labor, and we promised $500 million. This mob got into government and the first thing they did was cut $100 million out of it. So they have cut funding for fixing dangerous black spots on local roads by $2.2 million and they have cut funding for major road projects in Tasmania by $23 million in a budget in which Tasmania did not rate a mention in the Treasurer's speech. Funding for Tasmania will continue to fall over the next four years under this government: in 2017-18, $174.6 million; in 2018-19, $115.2 million; in 2019-20, $52.6 million; and in 2020-21, $61.6 million. It is a descending graph. It is like Malcolm Turnbull's-sorry, the Prime Minister's-approval ratings in Newspoll: down, down, down they go. Every major federally funded project currently underway in Tasmania was originally identified and funded by the former federal Labor government-whether it is irrigation, whether it is roads or whether it was the real NBN. That is an infrastructure project, although I know it is not under this minister's purview, where we delivered FTTP. I was in the chamber earlier today talking about Launceston being the only gigabit city in Australia. That was possible only because we delivered FTTP, whereas this government has come in and is delivering FTTN and wireless and satellite, and is making it impossible for new businesses to invest in the economy of the future, which is all about information technology. At every turn, Tasmania is losing under this government. It did not rate even mention in the Treasurer's speech and has not rated a mention whenever the minister gets to his feet. No doubt he will get to his feet in a minute and talk about all the wonderful things he is doing. Remember what Labor promised in the last election: a big program for Cradle Mountain, HMAS Tobruk would have come to Tasmania, extra road funding for the Midland Highway. Compare what Labor was going to produce for Tasmania with what these guys are doing. There is no comparison. known and unknown natural beauty. It is also home to some of New South Wales's worse traffic. Three of the 10 most congested roads in New South Wales are either on the northern beachers of Sydney or feed into the northern beaches of Sydney. It is a place of lifters, not leaners. In 2014-15, my constituents paid net tax of $1.9 billion. The average electorate pays $1.3 billion in tax. My electorate pays 46 per cent more tax than the average. We give so much, and we ask for so little. Mr Albanese interjectingSouth Wales government is currently building $75 billion of infrastructure projects and has announced $120 billion more.

The lost productivity through this traffic congestion is $9 billion per year and rising. One project which will ease traffic congestion on the northern beaches is a metro from Chatswood to Frenchs Forest. It would take cars off the road, put families around dinner tables rather than in traffic jams and markedly improve the quality of life of not only my constituents but people right across Sydney.

We will work with the Victorian government to access potential further funding for this project from the $10 billion national rail passenger program. The government will connect regional centres to our capital citiesalways a good thing-with faster, more-reliable rail services, with regional Australia getting its fair share of the new $10 billion national rail passenger program. The budget builds on funding for significant rail projects, such as $95 million for the Gold Coast light rail, in Queensland; $490 million for the Forrestfield-Airport Link, in Perth; $42.8 million for the Flinders Link; $365 million, by way of equity, for the $1.9 billion Moorebank Intermodal Terminal, in Sydney; as well as the recently-announced $792 million towards projects for Perth's metropolitan rail network, part of a $2.3 billion road and rail package for the Western Australian government. The government is working with the states to develop urban rail plans or our five largest cities and their surrounding regions and has committed $20 million, under our Faster Rail Initiative, to support the development for up to three formal business cases for faster rail connections.

(Time expired) Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) (16:46): The federal budget establishes $10 billion in national rail programs, yet it does not commit any new funding to South Australian rail projects. The South Australian Liberal Party has recently made a very ambitious election promise for a freight rail bypass from the Murray lands, taking freight out of the Adelaide Hills. It also includes a regional freight airport in the Murray lands. Was an examination of this proposal considered during the establishment of the National Rail Program? If so, why was it not funded or money at least put aside in the forward estimates? Was this proposal even put forward to the federal government by the Liberal opposition? The South Eastern Freeway, in South Australia, which goes through the heart of my electorate, provides a crucial transport link between the Adelaide metropolitan area and dozens of towns across the Adelaide Hills, and extends beyond to Murray Bridge. It is also the only freight link out to Melbourne and Sydney. Can the minister provide an analysis of when the freeway is likely to reach its capacity? Has any consideration been given to potential upgrades to the freeway to reduce its congestion? The minister would know that we have had a number of deaths on that freeway and a number of trucks have caused significant chaos. It is really just too congested. I would like to talk about the Building Better Regions Fund. The Treasurer spoke specifically about investing in the regions, before announcing a $200 million fund for a further round of the BBRF. Under the current eligibility criteria, cities such as the Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast and Geelong are considered regional, while townships such as my area of Charleston in South Australia, with a population of just 530 people is not considered regional. It is an isolated area, with in Charleston having no health services and no public transport. It is a true regional area but it is not considered regional, yet the Gold Coast is. What analysis was undertaken to determine the significant urban area maps, and what was the best determinant for eligible regions? Are there any plans to review this spend to address this clear anomaly, where the Gold Coast is deemed to be an eligible area for a regional grant but towns in my community like Charleston and Echunga, towns that are truly isolated, are not considered? The budget papers detail that the Australian government will continue the Regional Development Australia committee program by providing $74 million for the period 2017-18 to 2020-21. However, it also indicates that the current funding arrangements have been extended only until 31 December 2017. Minister, will Regional Development Australia continue beyond 31 December 2017 or will it face the axe? If it is to continue, could the minister please elaborate on the capacity in which it will continue? am even more delighted that the member for Grayndler is here, becauseMr Albanese: You guys are a bit obsessed with me!

237,Mr Wallace,"I do no know about 'obsessed', but I am delighted that the member for the member for Grayndler gets very upset when I talk about how, when he was the infrastructure and transport minister, he did absolutely nothing for the Sunshine Coast. Just last year, the federal government announced a $743 million commitment to the Bruce Highway upgrade between Caloundra Road and the Sunshine Motorway. That was under the minister for transport and infrastructure who is here this afternoon, not under the previous Labor infrastructure minister, the member for Grayndler. The project is going to make a significant improvement and will change the lives of many of my constituents on the Sunshine Coast. All up, it is a $929 million project. I notice that the member for Grayndler is trying to ignore what I am saying right now, which is quite sad. This stretch of road will change from four lanes to six lanes. It will include a new diamond interchange at the Caloundra Road Interchange. It will include a new interchange at Sunshine Motorway. Just a few weeks ago, in the budget, the federal government announced a further $650 million for upgrading the Bruce Highway south of Caloundra Road. I know that many of my constituents are over the moon. We are seeing unprecedented expenditure on our Sunshine Coast section of the Bruce Highway so that people travelling to and from Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast will no longer be trapped in gridlocked traffic. It is going to take three or four years to do this work, and, as they say, you cannot make an omelette without cracking an egg. There are going to be some difficult times ahead, but this government is prepared to make the difficult decisions. All up, just in my patch, just on the Bruce Highway, the federal government has committed $1.6 billion to road infrastructure. I want to congratulate both the Minister for Urban Infrastructure and the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport on the work they have done for the Sunshine Coast. But we are not stopping there. We on this side of House understand that, despite the state Labor government in Queensland, commuting to and from Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast requires a holistic approach. We understand that we need a better rail system. We on the Sunshine Coast have put up with a single-track line north of Beerburrum since the 1890s. That is for the 10th largest city in the country. I am very proud to be part of a government that recently announced, through the National Rail Program, a $10 billion facility for the state Labor government to tap into, to tender and bid for duplication of the North Coast railway line. That rail line duplication will take a lot of pressure off the Bruce Highway, and I commend the two federal ministers sitting here today for that project. My first questions to the minister are: What is the likely impact of the National Rail Program around Australia? How will the government prioritise projects under the National Rail Program? And, very importantly, has the minister received any contact from the Queensland government with regard to incorporating the duplication of the North Coast rail line between Beerburrum and Nambour into that program? elect, the way this government is going. I can answer the question from the member opposite, which was, 'What will the impact be of the $10 billion national rail fund?' The answer is zip, because there are zero dollars this year, zero dollars next year and zero dollars the year after. You do not announce a program for the next term in your first term and pretend that it is real. Then, when it is actually funded, the first year is $200 million and the next is $400 million. It is a great example of the illusion that is this government's budget-an illusion that includes",230,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
238,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (16:54,"I rise as the shadow minister-and the ministerthe Bruce Highway. Here are the figures-they are on page 133 of Budget Paper No. 2-on the Bruce Highway. It says: The Government will provide $908.6 million over seven years from 2016-17 for infrastructure projects includingAnd it includes the Bruce Highway projects. It says: The cost of this measure with the exception of the Far North Collector Road will be met from within the existing resources of the Infrastructure Investment Program. There it is in black and white: there is not an extra dollar for these infrastructure projects-not one dollar-apart from the Far North Collector Road. That is on page 133 of Budget Paper No. 2. Of course, before the budget we saw the establishment of the Infrastructure Financing Unit. That has now been renamed the 'Infrastructure and Project Financing Agency', perhaps because those opposite worked out that the acronym was not the best. Eventually, they worked that through. That is the minister's contribution: working out that that was a bad acronym. But the fact is that the industry thinks it is totally unnecessary. This is what the industry said: iii. We cannot identify any currently proposed infrastructure projects which are commercially viable and not already attracting finance; therefore we cannot see how the IFU will increase the pace of infrastructure project delivery; … … … vii. Commonwealth debt or equity investments provide an illusory benefit to the budget’s bottom line, but the Commonwealth is also taking equity or … risk on complex projects – meaning that risky investments' in marginal projects will likely never be repaid; … … … 1. The IFU should not be established. That is what was said. And what this government did was take $17 million out of the construction budget administered by the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development to fund bureaucrats at the high end in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. They actually reduced the money that was intended for road and rail infrastructure in order to fund this unit. That is a solution looking for a problem. There is not a lack of financing available in this country for good infrastructure projects; what there is a lack of is a pipeline of projects and proper planning for projects. One of those projects in which there is not a problem is the Cross River Rail. On 30 April 2013 I received a letter from Scott Emerson, the then minister in Campbell Newman's government. Campbell Newman confirmed on TV on Monday night that this was a project that was absolutely ready to go and that the details had been sorted out thanks to Infrastructure Australia and thanks to negotiations between the two levels of government. There was a five-point plan, confirmed in writing minister to minister by Mr Emerson. The letter said:  the Project will be delivered largely through an availability payment Public Private Partnership; It goes on about equal capital contributions of $750 million each. It goes on about funding the availability payment stream for the PPP component of the project on a 50-50 basis for the duration of the concession period. It committed the Queensland government to funding rail operating expenses for the project. It said:  the project will be delivered through a PPP commercial vehicle and financed by private sector equity and debt. That is exactly what some of those opposite, who think they have discovered these things called 'value capture' and 'public-private partnerships', do not seem to understand-that it was happening and it got stopped in the 2014 budget, just like the funding and agreements for the Melbourne Metro got stopped before that budget. It is quite farcical that the government has established this unit, which will not be able to achieve anything at all, and is establishing a rail fund asking for bids when projects that were approved by Infrastructure Australia five years ago and funded in a budget four years ago remain unfunded due to this government's intransigence. (Time expired) number of the matters that have been raised by parliamentary colleagues this afternoon. I will first address the comments made by the member for Tangney in relation to the Perth Freight Link. The member is not here anymore-he has had to go to another commitment-but I do want to acknowledge his outstanding advocacy for the Perth Freight Link project, a project that was identified by Infrastructure Australia as a high-priority project addressing national connectivity. Infrastructure Australia ranked this project as a high-priority project, and the Turnbull government therefore committed significant funding to it. It would have delivered, as the member rightly observed, very substantial benefits for people in the southern suburbs of Perth, particularly freight traffic moving efficiently to and from the port of Fremantle. The incoming Labor McGowan government in WA unfortunately succumbed to the desire to chase Green votes, which is such a disease which infects Labor governments and Labor oppositions around Australia. We have seen this very disturbing trend. We saw it in Victoria, where the incoming Labor government abandoned the East West Link project, ultimately ending up costing Victorian taxpayers over $1 billion. They did that in a desperate attempt to protect two inner-city seats. We saw a similar pattern occurring with Perth Freight Link, with the incoming Labor government abandoning that project-again, in a desperate attempt to win Green votes. In fact, we almost saw it last year in the lead-up to the federal election when the member for Grayndler, who claimed previously to have been a supporter of WestConnex, performed an extraordinary backflip under pressure from the Greens in his own seat. To the ABC in 2014, he claimed credit for $1.8 billion of funding that his government, when they were in government, allegedly had committed to the Perth Freight Link. Two years later, he told ABC Radio the precise opposite. He said, 'We provided $25 million for funding and we never provided any substantive funding.' That was an amazing backflip and part of a regrettable pattern all around the country. The Labor Party really are not interested in providing better transport solutions for hard working Australians in middle-ring and outer-ring suburbs, because they are so desperate to contest the votes of the latte sippers and try to get those votes away from the Greens. Unfortunately, the interests of hard working Australians are sadly abandoned. I repeat for the benefit of the member for Tangney: there is a commitment that this government has made contained in this budget. There is a contingent liability of $1.2 billion in this budget for the Perth Freight Link. Should any future Western Australian government",231,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
239,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield,"Minister for Urban Infrastructure) (16:59): I will address awish to build the Perth Freight Link, we stand ready to fund it with $1.2 billion. That is why there is a contingent liability in this budget. We heard from the member for Lyons, who made some assertions about the nature of infrastructure projects in his electorate and, indeed, in Tasmania. PerhapsI could remind the member for Lyons that the Turnbull government is contributing $260 million over the first five years of the 10-year $400 million Midland Highway upgrade program. PerhapsI could remind the member for Lyons about the $24 million commitment to the Hobart airport roundabout, the Highland Lakes Road upgrade, the Glen Road upgrade, the Industry Road upgrade, the Soldiers Settlement Road upgrade, the Cove Hill Bridge upgrade, the Saltwater River Bridge upgrade, the Bass Highway-Wynyard intersection upgrade, the Bridport western access road, the Bass Highway-Westbury Road intersection upgrade, the Bass Highway, and the Cooee and Wynyard planning money-there are a very substantial range of commitments in Tasmania by the Turnbull government. The member for Lyons is, sadly, misinformed. The member for Mackellar expressed his strong interest in the National Rail Program. I commend him for that. I look forward to the opportunity, in a later contribution, to expand in more detail on that very exciting program. it is my view that the interjections were too loud during that contribution and I will intervene in future if that continues. a lecture on latte sipping and working-class values from the member for Bradfield. I want to talk about a lack of initiatives in the budget that will lead to employment growth and economic growth, particularly in southern New South Wales, the area that I represent and that you also represent, Madam Deputy Speaker Bird. It is a matter of deep disappointment when you look south from Sydney. It is almost as if these ministers do not understand that there are parts of New South Wales that exist South of Sydney. I am talking in particular about some key projects that would make an enormous difference to the region. I have long advocated for them and you have long advocated for them, Madam Deputy Speaker, but there is no funding for them within the budget. I would like to hear from the minister about whether there is a possibility that these projects are going to be funded. In the Illawarra, I am talking about the Maldon-Dombarton rail link. The member for Grayndler would recall that, when Labor was last in government, $60 million and a line item in the budget were set aside to ensure that this project could get up and running. We knew at that time-as we know today-that there was significant private sector interest in forming a public-private partnership or going into partnership with the government to ensure that this project is built. Those on the other side of the chamber who pretend to represent regional Australia understand that this is an important project not just for the Illawarra and surrounding regions; it is absolutely critical if we are going to have a more efficient and effective way of getting grain and bulk commodities from western New South Wales into one of the best deepwater seaports in Australia. My question to the minister is: is the government going to fund this project? Has the government been working with the New South Wales government to ensure that this project can get up and running? The second project that I want to talk about is one that we were leading the way on. In fact, we were encouraging the government to match our commitment. Of course, I am talking",233,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or

241,Mr Stephen Jones (Whitlam) (17:04,"It is always a matter of rare enjoyment to copabout the Nowra Bridge project. Before the budget, Labor made a commitment to put $50 million into the Nowra Bridge project to ensure that the bridge is built. We were hoping that this would excite and coerce the government into putting money of their own into the budget to ensure that this project is built. But, once again, the people of Nowra and the people of the Shoalhaven have been let down. I can only assume that they do not have a strong, local advocate in their party room who is going into bat for this project. In fact, if you look at the record of the member for Gilmore over the last term and a half, the biggest capital works project in her electorate has been the upgrade of her electorate office. I am sure that is very good, but the people waiting in queues on the highway as they attempt to cross that bridge want to get the project built. They want to see the bridge built, and we encourage the government. We ask the minister: will the government match Labor's commitment to ensure that this bridge is built? In the time that I have left I will also ask a question about Regional Development Australia. We know that last year the minister received a review into the structure and operation of Regional Development Australia. We know that the minister has had a copy of the recommendations from Mr Warwick Smith's review for at least five months. We are well beyond the deadline when that review was going to be published. We see that within the budget there is $74 million over the forward estimates for funding of Regional Development Australia. My third question to the minister is: what is the plan for Regional Development Australia? When will the review of Regional Development Australia be published so that RDAs throughout the country can get on with the job of putting together plans for the economic development of their regions and putting bids to government and to the private sector to ensure that those regional development plans can be put into action? this place and speak in some detail about what this government is doing for infrastructure around the electorate of Forde and its surrounds, particularly in regard to the M1 merge at Eight Mile Plains, one of the great projects that is occurring to upgrade the M1. It is being very well received by the electors of Forde and also the electors of Bonner and Rankin and those further south. To the minister: I know this has been a long time frame and a long piece of work, and I am pleased to say that we finally got to a resolution on this matter, as well as for the project on the Gold Coast, in the electorate of the member for McPherson. It is part of an overall package for the budget. Importantly, I would like to ask the minister this. As I said, I am very pleased that these projects are proceeding, but I would be interested to know what else we are doing in the infrastructure space. I would like the minister to elaborate somewhat on this particular project and how that is going to roll out and on our commitment to other infrastructure in Queensland, which is extensive. Also, what hurdles still remain for further funding to finish off the remainder of the M1 project? Ms McGOWAN (Indi) (17:11): Good afternoon, everybody. It is lovely to have you here. I would also like to welcome two of my constituents into parliament today, users of the northeast railway line who have a great interest in the outcome. It is lovely to have you here. Minister, the questions I have to ask are about the north-east line and in particular about the $100 million allocated in the budget. There is nothing about this other than great gratitude.",234,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
242,Mr Van Manen (Forde,"Government Whip) (17:09): It is always terrific to stand inThe people of north-east Victoria want to say thank you and how much we are looking forward to that money flowing. My first question is: when? When can we expect the plan and the beginning of works? The next question is about the relationship with Victoria. Can you please tell usAn honourable member interjectingMs McGOWAN: Yes. Will Victoria pay? How much will they pay? Who will pay first? And will it be enough? There are some other questions I need to ask, other than when the commencement date is going to be. Will you ask New South Wales to pay, because we know that the XPT also has enormous trouble with our line? Last time. I was talking to the customer service people on that XPT, they showed me the bruises up and down their arms from being bumped around on the train line. The next question is: who will ultimately be responsible for delivering the project and the expenditure? If it is Victoria and New South Wales and the Australian Rail Track Corporation, who actually takes responsibility? One of the big problems we have had in the past is that no-one has actually accepted responsibility, so the poor old communities got stuck with poor service, and everyone else was not saying who should be responsible. In terms of the plan for the $100 million, can you give us a broad outline of the types of work that are needed and how far you think the $100 million will go? Is your intention to spread it across the whole line, or would you consider doing a small portion and doing it really well? We know that there are sections that have really bad mud holes. Would we reconstruct the whole line and get a section of it working really well, or is the plan to go the whole distance? The questions that the community is asking are not only around the actual spending of the money but also about some sort of reporting mechanism to the community. Minister, as you know, more than anything else, this problem has become really political. In the political nature of it, I think we have lost sight of the fact that it is an engineering problem that needs a solution. We have got caught up in playing politics rather than saying: how do we solve a problem? How do we get the trains working better? And then how do we have a plan for the next 50 years that is going to give us good passenger service? Another consideration-and I would really welcome your advice-is we know the ARTC sees their main customer as freight and we understand how important it is that the ARTC raises a considerable amount of its revenue from freight, but from my perspective the passengers need to be included in that relationship. How do we have a coexisting collaboration between freight and passenger services? Can you give me some sense of the planning around that? Will that mean we need more passenger passing loops or freight passing loops? If we do-and we all know that they are expensive-how will they be paid for? That leads me to my final question about the relationship between our $100 million-it is such a lot of money and it means so much to us-and the inland freight project. These two things obviously operate together, but the community is really interested to know how these two will coexist. Can you give us a commitment that some of our money will not be used for crossings, raising bridges or doing more freight stuff? seek to respond to a few of the members opposite and the issues they have raised. The member for Mayo raised some concerns about the Building Better Regions Fund. I can confirm that the government has committed a further $200 million to the Building Better Regions Fund from 2017-18 to 2020-21, which will bring the fund to a total of nearly $500 million. It will allow more regional communities across Australia to benefit from that fund. The member indicated she had some concerns about the geographic eligibility. The program actually uses Australian Bureau of Statistics's significant urban areas of the major capital cities to determine the geographic eligibility of that program. We will seek to review the program, including that eligibility criteria, after round 1 of the funding. In relation to Regional Development Australia, the member also inquired as to the government's approach in this budget. She would be aware that in 2016-17 the Australian government provided $18.3 million to the 55 RDA committees across Australia. The committees are designed to drive economic growth in regional areas. An independent review of the RDA program commenced in 2015 and reported back. Minister Nash is currently considering her response to that review. Obviously we seek to ensure effective regional planning going forward. I look forward to the minister's response in that regard as well. The member for Grayndler raised the Bruce Highway once again. Members of the coalition right along the coast of Queensland have been extraordinary advocates for the Bruce Highway. I know the member for Capricornia, who cannot be here, is very keen on future projects on the Bruce. I will just set the record straight, because the member for Grayndler cannot help himself on this particular issue. The federal coalition government has allocated $6.7 billion to the Bruce, which is $1 billion more than Labor ever committed to the Bruce Highway. He knows that is true. He is not even interjecting on that point any more. We are delivering on every single project in the Bruce Highway package of works that we promised. We are delivering on them. In the 2017-18 budget we announced an additional $844 million would go to new projects. The member is right in the sense that a smart government operates like this: when we were achieve savings we reinvest them in additional projects on the Bruce. The Pine River to Caloundra project will remove one of the last major bottlenecks on the Bruce Highway, in one of the fastest-growing areas of Queensland. There is the Pine River to Caloundra project and the Deception Bay interchange, $11.4 million for the Wide Bay intersection and $182 million for road safety upgrades. They are all projects that Queensland MPs have strongly advocated for. I can assure the member for Grayndler that when someone goes to work on a project they are not going to say to me, 'Is that new money or old money, Minister?' They are just going to say: 'I've got a new job. I'm working here and I'm delivering a better product for the people of Queensland.' I will not be able to get through all the questions from the member for Indi-she did have quite a few-but I can assure her that my relationship with Victoria is patchy sometimes but going very well at the moment. We have had some very productive discussions in recent times. We have not reached a resolution yet on the $500 million regional rail package, but there have been negotiations since both budgets were handed down and the dust settled a bit. I had meetings with Minister Jacinta Allan in Brisbane a week or 10 days ago. We are very much focused on getting results.",235,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
243,Mr Chester (Gippsland,"Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (17:15): I willThe member correctly indicated that the people from the north-east-and I welcome your two constituents from that beautiful part of the world-just want results. They do not want to see silly political games. The $100 million that we allocated in the budget was a breakthrough in the sense that the people in the north-east have been waiting a long time for a decent rail service and this will be the start of the process. I met with the chief executive of ARTC, John Fullerton, this week and impressed upon him the importance of securing a better passenger ride experience on that line. I can indicate that Mr Fullerton has a critical role in delivering that other project we have talked about a bit tonight, the Melbourne and Brisbane Inland Rail project. The member for Indi quite correctly reflected on that that it is an important project which will require additional investment-and I stress that-in providing for the double-stacking of trains along that route into the future. So the $100 million is aimed at passenger rail investment. I want to use this opportunity to congratulate and thank my state colleagues Tim McCurdy and Steph Ryan for their fearless advocacy on this issue and also Senator Bridget McKenzie. Senator Bridget McKenzie, Steph and Tim were very active in making sure I was aware of the issues and inviting me to visit. I travelled on the line a matter of two or three months ago. I think the local community would be disappointed that I had a great experience that day! There were no delays on the day I was there. The only delay on the route was caused by a rolling-stock issue and the door would not shut at Wangaratta. It is about us investing in rail infrastructure but also the state government getting on board. There is no free ride. The Victorian government will have to invest in better rolling stock as well. and the reality from this government when it comes to actual investment in infrastructure. One of the things the government continually does is speak about the 2013-14 budget. I have news for the government: Wayne Swan delivered that budget. That was not a budget delivered by the current government, but it adds in that figure as if it was when it was in government. This time around, any analysis shows a $7.4 billion cut in actual infrastructure investment over the forward estimates. Yet the rhetoric of the government is about $75 billion. Well, sometimes it is. In the government's own glossy produced as part of the budget papers, it says it is $70 billion in infrastructure commitments. Then if you go through and have a look at the details you see $1.2 billion committed to the Perth Freight Link. But then the same $1.2 billion is listed for the Metronet rail project. That is on page 10 of the budget glossy document. However, on page 8 it says there will be $700 million going towards the Metronet rail project. So it is not clear from the budget papers themselves whether it is $700 million or $1.2 billion. And then there is the same $1.2 billion double-counted for the Perth Freight Link project. It is a bit like the Victorian circumstances where you have $1 billion and then there is $3 billion committed to the East West Link but it is the same money. It is the same contribution-the advance payment that was made from the Commonwealth to Victoria of $1.5 billion as a result of its 2014 budget. There was, further up in Queensland, $13.6 billion allegedly allocated but $844 million for the new Bruce Highway project, and we just heard from the minister that that is new money; that is a reallocation of existing funding. You see that pattern repeated throughout the budget.",237,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
244,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (17:21,"I rise to question again the gap between the rhetoricLet's look at actuals for Victoria for 2017-18 through to 2020-21. There is $791.2 million, then $568 million, then $606.3 million and then $280.7 million over the life of this budget. For Queensland $2,049 million goes down to $1,874 million, then to $1,866 million and then down to $1.652 billion in 2021. South Australia begin with $759.2 million. Then in 2018-19 they will get $434 million. In 2019-20 they will get $349.5 million. In 2020-21, they will get $95.2 million-that is the entire Commonwealth contribution for South Australian infrastructure. Then you see the great fiddles of the Inland Rail project being off-budget. A government member interjectingprovide a fix or a fiddle, pretending that it would happen. This government has stopped the project 38 kilometres short of the port, thereby reducing the cost of the actual construction of the project. Then, what they do with this project is have it all funded off budget. There is not a dollar of on-budget funding, even though John Anderson's report said that expected revenue over 50 years will not cover the initial capital investment. John Anderson said that it needed on-budget investment. That was the report to the government. It has been totally ignored. Then, we know that what they are counting is not the Inland Rail revenue; it is revenue from the whole of the ARTC. So, as a fix, they are using the profits that are made from the Hunter Valley rail network to pretend that that is the way that you finance this project. If this were a private sector operation, people would go to jail, but you, as a government entityGovernment members interjectingthat is why(Time expired) the House that my warning on interjections was for both sides. for Grayndler knows full well from his time as the minister with responsibility for NBN, it is well-established practice for the Commonwealth to make equity investments into substantial infrastructure projects. AndI do not recall the member for Grayndler describing that funding method as being corrupt-or as any of the other extravagant flourishes of language he has used now. What we have seen from the member for Grayndler, in his claims about total levels of infrastructure funding in this budget, is that he has looked at one part, a very substantial part, a very large part, of the funding that is being provided-namely, grants to states-but he has completely ignored another equally large part of the infrastructure funding in this budget, and that is the multibillion dollar commitments of equity going into inland Rail, Western Sydney Airport and, of course, Moorebank. And, indeed, we also have loan financing going from the Commonwealth government to Sydney Motorway Corporation to underpin WestConnex. This reflects a clear policy approach from the Turnbull government. We are providing funding and financing in a range of ways, and the total amount that we are putting into infrastructure is greater than ever before. In fact, over the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years, average spending was a little over $6 billion. Between 2013-14 and 2020-21, the figure, as we have informed the community, will be around $8 billion.

It really does not advance the cause when somebody as experienced in infrastructure policy as the shadow minister wilfully turns his eyes away from one significant part of the form in which that funding and financing is provided. Let me now respond to the contributions made by the members for Mackellar and Fisher, who expressed significant interest in the National Rail Program-and for very good reason. This is a commitment by the Turnbull government to commit $10 billion to funding rail programs and rail assets around the country. We know that major rail lines are city shaping. They are transformational. They have an enormous impact on the functioning of our cities and on the functioning of the regional areas around our cities, which, of course, form part of an integrated economy with our major cities. We have people living in Geelong or in Ballarat commuting into Melbourne. We have people living in the Blue Mountains or on the Central Coast commuting to Sydney. We have people on the Sunshine Coast or the Gold Coast commuting to Brisbane. Our $10 billion National Rail Program is available to fund transformational rail investment within our major cities and also to deliver improved connections between our major cities and surrounding regional areas. I want to commend both the member for Fisher and the member for Mackellar for their strong interest in these programs, their strong advocacy and the encouragement which they are already expressing for their respective state governments to come forward with proposals under this program. We want to encourage proposals coming forward so that we can allocate this funding in the most effective way possible to encourage the provision of transformational rail infrastructure in our major cities and between our major cities and surrounding regional areas. I commend those members for their advocacy in relation to their areas. It is exactly the kind of competitive energy that we want to encourage through this program. We want to see the best ideas coming forward. We have included a $20 million commitment to co-fund up to three business cases in relation to faster rail links between our cities and surrounding regional areas, part of an overall integrated approach to infrastructure in this budget, which involves record financial commitments for nation-building infrastructure all around the country, in the cities and in the regions, providing support from the federal government for the delivery of vitally needed infrastructure. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Consideration in Detail Communications and the Arts Portfolio Proposed expenditure $2,427,440,000 rise in this consideration-in-detail debate regarding the budget appropriation bills in the communications portfolio. The Turnbull government's 2017-18 budget contains great outcomes for the Australian broadcasting sector, for those who love Australian arts, entertainment and sport, and for Australian families. Funding measures and policy announcements outlined in the May budget will further augment innovation and competition in our communications sector. They will provide much needed reform of the media and broadcasting industry, and they will continue to support participation in Australia's artistic and cultural life.",239,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
249,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield,"Minister for Urban Infrastructure) (17:32): I am pleased toThe government will provide the portfolio with $13.2 billion to deliver its priorities through the 2017-18 appropriations bills, combined with prior year appropriations for the NBN. In 2017-18, funding will contribute equity and a short-term loan, totalling $10.7 billion, to take the National Broadband Network rollout to 75 per cent completion by the end of the financial year. A combined total of $1.3 billion in funds will also be appropriated for our national broadcasters-the ABC and the SBS. Close to half a billion dollars will be provided to our national collecting and cultural institutions to engage, educate and inspire the hundreds of thousands of local and international visitors who will flock to our galleries, museums and archives in the coming year. And $664 million will be appropriated for the Department of Communications and the Arts and the Australian Communications and Media Authority to make our communications and media sectors work in Australia's interest, to ensure access to diverse Australian content and to foster Australian arts and culture. Funding will continue to flow to rounds 1 and 2 of our highly successful Mobile Black Spot Program-of course, an area that saw egregious, complete, continuing, absolute and shameful neglect by Labor for six years. How much money did Labor spend on mobile blackspots in their six years in government? They spent zero. And why is that? It is because the Labor government and the Labor Party have no interest in regional Australia. They are utterly and completely shamelessly indifferent to the communications needs of regional and remote Australia. There has not been one dollar for mobile blackspot communications from the Labor Party in six years in government. What a shameful record, but it is a record that, by contrast, we have been working to correct. We have been working to roll out, with great success, new mobile base stations around the country. children from gambling advertising, to modernise and assist our broadcasting sector and to recognise the changing media landscape, which has affected the way in which Australians consume content. The government has listened to the community. We are taking action to protect Australian children from regular exposure to gambling advertising during live sporting programs. This budget has seen an announcement of the government's intention to abolish broadcasting licence fees, providing fee relief of around $127 million a year-helping to level the playing field so that Australian broadcasters can compete in the modern media environment and continue to tell high quality Australian stories. In its place, the government will charge broadcasters a new fee for the spectrum they use of around $40 million, which is much more reflective of its value. The government is continuing to support the development of Australian drama, children's programs, documentaries and other content by commissioning a joint review of the current regulation and funding framework. Our content review will identify policy enhancements that will ensure the ongoing production of Australian and children's screen content for domestic and international audiences, regardless of platform. There are adjustments to modernise the antisiphoning scheme. There is funding of $7.5 million a year, over four years, to increase the coverage of sports that currently receive low or no broadcast exposure and it provides funding to replace advertising revenue that the SBS has been unable to realise without legislative change.

Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) (17:37): On 11 May The New York Times warned the rest of the world about this government's second-rate NBN. The title for the article was: 'How Australia bungled its $49 billion high-speed internet rollout.' The article went on to say, in relation to the Prime Minister's broadband plan, that it has been: …hobbled by cost overruns, partisan maneuvering and a major technical compromise that put 19thcentury technology between the country’s 21st-century digital backbone and many of its homes and businesses. Meanwhile the rest of the world has been moving towards fibre. In January Ovum declared that 2016 had been a tipping point for fibre deployment. They noted the business case for FTTP had improved dramatically with costs falling significantly across the globe. The UK is now exploring plans to expand fibre deployment to 10 million premises and British Telecommunications are reported to have halved the cost of FTTP deployment in their rollout trials. New Zealand has a blossoming fibre network and its own space program. It has brought down the costs of fibre deployment by 44 per cent. Meanwhile, here we are, stuck with a $49 billion second-rate copper NBN. This government's digital transformation agenda has collapsed before our eyes, and consumer complaints about the NBN soared over the 201516 period. Through all this the government has stood by and watched on as a spectator. Our constituents are fed up with the broken promises, the missed appointments, the dropouts and the blame shifting, which have characterised their experience since moving to the NBN. The 2017-18 budget will provide $7 million in funding for the implementation of a speed monitoring program. Labor welcomes this announcement and considers the program can help ensure consumers are better informed to make choices about the services they purchase and the factors which impact on their speeds. I was disappointed, but not surprised, to learn the ACCC proposed the broadband speed monitoring program to government in the week commencing 15 February 2016. That is right, last year. This was their evidence to the NBN joint standing committee. Fourteen months has elapsed since February 2016. Why has this sensible step taken so long? Why did the government and the minister sit on this for 14 months? Ms MARINO (Forrest-Chief Government Whip) (17:40): As the minister is aware, I am extremely committed to children being as safe as possible online. I have delivered hundreds of cyber safety presentations and have worked closely with the minister, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, on the establishment of the Office of the Children's eSafety Commissioner. I note that it is the 10 year anniversary of the death of Carly Ryan. It is one of the instances that I have frequently quoted the young people and parents as a reason why impersonation online is such a critical issue and why young people should never go to meet in person people they have met online. As we know, Carly was only 15 when a young man by the name of Brandon Kane, who claimed to be 18, wanted to be her friend. Over time Carly believed that she loved Brandon, because of the communications they shared and how interested he was in her and the things that mattered in her life. Over that",241,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
252,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Bird,"For the benefit of those who have joined us, I willtime, a gentleman claiming to be Brandon's father asked to come to Carly's party, and then made some pretty obscene comments to her. Of course, when he left it was not long before Brandon got back in touch with Carly and said, 'I need to make this up to you. I need to meet you.' Carly eventually gave in and went to meet Brandon Kane at Port Elliot. Unfortunately, there was no Brandon Kane, there was only Garry Francis Newman, a 50-year-old online sexual predator and paedophile. Of course, Carly still would not do what he wanted, so in the end he assaulted her, he shoved her face sand and he drowned her. This is a case that I repeatedly talk about when I talk to young people and parents. The reason I am so concerned is that in every class I do young people have the courage to admit to me that they have been to meet people in person whom they have met online. In one class I had seven 11-year-olds who admitted this to me, which significantly scared the teacher and their parents. Even more importantly, the youngest person's mother contacted my office after one of the presentations I did to say that her 11-year-old daughter, after listening to my presentation, realised that she was being groomed online for sex-at 11. I have a very deep commitment in this space, Minister, which you are very well aware of, and I have worked with you on this for some time in this place. Minister, could you explain how families, teachers and schools are using the resources and services provided by the Office of the Children's eSafety Commissioner? Could the minister explain the importance of the Criminal Code Amendment (Protecting Minors Online) Bill, which I spoke about today, and the process the government is using the develop civil penalties for online image based abuse? statement on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2017-2018 the minister posed the question: how much money did Labor spent on mobile black spot programs? It is a very good question with which to open these proceedings. The answer to that question is $250 million, slightly more than the government is currently spending on its mobile phone black spot program, but it was more targeted and it was not used as a political slush fund. Madam Deputy Speaker, you would know that unless you have backhaul cable that is connecting a mobile phone tower to the rest of the network, those towers you build are just poles in a paddock. They are not connecting a network and they are absolutely useless. This is a fact that appeared to be lost on the minister opposite when he asked how much money Labor spent on a mobile phone black spot program. The answer is $250 million, and a hell of a lot of the towers that they are now funding could not have been built unless Labor had put the Blackall cable into the ground. That is a fact that is lost on these guys. My questions go directly to the Mobile Black Spot Program, which has been roundly condemned by independent economic and probity analysts. First it was the Australian National Audit Office, which, in its damning report into round 1 of the program, highlighted serious flaws in the design and the administration of the program. As if that were not enough, it was then followed by the Productivity Commission's December report into the universal service obligation, which, on page 266, said: … the Commission is concerned that there is a risk that Australian Government funding is directed at expanding mobile coverage in locations for political reasons rather than to locations where overall community well-being might be better served.",242,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
253,Mr Stephen Jones (Whitlam) (17:43,"In his rhetorical flourish opening hisYou would have thought after reading both of these reports and having the sirens go off that they responsible government would have heeded the warning. This is round 1, seen to have been corrupted by a political process, with round 2 in danger of repeating the very same mistakes. So, at the Senate estimates hearings last week, you can imagine our surprise at the answer we got when we asked the department and the minister responsible for administering the scheme whether they had adopted the recommendations of the ANAO, whether they had learnt from their mistakes and whether there would be a transparent competitive process for round 3 of the program. What was the answer? The answer was no. They are repeating all of the same mistakes that had been made in rounds 1 and 2 of that program, the same mistakes that had been roundly criticised by the ANAO and by the Productivity Commission. In April 2014, you told the listeners to ABC Ballarat this about the program when it was first announced: 'It will be obviously necessary to prioritise and make sure that the money we have that we allocate to areas is to the areas of greatest need.' My question to the minister is: what has changed? Why are you now not using a transparent and independent program for round 3 of the program? Why have you not learnt from the damning findings of the ANAO report and why will you do not implement the recommendations of those reports to ensure that mobile phone towers are built in the areas of the highest need? The shadow minister and I have highlighted a number of areas in regional Australia which have been subject to bushfires and other natural disasters and have put in very compelling bids for funding under this program but have been overlooked time and time again. I highlight the advocacy of the member for McEwen for mobile phone towers in his electorate in those areas subject to the Black Saturday bushfires for which reports and community organisations have said a phone tower would have made the difference. Why are they not funded? Why will the minister not learn from these previous reports? want to turn to the remarks from the member for Whitlam. The fundamental fact about government programs to support increased mobile coverage in regional and remote Australia is that in six years Labor did absolutely nothing. They did zero because they just do not care about regional Australia. Then the shadow minister had the temerity to put out a media release which contained this laughable statement: Labor's policy on mobile black spots is to place a far greater emphasis on a fair distribution of funds across a fairer spread of electorates. I will tell you what Labor's policy on mobile black spots is. It is to do nothing. The only honest statement of Labor's policy on mobile black spots would be: Labor's policy on mobile black spots is to spend six years doing absolutely nothing. The best the shadow minister can come up with is a few selective quotations from an ANAO report. Here is the bit that he forgot to quote: The department established the key elements that would be expected to form part of a competitive, merit-based grants programme … It was very selective quotation. That is all he is good at. I say to the member for Whitlam: when you go to regional towns all around Australia, as I have had the privilege of doing, and meet with people, they are desperate to have mobile coverage for all of the safety benefits it provides and for all of the convenience benefits it provides-because, as they rightly say, increasingly in modern society people assume that",243,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
254,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield,"Minister for Urban Infrastructure) (17:48): First of all, Iyou have a mobile phone. When you deal with your bank, your insurance company or a government department, they just expect that you will have mobile coverage. The critical thing is to take the money that is available and leverage it to the maximum extent possible and deliver as much as you can further dollars, and that is precisely what we have done. For $100 million of taxpayers' money in round 1, we delivered 499 base stations. The Mobile Black Spots Program is rolling out all around the country. We are seeing, under both round 1 and round 2, an extensive rollout of mobile phone base stations. This is a program which the coalition is very proud of because it is changing lives every day. It is an extensive rollout of mobile base stations that would not be there but for this public policy program initiated by the coalition after Labor did nothing. For six years, Labor did nothing. Government members interjectingForrest has been an extraordinary champion, and that is the question of children being as safe as possible online. The Turnbull government established the Office of the Children's eSafety Commissioner. Because of the work of the Commissioner and the office's staff, thousands of Australian children are much safer online. It has been a significant journey getting to this point. The online safety working group was established when the coalition was in opposition, and it worked extensively with experts around the country. We drew extensively on expert input and advice. The member for Forrest has done such extraordinary and consistent work in this area. As a result of that policy work in opposition, we established the Office of the Children's eSafety Commissioner and the Enhancing Online Safety for Children Bill was passed into law. Since June 2015, the office has had over 3.3 million visits to its website. Of course, the work in this area simply continues. The Minister for Justice recently introduced the Criminal Code Amendment (Protecting Minors Online) Bill 2017, which is a reflection of the government's strong commitment to preventing harm to children both in person or online. Such harm, including sexual exploitation of children, is of course devastating for the children involved, their families and their communities. The introduction of this bill follows the tragic case involving Carly Ryan, which the member for Forrest explained to the House this afternoon. This is a vitally important area, and the Turnbull government is working very effectively in this area. minister's side, in their great enthusiasm, no doubt, actually drowned him out and forced the no doubt reluctant minister to have to yell his response. Keeping the volume of enthusiasm down a bit would be helpful, I would suggest. Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) (17:54): Minister, I would like to talk about Australia Post. It is charging more for services such as delivering letters but it is slowing its time for delivery. It has also just recently changed the clearance time for street boxes in regional areas. I note that one of these regional areas is where my electorate office is in Mount Barker. I will say that that area is considered rural and regional for health purposes but is no longer considered regional when we are talking about the Building Better Regions Fund, despite it being one of the fastest-growing inland regional areas in Australia. However, I digress. How will this affect delivery times for regional and rural areas, which are already at a disadvantage for the delivery of mail, when compared to metropolitan areas?",244,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or

256,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Bird,"I point out to the House that members on the Minister, in relation to the Mobile Black Spot Program, round 2 closed early last year, as you are aware, and successful applicants were announced late last year. There is a significant inequity in the allocation of funding under the Black Spot Program across the electorates. Mayo only had two successful bids, whereas the electorate of Grey received 13 and the electorate of Barker was allocated just five. Can the minister please explain the reasons behind the inequitable allocation of funding? Will the program be extended to address all priority sites? Surely, the minister does not think that mobile phone coverage in regional Australia is complete. If he does, I will advise that on a drive from the north of my electorate to the south, on the mainland part of my electorate, I drop out at least 10 times on the main arterial routes. Mobile battery backup on our mobile towers during outages and emergencies is an area of immediate concern for my electorate. During the summer storms over the Christmas period we suffered lengthy power cuts. What be realised was that those of us who were on NBN fibre to the node no longer had a landline. After four hours, the mobile phone tower batteries died. This meant that people in my community had absolutely no way of communicating with authorities or with each other. In areas of high risk for bushfire, in which category is the majority of my electorate, we need to have some sort of surety that we can at least use our mobile phone towers. Power is cut deliberately in a high-risk bushfire areas on days of catastrophic risk. We need the minister to address this essential service, because without the internet, without a landline and without mobile phone towers, we are beyond vulnerable. I would like the minister to address that this evening, please. is a beautiful electorate and it has a range of different ways in which people can live. They can live in suburban built up areas, they can live on the beautiful Hawkesbury River and they can live in the rural areas of the electorate. The geography of the electorate presents beautythere are hills, valleys and the river-but it also presents challenges. I have found that the people who choose not to live in the suburban areas of the electorate, particularly people who live on the river or in rural areas, choose to live there for a range of different reasons. Some have lived there for generations. When I was visiting the Sackville North fire brigade, recently, I met John Turnbull, who is a distant cousin of the Prime Minister, who goes back to the time of Lachlan Macquarie and the settlement of Ebenezer, which is in the electorate of Macquarie. There are some people who have lived there for generations. There are some people who love the rural lifestyle, who want to have a river experience. There are some people with large families who live there. There are some people who like to have privacy, the privacy of not living on top of the person next to you is a great benefit of my electorate. Despite the fact that my electorate starts only about 40 kilometres from the CBD, it often feels like you can be at the back of beyond, because, while Berowra has its suburban areas, its rural areas are no different to rural areas in other parts of Australia. They are rural areas, particularly, because their geography makes mobile telephony and mobile coverage a real challenge. Those of us who rely on mobile phones, and so many of us do now, take mobile phone usage for granted. We need mobile phones for calls, for texts, to check the internet, to check emails and to use apps, and we need them for family life and for businesses. Many of the people who live in the rural areas of my electorate in their own businesses. Many of the",245,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
257,Mr Leeser (Berowra) (17:57,"I am very lucky to represent the electorate of Berowra. Itpeople who live in the rural areas live in bushfire prone areas, and we need mobile phone coverage, particularly for emergency services. The black spots in mobile phone coverage arise because of the patchwork of coverage in the vast landscape in my electorate and the particular geography of the electorate. As Australians continue to embrace this technology, we need to ensure that people have a life and have a level of communications technology that can assist them, regardless of where they live. I want to pay particular tribute to the minister at the table here today, Minister Fletcher, who was absolutely central in bringing on board the Mobile Black Spot Program. The Mobile Black Spot Program has been a great boon to people living in regional areas and in outer suburban areas like mine that have particular geographical challenges. In contrast to speeches from those opposite, we have invested seriously in addressing mobile black spots. I have to say that, other than the issue of roads, mobile black spots are probably the second most important issue-the second most frequent issue-that people raise with me when they come to see me in my electorate. Residents in the north-west of my electorate have chronically poor mobile phone coverage. People in towns like Sackville North, South Maroota, Glenhaven, Maraylya and Forest Glen might live in one of the most beautiful parts of the electorate, but it is a very difficult part in terms of mobile black spots because of the particular landscape of that area. Those homes are often connected by a thin network of sealed and unsealed roads. As you follow the river along, you get wonderful things like the ski resorts, the caravan parks and the Supercross tracks. On my recent visit, which I mentioned, to the Sackville North rural fire brigade, it was clear to me how poor mobile coverage interferes with the work and the lives of local residents. A driver needs to know that they can get to a particular scene if there is an accident. A family need to know that they can make a call if a powerline comes down or their home is damaged in a storm. A patient with a medical emergency needs immediate contact with an ambulance, and the ambulance must be able to reach them. Even when you have a bar or two of reception, in the summer months and around Easter, peak demands spurred by tourists and extended families can keep locals stuck in queues trying to get their share of the signal. A new mobile phone tower for Sackville North was granted funding in the first round of the Mobile Black Spot Program. I understand there are three candidate sites for the tower and that a final decision about that site has not yet been made. So my question to the minister is: when will the tower be constructed, and when will it be brought on line to deliver coverage to my constituents? beat his chest about how good he is and how good the government is. In the context of telecommunications and service delivery in the north of Australia, he has been absolutely absent. I might say that a recent issue which brought the community's attention to the lack of interest by the government in people who live in my communities in Lingiari, and indeed the Northern Territory generally, was the decision by the ABC to shut down short-wave radio. This issue was not seen at all by the government for a long while. We had no participation from the Northern Territory CLP senator around this issue, but it was something which drove a lot of energy through the pastoral community of the Northern Territory-a community",246,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
258,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (18:02,"I have listened to the minister stump and thump andwhich is very important to the economy of the Northern Territory and, indeed, the economy of Australia in terms of live cattle exports. It was raised by truck drivers across the Northern Territory, who used short-wave radio regularly. It was raised by fisherpeople in the Northern Territory who used the short-wave radio service. It was raised by ranger services in the Northern Territory who used this range of services. It was raised by people who are travellers in the Northern Territory who relied on those services. Indeed, the response from the ABC was less than informative because, in the first instance, we were told that they consulted widely. We learnt later from Ms Guthrie, in evidence to the Senate, that in fact there had been no prior consultation with the communities of northern Australia around the proposal to cut the short-wave radio service. They said that, in its place, the VAST service would work, and that would be able to be utilised by people in the bush. In fact, of course, the VAST service is only useful if you are stationary, and people who relied on the short-wave service were travelling. I say to the minister that it was a shame that there was no interest taken in this subject by the government. What we have seen, in response to the ridiculous assertions made by the ABC and the mismanagement of this process by the ABC, is that Mr Jay Mohr-Bell, a cattle station manager outside of Katherine, dismissed the ABC's view by saying: The ABC fails to understand that their audience who listens to local ABC via shortwave do not 'favour' this service, this is their only available service. He told The Guardian: The ABC likes to be heard but fails to listen. Essentially the ABC is closing down the shortwave service and replacing it with nothing. Minister, you may see this as something which is of no interest to you, but it is of great interest to the people of Lingiari and, indeed, the people of northern Australia generally. It typifies a lack of interest by your government in people who live in my electorate. I give you the example of a barramundi farm in Humpty Doo. Humpty Doo Barramundi is the largest barramundi farm in the country and one of the most successful farms of its type in the country. It is halfway between Darwin and Kakadu in Humpty Doo on ANZAC Parade. It does not have effectively any telecommunication services. This is a commercial operation that is at the forefront of its industry and it has a lack of telecommunication services. This is the responsibility of you and your government and yet nothing has been done for them. Most importantly, Minister, I find it hard to believe that you could look past this decision by the ABC to cut this shortwave service in the Northern Territory and not request they do something to replace it, because there is nothing in place at the moment that can replace this service. I am wanting to know how much was set aside in the budget to ensure that the people I have referred to-the cattlemen, the fisherfolk, the tourists and the residents of northern Australia who have relied on these shortwave services-are not punished for the coalition's savage cuts to the ABC? How much has been put into the budget to ensure they have a replacement service that is actually effective and works? a number of comments made by the member for Greenway in relation to the NBN. I thought it might be informative to look at the number of premises that were ready for service in the electorate of Greenway as at 9 September 2013. When Labor left government it was about 10,000. Today it is over 46,000. How many were connected when Labor left government? It",247,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
259,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield,"Minister for Urban Infrastructure) (18:06): Let me addresswas not 10,000 and it was not 1,000; it was 237 people. There were 237 people connected to the NBN in the electorate of Greenway when Labor left office and today there are 32,000 premises. Whitlam is another interesting electorate and another interesting case study. There were 871 ready for service on 9 September 2013, when Labor left office after 4½ years of supposedly delivering the NBN. They had managed 871. How many are ready for service in Whitlam today? Remember that there were 871 when Labor left office. How many are ready for service today? Seventy-two thousand. The number connected in 2013 was 54 and today it is 35,000. The member for Greenway also asked about the broadband monitoring program. I welcome her generous, open-minded support for this program. This is an important program. Indeed, on 7 April this year the Turnbull government announced a commitment to funding $7 million for the Broadband Performance Monitoring and Reporting Program. That funding will go to the ACCC to implement the program. Of course, the ACCC is well placed to manage this program, given its role in enforcing the Competition and Consumer Act. The program will be funded on a cost-recovery basis from industry via the annual carrier licence charge. Carriers will be required to contribute to the cost only if they are providing broadband products over the NBN. The broadband monitoring and reporting program to be carried out by the ACCC and funded by the Turnbull government is a very important initiative. I thank the shadow minister for her interest in the program. I was asked some questions by the member for Mayo about the Mobile Black Spot Program, rounds 1 and 2. The Mobile Black Spot Program was structured so that applications were made on a base-station-by-base-station basis and ranked in accordance with the guidelines. One of the factors which weighed on the rankings was the amount of money contributed from other sources, including state governments, the telcos themselves and private sector contributors. That meant that this was a very effective way to leverage the Commonwealth taxpayer contribution to maximise the outcomes. It is the case, unfortunately, that the South Australian government committed no money at all to support round 1 and only $1.5 million to support round 2. While we welcome that, the reality is that that was materially less than most other state governments. As a consequence of that, 20 mobile blackspots were funded in South Australia in round 2, of which two were in Mayo. I would encourage the member to take that matter up with the South Australian government, but it is pleasing that it has been possible to fund two base stations in Mayo, and I hope there will be further opportunities in the future. The member for Berowra asked about the Sackville North tower and gave, I thought, a very good explanation of the value of the Mobile Black Spot Program and the benefits that that can deliver to communities which do not have adequate mobile coverage at the moment. He spoke at some length about how important the role of the local Rural Fire Service is in Sackville North and described his visit to that important location. I want to thank the member for Berowra for his interest in the Mobile Black Spot Program. He asked about progress on that tower, and I can advise the House that construction of the Sackville North tower is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2017 and, subject to planning approval from council, to be online by Christmas. Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) (18:12): I would like to ask about some of the arts elements in the budget. Unfortunately there was not a lot a lot of mention of the arts, but we have questions. We have seen the actual amounts to be returned to the Australia Council in this year's budget and across the forward estimates from the closure of Catalyst and the transfers of the Major Festivals Initiative and the Australian World Orchestra. From those figures can you update the amount of uncommitted funding-in total and over each of the four years from 2017-18, year by year-available to the Australia Council to support the really important small-to-medium arts sector? Has the final round of Catalyst been completed? If not, when will that occur, when will announcements be made and how much of those uncommitted funds over the forward estimates have been or will be expended on the final round of Catalyst? I also want to ask about national institutions. Members will have seen reports this week that, despite small amounts of capital funding for national institutions, there are collections at risk from prolonged cuts. CPSU researchers have looked into this. Years of budget cuts have heaped pressure on staff and limited public access to collections. The report in The Canberra Times shows that they have made it harder to acquire and preserve items, slowed the efforts to digitalise historical documents, and put artefacts at risk of deteriorating. Can the minister explain why he has neglected the national institutions and, as reported in The Canberra Times, ripped out $30 million from museums, galleries and libraries since 2013? I would also like to refer the minister to the expenses under the arts and cultural heritage subfunction, which are estimated to decrease by 2.6 per cent in real terms from 2016-17 to 2017-18 and by 12 per cent in real terms over the period 2017-18 to 2020-21. This subfunction includes programs that support funding for the arts and cultural institutions. The estimated decreases reflect the implementation of efficiencies and arts related savings measures from the 2014-15 budget, the 2015-16 budget and the 2015-16 MYEFO. So with cuts of this nature affecting the long-term sustainability of the arts sector, what is the minister's overall vision for the arts, and how is he planning to remedy this double-digit cut in arts support that has been engineered entirely by this government? They are the questions that I would like to ask on the arts, and, if time allows, I would like to turn to questions on the NBN specific to my electorate. The budget claims high-speed broadband in regional areas is a key priority. But in my electorate of Macquarie, we have been condemned to complete chaos on NBN delivery with a mishmash of fibre to the premises-put in under Labor-satellite, wireless, fibre to the node and fibre to the curb. How is this budget fair when residents in the lower Blue Mountains suburbs like Glenbrook, Blaxland and Springwood and in parts of the Hawkesbury like Wilberforce are entitled to fibre to the curb, while residents in the upper Blue Mountains at Blackheath, Katoomba and in the Hawkesbury's Mcgraths Hill and Freemans Reach are relegated to outdated copper from the node to homes? How is it fair that Grose Vale has some homes that will have FTTC, some that will have FTTN, and others that are due to have fixed wireless? How is it fair that Pitt Town has some residents that have fibre to the premises, some that will get fibre to the node eventually, and others that will have fixed wireless? Where is the fair nationwide approach when there will be fixed wireless in Maraylya but satellite in Colo Heights? In many parts of my electorate, when the power goes off and the fibre to the node NBN goes down, there is no mobile phone communication. People have no way of communicating during an emergency and this is creating great fear amongst many in the community. What is in this budget to ensure that, in a bushfire-prone area like mine, people will be able to reliably access mobile communication when the power goes off? And what is in this budget to address a whole bunch of issues that have come up in the upper Blue Mountains? Community radio station Radio Blue Mountains in Katoomba has been trying to get fibre to the premises. They have been quoted nearly $150,000 by NBN, and they are in the CBD of Katoomba. Speeds are not matching the promise. What steps are the government taking to reduce the coexistence issues while ADSL and NBN are both using a single copper line? We have properties that are missing out at the moment because of long length of copper. What are you doing to fix that? (Time expired) announced a landmark package of comprehensive media reforms. This package of reforms will strengthen the protections for families and for children in relation to exposure to gambling advertising, provide substantial financial relief to enable the broadcasting sector to adapt to a changing landscape, and recognise the changing consumer viewing patterns for high-quality Australian content. I am particularly pleased that this is a package that seeks to preserve and enhance the viability of Australian media organisations who are under threat from foreign tech giants. I also note that tonight, CEOs of every major Australian entertainment company are here in Parliament House supporting this package. It is indeed a major achievement, unheralded in my lifetime, that a government has come up with a media reform package that has the support of every single major media player in Australia. I am sure that you will agree that this is a package that is unabashedly pro-Australian media, proAustralian voices and pro-Australian stories. We as a government have listened to community concerns about the impact of gambling on children who just want to watch live sport for the thrill and love of the game, not be exposed to odds and other gambling advertising. From my perspective, I know my constituents will welcome the further gambling advertising restrictions in this package as a community dividend from these comprehensive broadcasting reforms. As you know, Minister, the package will also provide relief for broadcasters by abolishing the cumbersome broadcasting fees charged to free-to-air networks from the bygone era when they occupied a dominance in the market, replacing them with a spectrum charge more appropriate to their use of terrestrial broadcasting spectrum. Further, the government proposes to abolish the two-out-of-three media ownership rule and the 75 per cent reach rule to reflect the current state of the market and allow media organisations to configure themselves in the way they see fit. Important protections against too much concentration of ownership will remain in the form of the 5/4 independent voice rule, the one-to-a-market rule for television, and the two-to-a-market rule for radio. I have on a number of occasions heard the Labor Party, and, in particular, the Member for Greenway, be critical of the government's media reform proposals. Labor said the original proposal to reform just the ownership rules was piecemeal. They called for a comprehensive approach. My understanding is that whilst the previous proposal was important and enjoyed the support of most of the media industry, the government has now put forward a very comprehensive and holistic package. It contains the abolition of licence fees, a new spectrum",248,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
260,Mr Falinski (Mackellar) (18:17,"Minister, as you know, the Turnbull government hascharge, changes to the anti-siphoning scheme and list, further restrictions on gambling advertising in live sportcritical changes to restrictive ownership rules that are holding Australian companies back. The government has also announced a review of the Australian and children's screen content and a $30 million package of support for the broadcasting of women's, niche and underrepresented sports. It is a very comprehensive plan-the only comprehensive plan in town, and it enjoys the support of the entire media industry. Minister, you would think Labor would welcome this package and support it through the parliament. But, no, Labor say they have a problem with it. So what is their comprehensive plan? David Crowe reports in The Australian today that the member for Greenway told caucus they would support a standalone bill that just dealt with the 75 per cent reach rule. Can you believe it! Labor call for comprehensive reform and their policy is to support a bill with just one single change to one ownership rule-it beggars belief. Minister, if you are looking for a comprehensive reform plan for Australia's media industry, who would you rather take advice from? On the one hand, there is Seven, Nine, Ten, Prime, WIN, Southern Cross Austereo, Foxtel, News Limited, Fairfax and the commercial radio industry. They are unanimous in their support for the Turnbull government's plan and have called for it to be passed in its entirety. Or, on the other hand, there is the member for Greenway and her plan to do very little and let Australian companies wither and die. This is the Labor approach to policy-score cheap political points, no matter the cost to jobs, livelihoods and children watching sport. Minister, can you explain why the Turnbull government's plan is so comprehensive and holistic? How will it ensure the ongoing viability and strength of Australia's critical media industry? What support does it enjoy from industry? What alternative comprehensive and holistic plans for media reform are you aware of? Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) (18:22): Could the minister please advise the House how he and the member for Mackellar voted a couple of months ago on an amendment to the Interactive Gambling Act, which dealt with the very issue of banning gambling during live sports? Secondly, with reference to the communications portfolio, can the minister advise how many pieces of government legislation this government has passed and which have received assent in the 45th Parliament, aside from the amending legislation to give effect to the 2016-17 budget measure on licence fees? number of issues that have been raised. The member for Macquarie asked about Catalyst funding. In March this year, the minister announced the transfer of the majority of funds from Catalyst to the Australia Council. This will see a transfer of approximately $61 million in uncommitted funding over four years transferred to the Council from 2017-18, restoring the Australia Council's funding to a similar level as it stood prior to the 2015-16 budget decision. The Major Festivals Initiative and funding for the Australian World Orchestra will also transfer.

All current Catalyst funding agreements will be honoured and all applications received for Catalyst funding by 18 March 2017 are being assessed under the existing guidelines. I was also asked about the national institutions. The Australian government is committed to supporting our national collecting institutions through the Public Service Modernisation Fund, and $48.5 million over three years commencing in 2017-18 is being directed to our national collecting institutions for capital works, the delivery of public programs and services and to develop shared services, capabilities and efficiencies. This funding is in addition to $16.4 million over three years commencing 2016-17 provided under the Public Service Modernisation Fund announced in December 2016 to support the National Library of Australia and its highly successful Trove program. I was also asked about NBN in the electorate of Macquarie, and I can inform the House that in 2013 the number of people connected after Labor's 4½ years of chaotic and disorderly mismanagement of the NBN was 269. It now stands at 16,000, and the number of premises ready for service in Macquarie is 32,000. While there is more work to do, the position has improved out of sight in the time that the coalition have been in power, as compared to the chaotic, disorderly mess that we inherited from the Labor government. Talking about chaotic and disorderly messes, let's turn to Labor's answer to the question of how as a nation we ought to deal with the phenomenal and fundamental forces of change which are sweeping through the media industry. The media industry is undergoing extraordinary change. Broadcasting, television and radio are subject to competition from global internet players that do not face any requirements for Australian content. This industry is undergoing an extraordinary amount of transformation and it is very important that there can be a competitive response to it. What is the shadow minister's careful and deeply thought through policy response? The shadow minister's careful and deeply thought through policy response is to put her head in the sand and pretend that the changes sweeping through the broadcasting sector are not occurring. She pretends that the unanimous view of companies right across the broadcasting sector and the media sector in Australia-an unprecedented degree of unanimity-is not happening. She is not prepared to engage with the comprehensive package that the minister has brought down: protecting Australian children by banning gambling advertising; undertaking a wideranging and comprehensive review of Australian and children's content; abolishing broadcasting licence fees for television and radio, allowing broadcasters to better compete with other media platforms; introducing a price for the use of spectrum by broadcasters that better reflects the value of Australia's limited spectrum resource; and some adjustments to the anti-siphoning scheme. Of course, this is a comprehensive package that includes the removal of outdated rules: the two-out-of-three rule and the 75 per cent reach rule. The media sector is unanimous in its support for these measures, this integrated package to help them remain competitive. Unfortunately, the shadow minister has her head in the sand and is trying to pretend that these comprehensive changes to the sector are simply not occurring. This government is engaging with reality even if the opposition, tragically, is not. and I am going to ask the minister to commit to responding to this question directly instead of avoiding it by taking a question from one of his own MPs. The question goes to satellite",252,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
264,Mr Stephen Jones (Whitlam) (18:27,"I am going to keep this question very shortprovision of NBN. There are consumers from households all throughout regional New South Wales who are deeply concerned about the performance of this government in rolling out the NBN through the Sky Muster service, including unreliability of service; over 60 towns being forced onto satellite, as opposed to the previous rollout plans that had them on wireless; consistent dropouts; problems with services; and unreliability. Will the minister commit to a full, independent inquiry into the operation of Sky Muster and will he commit to that today? years of chaotic mismanagement of the NBN, we hear this ludicrous suggestion from the shadow minister. The frank reality is that the rollout of the NBN has been transformed since the coalition government came to power-in every aspect. We inherited chaotic mismanagement from a government that had absolutely no idea what it was doing, and across all fronts-fixed line, fibre to the premises, fibre to the node, fixed wireless and satellite-the performance has been comprehensively transformed. The numbers are rising very sharply, with some five million people now able to connect. The numbers were in the order of a few hundred thousand when Labor left government. We inherited a staggering record of incompetence and mismanagement. We have systematically and steadily turned that around. How have we done that? We put in place a competent and experienced chair in Ziggy Switkowski. We put in place a competent and experienced management team-people who actually have experience in the telecommunications sector. What a good idea! They are led by Bill Morrow, who has led Vodafone in Australia and Vodafone businesses all around the world. We have got on with systematically delivering a rollout to meet the needs of Australians. Of course there is more work to do, but the rate of progress has absolutely transformed since the chaotic mess that we inherited from the Labor government. SoI will not be accepting helpful suggestions from the shadow minister, because Labor has an extraordinary track record of incompetence in this area. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Consideration in Detail Attorney-General's Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $3,053,744,000 for Counter-Terrorism) (18:31): The proposed expenditure for the Attorney-General's portfolio reflects the fact that this has been a very challenging year for the agencies within the portfolio, not least, of course, because we have been dealing with a security situation globally that has significantly deteriorated, and as a result we have had a very significant deterioration in Australia's global security as well. We have been reminded of this, very sadly, just recently, with the handing down of the Lindt coronial findings in response to the Martin Place siege, which occurred several years ago, and the atrocious Manchester bombings at the Ariana Grande concert that, quite barbarically, targeted teenage girls in particular going for a fun night out. We have had an arrest of a 22-year-old woman in South Australia on terror charges, the appalling slaughter of Coptic Christians in central Egypt, three police officers killed in Jakarta and, just overnight, the shocking news that a 12-year-old Australian girl was killed in a suicide bombing in Baghdad-quite amazingly, when she was going to get ice cream after the sun went down to break her Ramadan fast.

266,Mr Keenan (Stirling,"Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Ministertargeted by these barbarians. I would like to pass on my sincere condolences to the Al Harbiya family during what must be an extraordinarily difficult time for them. It is these incidents that make the government extraordinarily resolute in what we are required to do to make sure that Australia is, as much as possible, immune from this threat. We consider national security to be our highest priority, and that is what we have been focused on within this portfolio over the past year. Since coming to government, we have given our law enforcement agencies and our intelligence community very significantly enhanced powers as well as significantly enhanced resources, with $1½ billion, which supports our efforts in combating terrorism and strengthens their ability to provide law and order for our country. In just this budget, we have invested $321.4 million extra with the Australian Federal Police. This is the largest single investment in the AFP's domestic capability in a decade. We have tripled the investment that goes into countering violent extremism-it is now $45 million since we have arrived in office-and we have recently invested $13½ billion to strengthen national counterterrorism arrangements with the states and territories through training, exercises and purchasing of specialist equipment. Importantly, we have passed eight tranches of unprecedented counterterrorism and national security legislation through the parliament. I acknowledge that that has been done in a cooperative way with the opposition-and it is fitting, of course, that in this parliament we have a bipartisan approach to issues of the utmost importance such as national security. A key element of the reforms introduced by the government is the new offence of 'advocating terrorism'. It is very clear that the threat of a five-year jail sentence has meant that some of the groups that have been advocating quite abhorrent behaviour in Australia have been silenced. The AFP has advised me that as a direct result of this legislation a number of people who have previously been quite active and vocal in this space have ceased their activities. We have also modernised the ability of our agencies to collect intelligence. We have strengthened the control order regime, which can regulate people's behaviour. This can be particularly important for breaking up groups of people who might be getting together to engage in behaviour that would be against our national security. We have reduced the arrest threshold for terrorism offences. This is incredibly important because it allows the police to move in earlier when they have information that people might be planning to do the wrong thing. We have introduced new offences that make it a crime to enter a declared area, such as Al-Raqqa or Mosul. If we can prove you were in those declared areas and you have committed a prima facie offence we can prosecute you for that, unless you have a reason for being there. Most recently, in conjunction with the states, we have done a regime of postsentence preventative detention, which means that if somebody has been convicted of terrorism offences and has served their sentence but has not been rehabilitated and still poses a threat to the Australian community, we will continue to detain them. We cannot offer blanket protection from terrorism, but all of these measures have made Australia significantly safer. (Time expired) inquire about this government's completely unacceptable treatment of ASIO's directorgeneral, Duncan Lewis. Last Thursday, in a late-night Senate estimates hearing, One Nation senator Pauline Hanson tried to have Mr Lewis confirm her prejudiced views about refugees.",254,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
267,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs,"Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (18:36): I rise toWe know what Senator Hanson was trying to do. We know that she was trying to fan the flames of prejudice and fear in our community. We know that she was trying to spread false claims about refugees. What we got in response from Duncan Lewis, the director-general of ASIO, was, as you would expect from a man of Duncan Lewis's stature, a very measured and very sensible response. This is what Mr Lewis said: I have absolutely no evidence to suggest there is a connection between refugees and terrorism. That innocuous and straightforward answer earned Mr Lewis days of criticism from rightwing commentators, and, if that were not bad enough, days of criticism from government backbenchers. All of that criticism was completely unjustified and, of course, as Mr Lewis made clear in a radio interview this morning, because he has had to come out himself to deal with this, he was never suggesting that there are no cases of refugee involvement in terrorist attacks. He was saying that there is no link between being a refugee and being a terrorist. That is the way we need to approach all such matters of national security: by looking at the evidence and stating the facts. Yet Mr Lewis was torn apart as if he were saying something completely different, and senior members of this government, including the Minister for Justice and the Attorney-General, stood by and watched. It is a disgraceful performance. This is a former major general in the Army, a former ambassador to NATO, the former secretary of the Department of Defence, and the man who now, as head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, has helped to keep Australians safe from 12 major terrorist attacks-and this is the treatment he gets! This government has had many undignifying moments and this was one of them. It is not the job of the director-general of ASIO to pander to prejudice and to say what the tabloids want him to say. It is his job to tell the truth, and that is what he did. It took until today-that's right, nearly a whole week-for the Attorney-General to come out in support of Mr Lewis. This is Mr Lewis, who is the director-general of ASIO, who is receiving all of the intelligence that is collected by ASIO and is reading that intelligence, and I know who we should be trusting on matters of national security and it is certainly not these government backbenchers, let alone the right-wing commentators who come out to attack him. We have yet to hear a peep from the Minister for Justice, who, I assume, in the course of his work as the Minister assisting the Prime Minister on Counter-Terrorism, deals very closely with Mr Lewis. Why won't this government stand up for senior public office holders? Why did it take so long for the Attorney-General to stand up for a man we all rely on to keep Australians safe, and why has the Minister for Justice said nothing at all? Is it because these ministers are so scared of their own backbench that they can no longer see straight and cannot defend the truth and cannot defend the plain speaking and sensible words of the director-general of ASIO? Truly, this is an Attorney-General who has so completely checked out of his job and is so busy packing his bags for London that he has completely abandoned his duties and his ability to defend his most senior public servants. This is a government that pretends it is conservative, but it has a terrible record of defending institutions that it is meant to respect, particularly when it comes to the Attorney General. This year it is ASIO and last year it was the Solicitor-General who came under direct attack from the Attorney-General, just for trying to do his job. That was a disgraceful episode which showed the Attorney-General's contempt for the law and its institutions and his inability to handle those who disagree with him. One could go to the disgraceful treatment of the president of the Human Rights Commission, but I do not have time. My questions are these. Why did it take so long for the Attorney-General to defend Mr Lewis? Why has the Minister for Justice not said one single word to defend Mr Lewis? When will this government start to respect the truth? When will this government start to respect the integrity of government institutions and the people who run them? publishers here in the House tonight, Sally, a very happy birthday. I ask the minister to update the chamber on the Turnbull government's announcement to support the community legal sector by providing an additional $55 million in funding over the next three years. Mine is a capital city seat, so I have a fair number of community legal centres around Brisbane and they provide an important role in giving access to legal advice and ultimately justice for many people, particularly vulnerable people. The community legal centres around Brisbane include the Women's Legal Service, the Youth Advocacy Centre, Basic Rights Queensland, the LGBTI Legal Service, the Brisbane Family Law Centre in Albion, the Legal Advisory Service in Fortitude Valley, North Brisbane Legal Services, Caxton Legal Centre and many more. I went through that list because you will be able to see from some of the names on that list that there are some strong areas of specialist support provided by those community legal centres around Brisbane-for example, for women, families and other vulnerable groups. I note that because I understand that the new money, the additional $55 million of support for the community legal centres is intended to prioritise victims of domestic and family violence. It is for front-line services and it will be delivered via state governments, of course. It is proudly being provided by the Turnbull government on top its other historic commitments to protect Australians from violence. Notably, there is the $100 million Women's Safety Package and the $100 million Third Action Plan. I want to note how many community legal centres from the list above would have a client list that either directly or incidentally supports the victims of domestic or family violence. On the weekend, I visited the Brisbane Trans Fair Day at the New Farm Neighbourhood Centre. I spoke with the LGBTI Legal Service there and I also spoke to the crowd at the official opening of the fair. I mentioned this extra funding for the community legal centres, and I spoke about the need to start to raise awareness and actually deal with the long hidden problem of domestic and family violence within the LGBTIQ community. AfterI spoke, a couple of people came up to me and told me quietly and matter-of-factly about how domestic violence was a big issue in the LGBTI community and how they had suffered personally as a result of it. SoI hope that the LGBTI Legal Service can benefit from the extra funding being committed to community legal centres by the Turnbull government. I hope that the Women's Legal Service and many of the other community legal centres I listed from across Brisbane can benefit as well. I note that for a few months there was some nervousness from some community legal centres and their supporters about whether the level of funding from the Commonwealth would continue to increase. These are tight fiscal times after all, and not all worthy causes and government agencies are being funded or getting funding increases. I suspect the minister may well want to touch on that topic, given that these extra funding commitments of $55 million that I am asking about will actually mean that the Turnbull government is delivering record funding, compared to every former government, to the community legal centres. It is important to note also-the minister may choose to expand on",255,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
268,Mr Evans (Brisbane) (18:41,"I would like to start by wishing one of our Hansardthis-that the states and territories do remain the principal funders of legal assistance in Australia, given most of the court proceedings in Australia are conducted in state and territory courts and under state and territory laws. Lastly, I hope that the minister may expand on where specifically some of the $55 million of additional funding may be directed, given the government's stated preference and intention for the extra assistance to be received by the victims of domestic and family violence. Further on the subject of law and order, I would like to ask a second question of the minister, that he update the chamber on how the government's Safer Communities Fund is improving community safety and supporting crime prevention in areas in my electorate like the Brisbane CBD and Fortitude Valley. The minister will recall I am sure visiting me on the campaign trail to discuss projects to help improve community safety and to boost crime prevention measures in Brisbane. The projects that I committed to under the Safer Communities Fund are intended to help local businesses, venues, shops, councils and other stakeholders more easily report and share information about crimes with the police, as well as to respond more quickly to incidents and even to prevent crimes from occurring in the first place. It is all about utilising the great investments that many local businesses, venues and the council have already made in things like CCTV, ID scanning and other crime preventions, and about maximising the benefits of those investments by making sure that the benefit of all that information flows to the police and everyone else who can use it. The safer communities program is extremely important to Brisbane, as the minister may also talk to, because the increased attention on crime prevention will lead to more jobs. (Time expired) Ms O'NEIL (Hotham) (18:46): I will begin my questioning to the minister tonight with a quote: Clearly, if you are going to cut resources-if you are going to cut the number of personnel in our agencies-it is going to hamper the ability of law enforcement agencies to do their job. Can anyone guess who this is? They sound like words of a man who goes to the cabinet table and successfully argues for an increase in funding and an increase in staff to his relevant agencies. But what I will be asking the minister about today is the savage cuts that have been made to the Australian Federal Police, including an extraordinary 151-person reduction in personnel over the next year alone. I ask the minister: what affect is this going to have on law enforcement? It is critical that when the minister addresses this point he talks about the extraordinary dishonesty that came with the announcement that was made in the day before this year's federal budget. On8 May this year the Minister for Justice and the Prime Minister stood before the Australian people and announced what they described as 'an additional $321 million in funding for the AFP and an extra 300 AFP personnel.' I was really happy, because it is really important that we properly fund the AFP. But what I was shocked to discover the following day is that the budget actually shows the complete opposite. It shows a cut to overall funding to the Australian Federal Police over the forward estimates and it shows a reduction in the personnel of the Australian Federal Police of 151 people to the next year alone. Despite this fake announcement of $321 billion, the AFP is actually losing funding, and it will get worse in the coming years. I am glad that we have the shadow Attorney-General here in the chamber, because he has raised a very important point. There is a lot of political argy-bargy that goes on in this building, but it is not just Labor who is talking about the impact of these cuts. In fact, in Senate estimates last week and at the National Press Club today, we heard the AFP commissioner stand up and say that there is a reduction in resources going to this organisation. I will provide the quote to the minister in case he was not paying attending during the announcement. The commissioner said, 'The forward estimates show that our total resourcing levels will go down.' The AFP commissioner today was right there in the Press Club, in front of the Australian people, admitting that this so-called boost to the AFP is actually a reduction in funding. Will the minister apologise to the Australian people for misleading Australians about the funding that is provided to the Australian Federal Police? When the government cut funding to the Australian Federal Police last year, the Australian Federal Police commissioner was asked in Senate estimates what areas would be impacted by the cuts. On 28 February 2017, the commissioner identified the areas that he was going to cut as a result of the government's cut to the AFP budget. He talked about organised crime, he talked about drug work and he talked about fraud. These are extraordinarily important national priorities, yet, due to the minister's inability to argue for increased funding for one of his most critical agencies, these are the things that will be losing resources. My second question to the minister is: given that the government is cutting $184 million over the forward estimates from the AFP, could the minister please confirm which programs relating to organised crime, drug work and fraud will be cut? I notice that the minister is getting very agitated at some of the things that I am saying. I point out to the minister that these are not my words. I am quoting the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police in Senate estimates and at the National Press Club. I will turn to the issue of staffing, because this is incredibly important in a resource intensive organisation like the Australian Federal Police. Again, I draw to the attention of the parliament the fact that this minister stood in front of the Australian people and committed to funding for an extra 300 police, yet the budget shows in absolute black and white that there will be a reduction of 150 personnel in the AFP over the next year alone. My third question to the minister is: could the minister please explain the discrepancy between his dishonest announcement and what is actually in the budget? It is not only cuts to the AFP that we are concerned about. The Australian Federal Police Association have been working very hard to get an appropriate pay rise for their members. They have talked to us a lot about their concern about the attrition rate, in addition to the personnel cuts. I would like the minister to address this point in his statement. Finally, I say to the minister: we began with a statement from you about your commitment to fighting for funding for this organisation. I ask you: given you have cut resources and the number of personnel from the AFP, do you agree that you are hampering the ability of this law enforcement agency to do their job? for Counter-Terrorism) (18:51): I will try to deal with these issues in turn. I will start by dealing with the sensible contribution that was made by the member for Brisbane. I thank him for his keen interest in law and order issues. I would be very pleased to go to visit him in his electorate and go down to talk to his constituents about what they require from the Commonwealth government in terms of law enforcement resources.

269,Mr Keenan (Stirling,"Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Ministerwith him to make sure that we are doing all that we can to keep his patch in Brisbane as safe as possible. The member for Brisbane asked about the record investment that we are making in legal assistance services. I am very pleased to inform the House that in April this year my colleague and friend, the Attorney-General, Minister Cash and Minister Scullion announced that a further $55.7 million would be injected into the legal assistance sector over the next three years. That is $39 million to community legal centres and $16.7 million to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services. This is in addition to existing funding, including over $1.6 billion provided under the National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services. It represents the largest ever Commonwealth investment in legal assistance services on an annualised basis and a record Commonwealth commitment of over $1.7 billion over five years. The budget builds on this government's earlier initiative of $45 million for frontline legal assistance and family law services provided through the 2015 Women's Safety Package and the Third Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children. This funding completely fixes the 'Dreyfus cliff' and reverses the 2013 MYEFO savings measure. The 'Dreyfus cliff' made up a majority of the reduction in funding expected by community legal centres from 1 July this year. For the last two decades, the Commonwealth's focus in legal assistance has been on Commonwealth criminal matters, Indigenous legal assistance and complex family law matters, generally involving family violence. Accordingly, the national partnership agreement, another Turnbull government legal assistance funding initiative, ensures that the Commonwealth funding is appropriately targeted. We make no apology for not emulating the ad hoc funding approach that was so beloved by Labor. Labor was content to provide one-off funding to services, apparently selected by reference to little more than past practice. It was for the coalition government to establish an objective, evidence-based funding allocation model, moving to ensure that those most in need of help received it. can hardly hear myself speak. am going to let this slide, and I will give a reminder to everybody at the end of it. You are eating into your time, so I would suggesthas treated addressing family violence as an urgent national priority. The very first decision of the Turnbull cabinet was to approve the $100 million Women's Safety Package, of which $15 million was allocated for frontline legal services. There is more I could say about that particular issue, but I just want to quickly turn to the member for Brisbane's question about the Safer Communities Fund which we have established as a result of an election commitment. We committed $40 million to that at the last election.

Very quickly, I will turn to the issues that were raised by other speakers. The shadow Attorney-General asked me about the Director-General of Security. I would agree with his assessment that Mr Lewis is a very distinguished and well-regarded Australian public servant. Of course, the government has worked very closely with the Director-General of Security, who has done a tremendously good job providing leadership, in conjunction with the leadership provided by Commissioner Colvin of the Australian Federal Police, in keeping the Australian people safe. The shadow Attorney-General says that I have not said anything about this, but there have been three question times in the House of Representatives since these comments were made and the shadow Attorney-General has never taken the opportunity to ask me about this. I would have been very, very happy to talk to him about the professionalism of ASIO and how important ASIO has been in keeping the Australian people safe and to support the Director-General of Security, as I am very happy to do here in this chamber today. (Time expired) tracking multiple conversations in the House. But the minister is guilty of this as well, so let's not start picking out sides here. Ms BUTLER (Griffith) (18:57): Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon, as you are very well aware, there is a grave concern in this country when it comes to family law proceedings, particularly in the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court of Australia, in situations where domestic violence is alleged and, as it is in many family law cases, where accused perpetrators are able to personally cross-examine their alleged victims during proceedings. This is an opportunity for retraumatisation and revictimisation of people who have fled domestic violence situations at home. In order to deal with this issue, the courts need to be armed with the power to prevent parties from personally cross-examining their exes. There also needs to be a means by which to ensure that parties can then go and get a lawyer to perform the cross-examination on their behalf. Without that second limb, obviously there is a grave risk of the denial of natural justice. Remember, these are allegations at this stage-they are not proven-and it is very important that parties be able to indirectly, through a lawyer, cross-examine each other should the need arise in order for natural justice to be afforded. So you need two things: the court to have the power to refuse people being able to personally cross-examine their ex and the court to be confident that the person who has been refused the right to personally cross-examine their ex will be able to get a lawyer. That requires law reform. It also requires legal aid funding to ensure that the legal support is available for both parties. Of course, if one person is getting a lawyer, you do not want the other one left unrepresented, as so many parties are in the family law courts. The Productivity Commission, way back in 2014, recommended reform to allow the courts to prevent the personal cross-examination of alleged victims by alleged perpetrators of family violence in family law proceedings. This is policy that Labor took to the last election. We took to the election a commitment that would equip judges with the power to make orders preventing the personal cross-examination of victims by their alleged perpetrators. We also made a funding commitment of more than $40 million in additional funding for legal aid so",260,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
274,The Deputy Speaker,"I might just have a little word to all parties. It is difficultthat courts could be confident that the parties would be able to get the representation they would need in order to avoid the denial of natural justice. This is a reform that has been called for, as I said, by the Productivity Commission but also by Women's Legal Services Australia, former Australian of the Year Rosie Batty, Fair Agenda and many other people. It is an important reform and a really common sense one to provide permanent protection for family violence victims and survivors in the family law courts. We recommitted to this policy back in November 2016 on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, which is of course also White Ribbon Day. I was very pleased on budget night when the government announced that it would commit to cross-examination reform to prevent the personal cross-examination by alleged perpetrators of victims; however, I was surprised to note that there was no accompanying funding commitment to enable additional legal aid to ensure that people would not be left unrepresented and to prevent the denial of natural justice. Accordingly, I have some questions for the minister. How will the commitment from the government be facilitated? How will the government ensure that persons who have been refused the right to personally cross-examine the other party in family law proceedings are nonetheless able to have the other party cross-examined by a lawyer? How will they ensure that there will not be any denial of natural justice to either party in those proceedings? When can we expect to see the release of the proposed amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 that were foreshadowed on budget night? Finally, will the government make a commitment to fund additional legal aid for parties in this situation or does the government expect existing legal services to absorb the cost of this additional representation? concerned many members of my local community. The tragic events that we have seen in Manchester, Jakarta, Stockholm and Nice have shown that terrorists will not restrict their attacks to the largest Western capitals. There is, it would seem, no corner of the globe that these terrorists do not consider a target. Though we must not surrender to irrational fear, it is a fact that regional communities, like mine on the Sunshine Coast, are at some risk, just like our capital cities are. I understand that Australia's national terrorism threat is currently set at 'probable'. This means that our security agencies have credible evidence that individuals or groups have the intent and the capability to commit a terrorist attack in Australia. Indeed, tragically, since that threat level was set in September 2014 we have seen four such terrible attacks. The 2014 Lindt Cafe siege has rightly received a great deal of attention in recent days, but we must also remember the stabbing of two police officers in Endeavour Hills in that same year and of a man in Minto in 2016. We should also remember the brutal murder of Curtis Cheng in 2015, who was an innocent public servant killed outside his workplace. These attacks, along with those in Nice, Paris and Manchester, among others, show us that, although these terrorists prefer to target government institutions and famous landmarks, they are more than willing to make indiscriminate attacks on ordinary people as they go about their daily lives. Any large crowd, any place where people congregate, has become a potential target for an attack. The main threat that faces Australia is exactly that kind of attack from individuals or small groups.",261,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
275,Mr Wallace (Fisher) (19:01,"Recent terrorist attacks all over the world have rightlyThese so-called lone wolf attacks use simple and widely available tools to commit their violence, things like knives and cars that we all use every day. With these simple tools, with a simple plan and no need for coordination with others, these attacks can be difficult to detect and disrupt. Until the attack begins, a terrorist planning such an attack may not do anything of any great concern to authorities or give any clear signal that they mean to commit us harm. The recent Manchester bombing has shown us that large-scale coordinated and complex attacks remain a real possibility. These coordinated attacks require particular knowledge and skills. Sadly, however, these skills can be all too readily acquired. They cannot act alone and they cannot pick up the required abilities in the ordinary course of life. These acts of terror are more difficult to plan, but the impact of a large-scale, coordinated attack on multiple targets is devastating. They must be avoided. That is why I believe our continued resolute involvement in coalition efforts in Iraq and Syria must be maintained. We must deal with these larger-scale attacks at their source. PeopleI have spoken to in my electorate tell me they are particularly concerned about the threat posed by Australian individuals who have chosen to travel to Syria and Iraq to fight with jihadist groups. Around 200 Australians have made this ill-judged, foolish and unlawful journey. I understand that as many as 76 Australians may already have been killed. My constituents are concerned that those who remain will pose a serious threat if they returned to this country. Unfortunately, the twisted and violent ideology of groups like Islamic State and al-Qaeda continues to appeal to a small number of people within our borders. Worse, these groups use the internet and social media to target our young and most vulnerable. In Australia we are seeing ever younger people being radicalised by this evil internet propaganda, and we are seeing that process increase in speed and intensity. The threats from terrorism are varied and complex. Extremists seek to frighten and divide us just as much as they seek to cause us physical harm. Our first and most important line of defence is a passionate commitment to upholding our shared values. However, people in Fisher have told me that they expect to see our defence forces, security agencies and border protection agencies receive everything they need to protect our community and our shared Australian values. Our first priority must be to keep Australians safe. I therefore ask the minister: what is the Australian government doing to keep Australia and Australians safe from the risk of terrorism? portfolio, but my question is to do with terror, not terrorists, and not homegrown terrorists but terror in the home-the terror that can come when love turns to hate, especially when children are involved. Minister, the family law system in Australia is in crisis. Judges, legal practitioners, frontline service providers and families have all been calling loudly for better resources in the Family Court-calls that have not been heard by the Attorney-General. There are currently five judicial vacancies in the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court. These are funded, budgeted positions that are not filled, despite the backlog on dockets continuing to grow like Topsy. The 2017 Turnbull budget announced $12.7 million to establish parenting management hearings, a vague announcement that has caused much confusion in the legal fraternity and the general community, especially for the member for Corangamite, who is the chair of the",262,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
276,Mr Perrett (Moreton,"Opposition Whip) (19:06): I am aware of the minister'sSocial Policy and Legal Affairs Committee, which is conducting an inquiry into family law. What will parenting management hearings be like? The Attorney-General, in his $12.7 million media release after the budget announcement, described parenting management hearings as being a: … forum for resolving simpler family law disputes between self-represented litigants. However, during Senate estimates, the Attorney-General said he wanted to deal with 'the most difficult and intractable of those matters that come before the family law system'. Just yesterday the member for Corangamite, in a committee inquiry, said that she 'assumed that parenting management hearings would not include contested matters'. Here is a tip, Member for Corangamite: if they are not contested, they have agreed, and they would not be there in the first place. In his media release the Attorney-General said that: … those managing the hearings will run inquiries and gather evidence to inform their decisions. The description in the budget paper says that: PMHs will be given powers to make binding determinations … However, during Senate estimates, Senator Brandis said that determinations will need to be embodied in a consent order. So we will have determinations and we will have consent orders. This Attorney-General really could not organise a rock fight in a gravel pit, that is clear. If the determination of this parenting management hearing needs to be embodied in a consent order, before it is binding then it would be a toothless tiger. Parents would essentially have to agree with the determination after the hearing and then sign a consent order confirming that they agree. How often do you see both parents come out of a family law hearing saying they agreed with the judge's determination? Most often neither is completely happy with the decision, as the judge's focus, rightly, is on the children. It is troubling that the Attorney-General is moving children's matters away from being heard by a Family Court judge or a Federal Circuit Court judge. I am very concerned that the Turnbull government has a policy to create an alternative, nonjudicial venue for parenting disputes, a venue where it will not be a judge with experience in family law who will be making determinations. Of all the decisions judges make, surely determining how a child spends their childhood brings the heaviest burden. Why would we even consider outsourcing these decisions to anyone other than the most respected and experienced decision makers? Children have many rights under part VII of the Family Law Act; parents have none. Parents have duties and responsibilities; they do not have rights. The Attorney-General should remember this when developing radical new policies on the run. The government would be wise to reconstitute the Family Law Council, the statutory body whose mandate is to advise and make recommendations to the Attorney-General about the workings of the Family Law Act and other legislation relating to family law. Incredibly, that statutory body currently has no members, as the Attorney-General has failed to appoint any. If you want further confirmation that the Attorney-General has no interest in family law, look no further than Senate estimates yesterday, when he said, 'In other jurisdictions it is now very common practice for the court to require there to be a form of mediation before all the cost and expense of a trial is engaged on. If ever there was a system in which we ought to be doing that it is in the family law system.' It is a great quote, a great idea, in fact. In fact, if the Attorney-General looks at section 60I of the Family Law Act he will see the requirement for compulsory family dispute resolution for all parenting matters. It is unbelievable. The Attorney-General has no interest in family law and no interest in properly resourcing the family law system. Minister, have steps being taken to fill the five judicial vacancies? When will those replacement judges be appointed? When will the Family Law Council be reconstituted? How will cases be screened for suitability before a parenting management hearing? What cases will not be allowed: cases involving family violence, drug and alcohol abuse, child abuse? Will these hearings be mandatory or will parents have a choice? Will a determination be binding without having to enter into a consent order? Who will be hearing parenting management hearings? for Counter-Terrorism) (19:11): I will address the questions that the member for Moreton has asked and the contributions made by the member for Fisher and the member for Griffith. I will start by addressing the nonsense that was peddled by the shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham. I have offered her a briefing on the budget process to try and explain how it works so she can make some more-informed comments when she comments on it, but instead she insists on coming up with these nonsensical untruths about the way the budget works. I am happy to repeat it to her again. The budget works over a four-year cycle, and that is the way budgets have always worked. When we commit to a program over a period of four years, it terminates at the end of those four years. Those terminating programs are up for discussion. The Australian Federal Police will come back and talk to the government about the continuation of those measures. A very good example is the National Anti-Gang Squad. It was funded for four years, and when its funding ended we re-funded it for another four years. The shadow minister for justice continually asserts that the budget of the Australian Federal Police is somehow going down. That is complete and utter nonsense. The Australian Federal Police has never been supported in the way that it is currently: $1½ billion has been given to the Australian Federal Police and other agencies for counterterrorism measures in the most recent budget; $321.4 million extra specifically for the Australian Federal Police to increase its capabilities. The importance of that budgetary contribution announced in this year's budget was acknowledged by the commissioner in his speech today. If the shadow minister for justice wants to continue to peddle untruths, if she wants to continue to display her ignorance about how the budget works that really is up to her, but I hope that nobody will take seriously anything that she suggests. The Australian Federal Police has never been supported better than it is now. I am very happy to renew my offer to provide her with a briefing about how the budget works. I would have assumed that most members of this place would have an understanding of it by now, but sadly the shadow minister for justice does not seem to have a clue.

277,Mr Keenan (Stirling,"Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime MinisterAnyway, the Australian government takes very seriously the issue of family violence. We believe very strongly that all Australians deserve to live free from violence, free from fear and free from coercion. On 22 March this year the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs announced its inquiry into a better family law system which will support and protect those families affected by family violence. This inquiry is ongoing and it will examine how the family system protects those affected by family violence and make recommendations to the government about how that system might be improved. There have been a number of expert reports to the government on family violence and the family law system. The committee's recommendations will be avidly devoured by the government once they are made, and we will respond as sensibly as we can. The issue was raised by the member for Griffith about the cross-examination of victims in family law matters. We will soon release the proposed amendments to the Family Law Act that will ensure victims of family violence are not put in a position where they are personally cross-examined by their alleged perpetrators or are they themselves required to cross-examine their alleged perpetrators. We recognise that they are very important amendments to balance protection for victims of family payments with procedural fairness, as I am sure the member for Moreton can appreciate. In circumstances where direct cross-examination is banned, the proposed amendments will provide the cross-examination occur through an intermediary appointed by the court. This is happening in conjunction with the significant investments we have made in the family law system, including in this budget-$10.7 million for the purpose of engaging additional family consultants in family law matters, $12.7 million to establish parenting management hearings and $3.4 million to set up six new domestic violence units to provide essential services to women who are experiencing or are at risk of domestic or family violence. I apologise to the member for Fisher; I shall address some of his concerns in my next available slot.

My questions will exclusively relate to national security and counterterrorism. I will not be so presumptuous as to start lecturing the minister on terrorism 101 as he lectured our shadow minister for finance. I would assume that the minister knows his portfolio, though I am increasingly becoming aware that that is not the case. The government has repeatedly said that national security and countering violent extremism is of the highest priority. Indeed, it is something that we have bipartisan agreement on. The minister in his earlier preamble made reference to $45 million in funding for countering violent extremism. Inherent in national security and considering national security as a high priority are countering violent extremism, CVE, and prevention of violent extremism, PVE. They are very important components of that, particularly when it comes to building community capability and the delivery of services and programs to support prevention and early intervention within the scope of countering violent extremism. I want to move on to the Living Safe Together Grants Program, which was created by this government to build or enhance the capacity and skills of community organisations in countering violent extremism. I want to move on to the delivery of services through the",265,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or

These are people who in my previous line of work came to me seeking assistance for a person within their family or a friend who they believed was in the early stages of radicalisation. They were seeking assistance with early interventions, not so much full deradicalisation as removing the individual from radicalising influences, removing the radicalising opportunities from them and removing them from radicalising environments. That could be online but could be within the individual's social circle as well. The Living Safe Together Grants Program was created to build or enhance community capacity to be able to do that on the premise that there would then be a service directory for people in that situation who could then access those services in order to assist them and to assist the individual in question at the critical point when early intervention is capable of removing or diverting a young person away from the path of radicalisation. The thing is, though, that none of those grants were awarded for the actual delivery of services. I will make that point again: none were for the actual delivery of services. Of the 41 organisations that were awarded grants through the Living Safe Together program, only 13 agreed to participate in the services directory-that is, 13 out of 41. And, as was made clear in estimates last week, the funding for this grants program was a one-off and it no longer exists. It was around $1.8 million worth of funding to community based organisations to develop their capacity to deliver services for early intervention in countering violent extremism on the understanding that they would then deliver those services by signing up to a services directory. Clearly, there is a breakdown between the rhetoric of this government in making countering violent extremism a priority and its actions. The fact is that the government is neither interested in nor capable of dealing with the practicalities of countering violent extremism in Australia. It is much more engrossed in looking tough for the nightly news. So, Minister, here are my questions: What are the community-run services that are currently available to families or friends of someone who is at risk of being radicalised and requires early intervention? What funding is being provided to community based organisations and civil society to actually deliver CVE and PVE services in the community? The LST, the Living Safe Together grants program, was designed to build capacity to counter violent extremism. The grant is no longer in existence. (Time expired) Ms HENDERSON (Corangamite) (19:21): It is my great pleasure to rise and reflect on the budget commitments that our government is making in this portfolio, the Attorney General's portfolio. I want to start my contribution by reflecting on the member for Moreton's contribution. I am disappointed that he sought to misrepresent my work as the Chair of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs in the inquiry we are running into family violence law reform. I say that first of all because there is a great spirit of bipartisanship in this committee. We have worked very well together and we continue to work well together, with the first public hearing yesterday in relation to the very significant challenges for those who are affected by family violence-those who do not feel properly protected, who are victims of family violence, and who get caught up in the family law system. I want, for the record, to correct the member for Moreton's misrepresentation in relation to parenting management hearings. I remind him that anyone in the family court system is there because they are in dispute. The member for Moreton clearly does not understand that. The fact of the matter is that some disputes are capable of being resolved through mediation and at an early stage of proceedings. When that can happen, it is obviously very positive for families. But some disputes are heavily contested and may well proceed to an interim hearing and to a final hearing. I am very pleased that the Attorney-General has announced funding of $12.7 million to establish parenting management hearings in the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court. These hearings are designed to be fast, informal and less adversarial for resolving non-complex family law disputes between self-represented parties. In New South Wales, these hearings will initially take place at the Parramatta registry and they will be by way of a trial. Moving many non-complex matters into this system, we believe, should relieve wait times. Frankly, it is a very positive innovation introduced by the Attorney-General. I would hope that in running this inquiry we, as a committee, will consider a number of other innovative means through which families can deal with their disputes, particularly families affected by family violence. I commend the Attorney-General for this investment, and we look forward to seeing how this particular trial rolls out. The aspirations, of course, are that we make sureMr Perrett interjectingMs HENDERSON: AndI really do take issue with the member for Moreton's interjection. We obviously ensure that this parenting management system, which is a trial, is there to help families, something perhaps the member for Moreton has not shown a great deal of interest in, but it is something that we as a government are very interested in, and I take issue with the misrepresentation he has made. Mr Perrett interjectingMs HENDERSON: If the member for Moreton were interested in this issue he would not seek to misrepresent me and nor would he seek to interfere with the bipartisanship, and the strong bipartisanship, of the committee and the work we are doing to help families affected by family violence. I also want to put to the minister the very significant work the Turnbull government is doing in relation to counter-terrorism measures. In just over two years we have invested an additional $1.5 billion to support and strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism efforts. We know that this has resonated very strongly and positively with the Australian community. In fact, I would like to ask the minister about the eight tranches of counter-terrorism and national security legislation that have been passed since 2014, because we recognise that the agency's ability to collect intelligence, to strengthen the control order regime, to reduce the arrest threshold for terrorism offences and to introduce a post-sentence preventative detention regime are all very important measures. I commend the government's work and I also commend the work of the Attorney-General in relation to convening a particular briefing that we are going to have with the director-general of ASIO in relation to some of the ongoing concerns with terrorism in our community.

279,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs,"Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (19:26): Theoutrageous attacks on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal by the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, who seems to think he is infallible and seems to have no understanding of the magnificent role that has been played by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for more than 40 years, since it was established by the Whitlam government, during which time it has enjoyed bipartisan support. I ask the Minister for Justice why the government has not defended the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the disgraceful attacks that have been made on it not just by right-wing commentators but by a cabinet minister in this government. I will sit down now to give the minister a chance to respond to that question, and I would like to know the answers to the questions posed by the member for Griffith about funding for the cross-examination of family violence victims by perpetrators initiative, and the questions asked by the member for Cowan. for Counter-Terrorism) (19:28): In the time. I have left I will try to deal with all the contributions that have been made since my last contribution. Very briefly to the member for Fisher, I thank him for his interest in national security and counter-terrorism matters. I appreciate that he acknowledges that everything this government has done to keep Australia safe, including the record investments we have made in our agencies, the very significant powers that we have granted them, including the eight tranches of legislation that the member for Corangamite has just referred to, have provided them with the wherewithal they need to deal with the way that the national security situation has evolved in Australia, which is very different than it was even just three years ago. The member for Corangamite asked me about national security and family law reform. I have spoken a little bit about the very significant reforms that we are undertaking through the first comprehensive review into the family law system since the introduction of the Family Law Act 1976. We hope it will pave the way more fundamental long-term reform that ultimately better meets the needs of Australian families. I think it is fair to say that family law is a very difficult area and whatever we can do to improve the system will be good for all parties involved. On the question raised by the shadow Attorney-General on the AAT, I think it is perfectly appropriate that the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection would take issue with some of the decisions that have been made there. Our responsibility is to keep the Australian people safe. That is something this government is committed to above all other goals and we will continue to do what is necessary to achieve that.

280,Mr Keenan (Stirling,"Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime MinisterConsumer Safeguard Guarantee (Question No. 701) Ms McGowan asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, in writing, on 20 March 2017: Is the Minister's department going to review the Consumer Safeguard Guarantee; if so, (a) has funding been set aside, (b) what are the terms of reference, (c) when will the discussion paper be released for public consultation, (d) what plans exist for consultation with rural and regional communities, (e) will public hearings be held, (f) will consultation be done internally or by a consultant, (g) what is the timeline for consultation, (h) what plans exist for the review to interact with the Productivity Commission's review of Telecommunications Universal Service Obligation, (i) on what date will the review be completed, (j) how will the outcomes be reported, (k) when will the report be made public, and (l) will the Minister commit to presenting the final report to both Houses of Parliament. Mr Fletcher: The answer to the member's question is as follows: The Government's response to the 2015 Regional Telecommunications Review agreed that there are arguments that the current consumer safeguard regime is increasingly outdated. To assist in developing a reform model, the Government requested the Productivity Commission (PC) undertake an inquiry into the future direction of a universal service obligation (USO) in an evolving telecommunications market. The USO is a regulated consumer safeguard providing access to standard telephone services (STS) and payphones on reasonable request to all Australians. In addition to the PC USO inquiry, the Government also committed to considering the overall framework for telecommunications consumer safeguards, including what future retail level safeguards are necessary (if any) and how these are best structured, delivered and funded as well as transitional arrangements. Many of the existing telecommunications consumer safeguards are linked to the delivery of the STS. This includes, for example, the Customer Service Guarantee. Consequently, details of any broader examination of telecommunications consumer safeguards is not expected to be finalised until after the Government has fully considered the PC's final USO inquiry report as this may impact on the direction taken. Separately, the Government has proposed new Statutory Infrastructure Provider (SIP) legislation which will require NBN Co Limited, and in certain other circumstances, other carriers, to connect infrastructure and supply wholesale services on reasonable request from a retail service provider. The proposed legislation also includes a reserve power for the Minister to set wholesale standards, rules and benchmarks that the SIPs must comply with or in the case of benchmarks, meet or exceed. The Government anticipates introducing this legislation into Parliament during the Winter sittings. Perth Freight Link (Question No. 718) Mr Josh Wilson asked the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, in writing, on 9 May 2017: In respect of Main Roads Western Australia's 2 September 2016 options briefing paper for the then state Minister for Transport, Mr Dean Cambell Nalder MLA, regarding the contract award and construction approach for the Perth Freight Link (PFL), (a) was the (i) Minister, (ii) Minister's office, or (iii) the Minister's department, made aware, formally or informally, of the recommendation by Main Roads Western Australia to only proceed with the project prior to the state election in a form that minimised both the environmental damage and the sunk cost of the clearing and preliminary work; if so, was the Minister provided with a copy of the document, and (b) did the (i) Minister, (ii) Minister's office, or (iii) the Minister's department, discuss this advice, formally or informally, with the Western Australian Minister for Transport, his office, or his department; if so, did the (i) Minister, (ii) Minister's office, or (iii) the Minister's department, formally or informally provide advice to, comment on, or make a recommendation to, the Western Australian Government on how to proceed with the PFL; if so, what was it. Mr Chester: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Government worked closely with the Western Australian Government during the project development stage of the Perth Freight Link. However, specific decisions regarding what clearing works were to be undertaken prior to the Western Australian state election are considered an operational matter and were managed solely by the Western Australian Government. Perth Freight Link (Question No. 719) Mr Josh Wilson asked the Minister for Urban Infrastructure, in writing, on 9 May 2017: In respect of Main Roads Western Australia's 2 September 2016 options briefing paper for the then state Minister for Transport, Mr Dean Cambell Nalder MLA, regarding the contract award and construction approach for the Perth Freight Link (PFL), (a) was the (i) Minister, (ii) Minister's office, or (iii) the Minister's department, made aware, formally or informally, of the recommendation by Main Roads Western Australia to only proceed with the project prior to the state election in a form that minimised both the environmental damage and the sunk cost of the clearing and preliminary work; if so, was the Minister provided with a copy of the document, and (b) did the (i) Minister, (ii) Minister's office, or (iii) the Minister's department, discuss this advice, formally or informally, with the Western Australian Minister for Transport, his office, or his department; if so, did the (i) Minister, (ii) Minister's office, or (iii) the Minister's department, formally or informally provide advice to, comment on, or make a recommendation to, the Western Australian Government on how to proceed with the PFL; if so, what was it. Mr Fletcher: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Government worked closely with the Western Australian Government during the project development stage of the Perth Freight Link. However, specific decisions regarding what clearing works were to be undertaken prior to the Western Australian state election are considered an operational matter and were managed solely by the Western Australian Government. Deputy Prime Minister: Meetings (Question No. 722) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, in writing, on 10 May 2017: (1) How often does he work in his Ministerial Office in Armidale. (2) In total, how many (a) ministerial meetings, and (b) Agriculture and Water Resources portfolio meetings, have been held in his Ministerial Office in Armidale (3) In the same period, how many Agriculture and Water Resources portfolio meetings have been held in the Commonwealth Parliament Offices in Sydney. Mr Joyce: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Often. While in Armidale recently I took the opportunity to open the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Association's interim office at 246 Beardy Street, Armidale. The Armidale office is staffed and undertakes portfolio business every week of the year. (2) A considerable number of electorate and ministerial meetings are held at the Armidale office. While many are scheduled, a number are ad hoc so to provide the Member for Hunter with a precise number is difficult and would require an unreasonable diversion of resources. (3) Attendance at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Offices in Sydney is usually necessitated by Cabinet and Cabinet Committee meetings, such as the Expenditure Review Committee, rather than portfolio commitments. I like to travel to agricultural areas to meet with people and businesses engaged in the agriculture and water portfolio. For example in the week immediately following the BudgetI travelled to: Maryborough, QLD to discuss the Coalition Government's commitment to supporting Australian farmers experiencing drought and financial hardship with farmers and the Member for Wide Bay, Mr Llew O'Brien MP Rockhampton, QLD to discuss the $8.3m L-GAP funding announcement with live exporters, cattle producers and the Member for Capricornia, Ms Michelle Landry MP and Member for Flynn, Mr Ken O'Dowd MP Roma, QLD to discuss the Coalition Government's $8.0 million contribution to the Great Artesian (GABSI Scheme) with farmers and the member for Maranoa, Mr David Littleproud MP Wodonga, VIC to announce the relocation of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority with the Victorian Nationals Senator Bridget McKenzie Millawa, VIC to discuss the Coalition Government's reforms to the Wine Equalisation Tax and promote the $50 million the Government is giving to the wine industry to promote Australian wine in overseas markets and encourage domestic and international tourists to visit our premium wine regions, and the $10 million annual grant for cellar doors to promote local wine tourism Shepparton, VIC to announce (Fruit Fly) with horticulture producers, the Member for Murray, Mr Damian Drum MP and Victorian Nationals Senator Bridget McKenzie Casino, NSW to meet with farmers and announce (Primex Funding and Dung Beetle funding) with the Member for Page, Mr Kevin Hogan MP Wauchope, NSW to meet with foresters and announce (forest and wood products) with the Member for Lyne, the Hon Dr David Gillespie MP, Assistant Minister to the Minister for Health Port Macquarie, NSW to meet with plantation owners and announce the tea tree levy arrangements with the Member for Cowper, the Hon Luke Hartsuyker MP, Assistant Minister to the DPM Orange, NSW to announce the location of the Regional Investment Corporation, a $4 billion concessional loans, with the Member for Calare, Mr Andrew Gee MP Yeoval, NSW to meet with farmers and land managers to promote the Coalition Government's $1 billion commitment to a further 5 year extension of the Landcare program with the Member for Calare, Mr Andrew MP Tamworth, NSW to meet with the horse industry and announce the Coalition Government's new thoroughbred horse levy arrangements Armidale, NSW to deliver the closing address of the Rural Financial Counselling Service Conference and announce additional funding to support the organisation Brisbane, QLD to deliver an address to the Qld Rural Press Club to promote the Government's $4.1 billion commitment to the Agriculture and Water resources portfolio in the 2017–18 Budget.",269,Apvma Or Are They Staff Working Elsewhere For Example From Home In Canberra Or
