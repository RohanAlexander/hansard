I notice that many questions arise regarding these regulations, and it seems to me that bound copies of them are necessary to the House. Has the Minister* of Defence taken steps to have the regulations bound, and issued to members? members's attention to an answer given about ten days ago to, I think, the honourable member for Batman. That answer will afford him the information which he desires. newspapers that the introduction of wireless telegraphy on land makes it possible that there will be a shortage of competent operators for the service of the Postal Department. I ask the Postmaster General, therefore, whether he does not consider that it would be in the best interests of Australia to give every facility to experimenting wireless operators, so that there may. be qualified operators available when the demand for more arises? likely to be a shortage of operators, because any one who can use the Morse instruments can receive wireless messages. There are a large number of amateurs already licensed to experiment with wireless telegraphy. honourable member for Dalley asked a question concerning the Fitzroy Dock, and yesterday he wished, to know whe* ;i later on. . . .. i",12,Setup

They were approved on the 29th new work, of which the total cost may run into January, 1895; and I shall read standmillions, and of which not even an approximate ing order 169A, which saysAt the commencement of every Session of Parliament the Legislative Assembly, according to the practice of Parliament with reference to the appointment of Select Committees, shall appoint a Select Committee of seven members, to be called the Committee of Public Accounts, with power to send for persons, papers, and records. The duties of the Committee of Public Accounts shall be as follow :(a) To examine the accounts of the receipts and expenditure of the colony, and to bring under the notice of the Legislative Assembly any items in those accounts, or aay circumstances con. . ;., '.. (4) To report to the House any alteration which may appear to the Committee desirable to be introduced in the form of or method of keeping the Public Accounts, or in the mode of receipt, control, issue, or payment of the public money. (c) To inquire into and report upon any questions which may have arisen in connection with the Public Accounts.

Upon motion in the usual manner made by any member of the Legislative Assembly any matter of public account, or any question of sult of their inquiries. I take it these Standing Orders should prove a guide to us when framing our Standing Orders for this proposed Committee. In the British House of Commonsi t is the practice to appoint a Committee of Public Accounts, and a great amount of work is done by it . There can be no doubt its reports have greatly assisted in the understanding of the public finances, as well as in bringing about However, out-ofeconomies. For example, I shall quote an extract from their report in 1904 on Naval Works Acts AccountsW h a t w ill they be? Your Committee examined closely into the question of estimates for work proceeding I would like to show the scope Works of giving an accurate estimate of expenditure on the initial years of a new work, there are also of opinion that Parliament should not be asked on a token vote of a few thousand estimate is submitted.

42,Mr Fisher,"I always put a marginalcourse being adopted. A t the same time, from a small beginning great things result, and if we embark on a project Ministers ought to be able to tell the House where the expenditure is leading them. Those who embark on these projects can generally see far enough to ascertain, to some extent, what will be the ultimate result. The report of the House of Commons Committee, in 1907, in regard to the payment of commissions to stewards by certain contractors, saysA case of payment of secret commission to certain stewards in one of the Naval Depdts accidentally brought to light grave irregularities, which were very properly made the subject of severe disciplinary measures, upon which your Committee offer no criticism; but they recommend that by the display of notices or other means more care shall be taken to impress upon all employees of the Admiralty, as well as upon contractors, the illegality and danger of accepting or offering any kind of commission. Then, again, in regard to contract work, the same Committee reported in 1907An unusual procedure was followed in connection with the contracts for HMS. Invincible, Inflexible, and Indomitable, for which (without Treasury sanction) no competitive tenders were invited. In explanation it was stated that the Board of Admiralty particularly desired to keep the designs of this class of vessel secret as long as possible. They therefore invited only three firms of proved merit to tender. The Admiralty compared the tenders with the estimates which they themselves had prepared, and finding them to be ""practically identical"" they accepted them. Your Committee give due weight to the importance of keeping the design of those vessels as secret as possible, but they desire to point out that when any such departure from the usual practice is proposed the sanction of the Treasury should at once be sought. urged in favour of the proceeding are not good enough to influence the Treasury at the time they can be of little value when offered as excuses after the event. Again, in regard to exchange of information, the Committee ih 1907 reportedAttention having been drawn to a case in which the Admiralty purchased goods from a firm which was supplying the War Office with similar articles on more advantageous terms, arrangements have been made and rules drawn up to ensure a mutual exchange of information on such matters. Your Committee are of opinion that this should lead to economy, and suggest, for the consideration of the Treasury, that it may be advantageous to extend the system to other Departments which have to buy large quantities of stores. In our own case Tender Boards, when they are established by law, will, I hope, help this being done, and insure economy. I am not sure that it is not done to some extent now, though there is no statutory power. partments order goods separately, sometimes one Department is paying more than another; also, it very often happens that the contract price is lower than the price one Department may pay buying somewhere else, instead of going to the contractor. The Committee of the House of Commons in the same year (1907) reported as follows: A general dealer at Portsmouth was discovered to have in his stock 39,500 cartridges for use with the Morris tube, and of this amount 22,400 were marked Government property. It appears probable that this ammunition was sold to him in small lots by men who had pilfered it at the ranges, and steps have now been taken to safeguard the ammunition issued for practice. Your Committee would suggest that the legality of selling Government stores in this way should be tested by a case in the Courts, and that if a conviction is secured steps should be taken, by advertisement or otherwise, to warn all persons from engaging in such traffic. Here is another specimen of the Committee's work in 1907In the third report for last year, your Committee called attention to the increased cost of the Headquarters Staff, and to the fact that the reduction in the cost of the District Staffs, foreshadowed by the Esher Committee, had not taken place. The question has since been the subject of correspondence between the Treasury and the War Office, and before next year a comparative statement will be laid before the Committee, supplying f u l l information. Your Committee must, therefore, with some reluctance, again postpone consideration of this matter. If the arguments Again, in 1907, there is a report, which shows that the Committee was dealing with a matter which is interesting to ourselvesARMY ORDNANCE FACTORIES-COMPARISO N OF The Comptroller and Auditor-General states that at his request the War Office have agreed to furnish_ him with the documents by which a comparison can be made between trade and factory prices, which he believes will be useful. Hitherto the objection has been raised that such a return would tend to disclose secret matters, but the Comptroller and Auditor-General will use it confidentially. Another report made in 1907 deals with Military Works, Loan Account; purchase of lands taken, and the estimated value and ultimate cost. It statesA statement is furnished in pursuance of a recommendation^ of your Committee showing details of expenditure incurred in connection with the purchase of land under the Military Works Loan. This table does not reveal the difference between the valuation and the cost of the land, But when Debut your Committee accept the answer of the accounting officer that this matter will be considered with a view to the amplification of the return next year. In r e g a rd to the B a n k r u p t c y D e p a r t m e n t There should be no secrets regarding it . of the B o a r d of T r a d e , the reported in the same year A revised form of estimate approved by the Treasury was submitted to your Committee in which it was proposed that the Bankruptcy Vote should be divided and the companies part of it placed under the Board of Trade Estimate. Vour Committee agree that the suggested form of estimate be adopted. The n, again, in 1907 bhe House of Commons Committee , dealing w it h ordnance factories' m a n u f a c t u r in g accounts, and a comparison of t r a de and f a c to r y prices, r e p o r t e dAt present there are various considerations which tend to interfere with a direct comparison of factory and trade prices, and it would appear that the recommendations of a Committee on Government Factories and Workshops, presided over by Sir G. H . Murray (which are accepted in the main by the Army Council), will make the comparison-still more difficult. The Committee recommends that the normal establishment of the Arsenal shall be fixed at the minimum, which will enable the output to be increased on emergency to the greatest possible extent in the shortest possible time. This policy is clearly incompatible with the most economical method of production, as it entails the upkeep of unused buildings and machinery maintained with a view to expansion, the cost of which tends to swell the price of the Ordnance Factory productions. Your Committee are of opinion that it is ot the utmost importance that the real cost should be shown of articles produced in Government factories. As I have already stated, of the Committee's the consideration framing the Standing Orders. particulars given it will be seen that the Public Accounts an insight into the financial operations events. of the several Departments, there will be a number of members who right honourable member for Wide Bay will have inside qualified to give information to House. be more readily appreciated when it is obligements offered in that way. remembered that such assistance will be given by members who are free to criticise orable member's practice to ask for the as well as to explain. think that the strongest light should be Bill?

We desire the fiercest light of publicity to shine upon our public expenditure. C o m m it t ee This House has the right to investigate any matter of public expenditure, but owing to the exigencies of public life, and want of time, Parliament is often unable to look closely into many matters which it would like to investigate. This Committee will be always at work. It will be a body representative of both sides of the House, and will have power to inquire into, not only matters concerning which the House directs an inquiry, but any question that, of its own motion, it thinks should be investigated. No doubt from the departmental point of view, it will involve a good deal of trouble. the investigations will probably take up a good deal of time.

I do not say that the men appointed to the Committee will be less capable than the average capacity of the House. Par from it . One of the main points that the Treasurer tried to make was that in the Estimates small sums are sometimes proposed for particular works, and that that is wrong and dangerous. it is not clearly stated that the ultimate finite statement of intention in the matcost of the works will be very much ter. larger. with which I have had anything to do, cept? when a small sum appeared in connection with a work which would require further submit Standing Orders for the approval expenditure, there was a marginal note of the House. to inform the reader that the proposed vote would only cover a portion of the total expenditure.

It is rather in what I might call minor matters that the Committee's work would be valuable. It should be exceedingly valuable in regard to the presentation qf accounts.

I have no, reason to object to the principle of the B ill . it will work any revolution in the public accounts; and I am entirely against those wbo hope by this method to delay the constitutional works of the Commonwealth. It would have been impossible for any Committee of Public Accounts to in vestigate all the expenditure during the last three or four years; and now that the Government have time to look into matters, I hope that, if they discover that anything was amiss during that period, they will state it plainly to the House and the country. There was remarkable difficulty in creating new staffs in connection with the expenditure of £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 on public works; and that this was done without serious blunder is a great compliment to the permanent officials, and no discredit to the late Government. Although. I approve of the principle of the B ill , I do not agree with the Treasurer as to the great advantages that will arise from it . Undoubtedly the measure will steady the public mind a great deal, and minimize the influence of people who are ever ready to suggest that the Government are abusing their trust in the conduct of affairs and the expenditure of public money. I offer no opposition to the second reading of the B ill . I should like to preface my few remarks with the statement that my mind is in an absolutely open condition. fectly prepared to listen to all the observations that can be made on the Ministerial side in 'support of the B ill , and equally ready to listen to the observations from honourable members opposite A l though this B ill may have been posted ..to me, I never saw it unti l half-an-hour ago; and this disposes of any idea on the part of honourable members opposite that this question has been f u l l y discussed He did indicate in party meeting, or that we on this side are committed to any particular opinion In the most general with regard to the details.

I wish to compliment tlie Government on the distinction made between a measure like this, which is capable of discussion, and measures which we know honourable members opposite do not wish to discuss at all.

102,Sir John Fobbest..:,"That wil l all be*there are no Standing Orders bearing on the Bill. The Treasurer has quoted a good deal about the Committee of the House of Commons, and also about a similar Committee which sits in Victoria; but from what I know of the House of Commons, there is practically no parallel between the way in which it conducts its business and the way in which business is conducted in this House. I have looked up the Victorian Standing Orders on the question, and I find them to be very short, and principally concerned with the appearance and calling of witnesses. There is nothing whatever to show how far the Committee is going to be empowered to deal with questions with any degree of finality. Mr W. H. IBVINE -There is no finality. criticism is that this Bill is in the directhese regulations should be included in tion of a tendency we observe in all Parliaments. Affairs are becoming so complex in all Anglo-Saxon Parliaments, at all events, that it has been found necessary to delegate many powers to subordinate bodies, which, as the term implies, are intended to investigate certain problems, and submit recommendations to Parliament. We have already embarked on some sort of movement in this direction by proposing to establish a Public Works Committee. This is evidently intended to delegate to certain members of the House the right to investigate proposals for public works, and report, as is done in all the States. It is also proposed, I believe, to establish a Tender Board such as we find now in the case of the State Governments. These are found to relieve the central Government of a great deal of laborious work, and to relieve Parliament from matters of detail, the Board being authorized to inquire into all matters relating to tenders for public supplieSj and report. established an Inter-State Commission which is to relieve the Parliament of some of its duties, primarily those in connection with the Tariff, making recommendations which it is for the House to adopt or reject. member define, in the Statute the whole of the powers of the Committee ? at present I am only thinking aloud; for I am prepared to hear the discussion on both sides; and I shall be glad to hear what the honourable member has to say in favour of his view that the Standing Orders method of making the necessary provision is the better one.. My own view is that as this proposal is not a party question, and as the desire is that the House should take the whole responsibility of fathering this Committee, and giving it existence, I should like to see the House take part in framing, for the conduct of the Committee, the rules or regulations which are now in Victoria embodied under the title of Standing Orders. I do not see why the House should not deal with this matter, and lay down for itself, as a body consisting of two parties, what the Committee should do and should, not do, and how it should do anything it does do. That is my first thought. the B ill ! posing anything at present. I have heard some arguments on both sides, and I should like to hear further argument. I can assure honourable members that I appreciate the attitude of keeping one's mind open on such a question, especially when it is not a party question, and I shall be glad to hear other speeches one way or another; but my present inclination is that if we wish the House to regard this Committee as a body of its own creation, Parliament itself should be invited to take a hand in framing the rules and regulations by which the conduct of this Committee is to be ordered. Orders will be submitted for the approval oi the House. honourable gentleman must recognise that there is a great distinction between what We have also I am suggesting and what the honourable member proposes. Standing Orders are certainly brought to the House for approval ; but that is quite a different thing. We know they are not gone into in detail. They are simply laid on the table and approved of or disapproved of.

That is my feeling about it , and it will be for the House to determine by-and-by whether what are called Standing Orders in the case of the State of Victoria should not be embodied in the Rill, so that the House itself will have some say in them as part of the BiU. The Treasurer has announced that the office is to be an honorary one. I have no objection to that. be an honorary one. conscionable proposal to hand over to a Committee of the House an amount of financial supervision work which very few men can undertake. will not allow payment to be made. cannot be done unless you change the Constitution. has not been satisfied to say that' there should be a Committee to investigate the expenditure on the Capital site, or on the Northern Territory, or on public works, or on Naval expenditure, or on Military expenditure; but he is proposing that a Committee, appointed without any remuneration, shall have thrown upon it an obligation to investigate the whole of the expenditure of this great Commonwealth, amounting to something like £25,000,000 a year. If I were asked to go on such a Committee under such conditions I should say at once that I could not afford the time. Parliament is sitting four days of the week, for six months in the year, when those who have visible means of support have no chance to look after their businesses; and, therefore, to ask those men to be prepared, during the succeeding six months, to investigate the whole of the £25,000,000 expenditure of the Commonwealth voluntarily,, and without remuneration of any kind, and perhaps travel to many parts of the continent in order to carry out their work conscientiously, is to ask them to undertake an impossible task. the doorsteps of Ministers at the same time. fine figure of speech, but it is not necessary to go so far in one's imagination to realize how impossible a proposal it is. It would be different if the Treasurer proposed to' have a number of Committees, one dealing with expenditure on bhe Capital site, one dealing with expenditure on public works, one dealing with the Northern Territory, another dealing with Naval expenditure, and still another dealing with Military expenditure. It would be within the province of any man, who has an occupation to look after, to say that he would be perfectly prepared to accept office on any one of these Committees, as the work would only take him, in the aggregate, about a month out of the six months. If we ask honourable members to accept office on any of these Committees, and give the House the benefit of their advice, I believe they will be prepared to do so. The position here is not the same as in It England, where men go into the House of Commons, the bulk of them, after they have settled the bread-and-butter question for life, and have all their time to themselves. They are in London, and * they are willing to sit on these big Committees in. order to win political promotion at some future time. We have an altogether different state of things here. We are busy men, and have to give up our occupations for many months of the year to come to Parliament, and when we are asked to investigate, and go all over the work that the Treasurer and his officers are going over to-day, I venture to say it is impracticable. would have our assistance. would, but it would take the Committee the greater part of the six months to carry out that task, and I do not know any honourable member who would be prepared off-hand to say that he would go on to such a Committee, especially when a member of the Committee would not even get board fees or anything of the kind. I am not pleading for the establishment of the payment of CommitteesI think that would be a dangerous precedent-bu t I do plead, so far as I can see the matter, the unwisdom of so comprehensive a proposal, and the impracticability of asking one Committee to go into the whole of these matters. them, I hope. tion the Treasurer has given us is. of very little use.

It takes a member of the House nearly a week or longer to come here from Queensland or Western Australia, and it takes him the same time to return. Consequently, he has to make his home in Melbourne for six months in the year. In England, however, a member of the House of Commons can run down from Scotland or Wales, or run up from Cornwall, in the night.

However, I take it the Committee proposed in this In the case of Queensland B ill will not so much bear on the merits of a public works proposal as upon the amount which it is likely to cost. If we are going to adopt this principle, my present thought is-and I am open to conviction on the subject-that we will need to Y e t we are establish a number of Committees. I think an inquiry, for example, on the Federal Capital expenditure would be sufficient to occupy the attention of a Committee. I think the Northern Territory question is one which of itself is quite sufficient to occupy the attention I quite recognise the general of a Committee. I think that the Naval expenditure is quite enough to occupy the timo of a Committee, and the same with Military expenditure. With all due deference to military experts, their great object is to produce what they consider a perfect system of military defence.

I think it is due to professional jealousy. The honourable member for Herbert has made a suggestion which is well worthy of attention. He has pointed .out that the proposed Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee may possibly overlap each other, because the former body-if its members are going to consider the construction of public works-mus t also consider the proposed items of expenditure. However, I appreciate the remarks of the Treasurer, if he meant them-and I believe that he did, because he is not the type of gentleman who likes to surrender responsibility. He says he thinks that we ought to have a Committee to examine the proposals of the Government, and to bring up a report to the Housei f it believes that the Government are proposing extravagant expenditure. strangely, coming, as it does, from a gentleman of such a tyrannical dispositiona gentleman who has had his own way for so long, and who w ill not tolerate any interference. I am sure that if the Committee regarded his proposed expenditure upon the transcontinental railway as extravagant, he would become rather restive. It seem""» strange, therefore, to find him proposing the appointment of a Committee of Public Accounts. I think that the B ill is all right, and I merely rose to express my great objection to the honourable member for Parkes ventilating his personal grievances in this -Chamber. Whilst this B ill is fairly satisfactory, I limits its investigations to expenditure am of opinion that there is something in the criticism of the honourable member for Parkes to the effect that it would be a huge task for a Committee to make the fullest investigation into the whole of the accounts of the Commonwealth. A t the .same time, I realize that it would be very difficult to appoint more than one Committee. work will be largely a matter of departmental investigation. The whole of the -accounts will have to be inquired into, and, probably, light will have to be thrown upon certain operations of the Government by the calling of evidence-the -Committeebeing vested with power to swear and examine witnesses in the ordinary way. I do not quite.follow the honourable member for Parkesi n his desire to have embodied in the B ill fhe whole of the powers that will belong to the Committee. The more, we define those powers the more we shall probably limit them. That is .what we said in respect to the referenda. with the referenda. This Committee, if it is to do effective work, will require to be clothed with the very fullest powers of investigation. If the Committees' investigations are not of the most searching character, its reports w ill be of little use. The Committee should, therefore, be at liberty to make investigations respecting expenditure in the Departments, and to recommend what improvements it thinks necessary. In establishing our Committee, we have two models to guide us, those of New South Wales and Victoria, not one of the other States having a ComThat statement sounds mittee of Public Accounts. The Victorian Committee is provided for by an Act-it s powers being defined by Standing Orders; but, not only is the New South Wales Committee established by an Act, but its powers also are defined by Statute. Consequently, the powers of the Victorian Committee are wider than those of the New South Wales Committee. The investigations of the latter are limited to matters submitted by the Minister, the Auditor-General, or the Assembly by resolution; whereas the Victorian Committee can, on its own initiative, make the fullest investigation into the financial transactions of the State. The New South Wales Committee, unless it is acting on a resolution of the Assembly, made by a Minister without appropriation or authority. An advantage that is gained by providing for the powers of the Committee by Standing Orders is that it is more easy to make necessary alterations under that arrangement, because Standing Orders are more easily amended than are the provisions of an Act of ParWe have to recollect that its liament. But, before this B ill was brought forward for discussion, there should have been a meeting of the Standing Orders Committee, and a series of Standing Orders should have been drafted for the consideration of the House, in conjunction with its consideration bf the provisions of the B ill .

As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Parkes, the expenditure of the Commonwealth is increasing rapidly, being now about £27,000,000 per annum; but the hasty manner in which Estimates are dealt with in this Chamber prevents honourable members from obtaining the f u l l information necessary to enable them to judge whether money is being properly expended have power to make investigations other than those which it is instructed to make ? to make the fullest investigation into the expenditure of the Commonwealth, and to report thereupon. say so. plained that the powers of the Committee are to be denned by Standing Orders, and I have already stated that I think that the proposed Standing Orders should have been drafted and presented to the House for consideration simultaneously with the B ill . able member for Parkes that the members of the Committee should be appointed for the term of a Parliament; to l i m it their term of office to one session would be to make their work valueless. sion, the members of the Committee would hardly obtain an insight into the finances of the Commonwealth, and next session, were an election necessary, there might be an entirely new Committee, or, at any rate, a Committee several of whose members were new to the work. the members of the Committee are nearly always re-appointed. to appoint them for the term of a Parliament, as in New South Wales. course, when a member of the Committee ceases to be a member of the House, he ceases also to be a member of the Committee. There must be continuity in the work of the Committee, and the term of its members should therefore be the f u l l three years for which a Parliament is elected. take note of the suggestions made by honourable .... members'. for the. improvement of the measure, and that he will give us 1 some indication of the intentions of the Government regarding the powers of the Committee, and the scope of its inquiries. MrM c DONALD (Kennedy) [4.18]. -The measure, like several others that have been introduced by this Government, means nothing taken by itself. If we are going to provide for a Committee of Public Accounts by new Standing Orders, the B ill is not needed. It is time that we had a Committee of Public Accounts, especially in view of the rapid increase Committee to of our expenditure. Ministers have not told us what the scope of the Committee's inquiries is to be, or what work it w ill do, nor have we been told whether the Committee will have power to sit when Parliament is not in session. When Par-"" liament is in session, the labour entailed on the members of the Committee will be so great as to interfere with the performance of their ordinary parliamentary duties. No one could understand o u r nnances unless he devoted a considerable time to their study. The members of the Committee w ill not be able to understand them, unless they are prepared to sacrifice a large portion of their time to I agree with the honorthe work of investigation. From the Treasurer down to the youngest member of the House there is no one at present who has a clear understanding of thefinancial position of the country. ToI n one sesobtain that is almost impossible. We have not been told how many members will comprise the Committee.

That may be necessary for the thorough investigation of the public accounts of the Commonwealth. It would be a waste of time for the Committee to make an in vestigation which was not thorough, and such investigations w ill require of the members of the Committee considerable labour and time. As the House w ill be guided largely' by the Committee's reports, the information submitted by the Committee must be reliable. Under these circumstances, it is absurd to imagine that any one Committee could obtain a proper grasp of all the public accounts.

In the House of Commons the national finances are dealt with by various Committees which are formed at the beginning of the session. mittee of Public Accounts. Mr' M c DONALD T h a t is so. The House of Commons is guided very largely by the reports of these various Committees. Honourable members can well understand that investigations by such Committees are very necessary in dealing with the Navy and A r m y Estimates in the Old Country. The matter is becoming of very great importance here. Our Estimates cover some hundreds of pages, and while items of local and minor importance are brought forward and dis :; cussed from time to time, when we are considering the Estimates, I do not hesitate to say that the bulk of the votes in volving the expenditure of millions of any discussion at all.

171,Mr Ahern,"There is a Special Comventure to say that even the most gifted financial member of this House cannot claim to f u l l y understand the whole of the public'accounts of the Commonwealth. While I am strongly in favour of the establishment of a Committee of Public Accounts, I say that this B ill is useless for the purpose. First of all, because, if the Committee is established under the Standing Orders, the B ill is unnecessary, and if it is to be established by Statute, the Government should introduce a measure for the purpose which will set out exactly what they require. desirable that we should establish some such Committee as is proposed, in order to assist the Housei n maintaining a proper -control over expenditure, and in order that it may make suggestions from time to time which may be of use to the House and the country in connection with the regulation of the public finances. In the State of Victoria the duties now performed by a Committee of Public Ac-counts, under statutory authority, were performed for many years by a Committee appointed under the Standing Orders -of the State Parliament, a method whicli, as indicated by the honourable member for Kennedy, is quite possible of adoption here. honourable members is almost an exact -copy of the Public AccountsA c t of Victoria, No. 1877, which was introduced in the year 1903. find, on looking up the matter in the Victorian Mansard, that there was very little debate on that measure. present Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. He introduced the B ill in a brief speech of a few sentences, and, beyond -a short speech by Mr Watt, the measure was passed through all its stages in the Legislative Assembly, and was sent on to the Council, in one sitting. No reasons were given for the departure from the previous practice. consideration of matters relating to the public accounts in Victoria was dealt with by a Committee of seven members, who were appointed under a standing order passed on the 28th January, 1895. It was a Sessional Committee, whose duties were denned by the Standing Orders. Amongst other things, the Committee were expected to examine receipts and expenditure, to report to the House, to inquire into any matters which might have arisen in connection with the public accounts, to deal with the funds of the Commissioners of Savings Banks, and make any reports that might be necessary thereon, and to deal with any matters specially referred to the Committee. It was provided in the standing order that any matter of finance might be referred to the Committee. A number of reports have been presented to the Victorian Legislature by the Public Accounts Committee appointed under the Statute to which I have referred. These were of far-reaching importance, and I feel sure they must have been invaluable to the Treasurer for the time being, as well as to Parliament, in connection with the financial administration. In New South Wales, so far as I can gather, there ia no Statute dealing with the matter. of the A u d it Act of 1902. was no Statute dealing with the matter, but the honourable member for Adelaide has been good enough to direct my attention to the fact that the A u d it A ct of 1902 covers the appointment of the Committee of Public Accountsi n New South Wales. In the House of Commons, understanding order 75 of that House, a I notice that the B ill now before Committee of Public Accounts is appointed. It is a Standing Committee of eleven members, and, as in Victoria, the Committee is appointed at.the commenceCuriously enough, I ment of every session, and not for the life of a Parliament. We can easily understand that in Great Britain an enormous amount of work devolves upon the Committee of Public Accounts. I notice MrW . H . Irvine, .the that, during ten weeks' of one period of the year, there were thirteen sittings of that Committee, and, amongst other work, they examined a large number of witnesses-as many as twelve or fifteen at some sittings-in connection with various important financial matters. The reports of the Committee upon the administration of the national finances are far-reaching. Prior to 1903, the I agree wibh the honourable member for Parkes when he says that if the .work is to be carried out effectively by any Committee, very great responsibility, will devolve upon the members of it .

Sir Auditor-General besides. is why I wish to hear from the Treasurer. He told the House what had happened in Great Britain. I believe that two-thirds of his speech referred to reports from Committees in Great Britain in connection with tendering and alleged scandals regarding some tenders. .1 have never heard of any case here where public officers have been denounced, or where it has been thought that public officers have profited by any of the tenders accepted by their Departments. I sincerely hope that our public officers will always remain above suspicion, as I believe every member of this Parliament is. It cannot be said that any of the members or the officials have profited by any of the tenders which have been accepted'. As the Treasurer says that the matter I have referred to will be more for the Public Works Committee than' for the Public Accounts Committee to deal with, I want to know where we shall land ourselves if we accept this measure. If we are to have a Supply and. Tender Board, not only to consider the tenders, but practically to decide which is the best tender in each case, a Public Works Committee, and a Public Accounts Committee, I would point out that the work is being done at present by the Auditor-General, and I believe effectively done. If the work of the Public Accounts Committee can, as the Treasurer affirms, be transacted at the Seat of Governmenthaving a Committee to consider the public accounts only, it would be far better to have a Committee to consider the public works entirely. tion. will see the accounts. Public Accounts Committee will fulfil any useful purpose other than what the Auditor-General is fulfilling to-day. have its own Committee of Inquiry. [121] brake Committee is to do nothing but examine think the accounts as they come in, it will not many be able to advise on any public works; for instance, as to whether money is to JOHN FORREST -There is the be rightly or wrongly spent. I do not agree with the honourable member for Indi, who said that the Committee will be able to consider the operations of the various factories started by the Commonwealth. I do not know that it can do any more than the Auditor-General is now doing in connection with those factories. All that it can do will be to examine the accounts. If the idea of the Government is to have a Committee to do that work, and also the other work which is being done by the Auditor General, I believe that it is appointing a Committee merely to duplicate work which is already done effectively. It would be far better to appoint a Committee which will net only examine the accounts, but consider public works, and advise whether it is necessary to erect a post-office at Perth, for example, at a cost of £250,000, or one at Melbourne at a cost of £100,000. honourable member for Yarra seems to think that there is hardly room for a Public Accounts Committee if we have a Supply and Tender Board, and a Public Works Committee. Surely the members of the Supply and Tender Board ought to be more or less experts, if their report is to be of any value to the Government! They will need, to have a technical knowledge of the subject-matter of each tender which is called for. Otherwise, what will be the value of a report from them as a guide to the Government? I can see that, when the Public Accounts Committee and the Public Works Committee get into working order, their duties will more or less overlap. Let me point out an advantage to the 'Government in having a Public Works Committee. It will have to go into the cost of various things, and move from State to State very often to inspect the works on which its members are called upon to express an opinion. It seems to me that most of the work which the Public Accounts Committee will be called upon to do-lookin g into the accounts in the various Departments-ca n be done at the Seat of Government. I do not see what is to prevent that from taking place. It will only be at very infrequent periods,",33,Foster Wher E Was Worst Offender

I understand that many-of the States have a Public Accounts Committee, and that the Committees are supposed to have done good work, and to have been a distinct advantage on many occasions. Having regard to the very wide range of the Commonwealth accounts year by year, we ought to make a beginning in a similar direction. If a Committee can effect improvements in the way in which the accounts are presented to Parliament it w ill have done good work. An y one who has looked through the Budget figures year by year must admit that there is a good deal of confusion. Unless one has some Certainly, if the inside knowledge, or gets some information from those who are responsible for framing the Estimates, he really cannot form a conclusion as to what some of the items are really intended for, or what istheir connection with otber items. I think that it That is a fact patent here every session, and if this proposed Committee can provide I do not wish special fees to a better means of presenting to the House Estimates and public accounts generally, it w ill do good service. It will not be an expensive body. Whatever remuneration is allowed, it will not amount to much.

I think the members of I am not, as a the Committee should represent all shades of political thought. This is not a party question.

The proposed Public Accounts Committee may be no better than the Public Works Committee of New South Wales. cause we appoint a Committee the members of it will do good work carries no weight with me. We shall want to know the men who will constitute the Committee. If they are capable of dealing with financial matters, no exception can be taken to their appointment. I rose particularly to emphasize the fact that because the Estimates have been brought down in the same form in our Parliaments for the last 'twenty years that is no reason why we should go ou accepting that form. It is time that a Public Accounts Committee or :Some other body took in hand the work of submitting our Estimates and financial accounts in a business-like way. There is no reason that I , or any other business man, can see why the affairs of the country cannot be stated as clearly and straightforwardly as the affairs of any big business corporation. No business corporation in Australia, or anywhere else, would put up with their accounts being submitted in the way in which our Estimates are submitted here. poration submits accounts which give so much information as do our Treasury accounts. shareholders in the business of the Commonwealth, and they require to know what the directors are doing with their money. If the Treasurer can assure us -that a Public Accounts Committee will help to put our accounts on a business basis, I shall only be too happy to give my support to the appointment'of such a 'Committee. 'to point out that the introduction of this Bill is due to the uncalled for and unjustifiable statements made during the last Federal elections by the members of the present Government and their supportersThey made an attempt to mislead the people as to the conduct of the Commonwealth finances by the late Government, and said that one of the first measures which they would submit would be one to provide for the appointment of a Public Accounts Committee. They were seeking a placard to put before the public, but they could not point to a single item in the Estimates submitted by the late Government which they would alter. Some honourable memhers opposite endeavoured to induce the public ho believe that the proposed Public Accounts ComThe argument that bemittee will be able to deal with the Estimates. We know very well that no Government would allow a Publio Accounts Committee, or any one else, to deal with their Estimates before they are placed on the table after the Budget statement. The reason is that the Government are answerable for tlie Estimates, and it is clear that the proposed Public Accounts Committee can have no voice whatever in their preparation. As the Committee will not be permitted to interfere with them after they have been laid on the table in this House, I should like to know what they are going to do. The Treasurer has not told us anything about their duties. Are they to go through the columns of the Estimates to see that the amounts have been added correctly? Are they to search the Estimates for mistakes in the figures presented? We know that they will not need to do that, since all the figures in the Estimates are verified by officers of the Treasury Department. We know that a Government virtually stake their position on the accuracy of their Estimates. The honourable member for Robertson has said that he does not understand the Estimates. That is easily accounted for, and I am not surprised to hear it. But I can tell the honourable member that I understand the Estimates. As soon as I get them.

338,Mr West,"Honorabl e members takknow what tliey contain; but those who devote sufficient time to their consider a? tion should be able to understand them. I do not think that Estimates submitted in any of the State Parliaments supply as much information as do the Estimates presented to this Parliament. If any honourable member does not understand a particular item, the officers of the Treasury are only too pleased to give all the infortheir Estimates to be reduced by mation necessary about it. I do pot know why honourable members admit that they are so dense as to be unable to understand our Estimates. If we take, for instance, the Defence Department, and the statement in the Estimates that the expenditure in connection with the visit of the InspectoFrGeneral of Oversea Porces will amount to a certain sum, there should be no difficulty about understanding that item. In 'the same way there should be no difficulty votes. What would the proposed Public Accounts Committee do with the Estimates ? Would they dispute their correctness? The Auditor-General and his staff are appointed for tlie purpose of seeing that all the Commonwealth accounts are properly kept, and I have never heard any honourable member speak of the Audit Department except in terms of tlie highest praise. The complaint has sometimes been niade that we cannot get the report of the Auditor-General in time to consider it when we are discussing the Estimates. But honourable members should bear in mind that goods are delivered to Government Departments up to the 30th June, and i't is often impossible to have all the acthings they said to country peoplecounts for such goods sent"" in until July or August. hand before the Auditor-General can carry out his work, and it is therefore unreasonable to expect 'that his report should be in hand as early as some honourable members seem to expect. I cannot see how the proposed Committee of Public Accounts could do any good. They could not interfere with the Estimates before or after they had been laid on the table in this House. As a rule the Government can be trusted to take good care of that. Governments are very sensitive about their proposals for expenditure, and it is quite right that they should be. They should not submit to Parliament any expenditure unless it can be justified. During the last funny things said by honourable membera three years, so far as I know, there was not a single item in the Estimates presented by the late Government that was Mr West. interfered with. This session, it is true,, one of the votes on the Estimates was reduced by £2,000. That was because the present Government had not the courage or backbone to stand by the Estimates they had submitted. No other Government would have allowed such a thing to occur. The present Government have submitted to the humiliation of allowing, £2,000, but the late Government would certainly not have permitted any reduction to be made in their Estimates. Honourable members, I fancy, are confusing a Public Works Committee with the kind of Committee contemplated in this B ill ; but, as a matter of fact, the twobodies are absolutely different. A PubljcWorks Committee has power to call evidence, and make recommendations on that evidence; and in New South Wales a about understanding other Committee of the kind has done some remarkably good work. I remember that on one occasion the Government Architect of the State prepared plans and specifications for a building of brick and cement, or, as I should say, brick and mud, but the Committee satisfied themselves that the proper material was stoneThen, again, the Public Works Committee of New South Wales recommend positions for railway stations, and makeproposals as to railway routes and deviations; and their ideas are almost in variably adopted. I shall not vote against the Bill, which will, doubtless, satisfy honourable members opposite, and beheld to justify the numerous silly during the elections-wil l be held to Every account must be in justify some of the outrageous, idiotic,, and unreasonable statements with which they tried to delude the public. It will' enable them to point to the great work they have done in the National Parliament, and, on the platform, to indulge in thunder and bluster. As a matter of fact, however, it is the Government, and not any Committee, who are responsible to the House and the country. I ask what item in the Estimates could such a Committee interfere with? opposite, but that is about the funniest. Even the members of the Government themselves cannot tell us what these contingencies are; the word itself shows that",42,Foster Wher E Was Worst Offender

340,Mr West,"I have heard some verywhat is meant are accounts which cannot be foreseen, and for which the Government must have credit. If we are to appoint a Committee, let us appoint one for -some specific and useful object. It is idle to appoint a Committee with no power to do anything; and, so f a r as obtaining information is concerned, the best source is the Governmenb themselves. There is no member in the House who is such a stickler for Ministerial responsibility, and who is so averse to 'delegating that responsibility to any other body, as is the Prime Minister. -this power will be delegated to any but supporters of the Government? for the honourable member for Parkes, had the Labour party been in power, we should have had a lively five minutes at his hands; but it is rather awkward for him to speak against his own. party, and, -therefore, his remarks were lenient.

Has the Treasurer any doubt as to the correctness of the Estimates? Sir JOH N FORREST -They are quite correct. gentleman any doubt that the Estimates are honestly prepared by the officers in the best interests of the people ? of this proposed Committee of Public Accounts? Each Department furnishes Estimates to the Treasurer, and I suppose that each Estimate is liberally bluepencilled, because the money desired is not available. Many Departments have What guarantee have we that their Estimates returned for revision aa often as five or six times before they are As satisfactory to the Treasurer for presentation to the House; and I am informed that the last Estimates for the Defence Department were much larger than those finally decided upon by the Treasurer. When the Labour Government were in power there were certain amounts that I caused to be placed on the Estimates, but I was subsequently informed that' these had been cut down; and we know that the Treasurer cannot go beyond his revenue. Very few new members are aware of the close scrutiny t h a t takes place before the Estimates are finally laid on the table. As I have said, this Committee, if appointed, w ill afford some satisfaction to the other side.. The Estimates They will be able to wave their arms and create great excitement about the wonderful progress which* has taken place. They will produce this b it of paper, creatsolutely no power, and making only a laughing-stock of themselves. When the This has been done reGovernment come to the House they can do nothing.

Apparently, Standing Orders are to be passed to enable the Committee to do a number of great things. If some persons only had an opportunity The Government to come to a certain Parliament Housei n Australia, they would laugh heartily when they observed how easily some honourable gentlemen are gulled and led away. I wonder what they would think of the great men they saw on the Treasury bench. A squatter in New South Wales came to me once, and said, "" West,",43,Foster Wher E Was Worst Offender

But after he had been there a fortnight, he said that there were more scoundrels to the foot there than in any place he had ever been in. He remarked that the members went about with a load of stones in their pocket trying to float a gold mine. "" I never came,"" he said, "" amongst a more unscrupulous lot of fellows in my life. If it had not been for the assistance of the press, some of those gentlemen would not have got back to their seats again."" some honourable members on the opposite side would, like myself, prefer to be considering something better than this bit of paper. The cream of the intelligence of Australia is supposed to occupy the Treasury bench, and yet Ministers bring in a puny thing like this Bill, and call themselves statesmen. A politician is a man looking after the next election. There are a lot of politicians associated with this Bill who are looking after the next election. The statesman is a man who looks ahead. I asked once what an alderman was, and I was told that he was a man who knew more about menu cards than he did about anything else. I suppose that this bit of paper is one of what Ministers call their non-contentious measures. from the others. The sooner we go home the better; because in SydneyI could do more useful work, such as in assisting a hospital committee, or doing something of that kind, than I can possibly do by staying here. This is, presumably, one of those non-contentious measures which are going to do so much for Australia. my friend George Reid were here, would he not have a bit of fun ? Would he not enjoy himself with this non-contentious measure? He would adjust his eye-glass and say, ""Ah !"" Then he would look at the plain side of the sheet and say, "" There is more sense in that than there is in the printed matter on the other side."" would be enjoyable to hear his comments on the measure. We should get a lot of information. I am very sorry that I have not his assistance just now. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.£5 p.m. ing prior to the adjournment for dinner seemed to afford a lot of pleasure to honourable members. I am not at all sorry for what I said then, because I feel more satisfied than ever I was that the Bill is simply a placard to enable Ministers in recess to go about this great continent and tell the people what fine legislatorsthey were, and how they endeavoured to earn their salaries, and to guard the public accounts-as though previous Ministers were the greatest scoundrels that could be found on the face of the earth. Prior to the advent of a Labour Government in New South Wales, we used to have some Heaven-born geniuses as financiers. They tried to make the people believe that they were monuments of ability, and had all those fine qualities which make good citizens and parliamentarians;, hut they had a very peculiar way of keeping the public accounts. They had a masterful way of making a surplus. Did such a state of things exist in the Commonwealth, there would be some justification for the Attorney-General to exercise his abilities and realize the keen conceptions of the public wants which he is supposed to have in his "" noddle."" In New South Wales a surplus was made up in a peculiar way. The Treasurer would bring down his statement of income and expenditure; on the income side he would put down land valued at £2,000,000; on the opposite side he would put down his expenditure; he would then subtract the expenditure from the revenue, and bring that is so, then save us out a surplus. In other words, the vacant land was the surplus. That method of showing a surplus was exposed at the time by a Committee which was appointed to conduct an inquiry. As an onlooker from the gallery, I felt that there was some justification for what was done; but to-day the Treasurer has put If forward no justification for this little Bill. He has declared that, when he is framing his Estimates, the Public Accounts Committee will not be allowed to interfere; that he will take no notice of that body. The Government alone are responsible for the Estimates. The Treasurer treats with scorn any sugIt gestion of interference with the Estimates. The House should, however, always take good care that the Governmentare held answerable for them. I shall be loath at any time to transfer the control.",44,Foster Wher E Was Worst Offender

I in this matter. why honourable members seek to confer on a Committee of the House the righ t of scrutinizing the items on the Estimates. That is a privilege which no representative of the people ought to part with. One of the greatest functions which he can exercise in the House is that of scrutinizing the Estimates. that the Government do not intend to do the same with this B ill as they did with the LoanB ill , and "" g a g "" honourable members. I hope that the Government will reserve to honourable members f u l l power to criticise every item on the Estimates, and that they will not shelter themselves under such a subterfuge as this B ill , and say, "" The Public Accounts Committee have gone through the accounts, and we are satisfied with their inspection."" I do not intend to give up my rights, privileges, and responsibilities in regard to scrutinizing the Estimates. I ask honourable members to pause before they empower a Committee to exercise any power or judgment over their acts in that relation. I have tried to point out the difference between a Public Works. Committee and a Public Accounts Committee. A Public Works Committee composed of honourable members would be of some use, because it could go through every item, and make suggestions, pointing out whether any proposed expenditure was of such a character as to deserve our approval, and also indicating what the future expenditure was likely to be. There is another matter which has cropped up during this debate, and which is of more importance than honourable members appear to recognise. It has been stated that the Estimates, include many an item against which not a large amount is put down, but that the probability is the passing of that small amount may lead to a very large expenditure in the future. I agree with that statement. I cannot understand I watched the proceedings in the State House for a number of years, and I know that there have been put on the Estimates items which ultimately involved the country in the expenditure of millions of money. In the We first instance, of course, only a small amount was set down for a work. In the case of the Sydney water supply scheme some years ago, Sir Henry Parkes placed on the Estimates a sum wish to be regarded as serious of £750,000. A t the time there was I want to know a strong contention as to whether a low pressure or a high pressure scheme should be adopted. Knowing the value of a high-pressure scheme for a city, and how it could be utilized in industries, I favoured it , and with a few friends waited on Sir Henry Parkes, and pointed out that such a scheme would involve an expendiI hope ture of nearer £3,000,000.' I said to Sir Henry Parkes, "" How can you justify this vote; you have only £750,000 down on the Estimates?"" Sir Henry Parkes replied, "" West, if I were to tell the people of New South Wales what a water supply for Sydney could cost, I would have the whole of the country members against me for putting down the item at a l l . "" It will be the same in the Commonwealth. There are items of expenditure, small at first, which it is necessary to pass, and they will lead to greater works costing larger sums. The items are only small at first -because the whole of the works cannot be carried out during the year covered by the Estimates. A Public Works Committee would not alter that, but they would show the necessity for passing the smaller amounts to prepare for the larger works in future years. This is illustrated by the . expenditure on the Capital site. Though the amount expended this year may be £200,000, and may be justified, in twenty-five years' time possibly considerably more than £250,000 will be a justifiable expenditure at Canberra. Por the benefit of the honourable member for Robertson, a new member, whose boots seem to pinch him so much that he must keep moving, has interjected something about country bers. I may tell him that country districts benefit by the money spent in the Capital. The North Shore bridge at Sydney, which is essential for the traffic in Sydney, and should have been constructed years ago, has not been commenced, because, through the work of the New South Wales people knew the actual cost of that project. Without that Committee they would not have known it, and possibly the work would have already been taken in hand; but a Public Accounts Committee can give us no aid in that direction. to learn from the Treasurer where this Committee will save a shilling, or help to elucidate any item on the Estimates. is the duty of honourable members to make themselves acquainted diture set out in the annual and to see whether it is justified. have no right to delegate their power to any body or Committee. bility rests on every honourable and every honourable member should share ib. As for tlie Bill, I pick it up and see that it is a piece of paper printed on one side and blank on the other, and in trying to judge which is the best side I reason that as one side costs money, seeing that there is print upon it, and the other side costs nothing, seeing that it is blank, I am justified in plumping for the blank side. I know the Bill can do nothing towards reducing expenditure. fact, it will create expenditure. aid the revenue or enlighten members one whit. simply a placard for the next election. The honourable member for Wentworth will be able to say to the electors in his district, "" Look at the great work Parliament has done; and I , as Assistant Minister, took charge of the Home Affairs and was able to assist the Government in bringing this great measure before the House."" genius? Looking at this matter I think the House should be occupying its time in a much better way. If tlie Government had been really in earnest would have put through a Bill for a Public Works Committee, which could be of some assistance. I am sure the honourable member for Wentworth will admit that a Public Works Committee would do his Department no harm if he had it assisting him. Mr West. Instead of such a non-contentious meamemsure, we have before us this marvellous production, and neither side of the House pretends to care whether it is passed or not.

As he seems very anxious to have his name put to something, I would rather see it atPublic Works Committee, the tached to some better measure than this trumpery thing, which is simply put forward because at election time some honourable gentlemen made silly statements, and told the people what great things they were going to do.

Governments stand or f a l l , and are estimated in the public mind by their financial administration. I have studied this B ill , and have listened to the speeches in vain to discover what possible hope this proposed Committee wil l have of enabling us to better understand or manage the finances. We have now an Auditor-General, with a staff of officials, whose only duty it is to see tliat the finances are r u n on proper lines. The Auditor-General is presumed to be an expert; he is paid the salary of an expert, and he is supposed to have under him officials trained in accountancy and finance. If the B ill is to accomplish anything, it will relieve the Auditor-General and his staff of the responsibility they now have placed upon them in connection with the finances, at any rate, so far as the checking of receipts and accounts is concerned, and to divide that responsibility in a most general fashion. I can conceive of nothing more dangerous to successful financial administration than the distribution of financial responsibility. I have listened in vain for any hint as to 'the necessity for this alterasimilar cases. tion. relieve of responsibility? of only one reason for placing this B ill before us. During the last election campaign the question of finance occupied a very prominent position. We upon this side of the House claimed that the three years' regime of the Pisher Government had shown, if it had shown nothing else, unexampled ability in the matter of finance. The present Government and their supporters urged just as strenuously that we had been extravagant, that we had been careless, that we had exhibited utter incapacity in handling the financial affairs of tlie Commonwealth, and, for these reasons, we should be put out of office. We were put out of office, and the present Government, instead of coming down to Parliament with any reasonable proposals on the lines of their criticism of their predecessors-particularl y in regard to economy in financial administration-submitte d for our consideration a LoanB ill , together with increased expenditure, and have now brought forward a measure in which they propose to divest themselves of responsibility, and to thrust it upon a Public Accounts Committee. Personally, I have always a suspicion of Boards these buffer Boards, which come between Parliament and the responsible heads of Departments and Ministers. It had been well said that all Boards are wooden, and, in many cases, the Boards appointed by Parliament are merely buffer Boards, which serve no good purpose other than to shield the responsible heads of Departments and Ministers from the consequences of their administration. In the first place, T say that this B ill will relieve the Auditor-General and his officials of a good deal of responsibility. orable member. So far as we know, this B ill may mean anything, or it may mean nothing. It is a "" cart-before-the-horse "" proposal. We are asked to appoint a Committee of Public Accounts, and, after we have done that, we are to be told what its duties are to be. The only thing we have to guide us is what has been done in We have the experience of the Victorian Legislature, for example. TheB ill provides that the proposed Committee ' ' shall exercise all the powers conferred upon it by any standing order, or Act, or otherwise, for the session during which it is appointed."" I have here the Standing Orders of the Victorian Legislature, in .which the duties of the Committee of Public Accounts of this State are defined as follows: To examine tbe accounts of the receipts and expenditure of tbe Colony and to bring under the notice of the Legislative Assembly any items in those accounts, or any circumstance connected with them to which it may consider the attention of the Legislative Assembly should be directed. If that means anything, it means that the Committee which we are asked to appoint-if it is to be a responsible bodymust be held accountable for anything that happens in regard to the keeping of bhe accounts of the Commonwealth.

357,Mr Finlayson,"The honorablesays that the Auditor-General will not be responsible. Auditor-General is responsible for the correctness of the public accounts, and my complaint is that if this Committee is to examine those accounts with a view of seeing that they are properly kept, it must necessarily reduce the responsibility of the officer who is now charged with these very specific and important duties. Accountancy is an expert business. I question if there are half-a-dozen honourable members in this House who are able either to understand pr to check a balance-sheet of a complicated character. One honourable member said to-day that we ought to be able to understand the accounts of the Commonwealth as easily as one can understand tlie balance-sheet of a company. As a matter of fact, there is nothing more difficult to understand than is the balance sheet of an ordinary company, and the more diverse are the operations of that company the more difficult it is to understand its balance-sheet. It is a common saying that figures can lie, and it is much more true that liars can figure. There are very few honourable members who are sufficiently acquainted with accounts and with balance-sheets, with the methods of calculating and of checking them, to be able effectively and intelligently to critiment of the Commonwealth-measure s cise them. If that be true of the ordinary balance-sheet of an ordinary trading company, how much truer is it that honourable members are unable to criticise the various items of the Commonwealth accounts? There are very few of us like the honourable member for East Sydney who are prepared to claim that we understand the Estimates and the public accounts from one end to the other. The honourable member may be able to teach us, but I am inclined to think that many of us would prove dull scholars, because the business is a most intricate one. Personally, I am quite content to leave the public accounts of the Commonwealth to experts, to demand from them the very best service they can render, and to hold them responsible for the efficient discharge of their duties. If the proposed Committee is going to examine the accounts of the receipts and expenditure, and the books relating to the financial position of the Commonwealtli, it must certainly relieve the Auditor-General of responsibility. It will be the easiest thing in the world for that officer and his staff to shelter themselves behind this Committee. They will be able to say, "" The Public Accounts Committee has examined the accounts, and is satisfied with them. How, then, can we be held responsible for them?"". According to the Standing Orders of the Victorian Parliament, the Public Accounts Committee in this State hasTo report to the 'House any alteration which may appear to the Committee desirable to be introduced in the form of or method of keeping the public accounts, or in the mode of receipt, control, issue, or payment of the public money. That brings me to the question of: the distribution of responsibility. I begin now to wonder why the Treasurer has brought forward this Bill. Honorablo members upon this side of the House have been charged with wasting time by talking hour after hour, while the Government were anxious to get on with important business. Here is the notice paper detailing the different measures which are regarded by the Ministry as important. This is one Bill for which they consider the country is dying -on e of the measures which they have been unable to get on with because we will insist on blocking business. While there are undoubtedly many measures which are necessary for the good governwhich are already many sessions belatedthe Government coolly propose to waste time by submitting a Bill of this character which will serve no purpose exceptthat of protecting the Treasurer from responsibility for his Estimates. the Victorian Government adopt it? ing some inquiry in regard to the Public Accounts Committee in Victoria, and I have not yet learned that it has had the slightest effect in altering the system of keeping accounts which was previously in vogue, or that it has helped Parliament to a better understanding of the Estimates, or, in short, that it has been able to justify its existence. The Treasurer proposes to appoint a similar Committee, and in view of the fact that he refuses to give us any information as to the work which it is to do, I can only imagine-seein g that he has charged this party with having been extravagant, wasteful, and incapable in their financial administration, whilst he",48,Foster Wher E Was Worst Offender

I am quite prepared to admit that the Estimates require a good deal of consideration and investigation before we can arrive at a reasonable conclusion. If the proposed Committee is to take uharge of the Estimates, what are its members going to do with them? Will they go through them with a view to discovering errors? will look at the Estimates for the current year for the Department of Home Affairs he will find an error of .£600,000. with this Government. stance may be regarded as an argument in favour of the appointment of a Committee of Public Accounts. that there has been carelessness in checking the figures. It is a mere clerical error, but it makes the figures appear £600,000 worse than they really are. If the proposed Committee is to consist of seven members, and it is to be charged with the duty of discovering merely clerical errors, the end will not justify the expenditure. On the other hand, if it cannot deal with the Estimates until after they have been passed by Parliament, of what value will it be? The He proposes to do this by dividonly possible hope there can be of effective work being done by this body lies in its members being permitted to go I do not know through the Estimates with a view to suggesting a new method of presenting them to the House. But that immediately opens up the possibility of continual change in the method of keeping our public accounts. Anybody who knows anything about business knows that there is nothing more disturbing in The first time business, and nothing more likely to lead to trouble, than the continual altering of the method of keeping accounts. When once we have adopted a good 'system of bookkeeping we should stick to it. Unless there is something very faulty and wrong in the method of presenting the Commonwealth accounts, the interference of a pettifogging Committee of Public Accounts will only make confusion worse confounded. I cannot According to the Vicimagine that the Treasurer wishes to dodge his responsibility. Yet, 1 quite fail to understand why he should bring forward this Bill at the present stage of the session. The third instruction to the Committee of Public Accounts in Victoria isTo inquire into and report upon any questions which may have arisen in connection with the public accounts. If the adoption of that instruction will not transfer responsibility from the departmental officers to the proposed Committee by making the latter responsible for the methods adopted, I do not know If the Treasurer what will. I have just pointed out a clerical error of £600,000 in our own Estimates. Would that matter be referred to the Committee of Public Accounts? The thing is ridiculous. All that is necessary in a case of that sort is to call the attention of the Auditor General and his staff to it , and the error will be rectified. If we adopt the Victorian standing order relating to this It shows matter the proposed Committee will have power, to report upon any questions which may arise in connection with our public accounts. Suppose that we discuss the matter of expenditure upon the Yass-Canberra Capital Site. Tha* question will always arise in an acute form",49,Foster Wher E Was Worst Offender

Any report that the Committee might present, no matter how capable, would be ruthlessly swept aside if a charge of maladministration were to be made, .because the man who would have to answer the charge would be the Treasurer of the day, and the House would not let him shelter behind the Committee. No report of the Committee would prevent the criticism of the country's finances by tlie House.

The best informationI can get is that nothing it has done has had any influence. Yet we are wasting time over a measure for the appointment of a Commonwealth Committee that no one wants. The Treasurer says that he does not care whether we provide for the' Committee or not; the country has not demanded thecreation of the Committee, and the Public Service has not asked for it. There is no charge of incapacity against the Auditor-General, and no similar Committee has been of any practical benefit to the State that has established it . In Victoria, a member can move a motion dealing with the finances of the country, and have the matter referred to the Committee for report. But all representative Parliaments have jealously guarded the right to control finance. About nothinghas the House of Commons been moretouchy and nervous than about its right Such questions can have only to control money Bills; and there is= careful about. Perhaps the honourable member for East Sydney is right in saying that the Bill is merely a placard intended to deceive the electors. A Committee of Public Accounts could be given authority and power only by taking responsibility from the Treasurer and his expert advisers. He is surrounded by and are paid high salaries because of their special knowledge. They understand acThis Parliament most judicountancy, and it is their business to present the public accounts to us in the most understandable form. Yeti t is now proposed that a Committee, to consist of seven members of this House, who may or may not have had financial training, shall examine books that its members do not understand, to investigate methods that they cannot comprehend, and to make suggestions which will be of no value.

Financial matters are too important and too intricate to be dealt with in this way. Clause2 provides that the Committee shall exercise powers that are to be conferred on it by Standing Orders, by ' an Act,, or otherwise. The honourable member for Maribyrnong has called attention to the words "" or otherwise.""

The honourable member's second statement was that he found himself in difficulty about giving an account of his stewardship to his constituents after the session is over. That is the most astounding statement that could possibly fall from any honourable member on the Government side. If he will permit me, I shall suggest to him how easy it will be for him OT any of his colleagues to give an account of their stewardship during this session at any rate. All that they will have to do will be to say, "" Ladies and gentlemenWhenever we, on the Government side, found ourselves in a difficulty, we just gagged the Opposition and went on with the next subject. Whenever we found criticism becoming a little too warm we gagged the Opposition. Whenever we objected to criticism or to the exposure of our conduct we simply gagged the Opposition and went merrily on our way. We robbed the Opposition of all right of free speech, and did just as we liked without knowing why we liked to do it. That is a true and faithful account of our stewardship."" If any honourable member on Ithe other side stands before his electors and says that, it will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. In the third place the honourable member for Calare deplored his own want of knowledge in respect to the finances. We have only to remind the honourable member that when honourable members on this side desired to the best of our ability to criticise the expenditure of £3,080,000, with other honourable members on the opposite side, the honourable member deliberately applied the closure, so that he should not receive the information the lack of which he now so seriously deplores.

The very fact that the powers of the Committee are to be left to Standing Orders indicates that there is a desire on the part of the Government and their supporters to quarrel with the Senate. It has suggested by interjection, though certainly not in any speech, that it is proposed to give the powers under Standing Orders, because this House alone will cont r ol those Standing Orders. standing that the Senate is equally interested with ourselves in the public accounts, the powers of the Committee are to be left entirely to the House of Representatives. This, I repeat, seems to show a desire to quarrel witli the Senate, which, I contend, has a right to a voice in the delegation of the powers to the Committee. There is nothing in the Constitution which says that we alone shall be able to appoint a Committee dealing with the public accounts, and shall hold the right or power to say how far the Committee shall or shall not go. It is only feasible, in the circumstances, that the Senate should assert its unquestionable constitutional right to a voice in the granting of the powers. suppose for a moment, that the Committee w ill ever be of any real use to the Commonwealth; that is a matter for the future.

Are the Victorian Estimates submitted with any greater care or lucidity, or with more explanation, than is the case in the Commonwealth Parliament? then, without the establishment of the Committee, which must, of necessity, mean expense, we could adopt the recommendations. the last sixteen years that the Committee has recommended which we could not adopt without the appointment of a similar body? in both newspapers statements warmly commending some piece of work which the Committee here did only recently. sible, and I do not dispute the statement for a moment. Mr W. H . IBVINE -The Committee has rendered very valuable service during the whole of the time. that it may have done so. Certainly in the presentation of a Bill of this description the Ministerial side might have taken notice of those things, and given us an idea of what the Victorian Committee has recommended, and, if its recommendations do exist in the records, why cannot we adopt them, if they are an improvement on our present methods ? As a matter of fact, they are not. The Victorian Estimates are not presented in any better form than are those of the Commonwealth. nished ; no greater explanation is given. In that direction, it is reasonable to suppose that a Committee will be of very little, if of any, better use to the Commonwealth than it has been to the Victorian Parliament. tainty, however, that we shall follow on their particular lines. Pirst of all, the Committee will not be permitted to interfere with the Estimates. No Government would degrade themselves to that extent. No Government would give up their responsibility and their authority to the extent of permitting any Committee to interfere with the Estimates. In so far as the Estimates are concerned, all that a Committee can do is, after they are presented to the House and accepted, to go .through them in detail, and suggest some recommendations for the following year, which Parliament may, or may not, ap. prove ot. the expenditure. If they are, overlook the expenditure after it has been incurred, and there will be no saving in that direction, although it is possible that its recommendation may have Is there anything during the effect of preventing expenditure in a similar way in the future. However, generally speaking, the Committee will deal with accounts. If we take notice of what was said during the last elections by the Pusion side, at any rate, there is some justification for them bringing in this Bill, for, nominally, it will give effect to their election cries. The lie that was circulated by those gentlemen during election time was that this side of the House had been guilty of extravagance. That was assiduously circulated throughout the whole of the campaign, and, necessarily, honourable members opposite must do something to make the people believe that there was some justification for the inaccuracy. This measure, apparently, is to have that effect. So far as this year is concerned, it will be inoperative. One year will have gone by, just as it has done in respect of Tariff matters. A Committee can only be appointed a few days before Parliament is prorogued, and, if the Bill is left in its present form, the Committee will expire on the day that Parliament meets, in July, or whenever it may please the Ministry to call it together again. ThereNo more information is furfore, the Bill will not have accomplished anything this year; but honourable members on the other side will be able to say to their electors, "" We have appointed a Public Accounts Committee to look into the accounts.""

419,Mr Roberts,"This indicates, perthings, because it is clear, from the Estimates put in front of honourable members on this occasion, that there has been no consideration given to the important points mentioned in this pamphlet. I ask honourable members to listen to a passage on "" H o w the Post Office does not P y "" a The honourable gentleman goes on to show that last year there was, in the finances of the Post Office, a deficiency of £440,265. I do not intend to touch the details, but the statement is clothed in such language as to indicate that that deficiency ought not to have existed, that it was Something extraordinary, that the very fact of its being there necessitated a change of Administration. Honourable members would scarcely believe that, while the deficit last year was £'440,265, the deficit this year is £602,025, or £162,000 more, according to the honourable gentleman's own estimate, than was the actual deficit last year. Perhaps a Public Accounts Committee will look into the deficit of £440,265, deplored in extraordinary terms last year, and the deficit of £602,025 this year, glossed over with a lightness that is amazing. for Gippsland took his information from thab book. ber for Gippsland repeated these statements word for word, and deluded the electors in a similar manner. orable gentlemaD also says, in this bookTo this deficit must be added new works and (buildings, which means another ,£1,152,275, so that the total estimated deficit for the year (all of it chargeable to the revenue) is no less than Honourable members will scarcely believe it, but, in the hands of these geniuses, power, these great business men who jeer at us on this side and say that we are accustomed to deal with hundreds they deal with thousands, the total estimated deficit this year is £2,547,148, as against £1,592,540 hand's of these competents who jeer at us and allege that we knew nothing about -finance, who said that we were vagant and spent money regardless of -consequences, the total deficit on one Department alone, that of the Post Office, is £1,000,000 year. will possibly look into this, and no doubt will get a. c6py of The Financial foiits first food. I pass over details in deference to Mr Speaker's Wish, and come to one or two general statements. I find on page 28 this paragraphWhy we should go and do likewise. What do names mean? Is it necessary to overhaul our machinery in regard to such-like questions? I am firmly of that opinion. Take, as an. instance of its necessity, the huge increases in items such as "" Contingencies,"" The word is in quotation marks to emphasize it which in the Post Office alone has risen from ^450,000 ten years ago to £1,690,000 to-day. That is the criticism against the past A d ministration, alleging that contingencies, about which the honourable member for Gippsland so completely deluded a large number of electors, amounted to £1,090,000, and had risen at the rate of £64,000 per year for the past ten years. Listen to this:-Contingencie s this' year amount to £1,248,617 in the Post Office alone. through the Estimates. gencies amounted to £1,090,000; and, because of that, it was said there should be a change of M in is t r y; yet, in the same Department this year, we have an estimated expenditure of £1,248,617 on contingencies, or an increase for the year of The honno less than £158,617. Whereas the average increase for the last ten years was only £64,000 a year, the increase directly these financial giants come into power is £ 1 6 8 , 0 0 0; and, if au increase of £64,000 was suflicient to put one Ministry out of office, an increase of £168,000 financial should put about two and a-half Ministhese gentlemen of colossal tries out.

As we have seen already, this has increased during the past three years to an average of about 14 per cent. If tbe same average increase is maintained next year it means an additional expenditure of over £3,000,000. And the inquiry immediately starts, Where is the money to come from ? On these figures the prospect next year is that of an expenditure of some £25,000,000, with an income of about £21,000,000 with which to meet it . phetic, is it not? the honourable gentleman estimated that if the Eisher Government were l e f t in office the expenditure this year would be about £25,000,000, and that tliere would be an income of about £21,000,000. In round figures, that is what the income will be.; but when he has complete power, when he can do .as he likes, when he has everything in his hands and can say ""Yea, "" or "" N a y , "" and can stop expenditure, increase it or decrease it , his actual put. proposals this year amount to £2,200,000 more than he estimated the expenditure would be had tlie Fisher Government remained in office. I do hope the Committee of Public Accounts will inquire into this, and let us see what financial ability there happens to be on the Government side of the chamber. Perhaps, after all, we can let this Committee be appointed. But, so far as the B ill is'concerned, we can scarcely see if it will be useful or otherwise. preventing such glaringly misleading things as have deluded the electors, it will not be without value. If it exposes what has been done by certain people to secure election, if it enables the country to get a better and clearer understanding of what the finances are, and how they are handled, and whether this or that party has been true to its platform pledges, and whether the expenditure is justifiable, the Committee will not be without some use to the country. Treasurer, in submitting the B ill , should have told us what power he proposes to give to this Committee. I think he is wrong in suggesting that it Should die at the end .of each session. It will be preferable for the Committee to be elected for the whole of a Parliament, and it is absurd for tlie Treasurer to suppose that attention can be given to these matters in suggested, has long been a part of the Victorian the way it should be"" given, if the Commitadministrative machine, and has proved its great tee be once established., unless there is some remuneration, at any rate, for outof-pocket expenses. of-pocket expenses would be paid. Committee will have to be reasonably representative of the whole of the States. In other words, one man will bave to come from Western Australia, and one man from Queensland, New South Wales, or South Australia, as the case may be. I presume that will be the case. I do not know what Ministers will do, as they have given exhibitions of being able to do many things that are appalling; but at the present moment it is f a i r to assume that the Committee will be representative. It is impossible to suppose that any honourable member w ill , during the recess, come from a far State, or any other State but Yictoria-for practically all the work will be done in Victoria-unles s there is some reimbursement of the expense to which he is It will entail very heavy labour in deed for this Committee to do its work thoroughly, and unless it is done thoroughly it were better that it were not done at all. It will mean months of work when honourable members generally are in recess, when they are giving some attenT tion to their own businesses, and when they are relieved from the heavy and continuous duties that fall upon them in the House. It will be impossible for the Committee to do very much work when If it will have bhe effect of the House is sitting. The House sits on four days a week, and some honourable members have to travel 1,000 miles each week to attend here, and, as a rule, they . have very little time available even to thoroughly understand the Bills and proposals submitted. Therefore, the work of this proposed Committee must be done during the recess; and I know that professional men and business men will not go upon the Committee unless they are reimbursed But I think the their out-of-pocket expenses. I shall not go into details, but we find, on page 27 of The Financial Carnival, an indication of what is in the mind of the Prime Minister.

I thought the Bill would be generally acceptable to all honourable members; that there was a very strong opinion, if not a unanimous one, that a Committee of Accounts was very desirable, and, therefore, I cannot say that I took much trouble in preparing my notes for the second reading. I thought it was generally agreed that the Bill was very necessary. It certainly is a great advantage to have a Committee always at work investigating the public accounts, without having to appoint special Committees. This will be a standing power, which will be very useful from the point of view of the House. As far as the Treasury and the Departments generally are concerned, they do not require the appointment of such a Committee. They do not want any investigation more than that which obtains at the present time. any Committee of Public Accounts to investigate the actions of the Treasury.

If it is such good stuff it ought to have been of some value to him previously. It is not in the interests of the Treasury, or of the Departments, or of the Executive Government that this Bill has been introduced. It has been submitted solely in the public interest. We think that Parliament should have power to easily investigate anything connected with the public accounts. The Auditor-General has been mentioned during the course of this discussion. That officer has his own functions, which he will continue to discharge. His duties are to investigate every item of expenditure, to see that it has been voted by Parliament, to assure himself that there is a proper acquittance for it , and that it has been duly authorized by the Minister. When he has satisfied himself upon all these points he allows it to pass.' He does not go delving to see whether a particular vote was good policy on. the part of Parliament.

I have just looked into the powers which are conferred by law on the Public Accounts Committee of New South Wales.

The Committee is not necessarily in the nature of a standing Committee; it is a Committee, rather, to do what the authorities of ,the day, the administrators of the day, through the House, ask it to do.

I understood the Treasurer to say that there was no objection, when drawing up the Standing Orders, to enabling a sub-committee to do work of which the Committee as a whole would afterwards approve. that I did not think it was necessary to make such provision, but that I would consult the law officers on the subject. that instead of appointing the proposed Committee for a session it should be appointed for a whole Parliament. pointed out that it would be some time after the opening of a session before the Committee would be sufficiently familiar with the channels of inquiry to carry out its work expeditiously and successfully. I think the Treasurer now takes the view that the course pursued in New South Wales of appointing such a Committee for the whole of a Parliament is better than to appoint it for a session only. I think, with the honourable member for Hunter, that we must assume that the proposed Committee will consist of an equal number of members from both sides of the House. number should be equal, but nearly equal. so long as it is understood that it will not be a one-sided Committee, but will be so constituted as to secure the impartial consideration of all matters brought under its notice. sure that if a change of Government comes about 1 is appointed of an equal, or nearly equal, number of members from both sides of the House, we can assume that they will not make a party matter of their work. credit our opponents with the same desire to deal fairly as members of a Committee of this sort as I should claim for ourselves.

I am not hyperI critical as to the phraseology, so long as the Treasurer agrees that the Committee should be appointed for the Parliament, and not for a session only. I accept the honourable gentleman's assurance that in framing the Standing Orders power will be given to the Committee to divide itself into such sub-committees as may be found necessary. I move That the word "" session,"" line 5, be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" term of the Parliament."" The Treasurer in his speech in introducing the Bill this afternoon seemed to give a party colour to the measure. I interjected to that effect, and I am very pleased now to hear from the right honourable gentleman and the Prime Minister that that is not the intention of the Government. The remarks made by the Prime Minister have raised a somewhat serious position. If the Committee were appointed only for a session, and upon are we to inits reappointment there was a change of only one member made in the personnel, it occurs to me that that would be rea Committee garded as a very serious reflection upon the member who was rejected. I think it would be a very great mistake to adopt the Prime Minister's suggestion and appoint the proposed Committee for a session only.

It would be much better-, I think, if we could find a way to get over that objection, and at the same time to give stability to the Committee.

The Committee will make investigations and suggest an improved method of handling the finances. It may, for instance, recommend the presentation of the Budgeti n another form. It may make very important recommendations in connection with other Departments after it has called expert evidence, but after it has done all that, its report will become the property of the House, and help to inform honourable members in dealing with the finances. The Committee w ill not in any sense involve the Government. It cannot involve the Government or the Opposition. All that it can do is to criticise, and, perhaps, sometimes to criticise adversely, the way in which the finances are handled.

I can conceive of nothing which would so destroy the work of the Committee as to interfere with the personnel during its operations. Wimmera w ill , I think, on consideration see that, if the life of the Committee were limited to one session, it would frustrate the very thing that he wishes to secure, and that is to get its members to take an intense interest in the work and give us something tangible. points to show that they were worthy of consideration.

The value of a recommendation would lie in the fact that a majority of the Coinmittee was against the Government who were handling the finances. That, I think, would be a most commendable thing. It might, however, be awkward for the Government. It might submit their financial administration and critical review, but so far as the House is concerned, such a recommendation would have additional value by reason of that very fact. WhatI believe honourable members on each side wish to obtain through the appointment of the Committee is an honest administration of the finances, irrespective of what Government may be in power.
