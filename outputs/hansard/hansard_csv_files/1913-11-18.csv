Referred to Committee of Supply. there is reported a speech made at Balthere, and the quotation of my remarks larat last night by Senator Millen, _ in by Senator Millen, as reported in the which he refers to me in the following press, is not accurate. ! terms' Speakers in that hall had made it appear that Ballarat, I said, "" The Hansard proof tained applause from Labour supporters at the regularly sent out in the ordinary way back.) It had been announced that Mr Fisher and Mr Hughes would speak inBallarat-,. but, as a matter of fact-(interruption)Mr Fisher and Mr Hughes had both refused in. Parliarefuge in the subterfuge that there was no prpuf he had said anything at all. (Laughter.) Mr Hughes had said, ""We have no knowledge he made that statement at a l l ; it is a statement made in a newspaper."" They would readily understand how it was ""that Mr Hughes found it inconvenient to attend the recent meeting at Ballarat. That is not an accurate presentation of my attitude, nor is there anything in my speech on t i e motion of the Prime Minister for the suspension of the honourable member for Ballarat that warranted what was said by Senator Millen. The words quoted appear on page 3000 of the Hansard report, and record an observation made by me on a point of order. I was contending that the matter should be dealt with in accordance with standing order 285. When dealing with the merits of the case, in speaking to the motion for suspension, If u l l y justified tbe exercise of the right of free speech by the honourable member for Ballarat. I did not pretend to express an opinion on the merits of his statement in reference to your alteration of Hansard, Mr Speaker, although I said that technically you had altered Hansard. On page 3029 of the Hansard report, these words occurIt is alleged against the bonorable member 18 November, 1018. that he said you were biased; that is not by any means unusual in those holding judicial and presidential offices, as I have said; that you altered Hansard; technically, you admit it ; that you have lost the confidence of the House. I do not think it is saying too much to say that you have lost the confidence of half tbe House. In those circumstances, what has the honourable member for Ballarat said for which he is to be punished in this way? I repudiate, therefore, the interpretation placed upon my utterances by Senator Millen. As for it being inconvenient for me to go to Ballarat, it was .because I was unwell that I did not go there. I have never found it inconvenient for any' other reason to go anywhere to say what I thought. gard to the report of. last night's meeting at Ballarat, that I was not asked to go In the Age of to-day to Ballarat, and did not promise to go In dealing with the case of the honourable member for",12,Setup

Those sheep have turned up. in the course of their peregrinations at Anthony's Lagoon, and when seen by the Administrator, were in tip-top condition. of External Affairs think, in view of his answer to the preceding question, that it would be more in the interests of the Commonwealth for Commonwealth officers in the Northern Territory to remain in the settled places rather than do exploratory work in the interior; and, secondly, does he think it advisable to give such answers as to mislead people outside Australia who do not know that this is a vast country, and needs pioneering work? the honourable member thinks misleading in the answer I gave to the honourable member for Parkes.

An Act was brought in by Mr B. R. Wise, and although it was practically murdered by tlie legal profession, it had very beneficial results.

I have tried to discover from the speeches so far delivered in this debate by honourable members on the other side what object they have in supportingfchisBill. I find fchat the honourable members for Hume, Riverina, and Robertson, have taken up the cudgels on behalf of the Government in this matter, and we know that they are connected with rural districts. Their support of this measure is due to their opposition to the formafciou of rural workers unions. They are themselves members of the Pastoralists Association, and also of the Farmers and Settlers Association. They consider it necessary fco belong fco tliese associations in order to conserve and protect their own interests, yet they are not prepared to give their employees the same privilege. That seems to me a selfish and discreditable position for honourable members to occupy. The Attorney-General will nofc disagree with me when I say fchafc the Pastoralists Association and the Farmers and Settlers Association are political associations.

They ask for concessions which are not asked for by any other section of the community. They ask to have railways 'built to their own doors; and when they secure the construction of a railway, they then ask for reductions of freights, and for the erection of accommodation at railway stations and storehouses in Sydney for the protection and storage of their products. These are the people who object to their employees, having the benefits of organization. There are. no people in the Commonwealth who are in greater need of organization than are the employees of the rural industries. years ago, when Joseph. Arch rose up in England, altliough fie was only an ordinary labourer, he was able, in a few months, to organize 100,000 people, and he received assistance from Lord Shaftesbury, Cardinal Manning, and such men. In my opinion, our rural districts will never be properly settled until the rural workers are organized. We cannot expect yeomanry to settle permanently in those districts while the conditions of employment are unfit for human beings. Only a few days ago I saw a reference to this matter in the London Times. That is an indication of its importance. The London Times takes up the cudgels on behalf of our rural workers, whose conditions are such that they should not be tolerated in any country. The Times directs attention to the fact that advertisements have appeared in metropolitan journals calling for married couples without encumbrance for the rural districts, and points to the fact that intending emigrants are not invited to bring tlieir families to Australia. This is one of the reasons why we do not obtain immigrants to fill vacant situations in our rural districts. Our friends on the other side who represent the rural districts are earnestly supporting the Government on this B ill in order to indicate their opposition to the organization of rural workers, although they are aware that workers in the cities, where organization is not so necessary, possess all the advantages of organization. merely a placard brought forward by the Government; and if it were not for the serious principle involved, it would be better for honourable members on this side, and the Opposition in another place, to let the measure go through. If t h a t were done, the Government would bel e f t on their beam-ends, and would be at a loss to know what to do. card, and would have nothing to put in the political window when they went to tlie country. It is strange that honourable members who represent farming districts should be supporting the Government in connection with this B ill . All the friends of Democracy in the agricultural districts of the Commonwealth will be found supporting honourable members on this side when they learn that the real ground for the support of this B ill Many is opposition to the proposal to grant to rural workers the benefits which members representing rural districts themselves'receive as members of organizations. Why should the rural workers of Australia be deprived of these benefits? I am at a loss to understand how any honourable members possessed of the instincts of manhood or of any sense of justice can in this National Parliament propose to deprive the citizens of one portion of Australia of privileges enjoyed by the citizens of other portions of the Commonwealth. ' I heard an honourable member on the other side express the opinion that honourable members on this side, who are connected with Labour organizations and champion the formation of unions in the rural districts, ought to go to a phrenologist to get their heads felt. I am quite prepared to submit to that test. A t the same time, I feel sure that were some honourable gentlemen on the other side, especially leading officers of the Farmers and Settlers' Association, to have their bumps felt by a phrenologist, they would be very sorry afterwards for having gone through that ordeal. Some -charges have been made against this side by honourable members opposite in regard to the use of moral suasion, the using of bricks, and the dousing of men in tanks three or four times, but I do not think that all their accusations compare with the declaration of a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales, that if a member of a ThisB ill is union came on his property he would shoot him. That is an example of the sort of gentlemen who run the Farmers and Settlers' Association, and who are represented by some honourable members on the other side, although Ehey talk about ' liberty and the concessions they wish to",17,Government Preference Prohibition Bill
59,Mr Austin Chapman,Ho w is that?,18,Government Preference Prohibition Bill
60,Mr West,"They would have no plagive to others. In my opinion, honourable gentlemen who are anxious to shoot those who differ from them or endeavour to form associations to better their conditions are hardly fit to decide whether the Government should have the assistance of a Bill of this sort to deal with Government employees. The Attorney-General, in his speech, stated that the unions did not become political organizations until 1890. He is not well acquainted with the history of Labour organizations, otherwise he would not have made that mistake. It was in 1868 that the first attempt was made to make Labour organizations political, and the attempt was made at a very important congress, which was held at Leeds, and which I remember very well. Very many proposals were submitted to this Trades Union Congress, which was assembled after the struggles and the strikes in England in the early sixties to endeavour to better the conditions of the men. It had been found impossible to attain that result by means of the ordinary craft unions, and it was necessary to make a departure in order to bring about any improvement. iu 1868, at Leeds, the first Parliamentary Committee was appointed to deal with the matter of legislation. In 1874, the first Labour members were sent to the British Parliament. to-datedness of Labour in New South Wales, I may mention that 1874 was the first year in which we sent to Parliament a Labour representative, in the person of Mr Angus and several others stood for the position, but were not successful. It will be seen that the Attorney-General was a little out in his calculation'. If he feels 1 disposed to ascertain the actual facts, he can easily obtain the information, or, if he wishes, I . can give him information which will satisfy him that he was entirely in error in making the statement he end as to the advent of Labour bodies into the political arena. Let me point out to the Government oue of the reasons in favour of preference to unionists. When an award is made in a Court-, or an agreement is made between two bodies, in order to insure the payment of certain wages, it is absolutely necessary that prebe that the Government should always be ference to unionists should be given. Unless there is a strong organization to see that the employers pay the wages fixed by an award, there is no one to exercise any control over the employers, Mr West. whereas thc members of a trade union can always make sure that the prescribed rates are paid. It is a great consideration to a contractor to know when he is tendering for a work that he is tendering on an equality as to wages with other contractors. Ho wants every man who tenders with him to be compelled to pay the ruling wages. When preference is granted in a trade, the contractor'knows that he is tendering on equal terms with others. Anyone who, like myself, has been associated with Government contracts is awaro that some Government contractors are not over-honest, or not very anxious to allow the current wages and conditions. If the Government are to revert to the contract system, there ought to be a provision in every contract that the contractor shall pay the union rates of wages and observe the union hours and conditions. Otherwise some contractors will get an advantage at the expense of others, because they will not pay what others are always prepared to pay. I know contractors in New South Wales who always So work in connection with the Labour bodies, and who have always been prepared to pay the current wages and to recognise the conditions of the trade. Our struggles in the past have not turned To show the upon the question of wages, for that has been a mere cipher in the situation. We have never worried about the rates of wages. Our greatest and longest fights have been regarding the conditions of the trade or Cameron. Mr Garrard calling concerned, because a union can always get the rates of wages increased. The great trouble has always been to improve the conditions of the trade or calling. The Government should set an example in that respect. They ought to see that the wages and conditions of Government employees are the best in the country, and Ministers ought, I think, to take into consideration what conditions they would like to work under themselves if similarly placed. It does seem to me a retrograde step to withdraw preference from unionists. I am confident that this measure will never be approved by the people of Australia. I feel sure that were they consulted their verdict would the best employers in the country, and allow the best conditions to their employees, and so set an example to all employers. If the Government will not pursue that «ourse, who is likely to set an example? Indeed, who can better set an example than can the Government? It does not -seem to me that under this Bill provision is to be made for the enforcement of union conditions under all contracts. In -Great Britain there is hardly a governing bodyI refer to the London County Oouncil and similar bodies-dealin g with public utilities, which is not imposing upon a contractor the conditions of a trade or calling. Wo in Australia are supposed to be advanced in Labour matters. We were well advanced until the' present Government came into power, and then, as every one knows, progress was arrested. I think that it can well be called the ""Backward Government,"" because it is taking a step backward not to adhere to existing labour conditions. We have not yet heard a word from the Government of any loss having accrued to Australia from the grant of preference to unionists, "" all other things being equal."" It has not been shown that the people have lost anything by reason of that policy. I think that the people of Australia, if consulted, would admit that the country has gained, because the conditions of labour have been made suitable to human beings. In support of that view, I have only to refer to the operations of the Saddle and Harness Factory. allowed a week's holiday nt Christmas time.

If , instead of bringing in two puny measures not worthy of men occupying seats in this National Parliament, the Government had brought in some national measures, to which the people could pay some respect I refer to measures dealing with great questions which the people are anxious to have dealt with-the y would have provided subjects for reflection by the people at the next general election. Measures of this description form only a subject of merriment to persons outside this House who pay any regard to progressive legislation. Of course, the Government came into office unexpectedly, and that circumstance may possibly be urged as an apology for their inaction. But apart from that consideration, they are unable to submit any legislative proposals of an encouraging character to the people of Australia. When the latter take up their newspapers, and read the text of this and other Bills which are put before us, they must wonder how they came to commit the mistake which they did on the 31st May last. However, I do not think it will be long before they will remedy that mistake. Honourable members opposite appear to imagine that because there is a so-called Liberal Government in office they can break up the trade unions and Labour organizations of this continent. The idea is a preposterous one. There is no possibility of them giving effect to their will. The tendency of the Its employees are present age is towards organization. The whole trend of Democracy is towards organization. It is only in our rural districts, where the electors do not get an opportunity of hearing members like myself, that my honourable friends opposite can score a victory. One supporter of the Government stated some time ago that I represent an electorate which is so small that if I got at one end of it with a graphophone, I could, through the medium of that instrument, address the whole of my constituents. Thafc is the very reason why I am here. The people of that electorate are able to hear my voice, and to judge me by my expressions of political faith. If members of the Labour party had only the same facilities for addressing the electors in the rural areas that they have in the metropolitan constituencies, honourable members opposite would cease to exist politically, and there would be insufficient accommodation on the other side of the House for the members of my own party.

If it be ference to unionists, because he knows that the recognition of that principle affords him a security that other contractors with whom he has to compete will pay the standard rate of wages. I speak from the experience of years. I recollect the trouble which was experienced before preference to unionists was recognised in the building trade. tion Court gave its award many contractors used to pay lower wages to their employees than they should have paid. Honourable members opposite must recognise that it is utterly impossible for us to vote for this Bill. It is merely a challenge which is thrown out to our party, with a view to occupying the time of the House, because the Government have not a sufficiently adequate conception of the requirements of Australia to enable them to bring forward measures of national importance. Instead of doing that, they submit these tin-pot Bills. the measures which were passed at the instance of the Fisher Governmentmeasures like the Maternity Bonus Bill -which they were going to cut up piecenieal, and of which they intended to make sausages? Why do they not attack the Commonwealth note issue or our Defence Act? They say not a word about them. Instead they submit a miserable weakling of a measure such as that which is now under consideration. I say that the Bill should be contemptuously rejected, especially as a regulation is in existence by means of which my honourable friends have already abolished preference to unionists. The measure is, therefore, a superfluity. I am quite convinced that honourable members opposite are not anxious to go to the country, and to allow the people to judge between us. General himself has admitted that the Bill is not required, seeing that preference to unionists has already been abolished by Executive act. If my honourable friends could wipe out trade unions and Labour organizations by regulation to-morrow, they would do it without hesitation. As I pointed out in my opening remarks this Bill will not affect professional men. If the Government wish to secure the services of a medical man, they will have to accept those of a member of the British Medical Association. No member of that association would enter the same room in which another medical man whowas not Mr West. necessary for members of the Britisb Medical Association to uphold the dignity of their profession, how much more so is it necessary in the case of the ordinary mechanic?

Until the ArbitraOne of the objects of trade unions is to maintain a high standard of competency amongst their members. To my mind, the Government have not thought over this matter. Had they done so the Bill before us would never have been introduced, because its aim is to minimize the power and prestige of the industrial organizations which have sprung up in our midst. In trying to pass a measure of this kind the Government are endeavouring to murder the progress of these bodies. They know that they will lose support Where are just as the membership of these organizations increases. The Government and their supporters know very ""well how men are educated by taking an interest in trade unions and other associations. The man who joins and takes an active interest in a friendly society or a progress association, or who becomes an alderman; is far more intelligent and is better able to understand the ethics of politics than is the man who isolates himself and takes no interest in public affairs. The man who joins one of these associations is, because of the education he thus obtains, a better citizen and a far better father than is the man who holds aloof. He becomes a more valuable asset to the community. He learns to exercise his faculties, and does not hesitate to condemn those who differ from him. In short, he soon acThe Attorneyquires all those attributes which are essential to good citizenship. These are the Bort of men we ought to encourage. But the Government, recognising that such men are not likely to vote for reactionaries, are aiming a blow at industrial organization. A t the last general election I stigmatized the present Government But that is beyond their power. party as' a party of stagnation, and I feel that I spoke the truth in thus describing them. Let us consider for a moment the position of those who live in rural districts. Should we not make some effort to improve the condition of life in the country? The question is one that must be faced. The London Timet pointed out. in a paragraph, some time ago, that a large number of men were leaving tbe rural districts of Great Britain, and were not sending for tbeir wives and children. The trouble was that they could not send for them because they could not secure housing accommodation where they obtained work. Por a number of years we have seen in the newspapers advertisements offering employment on a station to a man and wife "" with no encumbrance."" That is one of the most disastrous policies of which we can conceive. do they care ? like myself, is a student, and can readily supply an answer to my question. But no reply is forthcoming from the Government side of the House. members opposite are trying to destroy these organizations because they know that if the rural workers were organized this sort of thing would never be tolerated. Our rural districts will never be populated as they ought to be until some improvement is made in the lot of the workers. A t the present time, perhaps, a man and his wife, in answer to an advertisement in which it is stipulated that there shall be "" n o encumbrance,"" obtain employment in a rural district. But, by and by, when a little one arrives, the husband has to return to the city, because he can only obtain employment there. of mine from the Old Country, after spending four months at the Hawkesbury College, went into rural districts to work, but returned to Sydney because they could not tolerate the conditions. Some of them have since gone to America. They had hoped to obtain, land there, but they had a better chance of getting underneath than "" on "" the land. They were asked £3,000 for a farm, when they had not 3,000 pence. bers opposite support this measure to show their opposition to the organization of the workers. How would one of them like to take his wife and family into any rural district, having regard to the accommodation at present available there? Until we take steps to improve the condition of the rural districts they must continue to be hotbeds of discontent, humiliation, and everything that tends to make life unendurable. This improvement can be brought about. "" c a n ' t "" is unknown to trade unionists. Many years ago, when I used to mount a tar barrel or a gin case at street corners and advocate the application of the eight hours system to the bakery trade, I was told that it was impossible. But we got eight hours for the bakers, and by dint of much perseverance, we also obtained eight hours for the shop assistants, although we were told at first that such a thing could not be thought of. Unionists never use the word "" c a n ' t "" in .this respect. Representatives of country districts on the Government side of the House should t u r n down this B i ll and disI f it means money, what play a little humanitarianism.

A contractor can easily reckon up quantities, and so forth; but, in tendering, labour is somewhat of a lottery, unless the condition of preference is made to apply all round. I do not think that legislation such as that now proposed redounds much to the credit of the Government or the Parliament. Surely there are great national questions in preference to a trumpery matter of this kind to which the Attorney-General and his colleagues might devote their abilities! It is said that there has been some abuse of the privileges of unionism; but not a word of evidence in this connection have we yet heard. We cannot think for a moment that the Government will not pay the current rates of wages and observe union conditions, although there is no doubt that this'Bill will afford them the opportunity to do so.

Mr W. H . IRVINE -Hear, hear ! Contradictory. ingly contradictory. In the course of an impassioned speech by the Leader of the Opposition, the Bill was denounced as a fiendish device for the destruction of industrial unionism. On the other hand, the honourable members for West Sydney, Bendigo, and Darling found even their extensive vocabularies quite unequal to the expression of ridicule and contempt that they sought to pour on this Bill because of its futility, uselessness, and insignificant character. The honourable member for West Sydney regarded the Bill as a mere shadow of a shadow, and the honourable member for Bendigo referred to it as a legislative farce, while the honourable member for Darling described it as a harmless and insignificant attempt at legislation. Notwithstanding all this, however, the Bill has occasioned much white heat and passion on the other side; and the reason is obvious. This Bill is introduced in obedience to a mandate from the country, and, what is more to the point, it is thrown down as the gage of battle, with the determination and intention that the country itself should have an opportunity of confirming, or otherwise, an important fundamental principle. It is .this which causes so much unhappiness amongst honourable members opposite. .

If it helps to pass this B ill through the House, and the Caucus decrees its rejection in the Senate, the people will be able, at the earliest moment, to give, not a futil e decision, such as would be the only result of an appeal in the event of a single dissolution, but an effective decision applicable to both Houses. ber for Bendigo, and the ex-Attorney General, went to a lot of trouble to show that the B ill is unnecessary. it is at least the declaration of a fundasure repeals, so far as it goes, the Conmental principle. that justice and fair play were outraged by the last Government in giving effect to its policy of preference to unionists, and the B ill has been introduced in purthe statement that the B ill w i ll permit of' suance of a promise made by the Prime Minister, to prevent, so far as possible, that occurring again in the future. admit that, so long as a LiberalA d ministration is in power, the need for the B ill is minimized; but we want to make sure, by solemn statutory enactment, by Parliament itself, that the iniquitous and infamous system of preference to unionists shall not be adopted again, should a Socialist Government, in the remote future, get office. The honourable member for Bendigo said that, if the B ill became law, its provisions could be secretly evaded; but a serious reflection as the remark implies on the members of the Labour party. I think that the obligations of an Act of the Legislature of the counpreference to unionists, so far as temtry would be honorably recognised, and that if the Government of the day wished for a change of system, they would take the responsibility of introducing an amending B ill . According to the honourable member for Bendigo, this B ill is useless, from a legal point of view, but I do not agree with his contention. Commonwealth Conciliation and A r bitration Act of 1904-11 declares that an industrial dispute means an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State, and includes any dispute as to industrial matters, and any dispute in relation to employment in an industry carried on by, or under the control of, the The Commonwealth or a State, or any public authority constituted under the Commonwealth or a State. Section 40 of the Act provides that a limited preference may be granted by an award of the Courti n respect to any dispute coming before it . The law, therefore, now provides for the granting of preference to unionists by the Court, though, of course, its application is limited, so f a r as the Commonwealth is concerned, to commercial enterprises undertaken by the Government. But this measure, when it The honourable membecomes law, will declare that, so f a r as Government employment is concerned, preference to unionists must not be perI say that mitted.

79,Sir Robert Best,"That Governi t is the last Government alone that is responsible. Darling dealt in a mild-mannered way with the subject of unionism, about .which he is well qualified to speak. His-speech, however, was apologetic. One of the main premises on which his argument was founded was that unions are a law-making authority, having the right to impose taxation. He endeavoured to sustain that position in various ways. I admit that unionists are obsessed with the idea that the unions are a law-making and taxing authority, but this is an outrageous claim. The State alone is the law-making authority of the community, and it alone has the right to apply compulsion. Even the organization with which the honourable member for Darling is so prominently identified seeks, at times, to take the law into its own hands, and to dictate tyrannically to the community. It is within the knowledge of all that many of these political organizations have defied the civil authority, and substituted mob rule, and held up the Government of the country. . According to the honourable member, the trade unions claim no monopoly in regard to work and employment; but, if unionism means anything in our daily experience, it means insistence on monopoly of work and employment for the members of unions. It is regarded as a crime for any one to remain outside the unions connected with any particular industry. The honourable member, speaking of coercion, saidParenthetically I may remark that coercion may be a good thing. No doubt the honourable member He was referring to the honourable member for Parkesis much better than he otherwise would have been, because of the canings he got when a boy. The honourable member also saidMoreover, coercion is not an evil thing.

Eor instance, the honourable member for Darling saysI suggest to my honourable friends opposite that there may be some good in a certain amount of coercion. However, later on, he saysI do not advocate coercion, and I say that cases of the kind are always exaggerated. He does not advocate coercion on the principle of "" D o not put him under the pump,"" but, reading the speech of the honourable member, as we listened to it in the Chamber, it is quite obvious that he maintains that coercion is largely justified. In fact, the honourable member indicated, to a certain extent, the scale of coercion that he thought might fairly be approved of. him under the pump, but put him in the horse-trough."" member for Darling justified the coercion that had been adopted. He referred to a case where a friend of his had dipped a man three times, and the honourable member said that it was discovered that three immersions of the kind were calculated to bring about the proper conversion and clothe the man in his right mind. WhatI wish to urge is that the leaders of any particular party, whether on one side or the other, cannot afford to trifle with law and order and cannot/ afford to refer lightly to acts of violence, as the very constitution of our government depends on the observance of this. My friend quotes with triumph an instance where 50,000 men wereconcerned, and there was but one case of coercion, which case the honourable member seeks to justify as quite a reasonable thing, and something which might not be considered as either here or there-bu t that case of violence was of the greatest importance to the victim concerned, and liberty and protection are at least' as sacred to the individual as to the association. I have always stood by industrial unionism; I have always been anxious to support in every way organization of a voluntary character, and I believe every member on this side of the Coercion and tyranny House is prepared to aid and encourage voluntary organization, yet these voluntary organizations have their responsibilities ; they have no greater liberty than",24,Government Preference Prohibition Bill

Every individual is entitled to be protected by the community as a whole. If that condition does not obtain, it means disruption of government and the substitution of anarchy. The next point which was made by the honourable member for Darling was when he sought, in a very insidious fashion, to justify discrimination between non-unionists. He did not say it was necessarily a crime to be a non-unionist, but he contended that the men who should be despised are a particular class of non-unionists. He refers to them in his speech in this wayThose to whom we apply strong epithets are the anti-unionists, who for pay-and , in some cases, because of slavish instincts-tur n against of this, although peace and harmony obtheir fellow men. The anti-unionists whom we denounce so strongly are the men who refuse to join the unions, and wbo stand by the employers in times of trouble-the strike breakers. Then he goes on to say that only a small number of anti-unionists exist. This discrimination is made with a design and purpose, and is calculated to mislead us, and the track. It is a discrimination which is not justified. tyranny, and coercion that have unfortunately been a part of our daily knowledge for many years past has been directed against non-unionists indiscriminately. It has been a crime to be a non-unionist, and acts of violence have not been confined to those in the special pay of employers as strike-breakers or anti-unionists. pared to say this, but I am prepared to prove it from what must be within the knowledge of honourable members. A few months ago, as honourable members well remember, there occurred that colossal strike known as the Barrier strike. Some 4,000 or 5,000 employees engaged by the various companies at BrokenH ill were working under awards of Courts, and under conditions which were quite satisfactory; harmony prevailed between employers and employees. But the Barrier Labour Federation conceived the fiendish idea that a crusade should be launched against non-unionists. It so happens that there is a line of tramway or railway some 36 miles in length, known as the Silverton tramway, connecting BrokenH ill with the South Australian railway system, over which line the ore concentrates and supplies are carried, and it was found that a number of officers, consisting of clerks, stationmasters, and inspectors, working on that tramway did not belong to any union, so the Barrier Labour Federation sent to the various unions associated under the Federation requesting that resolutions be passed insisting that certain financial pence cards should be produced by everybody. The resolutions to that effect were passed, and were made to apply to the Silverton tramway. It is a privately owned concern, and the directors controlling the line determined that seven of their confidential clerks should not be permitted to join a union. The clerks ' had no desire to do so. In consequence tained all over BrokenH ill at the time, war was declared, and an attempt made to dragoon into a union these innocent non-unionists, men who were carrying on * their ordinary avocations outside all industries, and who were engaged, for the most part, in clerical occupations. They refused, and were supported by their directors. W h a t was the result? Prothrow us completely off posals were made to seize the tramway, lawlessness was rif e every day, and a All the violence, reign of terror established. Mark the wickedness of the conception of those people who conducted the strike. Nothing would satisfy them, but that they should picket the houses of those unfortunate officers. Not only that, but they sought to starve them and their families out by boycotting the various shopkeepers and tradesmen who attempted to furnish them Not only am I prewith supplies. And there was never one word of repudiation from the leaders of the party on the other side, of this chamber. This is but typical of the way in whicb the Labour party silently countenanced violence and breaches of law and order. They watched all this going on without so much as a word of public protest. The honourable member for Barrier watched it with great equanimity, but there was not. a word from any of them. at BrokenH ill .

Yet the strike was wantonly organized in order to dragoon them into the various unions. was made on these men, they were treated to all sorts of indignities and all sorts of threats of violence, in accord with the up-to-date methods of the most advanced of unionists.' When this wanton strike was taking place, my friends opposite had the fullest opportunity of repudiating it, but there was no attempt on their part to do so. clusively how unwarranted is the suggestion of the honourable member for Darling that these attempts at coercion are only made as against anti-unionists and strikebreakers. The case I have referred to is only typical-the facts are beyond dispute -bu t it can be multiplied many times over.

In 1890, in face of the fiercest opposition, I publicly stood by the industrial unions of that day in their great fight, and I assisted them, because I believed that they were within their rights from an industrial stand-point. I have consistently -done the same; but that strike taught -me one important lesson-and that was how urgent was the necessity for arbitration. That strike was largely justified by reason of the fact that at the time there were no industrial tribunals available to settle the differences in dispute. As a matter of fact, I and many others concentrated every effort and energy on bringing aboub the passage of an arbitration 'measure at the earliest possible opportunity afterwards. -did better in Victoria; we carried a Bill providing for industrial tribunals, known as our Wages Boards, which answered all our purposes. That was in 1896. I was a member of the Government that introduced tliat measure, so that my houorable friend was reckless and inaccurate when he launched that suggestion against me. I have practically demonstrated my sympathy with industrial unionism, and what I say for myself can be repeated by nearly every member, if not every member, sitting on this A wanton attack side of the House. Therefore, this nonsensical talk from the other side about this Bill indicating a determination on the part of the Attorney-General and the Government to strike a blow at industrial unionism is so much claptrap, which may be safe enough to use for ad captandum appeals at public meetings to political unionists, but is unworthy of repetition All this goes to show conin a deliberative assembly like this. The reason we protest against the present system of political unionism is that we realize that for the legitimate efforts of the old trade unions have been substituted tyranny, the boycott, coercion, and violence. Honourable members opposite have rejoiced in the fact that the old trade unions have now become political unions. That fact in itself should prove a death-knell to the opposition to the present measure, because, if they are political were as big an unions able member for Darling, the ex-Attorney General, and numerous other members who have addressed the House .have admitted that the present combinations are political unions.

If it does not mean that, it means nothing. Our hearts went out in sympathy to the honourable member for Bendigo when we heard his pathetic efforts to separate himself from the Syndicalists and strikers. In endeavouring to do so he undertook a very big order. If he repudiates the Syndicalists, he repudiates a very substantial section of his own following. They do not like to be called Syndicalists, but they are. He sought to sever himself, as I say, from the Syndicalist and striker.

Reardon, secretary of the General Labourers Union, saidI am not going to be dragooned into supporting an insane strike of this sort, even if I have to go out of the Labour movement bemy refusal.

C , who is directly interested in about half-adozen industrial unions in Christchurch, being permanent secretary of the Hotel Employes Union, member of the executive of the Stonemasons Union, and president of the Cyclemakers Union, was reported to have saidI have never been in favour of the federation of Labour, nor am I a member of the United Labour Party, as I have not approved of organization or funds for trade unions being used for political purposes. It is left open for members of trade unions or any other one to join the Labour party, but I have always considered that there is no justification for forcing members to subscribe to any political party or platform. I believe Mr Reardon to be absolutely correct in the statement that the men are fighting for their own existence, and that the waterside workers' and the other unions have become mere pawns in the game. AH the unions have been mere pawns in the game from the outset. There is no one who has the least bit of knowledge of the matter but is aware that had there been men at the head of affairs whose first concern was the workers' dispute, it would never have gone beyond the Waterside Workers, nor would it have lasted beyond the second day from the outset. The leaders of the Federation of Labour and their supporters in the' Waterside Workers' Union have shown themselves to be utterly incompetent to lead to other than destruction. They have set the prairie on fire, and now, as Mr Reardon pointed out, are fighting for their own existence. The Arbitration Act itself, to which the Federation has been a l l along so -strongly opposed, is now in very serious danger. It is for that reason that I support the attitude of Mr Reardon, as, with him, I see danger to organizations that took many years of drudgery to build up-organization s that never would have -existed but for the Act. from the outset there has been no occasion to -strike. Agreements were broken when the Federation's own constitution was ignored, but that is not surprising, as the wreckers in charge are incapable of holding to the rules, even of their own making, at the present moment. A position created by the incapacity of those allowed to lead is now being used to justify the continuance and extension of the trouble. There is an indication of what is taking place in New Zealand. Honourable members opposite say, "" This may be so, bufc look afc our own Arbitration Court and its wonderful success.

The award of the Arbitration Court did not touch the question of manning owing to its being provided for in the Navigation .Bill. I u this case the Adelaide Steamship Company had-to concede the demands of the men. But the most flagrant case' occurred in Sydney. The Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers' Eederation were working under an industrial agreement that had been solemnly entered into, signed, and duly filed under the Arbitration Act. TJnder the terms of that agreement they received something like .Is, 3d. per hour.

They were under an agreement, as I have said, solemnly entered into and filed under our existing arbitration law, but they decided to flout and defy the law already quoted, and committed this breach of the agreement with deliberation. I should like to get from my honourable friends opposite, and particularly from the honourable member for Bendigo, any statements showing that there was any repudiation of this flagrant breach of the law and of an agreement entered into by the Waterside Workers Eederation.

Some Labour unions passed resolutions to the effect that the High Court should be abolished. Whilst a section of my honourable friends opposite are determined to annihilate arbitration as soon they possibly can dent Workers of the World.

IRVINE -The difficulty is is not corthat some of your colleagues do not agree with you. that -the Labour party do not believe in strikes. In 1890 the party decided, at the request and on the advice of many of the employers, to try to bring about reforms on constitutional lines, to abandon the old barbarous method of the strike. From 1890 to the present time we, as a party, have pursued that course. It is, I think, the greatest tribute to the working men of Australia that they abandoned the old method of the strike, and handed over their future to a Judge whose environment was entirely, different from their own. In that connection, I wish to quote some remarks which Sir George Reid made on the 6th August, 1903, when the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was under consideration. On page 3186 of Hansard he saidBut, from the aspect of things as they are, it seems to me that it reflects infinite credit upon the Labour bodies of Australia that tbey are willing to entrust their liberty-aye , even their subsistence-to judicial decision.

I cannot conceive fchafc he would so go back upon his trade union principles and the preference which he has advocated year affcer year for a life-time. this measure we see the hand of the A t torney-General, as it was seen a few years ago in Victoria, when he introduced his coercion measures. .Bufc, thank God, sirand this is our consolation-ever y measure of a coercive nature which he passed through bhe Sfcafce Parliament has been wiped off the statute-book since he l e f t the Legislative Assembly. This measure is an indication of what may happen here iu the future. fche statute-book if it is ever passed. a little time ago you spoke on the matter of trade unionism on a question very apropos of what we are dealing with today. You made some very sensible remarks, which are to be found on page 7655 of Hansard, volume XXIV . Speaking on the 30th November, 1904, you saidWhat would be said if , in matters pertaining certain section of the community from having access to our Courts of law? A very exceptional case, indeed, would require to be made out before the public would tolerate such a condition of affairs. I recognise that at the present time it is almost impossible to extend to domestic servants the benefits which this B ill will confer upon other classes. That, however, The is no reason why we should deliberately exclude them from its operation. I say that we should give them the right to appeal to the Courti f they wish to do so. If they are so blind to their own interests that they refuse to organize, the fault will rest with themselves. Personally, I think that, with an increasing sense of their responsibility, they will be induced to organize at no distant date. Those who oppose the granting of a preference to unionists wish to impose upon the applicants, as a condition precedent to the extension of any such preference, the obligation of proving that they represent a majority of those who will be affected by any award of the Court. I wish to know why they should be obliged to establish any such affirmation. The question to be considered by the Court, in dealing with an application for preference, is simply whether the applicants have a just claim. If a preference were extended to a very conI take it siderable number, some of the non-unionists might very well object that it would seriously interfere with their prospects of employment; but where the organization making application comprised only a minority of those engaged in the occupation which it represented, I , as a non-unionist, should regard that rather as an advantage than a disadvantage. It should be shown, at all events, in a way that bas not yet been attempted, that the granting of preference is bound up in the giving of it to a majority of those engaged in the industry affected. It ought to be shown that the granting of a preference to a minority would be something in the nature of an injustice; but no honIn orable member opposite has yet attempted to prove anything of the kind.

That is all that the Bill does. p Mr W. H . IRVINE -It does what the honourable inember says, and it will do something else, too. surprised if there is a sting in its tail, contractor chooses his employees. the nature of which has never been divulged to this House. Mr W. H . IRVINE -It will prevent an award being given granting preference to unionists in the Public Service. so. I propose tc state a case to the honourable gentleman, and I ask him to give it fair consideration. On the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, a large number of men are employed. The policy of the present Government is to get a lot of that work done under contract. understand that they argue that it is uujust to grant a preference to unionists in cases where public funds are being expended. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Wher e the vernment are providing employment' out of the public funds. Government is one of contract versus day labour. Consequently, they are instituting the contract system in connection with the huge undertaking to which I have referred. The earthworks upon the transcontinental line are, I understand, to be carried out under the contract system. Large bodies of men will be employed upon the earthworks, whereas a lot of other work, such as plate-laying, laying the road, and ballasting, will be undertaken by day labour. In each case, it is public money which will be spent. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Of course, it is. What has that to do with the matter? The Government may buy things from a manufacturing firm, and in that case Government money would be spent. employees unoer a contractor will be able to resort to the Arbitration Court, and obtain an award under which they may be granted a preference; in the other, the employees of the Government will be denied access to the Court. They will not be able to claim preference to unionists. Is not that au unfortunateanomaly? Does not the Attorney-General see in it au engine for strikes and difficulties ? Why should one body of men beCourt, whilst the other has a right to sothere? b Mr W. H. IRVINE I can tell the honourable member in a sentence. It isbecause, in the case of the contractor, the gentleman is shifting his ground. It is public money which is being used in both cases. Now, it may happen that, in time to come, the Commonwealth will manufacture its owu rolling-stock, just as the Newport Workshops manufacture it for this State to-day. In that case, private firms -will be our competitors. In South Australia, for example, Islington is a competitor with the Gawier Workshops. TJnder this Bill, the men employed in I those workshops would be subject to our Arbitration law, and might thus be able to secure preference, whilst the employees in the Government workshops would be denied it . Surely such a condition would Gobe unfair, even to the employers themselves. Take the case of the contractors engaged on the transcontinental railway Only a combination of the men engaged on either end of that line would be necessary to create an. industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State. The private contractor would thus be placed at a disadvantage iu competing with the Government, because the Arbitration Court might grant a preference to his employees, whereas those engaged by the Government upon the day-labour system would be denied a right to preference. The thing appears to be unreasonable. Why do we ask for preference? We all recognise that industrial arbitration is opposed to the old method of the strike. Other things being equal, preference to unionists is-the natural corollary. We ask for preference for the sake of industrial peace. We recognise that every day work is stopped there is an absolute loss to the community.

As one who has been associated with these organizations for thirty-five years, I claim to know something about them. which we have had to fight. In the first place, we had to fight against bad conditions. the conditions which obtained on one station that I visited some years ago? ThereI found that, although sixty shearers had been engaged, there was not a solitary bunk for one to lie upon. They had to sleep upon the flagged floors. In another place twenty-eight men had to find sleeping accommodation in a room 28 feet long and 14 feet wide, which contained three tiers of beds. of that property when he died lef t estate valued at over £500,000. A t that time we used to be paid not the face value of the work done, but on the bonus principle. whole season he received 5s. more than if he did not. But a ring-neck, called the Pannikin overseer) had a right to come into a man's pen of sheep, raddle them at any time, discharge him, and then deduct 5s. per 100 upon every 100 sheep he had shorn. days. conditions which brought about industrial unionism. tralia married couples were engaged to work on stations for 22s. 6d. per week, and had to find themselves. also to supply rations to the ring-necks of the station, when the latter came out to do any mustering or marking of sheep, at 4d. per meal. men received 12s. 6d. per week. honourable member for Hindmarsh can vouch for the truth of my statements. These were, as the honourable member for Maranoa has remarked, the good old days, and I suppose my honourable friends opposite, who represent the squattocraey of Australia, would like to get back to [118] them. Let me tell them that this B ill will not achieve their desire. All 'the powers above the earth and under it will not put an end to trade unionism. organizers-the best we have. the B ill is a sham. If it were not for the principle that is involved, I would not hesitate to vote for the measure, because it means nothing. The Government policy is one of contract, and the B ill will not apply to permanent employees in I know the battles our Public Service. The Government know perfectly well that the principle of preference cannot apply to them, because May I be permitted to recall they obtained entry to the Service by means of an examination. If we were to attempt to apply the principle of preference to them they could snap their fingers at us, and say that they would not join a union. If an attempt were made to discharge them, what would be the position ? Each of these members of the Service would be entitled to compensation for wrongful dismissal. Boiled down, The owner therefore, the B ill will affect only casual Government employees. There are something like 15,000 casual hands in the Commonwealth Service, and if the present Government remain in ofiice twelve If a shearer went through the months hence, at least half that number will be working for contractors, leaving only 7,500 to whom this measure can apply. That being so, this political placard which the Government are exhibiting, and all the talk of battle, must go for nothing. The number of unionists has not been reduced by one since the present Government issued their minute abolishing preference to unionists. There must be at least 900 men at present employed on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, and I undertake to say that the number of unionists on that work has not In my time in South Ausbeen reduced by one since this minute was sent out. Nor w ill the number be reduced by the passing of this B ill . The They had Government, however, will be able to go to the country and say to their supporters, "" See what a grand, thing we did.

170,He W I L L Vote I N Favour Of Mr Poynton,"As a matter of fact,something to bring about a double dissolution. As a result, this wretched little weakling is to be sent up to the Senate to bring about the double dissolution that the Government desire. I could understand the attitude of the Attorney-Generali f he proposed, straight out, to repeal the Conciliation and Arbitration Act . The honourable member for Kooyong told us that this B ill , if it becomes law, will repeal certain provisions of a measure passed last year. Is this a manly way of repealing legislation to which objection is taken 1 If they objected to certain provisions in another measure, the Government, instead of proposing to repeal them in this indirect way, should have brought down a B ill repealing the whole or portion of them. If they did that, they would show themselves in the open. They would at once be seen in their true colours. The people would be able to see that, notwithstanding their professions, they are opposed to trade unionism. The Attorney-General has proved himself a bitter opponent of up-to-date trade unionism . Mr W. trade unionism is a good expression. By up-to-date trade unionism, I mean that which is the natural corollary to the giving up of the power to strike. ber cannot point to one strike in connection with an award made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, although that Court has now been in existence for nine years. Does the honourable member for Calare, who represents a country district, realize the change that has been brought about in the pastoral industry, for instance, as the result of the establishment of that Court? Before tlie award of the Court was obtained, the pastoralists never knew, from one day to another, how they were going to get along with their shearing, and the industrial disturbances that took place from time to time must have involved a loss of millions of money to the country. But since the award of the Court was made, there has been no trouble. I do not think I can do better, at this stage, than quote from the speech which I delivered in this House when the original Conciliation and A r b i tration B ill was before us. In passing thafc B ill , I felt that we were doing one of the grandest things ever done in connection with the industrial movement in Australia. I held the view that we were placing on the statute-book a measure which would provide a peaceful means of settling industrial disputes, and looking back at what has happened since that B ill was passed, I feel well satisfied with my forecast. I said thenBut what we have to considei is how we can minimize the evils arising from such disputes, and to endeavour to settle them as peaceably as possible. I feel that we are standing almost on the threshold of a new era-a n era that will form an important one in the history of the industrial movement. Witb other honourable members, 1 recognise that I am about to take part in placing upon our industrial structure what I choose to designate an emblem of peace. Looking back over the rugged pathway along which this industrial movement has passed, I see that at times it was on the mountain of success, and at other times in the valley of despair. All along the right side of this rugged track I note the numerous Acts that have been passed up to a comparatively short time ago for the suppression of industrial organizations. And on the other side of the track, as it presents itself to me in this panoramic view, I see the mounds that cover the remains of those who have been sacrifices to the cause. Here and there I see the finger posts which point to the men who H. IBVINE "" Up-to-date"" sacrificed life and liberty to keep the light of unionism burning. It has been kept burning, and there is no power in existence that can exI t is the correct one. tinguish it. I see in this vision the rise and fal l of this movement from the time of that King who, building better than he knew, divided his people into companies according to their trades and professions. I see the progress of the movement in the early Christian era, and I trace it on, until, at one time, I find it is considered to be not unbecoming for a King to be a inember of a union or of a craft guild. I refer to the historical fact that King Edward III . was a member of the Linen Armourers' Guild. Immediately after, notwithstanding the popularity of the movement at that time, we find the commodity of labour ill-used. Later, I see the scourge of the Black Death spreading across the land, and unsatisfied until it has carried off one-third of the population, and with the result that I see the first labour statute passed and the first conspiracy law that was ever introduced. I trace the movement further, and in my vision I see Henrv VIII . confiscating the accumulations of years, and while I gaze, I can almost hear the troubles of the weavers. ThenI am confronted by the Luddite rising. When I think of that, and compare the conditions then existing with present conditions, I cannot help reflecting that the natural offspring of oppression and tyranny is revolution and anarchy. A little further along the track I see a banner floating past emblazoned"" Educate! Educate !"" I see following it another banner, on which is inscribed the magic word, *' Ballot-box,"" and immediately afterwards I find that some 3,000,000 of the workers have secured their political rights in the shape of votes. So on and on the movement proceeds until I arrive at the day when I find a deliberative assembly providing means for the purpose of preventing industrial disputes, and in my vision I can",36,Robeet Best Wha T About To The Ordinary Affairs Of Life We Debarred A

173,Mr Poynton,"The honourable memalmost-see the Judge, as he sits above the contending forces of the representatives of labour and of the employer. And, comparing this picture with tliat of the past, I fail to understand how there can be any one desiring to oppose legislation having for its object peace; tbe bringvernment employees as well as to the eming of the combatants together, the amelioration and betterment, not only of the employd, but of the employer, for undoubtedly peace in industrial life makes for the advantage of both interests. If we are able now to put the coping stone upon the industrial edifice it is because by virtue of their moral and numerioal strength the labour unions are in a position to achieve for themselves by constitutional means their f u l l social and political emancipation. A well-known writer has said"" After a long weary pilgrimage, labour has emerged from the valley of the shadow of political death on to the broad plain of freedom, and now demands an equitable re-adjustment of the relations between itself and capital. Prejudice and self-interest mav refuse concession, but sound policy and justice will accede to the reasonable demands of those who constitute the wealth and power of the nation."" Those were the words I uttered in supporting the first Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and everything since done in connection with the main body of the workers has justified my forecast. To-day, however, the Government are indulging in a pin-pricking policy, but they need not imagine that this little twopennyhalfpenny Bill is likely to stop the great trade union movement. It certainly will not stop it, but it will prove a disturbing factor, and must cause trouble Those who are honest in this matter, must feel, as I do, that everything that it is possible to do to coerce men into joining unions for the purpose of industrial peace must be iu the interests of the country. It is immaterial to me whether this Bill passes or not; but if the honourable member for Perth still holds the sentiments which he expressed on a former occasion, and to which I referred a few minutes ago, he should be found voting with honourable members on this side of the House, as he did on the last occasion that we were invited to vote on the question of providing for preference to unionists, securing industrial peace, and putting an end to the barbarous system of strikes. When a strike occurs, not merely the actual combatants, but the wives and children of the strikers, as well as business people in all directions, suffer most severely. If honourable members will look at this question seriously, and set aside their party feelings, they will recognise that there was never a grander or greater measure passed than is the Commonwealth Con[118]2 ciliation and Arbitration Act. Preference to unionists and industrial peace are closely allied, and the principle of preference to unionists should ""apply to Goployes of private firms. I see nothing to fear in the future. The Attorney-General may succeed in obtaining his desired double dissolution, but I should have liked to see him come .forward with something more substantial than thisI should have liked to see him come forward with an attempt to stem the great tide of trade unionism by legitimate means. The Fisher Government did not hesitate to come down in a proper, constitutional way with a Bill to repeal the Naval Loan Act, and if honourable members opposite are honest in their convictions, they should come forward with Bills proposing in a direct, legitimate way to repeal legislation relating to trade unionism passed by previous Parliaments. If they do that we shall have something on which to go to the country. Bill contains a very simple proposition. We are asked by it to determine whether the action of the late Government in granting preference to unionists in the Public Service is justified or not. There appears to me to be no justification whatever for what they did. I look upon preference to unionists, whether applied to the Government service or to private employment, as an excrescence, designed to enable those holding certain political views to obtain an undue advantage over others. The whole history of the case is interesting in the extreme; and it has been engaging the attention of the House at very considerable length. One of the most remarkable statements made was that by the honourable member for Denison, who said, "" We desire preference to unionists in order to drive men into unionism."" member be fair, and go on to say that I concluded with "" for the purpose of getting industrial peace."" of getting industrial peace; but in that statement there is underlying the evil of coercion-the desire for preference to unionists in order to force men into unions. But that is only the beginning of the forcing process; the end, I venture to assert, nobody can foresee. We",37,Robeet Best Wha T About To The Ordinary Affairs Of Life We Debarred A

176,Mr Palmer,"Yes; for the purposeare at heart a freedom-loving people, and coercion is the antithesis of that freedom which we desire all our people to enjoy. We have seen enough of the action of unionists to know that they are prepared by various means to apply force and pressure to others. Other peopie may disagree with them, yet, perforce, in order to get employment, they must join a union, and then they are compelled to subscribe whatever 'levies may be made, even though .they may disagree entirely with the political platform of the union with which they have been coerced into identifying themselves. To join a union is the only means by whicli they can earn their bread, and, whether they like it or not, they have to pay levies in order to -amon g other things-produc e a workers' newspaper, the object of which is to advocate a policy which unionists conceive to be right. The views of the newspaper may be directly antagonistic to the man who has been coerced into joining a union, but he is forced to take part, although to do so he may consider detrimental to his own interests. illustration of this is given in an account in to-day's paper of some proceedings connected with the New Zealand strike; and this has an exceedingly important bearing on the history-making struggles of to-day. This strike has practically paralyzed the whole trade of New Zealand for some considerable time, and it is a very creditable thing that the attempt to create a general strike has signally failed. This indicates that the people are a freedom-loving people, and are not inclined to be driven to the extent that others may desire. The newspaper account is as followsAt a meeting of tramway men it was decided nationality, or other conditions? by 71 votes to 30 not to cancel the registration should nofc all be employed according fco under the Arbitration Act.

179,Mr Palmer,"I threaten? Theredominate the majority, is a principle which cannot receive any recognition from honourable members on this side. proud to be supporting a Government which is determined to destroy any idea of the kind. W ill the forcing of all men into unions bring peace? If all are compelled to join unions, then all will stand on a common plane, just as they would if there were no unions at a l l ; so that peace cannot be secured in that way. Experience shows that the unions are not "" o u t "" for peace, but for profit, and I venture to say that it is the leaders of the unions and .nob the bond fide working men who, profit. But the great mass of the people will wake up to find that they are simply dupes, being led on for the benefit of the recognised organizers and talkers in the ranks of unionism. Let me quote a case to show the great love that exists in the hearts of unionists for other unionists. This is a case in New Zealand, reported in the Argus on 14th June this year: Mr Justice Edwards delivered judgnient in the case brought against the Auckland Waterside Workers' Union by two members, who alleged that the union officials had by intimidation prevented them obtaining employment on the water front. The plaintiffs were Joel Smith and James Miller, and tbe defendant James Collet, secretary of the union. Plaintiffs claimed ;£2oo and ^250 wages respectively and an injunction against the union, which was not incorporated or registered under the law. His Honor said that plaintiffs were employed on thc Maheno gang because no fewer eleven of a chosen gang had failed to turn up. Certain members of the union took exception to the extra industry shown by plaintiffs, and at a meeting in the absence of the plaintiffs, and without evidence, fined Smith and Miller the amount earned by them on the Maheno. a proceeding was void as being contrary to' natural justice. that both plaintiffs had been excluded from the waterside workers' waitingroom, -is non-members. being given to unionists, had been unable to obtain employment Honor found that the union, without anv colour of right or authority, had penalized who had not done anything strictest unionist should disapprove. without a scintilla of right gave the employers of the waterside workers notice that had ceased to be members' of the union, with the object of precluding employers from employing such persons, and upon this notice the employers were bound to act. Miller's damages at ^55, and those of whose case was more serious, at £80. That case makes plain the inner working of unionism. Men who show ability and energy exceeding that of their fellows are driven out, but it stands to the credit of our Courts that in this case justice was done, to some extent at least, to those I am who suffered. But what becomes of the statement that unionism means peace? It means rather the destruction of individual rights, and requires men to go to the Court to vindicate the privileges that they possess under the common law. In my opinion, it is a disgrace to our civilization that such a state of things should have come about. Doesi t make for peace to coerce men to pay levies for all sorts of purposes ? All over Australia men are contributing by way of levies to the establishment of newspapers. The wages of the workers are taken from them to benefit the unions. That does not make for peace; on the contrary, it creates a bitterness in the minds of hard-working men, who feel that they ought to receive the f u l l benefit of what they earn. Recentlyi n Bendigo, where the majority of the miners are unionists, it was determined to prevent the non-unionists from getting work. The unionists declared that they would not work side by side with non-unionists. The employers, however-in my judgment very properly-re fused to recognise men either as unionists or non-unionists. The upshot was tliat the unions, to meet the expenses incidental to the strike, had to make a levy of 10s. a member, thus taking £1,000 from their members. Such occurrences do not evidence a large measure of than freedom among unionists. They show that unionism is hostile to freedom and liberty. Under unionism men are not allowed to exercise the right of private judgment. It is right that the workers Such should combine to benefit and improve their conditions, but when the unions use The evidence was held to prove their organization and power with a Comand regarded monwealth Government to give effect to Both men, owing to preference their views, a great evil is done, and the Labour party will meet its Waterlooi n as waterside workers.

Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.£5 p.m. in connection w it h the question of Government preference to unionists. individuals in Government employ are iiot in the same position. We have, in oonnexion with our Harness, Small Arms, nnd Clothing Factories, quite a number of men who are in the employment of fhe Government, and are being continued in that employment month after month, but are yet exempt from the operations of the Public ServiceA c t . They are, in fact, temporary employees for an unlimited term. They may be employed for a year. During the course of the debate of the 7th November, 1912, as reported in Hansard, Mr Fisher was asked by Mr GroomAre these men to be exempt from the provisions of the Public Service Act? lutely temporary. Ministerial rule that, other things being equal, there shall be preference to unionists? That creates the anomalous position to which I refer. There are two grades of temporary employees, those employed for Minister of a limited period, and those employed for no fixed period. Later on Mr Groom Does the Prime Minister think that many of the unionists are non-political? required to make contributions for political purposes? The question of whether these men and unions are non-political has a most important bearing on this B ill , and the answer of the honourable member, that many of them are not required to mate contributions for political purposes couI hold strongly that veys the. undoubted truth that many of them are. I am, however, inclined to differ from the honourable member when he says that many of them are not. I think that they are all required to make contributions for political purposes. A t any rate, we have the admission of the preference to honourable member that many of them are, and, that being so, by granting preference in the Government service to thejo men they become active political partisans, to further the ends of the political body to which they belong. Returning to that all-important question as to whether unionism, and enforced unionism above all, means peace, let me give a few All quotations to show how peace is evolved by these political unions. I am sorry the honourable member for Darling is not here, because he was a party to a casrs in connection with the Sydney Worlzer strike, and he would be prepared to accede the exact truth of the words thafc I am about to quote. The men employed in the newspaper office were all unionists, but, being in the employ of other unionists, they found that they were not receiving the same consideration that other employers were compelled to accede, and, naturally, they resented this, and, not unnaturally, proceeded to ' the length of striking.

Colonel RyBiE.^The honourable member does not know any better. fore I apologize to him. worthy honourable member on tlie opposite side is tlie honourable member for Werriwa. 1 really do not know where he stands on this question. judge whether he is on his head or his feet. Judging from what I heard the honourable member say, he seems to me to be the most pronounced anarchist. He came forward in the most pronounced way with 'the idea that every man has a righ t to do just what he pleases, so long as he does not put his hand into the honourable member's pocket. He told us that we came from the position of status and contract, and are going back to contract and status. I am very pleased that we have come away fro m the position of status and contract, and are taking up the position of status versus contract, because I find in the change a larger liberty. The doctrines of the Manchester school, which commenced about 100 years ago, were thrust into m i as a boy, and I had to get r i d of them. I was told of the liberty of freedom of contract. with the lords and masters of in dustrialism, and where, then, was the free, dom of contract? It was not freedom of contract, but freedom to coerce on the part of those who had wealth. Was that not the case in the industrial world of Great Britain, America, and everywhere else? The whole history of this supposed freedom is replete with instances, not of freedom of contract and liberty of the individual, but of the domination by those who have of those who have not. That is what we have to face, and that is why we are going back to the doctrine of status, and are seeking by such means as conciliation, arbitration, and preference to trade unionists, who are fighting the battle of life, to conserve the industrial and social life of the community. We are told now that there is to be no preference to unionists. PreNo more ference to unionists does not mean that the other fellow is to be deprived of a job, but that where two men apply for one job, the unionist is to be given preferThey are not. ence. I ask why should not the socially organized force, the man who has fallen into line with his fellows to meet the needs of the community; who, instead of standing alone, is associated with others for a definite purpose in life, be given He does not, and therepreference, when we know that he is the Another better social creature ? I await an answer to this question, and am prepared for any interruption that I .may be answered. I regret he is not here, for Is not the man who represents a social force the better man in the interests of It is very difficult to the community, and if preference is to be given, why should it not be given to the larger social force? If two jobs are vacant, and two men apply for them, one a unionist and the other a non-unionist, each w ill get a job. But, where it is necessary from two men to select one for the only job offering, I do not see what objection can be taken to giving the preference to the better social force. That is all that preference to unionists implies-that preference shall be given to the man who, by association with his fellows, creates a social force for the benefit of the community as a whole. I cannot understand why there should be this objection to preference to unionists on the part of honourable members who are here as an organized body of individuals to carry on the affairs of the country. If persons not so organized sought to interI n my youth, I had to fight fere in the conduct of the affairs of the country to-morrow, we should call them revolutionists. We should call them the mob. I do not understand why we, who represent organization, should object to give preference to others who are organized. W ill honourable members opposite tell me that the State, as organized today, has reduced the liberty of the individual ? W ill they tell me that we have not a larger national life through the development of the organization of the States into a Eederation? A r e we not in consequence brought more closely into touch with the Motherland ? W ill honourable members contend that our liberty has in any way become lessened ? A r e we becoming slaves under this new organization, and is our field of operation more restricted than it was when we were citizens of a number of separate",44,Robeet Best Wha T About To The Ordinary Affairs Of Life We Debarred A
203,Mr Howe,"States? Our organization has given us a wider liberty in the best possible way. It has not given the liberty of domination by men of wealth, but the larger liberty which comes from the common purpose of the community, and safeguards the interests of the people. by unionism we secure a wider liberty, and preference should be given to unionists, because they represent the best social force in the community. are the men who make progress in our social history possible, and who should, consequently, be rewarded for their efforts in this connection. fore me a speech delivered by the Attorney-General, who took it upon himself to make a comparison between the trade unionism of to-day and the trade unionism of the past. a little while ago to speak in this House, and though I did not quote my authorities at the time, I handed them over to the Attorney-General that he might look through them. How far he did so, I do not know. I am aware that the honourable gentleman has a very great deal to do, and possibly he could only very briefly scan the matter with which I furnished him. I find that he saidI refer by analogy to the guilds of the Middle Ages for the purpose merely of pointing out that in those times co-operation of workers was based on a fundamental recognition of the principle that they existed, not solely for themselves, but for the community as a whole. I take deliberate exception to any such statement. I say at once that the guilds of the early ages were not established for any such purpose. They were craft guilds established to look after their particular interests, and were political from beginning to end. efficiency of unionists, the Attorney General further saidWe hear all kinds of things said; but, personally, I am not in a position to speak, because I do not know anything of the matter. I am m u c h a f r a i d t h a t t he honourable gentleman does not . But I do know that since about the year 1S90 when we say that we shall associate ourpresent trade unionism has, unfortunately, taken a totally new turn in its development. I am quoting from page 3085 of Hansard to'get out. We are especially told that for the 12th November. The honourable we are to be given no preference. gentleman further went on to sayI am glad to find that my statement of a work, which will be found at page 99simple fact evokes a chorus of approval; but whatever the results may be, the facts are undoubtedly true. Until the year 1800 the operations of unionism were purely industrial organization, but since 1890-approximatel y from the time of the London dock strike, and the shipping strike in Australia-the whole trend of unionism has taken a new course. Then the honourable gentleman made a reference to myself which I have no occaI say that sion to quote. I have here' Howell's book, Conflicts of Capital and Labour, and we shall see whether the guilds were not political bodies. A t page 47 of this They work, I find the following statementThe contests of the craft-guilds were not consequently struggles for equality of labour and capital, but for the political mastery of the I have betowns. Honourable members will please note thatTt was a fight for the recognition of the political equality of stock-in-trade and real proI had occasion perty ; it was a contest of an oligarchy of landed proprietors, and the new oligarchy of capitalists; as trade increased, so the latter flourished; wider markets afforded greater opportunities for the employment of larger capital, and so the craft-guilds gradually changed from being societies for the protection of labour into associations for the investment of capital. That was somewhere about the middle of the fifteenth century. We have been told that the craft guilds were not political; that under them there was harmony between the masters and their employees; that the lion and the lamb lay down together; that their relations were entirely friendly; and everything went on well. A t page 51 of the same work, I find the statement'madeIn order to prevent the rural population from apprenticing their children to trades in cities and boroughs, and therebv reducing the number of servants in husbandry below the proper level, it was enacted by 7 Henry IV . "" that no person was to put a son or daughter apprentice within a city or borough except he had land or rent to Speaking of the the value of 20s. a year at the least, on pain of a year's imprisonment."" There was, of course, no political operation there. We are condemned for b---ing opened up a new field, because we have taken upon ourselves the adoption of political methods. We have been told that we have no right to do this, and selves in trade unions having political purposes, we are to be damned, and told I make another quotation from Howell's In consequence of this distressed state of trade in the silk manufactures, the whole of the masters and men petitioned Parliament, in 1818, for the extension of the Spittalfields Acts to the silk trade, in the districts of Coventry, Macclesfield, and Nuneaton, but without avail. This was i u 1818. Y e t we are told that the crafts were not political unions. They took the only political course then open to them. The members did not have the 1 franchise. The other side never gave it to them. There was only the domination of the landlords, and the industrial masters, of the K in g , the Lords, and even the Commons. The people had no franchise rights, and they could only act politically by petition to Parliament. To continue the quotationAs the justices of the peace no longer assessed wages, the workmen tried to induce the system of regulating wages by statement lists of prices, mutually agreed upon by masters and men; but these were violated upon every occasion by the employers. We to-day represent the people who, by their unions, have organized themselves, and made social progress possible, and yet honourable members opposite say that we are not to have preference as a reward for the efforts we nave made. Who, in the name of fortune, then, shall have preference ? MrW . H . IRVINE body have preference? stract question. The point is, Who does get preference? I want to tell the honourable member at once why my honourable friends opposite do not give preference by law to trade unionists give it to the non-unionists by their bureaucratic system which leaves tools at their disposal. . I quite agree with the honourable member that if we saw that abstract position realized, there would be no occasion to give preference. we do not see an ideal world. unionism exists to-day because the world i«3 not ideal. We have to take facts as they are. We have to organize in order to obtain that justice which otherwise we would not get. I feel that I am compelled to quote a little further, though, perhaps, much against my grain. page I find this statement by Pitt,_ the youngerI f ever it does arrive at this pinch, Parliament, if it be not then sitting, ought to be called together, and if it cannot redress your grievances, its power is at an end. Tell me not that Parliament cannot-it s power is omnipotent to protect. What is he speaking about ? He is speaking about trade unionists and their need for protection. He is speaking there of the horrors of the oppression that came down upon our ancestors when they were trade unionists. Was there preference then ? No ; there was nothing but oppression. The men were humbled, and driven to the cellars, so that the employers could starve them., and take them into the . workshops again. That is the sort of preference which men got in those days. We ask honourable members on the other side, in these times of modern civilization, to associate with us in some effort at social regeneration. When we ask them to give us that assistance which they should by granting preference to trade unionists, they seek to revert to the very conditions that brought about the horrors of which we read in this book. TheA t torney-General says that, u n t i l 1890, the trade unions were not political bodies; that there were no political organizations. I have two cases here which I could cite, but I will quote one case, which comes from my native town, and of EdinburghThe twelfth Congress met in the Oddfellows' Hall, Edinburgh, on 15th September, 1879. The report dealt with nineteen subjects, the most W h y should anyimportant being the Employers' Liability Bills and the Criminal Code Bill, before Parliament, and the Summary Jurisdiction Act 1879. ThreeT h a t is a purely abnew questions were added to the programme, namely, Reform of the Land Laws, Assimilation of the Borough and County Franchise, and the Extension of the Hours of Polling, all distinctly political. Mr R. S. Wright read an interesting paper on "" Labour and Land QuesThey tions."" Was that non-political ? Isi t only since 1890 that craft unions, or trade unions, have entered into the discussion of political questions? Is that case enough to satisfy the Attorney-General, or shall I But quote more? I mav as well quote all the Trade cases I have noted. According to the Gilr/s aaid Companies of LondonIn several of the greatest crises in the history of medieval London the power based on the exercise of separate jurisdiction enabled the members of a single trade to play a dominating part On the same In what? in city politics; and as it was just at this period that the Courts of the larger livery companies were taking shape, it can hardly be supposed that the effect of so striking an example was entirely lost upon them. Eveni n the sixteenth century there were craft guilds. That extract relates largely to the crafts of bakers, fishmongers, and weavers. Y e t we are told that there was no political movement u n t i l 1890.",45,Robeet Best Wha T About To The Ordinary Affairs Of Life We Debarred A
204,Mr Howe,"We have to bear the brunt of that statement. On another page I find this extractIn that great development of civic l if e in [8.37] -This is the most extraordinary which lay the main contribution of the Middle Ages to the cause of Western progress, _ and which reached its culmination about the middle of the fourteenth century, the organized power of the crafts was undoubtedly the most striking feature. From one end of Western Europe to the other, from Lubeck to Florence, and from Bristol to Vienna, the new social force was to be found under every variety of external circumstance W o r k i ng out what?working out a political revolution, sometimes by a quiet series of compromises, but in other cases with a violence that foreshadowed the worse days of the reign of terror. Yet we are told that there was no political unionism in those days. Why, sir, it has heen operating right down through the centuries. thing else but political unionism. I think I have done enough to demonstrate the Attorney-General's misstatements in connection with the history of craft unionism and guild unionism. I think I have done enough to' show that, right dowu through the centuries, the workers have had at once trade unions and political organizations. My honourable friends cannot separate them. what steps they may take. crush the workers for a moment, but they cannot divorce the two things. Trade unionism is so closely related to every economic and social question that arises that there is no possibility of my honourable friends, by any political enactment, divorcing them. I look upon this measure as a distinct attempt to divorce them. I look upon the measure as a clear attempt to destroy that natural position which we ought to occupy, and to enable the Government to give to those who are not unionists that preference which should rightly attach to unionists. I look upon the measure as a deliberate attempt to break down our fighting forces of trade unions and political bodies. I look upon it , further, as a deliberate attempt on the part of my honourable 'friends to go Democracy always was opposed to p r i v i backwards, and not forwards, hoping that lege. it may serve their ends for to-morrow.

Take centrate our forces, and the day after we the legal and the medical societies, and will come along again and undo the wrong which they have done. measure which could possibly be brought in by a Government, its object being to withdraw preference from unionists. One would naturally expect the present Government to bring forward a measure based on something like reason, justice, and equity; but, true to the traditions of the Conservative party that supports them, they have introduced a B ill which contains very little, and which, when it is placed on the statute book, will affect but a very few employees of the Government. It is one of those measures which could be easily found in previous legislation enacted by the party now in office, and which have often been Tliere has never been anydescribed as shadowy. A great deal of noise is made about this proposal, but when it is examined closely it is found to contain very little. Furthermore, it is typical of the other class of Conservative legislation which our honourable friends give with one hand and take away w it h the other. And when you come to realize what the people of the country have obtained, you find that they generally feel It matters not that they are suffering from a disappointThey may ment. It is difficult to understand why the attention of honourable members should be called to a proposal of this character. It is difficult to understand why a measure of a more substantial character has not been submitted. The answer is obvious. It is, in effect, "" We are not strong enough to attack the unionists of this country; we are not strong enough to stem the tide of Democracy, which, for some years, has proceeded very largely on trade union lines, but we are strong enough to show our malignant hatred to this movement. We are strong enough to irritate it . "" That, I suppose, is what w ill be called statesmanship on the part of our honourable friends. MrW . H .

There is one feature of the B ill to which I desire specially to refer. We have been told that it is a measure to prevent the granting of preference to unionists. I say that its effect will be to grant a preference to non-unionists. Mr W. H . IBVINE -Why? honourable gentleman why. My honourable friend knows ' perfectly well that the bureaucracy has, no love for trade That is the spirit to-day, only unionism. The great danger which Australians have to apprehend in the future is that they will be ruled by the bureaucracy of the Commonwealth. What will happen then ? That bureaucracy, in order.

A t any rate, that is the way in which it will work out. The honourable gentleman himself admitted that trade unionists are the best workers. Mr W. H . IBVINE I did not make that admission at all.

I .may well illustrate my contention by an anecdote relating to Lord Palmerston. On one occasion he met a well-known Chartist, and in his neighbourly way exclaimed, "" Well, how are the Chartists getting o n ? "" The Chartist replied, "" O h , very well, my l o r d "" ; whereupon Palmerston inquired, "" How many votes No . Assuming have they in the House of Commons?""

Three years ago, when the present position gi parties in this House was reversed, I said that I was in favour of industrial peace, and that, despite any temporary set-back caused by a strike here and there, I intended, in season and out of season, to advocate conciliation and arbitration, believing that, ultimately, the workers of Australia would unanimously agree to industrial disputes being dealt with in that way. There are, undoubtedly, difficulties to contend with. The older trade unionists, in many cases, believe in industrial unionism, and look only to the strike as a meaus to get over any industrial trouble. They remember what a bitter struggle their unions had in the days gone by, and they do not enter into the work of Conciliation and Arbitratice Higgius presides, in the same way as do the younger trade unionists. after all, a matter of evolution. Whatever may be the opinion of honourable members opposite, I believe that the principle of preference to unionists will u l t imately be f u l ly recognised. I have sufficient confidence in the sense of justice of my fellow Australians to believe that they want a fair deal, and will t r y to obtain it. The people of this country may be blinded by prejudice and passion for a time, but they are much stronger than are any Government. Mr W. H. IRVINE -What is a fair deal, unionists 1 have pointed out what, in my opinion, is the meaning of this B ill , and that it will work in the direction of preference to non-unionists. In one of the most able speeches to which I have ever had the pleasure of listening, the exAttorney-General pointed out in this House last week the right of trade unionists to obtain a preference. He pointed out that, for a long while, the trade union movement had been fighting to be recognised by the law. unionists are carrying on the work begun by their fathers. We need not go back to the ancient guilds. We need only go back as far as 1826, when the House of Commons passed the B ill which prevented magistrates from fixing th'ewages of the Spittalfieldweavers. If honourable mem[119] bers turn to the early records of Botany Bay, they will find that many of the convicts of the Crown who were sent tliere were trade unionists, who were transported under the conspiracy laws. There is an old saying that the blood of the, martyrs has been the seed of the church; and from the oppression to which trade unionism was subjected in ' the olden days has sprung the great trade union movement of to-day. When I was in England a year or two ago, I conversed with an old north-country unionist, who told me that he had sold up his home on three different occasions as the result of strikes and locks-out. Some of us in Australia know what that means. I ask honourable members opposite how they would view the position if we had been for years the top-dog, and they the under-dog. If the workers had had the power for years to oppress the wealthy, would not the latter have made It is, an attempt to secure a fair deal and to be recognised, and legally recognised, by tlieir fellow countrymen? The Fisher Government went to the country on the principle of a White Australia and the question of Protection, but they went also to the people on the question of compulsory arbitration. If trade unionism was to be the high water-mark of industrialism in Australia then, it was urged that the logical conclusion was that trade unionism should be recognised by the Government of the country. Honourable members opposite may say, if they please, that they want our party has suddenly sprung into existwith preference to ence; that it has neither tradition nor history; and that it is simply a revolutionary party, formed to make outrageous demands. But that statement is not founded on fact.. We have risen steadily on the work of our fathers. The workers saw some years ago that it was necessary that they should obtain political powerthat the Parliament made the laws, and that the workers must be represented in Parliament. They saw that Parliament controlled the destinies of the people, and that, until they got some representation in Parliament, and secured the right Present-day of preference to unionists, they could do nothing. We hear a great deal of talk about preference to unionists. As pointed out by the honourable member for Dalley, there is not much in this proposal except sentiment. All that is asked is that, if two men present themselves",51,Smith T H E Attorneying About Industrial Matters You Can

222,Mr Archibald,"Undoubtedly . Ibefore the Government for employment, other things being equal, preference shall be given to the unionist; and surely there is nothing in that of any very great danger to the community? whether the Government be Labour or Conservative, they are not doing their duty if they do not do everything they can to promote industrial peace; and the only way to secure that peace is to insure legal recognition of tribunals before which both sides can be heard, and an award given, according to justice and equity, by a trained President. Government, and their supporters, not think that they could have found a better job thau that on which they are at present engaged ? Certainly, the Conservative party are "" out"" for a good advertisement; and I do not envy them the task on which they have entered, seeing that the high-water mark of their legislation is to abolish preference to unionists. As I pointed out in the speech I delivered at the opening of this Parliament, there are two policies, either of which the Governmeut could pursue. as Napoleon III. wculd say, to recognise the logical facts. people of Australia are so divided in their political feelings that they have returned us in about equal numbers; and, under the circumstances, there was obviously only one course for the patriotic Government and Parliament. troduce and dispose of all the non-contentious legislation that the country required ; and, if this had been done, we on this side could not have done otherwise than give the Government our support. Instead, however, we have had presented a policy actuated by malignant hatred of practically thc whole of the people who support the Labour party. the Conservative party in this House to take their models from this side of the chamber, or from amongst the Radical' statesmen of the Old Land.

There is, by the way, a strong resemblance between the Cecil of our times and his ancestor, Robert Cecil, who won the confidence of Queen Mr ArcHibald. Bess, one of the wisest and best sovereigns of England. These are the models for the Conservative party in the Commonwealth; and I challenge my honourable I care not friends opposite to show me when any of those statesmen sank low enough to propose pettifogging legislation like that now before us? There is nothing in the Bill except an indication of what the Conservative party would do if they had the power; and we are told that this is statesmanship ! We have not had a great many statesmen in Australia, though I Do the could mention one in the person of my late lamented friend, Charles Cameron Kingston.

There has been a good deal of party feeling on both sides during the last Unfortunately, the few months; and it would be well if we had no repetition of it . I am not going to say on which side the fault lies, but I have put certain facts before the House and the country, and I make an appeal to honourable members opposite. The GoThis was to invernment have the power, .and, with the assistance of the closure, can pass any legislation they please; but there is something stronger than the Government and the closure. I appeal to honourable members opposite to let us have something like Conservative statesmanship something we can respect. Guizot says that the British statesman is far more adI do not ask vanced than even the British people; and that is true. It is worthwhile remembering that the statesman ought to be superior to the party spirit that may In the sway the people for the moment, and to look beyond the ordinary political fighting to the effect of that fighting-to the feeling of the country When those statesmen acquired and its effect on the future. If the Government, like the statesmen I have mentioned, are actuated by lofty principles, I ask them, even now, to withdraw the Bill. Is this measure worthwhile persisting with merely for the purposes of an idle placard?

But this movement means a great deal to us; its history gives it great value. A feature of the guilds and offcheearly trade unions was their insistence on apprenticeship.

Those whose parents were in a good social position were sent fco fche universities and fche high schools, and entered fche learned proDoes the Attorney-General fessions, and the children of the working people learned trades. But to-day apprenticeship is going out. The employers do not want apprentices. A boot manufacturer does not want bootmakers; the employees he requires are clickers, puttersI do not know up, and others skilled in particular technical processes Every branch of trade is now specialized, and a few years hence it will be difficult fco find carpenters, joiners, bootmakers, or skilled artisans of any kind.
