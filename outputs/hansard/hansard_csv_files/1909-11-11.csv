I understand that at a place called William Creek, in the Northern District of South Australia, the postal service is conducted in a raihvay building, and that for some time considerable friction has existed between the stationmaster and the postmaster. So intense has the feeling become that the State Railway Commissioner has, I understand, on several occasions asked the Commonwealth to provide a separate office for its own officer, hut up to the present that request has been refused.' I ask the Postmaster-General whether he will obtain the papers, and see whether something can be done to remove the unpleasantness ? to accept the honourable member's suggestion, obtain the papers, inquire into the matter, and inform the House of the result of my investigation. Northern Territory Acceptance Bill is thirteenth on the list of Government business on the notice-paper, and I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he will ask the House to proceed with that Bill immediately after the Constitution Alteration {Finance) Bill has been disposed of. formed the honourable member for Grey that if we can arrive at an understanding to deal in one sitting with the two or three important issues still outstanding, challenged by amendments of which notice has already been given, I shall be glad to fix a date for the further consideration of the , Bill. The order in which the Bill appears on the notice-paper will not prevent that being done. Prime Minister whether it was not under-stood that we should proceed with the further consideration of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill immediately after the Constitution Alteration (finance) Bill had been dealt with? given to the honourable member for Boothby is in no way a qualification of my previous statement that I was prepared to arrange a date on which the further consideration of the Bill should be proceeded with. It is necessary to make arrangements with those who have already given notice of amendments, and who might object if the Bill were taken without sufficient notice. Subject to their convenience, and to the further consideration of the Bill being disposed of in one sitting, I am prepared to fix a date.

On two or tliree occasions, I have expressed the opinion that we can not afford time this session to bring on the Bill merely on the chance of being able to dispose of it. I asked that arrangements should be made to enable the crucial amendments to be dealt with at one sitting. We should then be able to send on tbe Bill to another place without delay. Prime Minister to say whether it is not a fact that I reported to him that the Leader of the Opposition would offer no objection to the Bill being taken immediately after the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill had been dealt with; secondly, whether I did not advise him that the only amendments of which I had any knowledge were those of which notice had been given; ancl, thirdly, whether he expects me now to go round the House and to ascertain what honourable members intend to offer opposition to the Bill before he will consent to bring it on again? two questions put by the honourable member is ""Yes."" As to the third, I do not expect him to do anything of the kind. I thought I had made it perfectly clear that all I desired.was to abbreviate the discussion. I did not ask t h i honourable member to do what he suggests. He may or may not, as he thinks fit, take that action. We shall endeavour to obtain the information to which he refers.

""This determination to secure for tbe States rights which are not good for them, will not assist them in any way, but will ultimately react against their interests, and. as the honourable member for Robertson ""indicates, help largely to increase that secsouthern end of the State, to manage the .tion of the people who 'believe that we -should have, a National Parliament with much greater powers, and State Parliaments with greatly diminished powers. I said last night that I am not a unificationist. I believe in the Federal principle, but it is well to remember that experience is likely to tend all in one way. That is to say, every question that becomes of national importance, and has a national scope, is likely to be transferred to the National Parliament."" Let me illustrate. ""The present deplorable struggle between the employers and employees in the New-castle district of New South Wales shows that the State industrial machinery has absolutely broken down, and the effect will probably be, not only an industrial -disturbance in a local centre in one State, but a dislocation of the whole -of the industrial and commercial life -of the Commonwealth. tinction to that, let me refer to the great struggle of the shearers and rouseabouts with the Australian pastoralists. That was settled only because we had a Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act that enabled the whole of the industrial workers concerned to get a verdict under a Commonwealth law. In consequence, that industry has since then proceeded in peace and quietness for nearly five years. That is what I mean by larger powers which have a national effect, and are a national necessity. While the States -should continue to possess the powers necestime "" means better methods of governing sary to carry on their own self-government, wherever larger powers can be given to this Parliament for the national advantage the people of the Commonwealth will not hesitate to invest this Parliament with them. I hold, however, another view regarding State Rights and functions and the scope of State effort*. States, as at present delimited, will not continue for a great length of time, but that New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, instead of being managed as they are at present by one local Parliament from a capital in one corner, will be split up into smaller States each with its own local Parliament. member is a unificationist, because that is what the unificationists propose. the interjection.

So far from being a unificationist from that point of view, I think there should be a larger number of. local Governments capable, of transacting the immediate local business, which would be completely under their control, while all large national questions should be left to the Federal Parliament. That could be brought about cheaply and In contradisexpeditiously.

I think the Federal Parliament, founded as it is on a broad franchise, is capable of doing justice to all. It is still hampered by many of its Constitutional limitations, and my objection to this B ill is that, if given effect to, it will hamper it more than ever. One would have expected from the Prime Minister and the Government a broadening rather than a narrowing of the national speeches, and some of his actions, the Prime Minister might well have been expected to proclaim to the people that this ParUament could be trusted to do justice in every instance; but this Bill declares in effect that it cannot be trusted with financial affairs, and that its probity cannot be guaranteed to the States. He and his Government are prepared to lay down definitely in the Constitut on : what the Federal Parliament must do, and to cripple it in order to secure to the States rights which up to the present they have not possessed. In that way the honourable gentleman is doing a great injustice to the Parliament and people of the Commonwealth. Any one who takes tbe trouble to look into the matter must arrive at the conclusion that the people of Australia cannot benefit from the proposed financial arrangement, unless the Commonwealth takes control The weakest feature of this measure is that it does not assist in bringing that about. Instead of helping the transfer of the debts from the States to the Commonwealth, it hinders it. It provides for an annual per capita payment of 25s. from the Commonwealth to the States, and leaves the transfer of the debts to be further investigated. The States, being sure of the payment from the Commonwealth, need not, and will not, be anxious to transfer their debts. A Bill now at its third-reading stage for an amendment of the Constitution, to enable this Parliament to take control of the whole of the debts of the States when it -chooses to do so. But it is possible that the people may agree to the amendment relating to the payment from the Commonwealth to 'the States, and may refuse to agree to the amendment relating to the State debts. ister should have first referred the StateI am not afraid of a National debts question to the people. Had they approved of the proposed alteration, we could have proceeded with greater safety in regard to the allocation of the revenue. I am more convinced than ever that the last clause of the Bill will really make the Commonwealth merely the agent of the States in regard to transactions connected with the debts. Although the Commonwealth may pay the interest and the principal of the State debts, a Commonwealth stock which will' be to its advantage cannot be created. Those who drafted the Constitution, and those who approved of it , no doubt thought powers. From his previous that during the first or second session of this Parliament the State debts would be transferred to the Commonwealth, and that a Commonwealth stock would be created, any accruing benefit due to a reduction of interest going to the Commonwealth. That was the view taken by many of us who advocated the acceptance of the draft Constitution in Queensland, where it was not popular, and it was the view of those who voted for it in that State. Had not the people thought that the Commonwealth would take over and manage the State indebtedness, and thereby make a profit, they would not have supported Federation as they did. Now it is proposed to put that out of the power of the Commonwealth. In my opinion, to do so will destroy the in.fluence of the Federation. Apparently, there are still to be six borrowing States. Even when a State borrows through the Commonwealth, its loans will be placed on of the public indebtedness. the money market as specifically intended for their purposes, and credited and debited according to the terms on which they are floated, while if the Commonwealth requires money for its own purposes, it must borrow it in its own name. The Attorney General said 'this morning that a mare's nest had been discovered, and that the objections which were then raised do not entirely apply; but he did not completely set aside my position. The Prime Minister freely admits that the Commonwealth will It is true that there if. have to continue to pay 25s. per capita to the States after it has paid off the whole .of the debts, principal and interest. But no provision is made for a sinking fund. The Government have not explained this omission. No doubt Ministers do not consider an explanation necessary. They are content to allow this matter to go through without placing their views on questions of detail before the House. That is not a I think that the Prime Mincreditable way to'act; but it is their method, and we must submit to it so long as they continue in office. I hold that the Commonwealth should be empowered to take over the whole of the public indebtedness of Australia, to constitute an Australian stock by the conversion and renewal of old loans and the issue of new, and that the States should have absolute freedom in respect to borrowing, subject to the control of an advisory Board established by the Commonwealth. that. appoint Treasury Commissioners, and I am sure that the State Governments would readily avail themselves of the advice which could be obtained from them. Directly the Commonwealth credit becomes better than the best State credit, the electors will demand that the public borrowing shall be done by the Commonwealth. In my opinion this is most desirable, but the Bill makes no provision for it, and the Government have not shown that it is provided for. larger powers regarding the taking over of the debts, and yet be limited in the way I am speaking of. No doubt it is useless to debate the matter now, because honourable members, having discovered that the numbers are up, have ceased to take a serious interest in the Bill, which they regard as pracby having in charge of its affairs men of tically passed. If this were an ordinary measure, it could be amended by a subsequent one, but an amendment of the Constitution can be secured only by the vote of a majority of the people and of a majority of the States. While at a particular time it may be easy to get the electors to take a particular course, it may not be easy to subsequently get another amendment carried. As I have already said, if five out of six of the electors wished for an amendment of the Constitution, they could be foiled by the action of the minority. mitted eloquence of the Prime Minister will not enable him to explain away that difficulty. He wishes us to ask the people to do something now which future generations may regret. that we are wiser than those who will follow us fifteen or twenty years hence will be. ment and of the Premiers evidence their mistrust of the future electors df Australia, and, in my opinion, amount to a wilful, open, and base betrayal of the National interests. were fought for in the Convention by far more capable and far-seeing men. I cannot help repeating again the statement of Sir Henry Parkes that, although New South Wales had more to lose from Federation than any other State, he was ready to join the union, trusting the National Parliament with the absolute control offinanceand the Tariff. He was prepared to leave it to -the wisdom and justice of future representatives of the people to deal properly with the questions which came before them, and thought it unnecessary to bind their actions by the Constitution. Smaller-minded men have followed him. The great blemish upon the Constitution is its financial provisions, and the Government propose to make that worse. I hope that the people will not agree to the proposed amendment. The newspapers and the Premiers have threatened to oppose those who vote against the acceptance of the agreement, and the press, at any rate, has considerable power, especially in regard to the party which I have the honour to lead. But, after all, these threats are vain, and will not influence any manly person. It is pitiful that we should ask for They may influence and terrorize political jellyfish, who are always watching which way the windblows, and are ever ready and anxious to set their sail to catch every passing breeze that may tend to their political advantage. It may suit them to do that, but a country does not make progress that kind. There is no special virtue in standing by the principles in which one believes, but there are times in the political history of a nation when the men most useful are perhaps those who decline for the time being to be dragged with the' majority.

I pointed out that there were eleven in eighteen years that went to a dual referendum, a referendum of the people and of the States. poses, a referendum in regard to an alteration of the Swiss Constitution is practically the same as that for which our Constitution provides. But there are other questions that are sent to a simple referendum. to be submitted to a simple referendum of the people. Swiss Constitution for such a referendumthat there should be a simple referendum, by which a majority of the people could accept or reject the agreement, I should accept the Government proposition; but, as it is put, it is fatal. Those who take the view that this is only the beginning of further pressure to be applied to Federal Governments by the States have some cause for that opinion. In the words of the honourable member for Flinders, it means, perhaps, the destruction of effective Commonwealth progress. I am not given to taking a very pessimistic view of matters; I prefer to be optimistic; but I do say that the proposition is one to abrogate certain rights possessed by the Federal Parliament. The Prime Minister, who is the leader of the movement, is the last whom I should have suspected, even twelve months ago, c\f taking this action. I cannot recall a single utterance of his which indicated that he was likely to favour any such action as he now proposes. No one was endeavouring to take the step that he has taken. No party sought an alliance with the State Governments, until he himself solicited their aid. Although the honourable gentleman assisted to frame the Constitution, he is the first to desert its principles, and to seek an alliance with the State Governments, the effect of which will be to take away powers that have been given to this Parliament. It is a deplorable exhibition of weakness; a singularly unfortunate action in the course of a rather long and distinguished Parliamentary career. I hope, however, that the matter will not end here. I trust that the people will reject the agreement, and that every qne who feels that the Bill may afford a temporary advantage and security to the States will yet recognise that unless the National Parliament can be trusted to deal fairly and equitably with the States, it wall be impossible to build up a national sentiment. If we are to begin to distribute our powers in the way now proposed, it is only a matter of time when the Government, to' be logical, will have to propose to distribute those which we now possess with regard to industrial legislation, and they might as well take the same course with respect to our power to deal with the question of defence. I shall take my stand against this proposal here and in the country, and regret that we were not able to brock the passing of the Bill. I repeat that those who voted for this agreement have had no mandate from the people to do so. The agreement has been sprung on the people without notice and without warrant, and honourable members who support it are prepared, without the authority of the electors, to endorse a policy which, I feel assured, will be disastrous, speaking generally, to the people of the Commonwealth. ter) [4.25] -It is due to the honourable",24,Pairs

In existing circumstances, the tension occasioned by the divisions that have been and have yet to be taken can be prolonged only at the cost of further sacrifices on the part of honourable members that are, uncier present circumstances, capable of being dispensed with. We are now faced with the report of the'Committee. I have not to undertake at this stage an exposition of what, from my point of view, is the consistency of the present proposal with those submitted by previous Governments with which I have been associated, or to previous Conferences of Premiers. have been among the first to draw the attention of the Commonwealth Parliament to the grave importance ancl ultimate magnitude of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. I have availed myself of every opportunity, when attending Conferences of State Premiers, or associated with them in any other way, to impress upon State Governments the wisdom of their facing the very contingency which has nowarisen. them to prepare in advance some welldigested ancl complete scheme which should, as far as possible, dispose of the many causes of friction that will exist until we have established complete financial relations securing the utmost independence on both sides, or where there is mutual co-operathem because, nevertheless, on the divisions tion, that this should be strictly defined. If we had been successful in the endeavour to induce them to grapple with this subject more thoroughly at an earlier stage, we could have dealt at the recent Conference with not only one or two of our central financial relationships, but probably with the whole of them. At present that still remains an ideal; but I submit with confidence that the present proposals depart in no way from the main principles laid down at the various Conferences. If they are not, as they are not, as complete as we desired, they, at all events, represent the utmost possible advance found practicable at this time. The Leader of the Opposition, at the outset of his speech, criticised the Government proposal; but, of course, he is well aware that an Administration is necessarily placed a.t a great disadvantage, when, against the one scheme to which it has given its adhesion is ranked I should have every other scheme, and all their supporters. In the present instance it has not been a choice between two rival schemes. The honourable member himself confesses that he, and a majority of those voting in Opposition, have approved proposals emanating from the honourable member for Mernda, and others, only because they appeared preferable to the scheme which the Government has submitted-no t as embodying the proposals which they themselves would have carried if they had possessed fl:e requisite strength. There, apparently, aro some differences of opinion on the subject amongst the members of the honourable member's own party, and there are certainly considerable differences amongst independent members who have united with them. All these, collectively, approach I may claim to very closely in strength tojhe number that have rallied round the scheme submitted by the Government. But this discussion has really shown that, as against any other scheme taken on its own individual merits, that embodied in the Bill commands a larger support than any rival scheme. That appears obvious. Consequently, although honourable members have voted the Government scheme by a bare majority, we have, as a fact, every reason to believe I urged that it has a very much stronger support behind it than any other scheme yet laid before this Chamber. The honourable member repeated some criticisms upon the attitude of members on this side who exercised their undoubted liberty of taking exception to the Ministerial project; twitting they have cast their votes with the Government. But, surely, under the circumstances, of all criticism that could be offered, this is one of the most futile.

Practically, the question was-wha t scheme is attainable reconcilable with our principles liament, deriving no direct electoral advanwhich will meet the present circumstances ef the Commonwealth, and be likely to secure the support of the majority of the whole of the electors, as well as the majority of the same electors reckoned by their voting places in their several States. That is the scheme we require. It is not the only scheme possible, but it is just such a scheme as is essential at this critical period of our national history. This scheme is evoked, not as a consequence of any search by the Government for one electorally advantageous in filling up a meagre programme. We had to face the House and the country with some financial scheme of this character. Constitution, on the cessation of the Braddon section in 1910, it became absolutely necessary, no matter how short the time at our disposal, or how great the pressure on us, to prepare and propose some arrangement which, after criticism in Parliament, cogkl be submitted at the general election as the best we could agree upon for the needs of the Commonwealth. The search was no choice of ours. Already overburdened with other important measures, the Conference had to meet in the midst of a strenuous session, and the measure is brought forward at this time simply because some scheme had to be proposed. This agreement is the result of our threshing out the question with the representatives of all the States concerned, proving to be the one practical and practicable measure which we were able to submit for the consideration of Parliament. Mr J. temporary arrangement if it had to be permanent ? answered several times already. Under circumstances of pressure, and in the short time at our disposal, we had supposed it impossible to arrive at a permanent settlement. But when we found we could arrive at an agreement in regard to what moy be termed a complete scheme, so far as it went-no t the full, complete financial provisions of which I have been speakingwe believed we were acting in the interests of the Commonwealth, as well as in the in[ 5] 20 terests of the States, in undertaking the Ministerial responsibility of submitting this proposal to Parliament. It must be remembered-and I merely say this in pasting, in reply to criticism, that the Government will go to the country, if this scheme be sanctioned by both Houses of Partage from its submission. It will be dealt with, not as the honourable member suggested, as a party question, put to the electors as a main ground for returning us to the next Parliament. While offering many temptations, as well as many opportunities of a party character in this way, it is put aside so that it may be dealt with independently of the candidatures of persons or parties. The electors, no doubt, in a number of constituencies, will accept or reject this measure, quite apart from their acceptance or rejection of particular party candidates. Mr J. H . CATTS -There is nothing Under the terms of the practicable in that. House see the point, and recognise the irrelevance of the comments that are being made. My point is that, if we had followed the course favoured by the honourable member for Wide Bay, of taking this to the country as the first proposal in the Government platform, we should undoubtedly have had, on that ground, and, perhaps on that ground alone, a special backing throughout the Commonwealth. Of course, it would have opponents as well; but I believe the backing we should have gained by that course would have been far and away beyond the opposition which it would have evoked. Under the circumstances, we are parting with an electoral advantage-w e are not taking the course which would have given us the greatest voting value out of this question.

I look forward with the greatest interest to the educational value of this direct appeal to the people, their attention being directed in the most pointed way possible to the financial situation of the Commonwealth to the financial requests of the States and the financial relations which must exist between the two bodies. These are matters which we have done well to discuss here; which will be discussed at large throughout this country until polling dav. and will, I trust, result in the creation upon this subject of an educated public opinion of great advantage to the Commonwealth and its coming Parliaments. that, in future, we shall find these appeals to the direct judgment of the people on great issues become more frequent. That will depend in part, as I sai3, upon the numerical response we obtain, and its character. Wide Bay commented upon the exercise of Ministerial influence upon members unnamed in recent divisions. If any such influence was exercised, it was but a fraction of that used every day by the honourable member himself and those associated with him, not only upon each other, but upon any others whom they can bring within its sphere. I make no objection to their doing so, but contend that anything of that kind which may exist on this side is but child's play to the steady, consistent, scientific manner in which it has been developed by my honourable friends opposite.

That may be so, but the honourable member's remedy for it followed the line of his argument. He implied a dominance by the Commonwealth which meant the sweeping away of the authority exercised at present by State tribunals, and the creation of a central control by the Commonwealth of all industrial matters and industrial disputes. I should prefer to take an exactly opposite point of view. I should say that the difficulties with which we are confronted are due, not to the existence of the State tribunals, nor to the limitations upon the There is not absolute unanimity on separable from State legislation in such matters, but to the fact that they lack that crown and completion which would make them harmonize with each other, and permit Federal action over the whole of Australia wherever Federal action is necessary. To obtain that would not destroy or cripple the State industrial systems. On the contrary, it is to encourage their development to the fullest extent that their Legislatures can sanction,, and then, by means of their work, in each part of the Commonwealth, assist to bring their conditions into line where Federal interests are involved or Federal action is necessary, by the exercise of powers which are or can be vested in the Federal Parliament.

The conclusion at which one would arrive, from hearing this and other speeches of the honourable member, is that the gain to the Commonwealth in the future, the gain to what he calls national interests, is to be obtained by the pruning of State powers and the reduction of their authority and activities. He seems inclined to take that view, branding as antinational those who do not see in this .reducciently acquainted with his trouble to be tion of State operations the one means of developing the national power and authority. Here again I find myself in profound difference with my honourable friend. My colleagues and I claim to be thorough and sincere Nationalists who recognise that in a continent of these dimensions, and in particular at this period of our history, Nationalism can be built up and buttressed only by a complete development of State powers. It is not in taking advantage of the weakness of the States that the strength of the national movement will come. It will arise with a perfecting of State powers within their own limits, and their subsequent union and completion by national powers. Mr J. H .

The honourable member may be long or short-sighted. I am not vet suffiable to supply him with the particular pince-nez which will best suit hiscomplaint. Nothing could be more pernicious at the present juncture than for those who are Nationalists, as I think most of us in the Federal Parliament are or may become, to manifest their Nationalism by hostile criticism of and antagonism to the State Parliaments and the States themselves. I should like to see the terms ""parochialism"" and ""provincialism"" fall into disuse in the National Legislature-no t merely that we should exhibit no qualities of that kind, but that, if ever they were exhibited by smaller bodies or from any quarter, we should pursue our way confident that the people will not be led aside into petty disputes between their several agencies, when they see before both such vast areas of unutilized territory awaiting their attention. There is not only room for both Federal and State authorities in Australia, fuller development than they have yet attained. The hnrmony to be established between them cannot be petrified upon a statute-book. It must arise out of a mutual recognition of each other's duties and difficulties, and a sympathy for each other in the common tasks which lie before them in this country of immense undeveloped potentialities. The honourable member for Wide Bay would probably feel that I had not done justice to his argument if I made no reference to his line of thought with regard to taking over the debts. YetI have pointed out to the honprable member that the Commission of Inquiry, alluded to in our agreement with the Premiers, has nothing to do with the taking over by the Commonwealth of the State debts. It has to do, as explained when the agreement was first laid on the table, with the arrangement to be made hereafter between the Commonwealth and the States in respect fo-» : the issue of future loans, under a Commission",28,Pairs

They are extremely intricate, and are viewed from different stand-points by the various State authorities. All the criticisms which are being levelled at the on forecasts, and, so far as the State debts are. concerned, on forecasts of a very distant future. Those who contemplate the abolition of the State loans look forward to periods regarding which the best financial experts in the world to-day would not venture to speak except in most qualified, cautious, and general terms. It would be difficult to predict the future of Australia fifty years hence, but to determine the relations of its public and private finances with the money markets of the world at that time is far beyond the power of any of us. That consideration does not relieve us of the responsibility for exercising prudence and caution. We must, prepare .for the future, but, inasmuch as it is so distant, we can discuss it only tentatively, and in an abstract fashion.

CATTS I can well understand that after the contradictory speech made by the Prime Minister, which no one -could comprehend, members of the Ministerial party had to repair to their own .room to discuss it amongst themselves and .to endeavour to determine what it really .meant. The Prime Minister took me to task because of one or two interjections that I made with the object of ascertaining -what he had in his mind. But it must be remembered that the right honourable member for East Sydney, and the Prime Minister's right hand supporter, the Minister of Defence, were in Opposition for years; that they complained time after time from this side of the House that speeches made by the Prime Minister were quite beyond their comprehension, and that one could find in them arguments on both sides of the question. future, when questions are put to the Prime Minister with regard to some of the points -dealt with in the speech which he has just snade, he will be able to point with equal facility to the ""Yes"" and the "" No . "" -The Prime Minister set up a man of straw in order that he might have something that he could readily knock down. He replied to a number of statements an regard to uniiication, which he professed to believe had come from this side of the House, but which had never been uttered. He wished it to go forth that there was a desire on the part of the Opposition to belittle the States and the power of the States. There is nothing of the kind. There is, however, a. desire on the part of our party to pre'serve the national sentiment from belittlement and degradation such as that to which -it has been subjected by that erstwhile Nationalist, the present Prime Minister. Take, for instance, the question of the new Protection, on which the Prime Minister ha?, varied his opinions very considerably. This Parliament cannot give effect to that -policy except by an enlargement of its powers. Some powers in that regard are .at present being exercised by the States, and to enlarge the power of the Common' wealth in this connection would be to restrict the power of the States. There is no desire on our part to belittle tbe States; -home rule. There is no one on this side out there is a desire to take to the Com' monwealth Parliament sumcient power to enable some far-reaching issues, such as that of the new Protection, to be dealt with ' on national lines, and effect to be given to the will of the people. It is absolutely absurd to say that because a man desires to see an enlargement of certain specific powers possessed by the Commonwealth there is on his part a concurrent desire to belittle the States; but it is quite in keeping with the Prime Minister's present attitude that any proposal which would appear to involve an enlargement of the national side of the Commonwealth should be thought by him to be a mere scheme for belittling the States. That is his present attitude; but it is a.tremendous departure from the noble Nationalism which he so eloquently expounded in the days gone by. I know of no one on this side of the House who advocates the centralization of all governmental control in Australia. The Labour party certainly does not. To do so would be to advocate that which is ridiculous. If effect were given to such a proposition there would be a great agitaI have no doubt that in the tion in the Commonwealth for home rule in respect of certain matters. There are some governmental functions that can best be controlled and developed by the central authority ; there, are others that can best be controlled and developed by the State authority. There is a difference of opinion as to what powers can best toe exercised by the National Parliament and the State Legislatures respectively; but to say that there is any authoritative opinion on the part of the leaders of the Labour movement, in the direction of the complete centralization of all the purposes of government, is, either from ignorance or party design, to invent a statement which is untrue. I agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay that even the powers now exercised by the States will have to be further distributed as the States themselves develop. Some of the States comprise huge areas. For instance, the Northern Territory, a proposal for the transfer of which has lately occupied the attention of this House, is nine times as large as England, Ireland, or Scotland; and since there is in Ireland, notwithstanding its comparatively small area, a clamour for Home Rule, surely, in the immense areas of Australia, a centralized form of government for all purposes could only be the forerunner of a great agitation for decentralization and of the House who takes any other view. yes.

There is only one honourable member "" on this side who advocates complete unification, and even his ideas may be qualified to a considerable extent by the meaning which he attaches to the word. Some believe that there should be one supreme Governmental authority, delegating powers to the local governing bodies, while 'others advocate Commonwealth and State Governments, each exercising sovereign rights within its jurisdiction. suggestion that there is a movement to centralize the whole of the Governmental authority in Melbourne, Sydney, or the Federal Capital, is a bogey erected merely in order to be knocked down; and yet that is what has engaged the eloquence of the Prime Minister this afternoon. In referring to the question of the debts, the honourable gentleman spoke of the futility of predicting conditions in future years. No one asserts that it is possible to forethe dictation of the State Premiers, and cast the operations of tbe money market thirty or fifty years hence; but, in making preparations for dealing with the pubhonest enough to thank the financial exlic debt of Australia, we can lay down a correct basis for future transactions. The proposals of the Government are fundamentally wrong, and will prevent the effecpeople. tive management of the debts, no matter what may be the conditions in the money market in the future. If it is impossible to make predictions of the kind, why does the Prime Minister desire to lay down a cast-iron basis for future operations? Why should there not. be some elastic arrangecriticism, the so-called Liberal party adopt ment, capable of meeting the changing circumstances of the future? As a fact, the Government propose to leg-rope the Commonwealth for all time, in regard to the revenue and the public debts, and so ; .deprive us of the advantage of that elasticity which the Prime Minister himself has shown to be so important. In hi,s peroration the Prime Minister urged that there was one part of the Government scheme in regard to which unanimity prevailed ; but he omitted to tell the House that that part has been plagiarized from ..the scheme-.drawn up by the Labour party at their Brisbane Conference. That is information which the Prime Minister did not afford to the public through the pages of Hansard jbut we know, that his speech of to-day is nothing more than an electioneering device, and no doubt it will be printed in pamphlet, form, and distributed I broadcast., The' honourable, gentleman did Mr J. H.' Colts'. not tell us that, the Labour party were the first to suggest that method of distributing the surplus revenue; and there is no real departure from the principle of the Brisbane scheme, except in regard to the amendment of the Constitution. did not know the Labour party's scheme when. I went to the Conference; I had seen merely a newspaper report which was unintelligible to me. Mr J. H . CATTS -But the State The Premiers, who dictated the present agreement -to the Prime Minister, knew the Labour party's scheme. As a matter of fact, before the Hobart Conference, Mr Kidston sent to me for a reprint of the scheme which I put forward here in October last year, -in order that he might supply it to the Premiers. In any case it was not necessary for the Prime Minister to know anything-h e did not go to the Conference to learn, but simply to accept he did so very humbly and subserviently. The honourable gentleman might bave beenperts of the Labour party for formulating the scheme which the State Premiers instructed him to accept on behalf of the The action of the present Government is quite consistent with that of the Liberals for some time past. When the Labour party, which is composed .of the rank and file of the people, draft proposals or measures whicb are found to stand the test of public them, and impudently take all the credit. Notwithstanding the fact that members of the Government and some of their supporters have, -. for some years past, denounced the Labour, party and its work's, they have abandoned their election pledges to such an extent that some of the most vital points of their policy have been takenfrom the Labour party's platform. At the same time, they'always contrive to associate with such measures some conservative principle which completely nullifies any beneficial effects. The particular scheme under discussiop was adopted by the State Premiers as a means' of dishing the Labour party, and it is now being forced on the Commonwealth to meet the exigencies of party warfare, set forth by the so-called Liberal party as their very own.

It is a sorry sight to find gentlemen opposite, who are well qualified to rouse the national sentiment of the people, departing, .some of them in the even'ng of their career, from their ideals of days gone by.

' It seems to me that the Prime Minister is now reaping the harvest of trouble sowed through all his years of office, by his recognition of'State Premiers in (Federal affairs. It was not unreasonable to expect those gentlemen, pampered as they have been with the notion that they have some right to shape the affairs of the Commonwealth, to attempt to dictate to this Parliament at this stage with regard to the division of Commonwealth revenue.

Bill is brought into operation. that desirable amendment. offences under the Act, my experience during the last election shows that while many are committed, great difficulty is experienced in having any action taken. In one case I submitted the most conclusive evidence, but the Department refused to take any steps, though it is hard to see where else the responsibility can lie. If a man commits a burglary, the police take action, and the sufferer is merely a witness in the case; and a similar policy should be pursued under the Electoral Act. The then Minister of Home Affairs told me that the Department was quite unable to do anything in the matter, and I was informed that I or anybody else could prosecute; in fact, the Department itself seemed absolutely helpless. When a penalty is provided for an infringement of the law, it surely ought to be the duty of the Department to see that the law is upheld. I also desire to say that I am very sceptical as to the value of postal voting. The Labour party haye been twitted with being instrumental in securing postal voting, and to that we must plead guilty, because, as a matter of fact, we were most anxious that those who could not get to the poll on election day should not be disfranchised. Unfortunately, like many other good things, postal voting has been most grossly abused; and I have come to the conclusion that the disadvantages of the system far outweigh its advantages. moves in the matter, to propose that the whole of PartX of the Act be deleted. The frauds committed under the system were very glaring at the last election; and in the State elections in Queenslandwhere, however, the system has now been abolished-the abuses would have convinced anybody as to the necessity for reform. that postal voting in Queensland was notsafeguarded by any regulations. under the Commonwealth Act, which, provides for regulations, there is a great deal of what I may term corruption. fraud oould there be?

208,Mr Bamford,"The cases where elecdid occur a difficulty would arise in securing a qualified witness to sign the postal ballot paper. I know that our regulations are much more stringent than those under tbe State law, but I have seen so much abuse of the postal voting system in State elections that I feel it would inflict no great hardship if it were done away with altogether. the introduction of the system in the first place it was on behalf of seamen and others who were prevented -from voting by circumstances over which they had no control. If necessary, the case of the seamen could be met by making every coastal steamer a polling booth. I wish to refer also to the question of hired vehicles, with regard to which I have given notice of an amendment. very commendable this House declared that no hired vehicles should be allowed to be used under certain pains and penalties, but unhappily we find that they are still very frequently used and in such a way that it is almost impossible to discover who are paying for them, although there can be no doubt that they are paid for. are also largely used. cases they are not hired, but are lent. Still, that is an infringement of the spirit if not of the letter of the Act, and as the chauffeur must 'be paid for his day's work, and petrol supplied, and possibly repairs effected, some charge is probably made in an indirect way. us are very severely handicapped indeed by the law as it now stands. election friends of mine offered to provide cabs for me and pay for them out of their own pockets without cost to my committee or myself, but I was afraid to avail myself of the offer lest I should find myself prosecuted. Department is very lax in some cases, I feared that if I did anything of that sort they would come down severely upon me. Another amendment which I have circulated has reference to newspapers. has teen an outcry that I desire to muzzle the press. muzzle it for a limited period-fro m nomination day until after polling-day. But I would point out that the press of to-day does not live up to the tradition set to it by the press of earlier days. the press was the redresser of wrongs, and held the scales of justice fairly between party and party and man and man. Today it has descended from its high pedestal and actually crawls in the gutter. tralia. members from that State say that the press there is just as virulent and just as culpable as that of any other State. The press wilfully misrepresents things. ber, of course, is referring to the. Age.

Even the honourable member for Maribyrnong, when he went UD to the Cyclqrama building on Eastern) H ill , would, I am sure, be shocked to see The fact is that some of an eight-stone man enter the ring with a. twelve-stone man. But that is exactly A t the last analogous to our position. The party to which I belong goes into the political fight, with both hands tied behind its back. The honourable member for Maribyrnong, on the other hand, has his case put l>efore the public by a paper which has a daily circuAlthough, as I have said, the lation of over 100,000, and is read, possibly, by 500,000 or 600,000 people every morning.

The idea underlying the restriction is that the electors should be allowed to make up their minds in peace and quietness, before they go to the poll, on the arguments that have been put before them. allowed to do so in practice, because others, who are not candidates for the particular electorate, come in and address meetings. -be prevented from speaking; but in South Australia, as far as possible, certain people are prevented from speaking, and, so far as it goes, that is a recognition of the principle for which I contend. I do not suppose that I shall be able to carry the amendment; but when I move it , I shall give honourable members on the Ministerial benches an opportunity of showing whether they possess those sporting instincts, and that love of fair play, with which the Australian is generally credited. . I hope that 1 shall get some support, at any rate, from that side. [8.13] -This measure is of considerable importance to the electors generally. B ill . No principle is involved in it. the important principle of postal voting, which is now exciting considerable attention. The system was introduced first by South Australia, and the Commonwealth followed her example shortly afterwards. It was originally intended that the principle should be limited to exceptional cases. us to deal with seamen only. was that it is not always possible for seamen who are following their vocation to record their votes at a polling place. be to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Herbert, and to proclaim each coastal ship a polling place. It was considered that this provision should be made to meet cases of sickness and ill health, and to allow those to vote who were too far from polling places to be able to attend there. The tendency has been to extend the privilege. The distance from a polling booth at which it is now necessary for an elector to reside in order to be able to vote by post is less than was at first provided for. voting certificate can be obtained on the ground of distance only by electors living 7 miles from a polling place,, whereas, formerly it could be obtained only by an elector living 7 miles from the polling crease of facilities has disclosed serious weaknesses in the provision, and this will be emphasized as it becomes more largely used. It lends itself to the exercise of undue influence by those who wish for the success of particular candidates. Such"" persons, sometimes bring pressure to bear to induce electors to vote by post who, if left to follow their own inclinations, would go to the poll. Queensland has followed the lead of the Commonwealth in this matter, but has gone much further, and the experience of the election before last there showed that, unless an alteration was made,' vote by ballot would be seriously interfered with. woman has the right to vote by post. any woman can vote by post under our legislation. All that it is necessary for a It is only a machinery woman to do to secure a postal voting certificate, is to sign a form declaring that she' has reason to believe that she will be unable to attend the polling booth at which she is enrolled, because of ill-health, or absence. On election day, she may neither be ill , nor away from home, and in a number of cases, votes are recorded by post, although the voters were able to go to the polling places. Some vote by post for personal reasons apart from distance, or the state of their health, and others because of the pressure put upon them by interested parties. Abuses might be prevented by confining postal voting to seamen, persons who are ill , and, possibly, persons who are living at a great distance from polling booths. The only alternative would In the country, 7 miles is not a great distance. Many of the difficulties in the way of recording votes have been removed by form "" Q , "" which enables an elector who is away from home to vote anywhere within his State at certain specified polling booths, and under conditions insuring the supervision of properly appointed officials. In every sub-division, there is at least one polling booth where persons who are not enrolled for it may record their votes.",41,Electoral Bill Second Reading

The electoral districts are subdivided, with a view to working the polling places from a common centre, and each subdivision contains at least one polling place where voting can be done under the "" Q "" form. That largely meets the difficulties for which the postal voting is provided, and is not so liable to abuse. Any person can obtain a postal voting certificate by signing a mere declaration. It has to-be witnessed by some one belonging to certain authorized classes. But the witnesses are often strong partisans, and take advantage of their position to advance the cause of their friends, in a manner which would be impossible in a polling booth. Whilst a partisan may secure some immediate advantage for those whom he is supporting, the improper use of electoral machinery is an abuse which may cut both ways. The purity of our elections will be maintained only by eliminating, as far as possible all opportunities for abuse, and it is the duty of all who desire that the voting shall be the true expression of the popular feeling to see that everything is done to this conditions. ' end. There are some who practically advocate the substitution of postal voting for the method of voting at polling booths. Some of these are supposed to represent large political factors. 1 was a member of a Committee which was appointed to investigate the conduct of the first Federal election. The possibility, of abuse under the postal voting provisions' was made evident to us, but a witness who represented a large political party, connected with the Kyabram movement, I believe, thought that the amending legislation should be so drafted that every person should have the right to vote by post -without restrictions. He advocated that the conditions surrounding the recording of a vote of that character should be made as easy as possible. One of the reasons advanced was the difficulty experienced by political parties in obtaining a representative vote. It was pointed out that at every election a large number of'' electors, either because of conditions over which they had no control, or because they were indifferent to the citizen rights conferred upon them, failed to record their votes, and it was urged that the provisions of the postal voting system should be extended nnd made as-easy as possible to [206] meet such conditions. The experience of that system in connection with both Commonwealth and State, elections has been such thati any extension or easement of thefacilities must be viewed with a jealous eye, particularly on the part of those who wish to preserve the purity of the ballot. It was pointed out that an election for the great city of Melbournewas declared void because of irregularities, and that a great abuse of this system obtained,. ber's leader, and others, advocated it stronglv even after that. originally advocated by the Labour party; to meet the case of seamenand others whom I , have indicated. position . based his advocacyof the principle on a much broader ground.

The honourable member for Wide Bay has had, since then, the experience of an election in his own State. difference is that the facilities for voting by post in that State are a little easier than they are under the Commonwealth law, and the Minister seems to be travelling in the direction of removing the conditions that' surround the use of the system in connection with Commonwealth elections. To the extent that he does so, to that extent. will he cause a repetition in Federal politics of the undesirable experience of the States, which has led. the Leader of the Opposition to desire that the system should be hedged about with more safeguards. himself. ister proposes to follow Queensland legislation in this regard, he will find the Leader of the Opposition's vote against him. from the legislation of Queensland. extent that more safeguards are proposed than exist in connection with the system in force in Queensland.

It was pointed out that, in one case, the canvassers were accompanied by a police constable, who witnessed the signatures of tbe voters, although he was not empowered to do so by the Act. Since then the provisions in this regard have been extended, and, if I mistake not, it would be competent for a constable, under this Bill, to witness signatures to postal votes. The experience of both the Commonwealth and the States should make the Minister wary in proposing to give greater facilities for the abuse of the postal voting system. When abuses are discovered, the offenders should be severely punished. One of the peculiarities of the Act is that it provides that certain things shall not be done. Certain actions are declared to be illegal, and punishable in a certain way, but the Department holds that it is no part of its duty to put the legal machinery into motion. It is well known that in connection with elections unprincipled people are prepared to publish circulars damaging to the character and general reputation of candidates to whom they are opposed. able member some real gems that were circulated against me by a Labour candidate. orable member some fairly strong ones that his crowd circulated against me. I show the honourable member some gems of the kind referred to, but I was followed by them. for me, but those who distributed such circulars did not accomplish their object. It was to prevent practices of the kind that, in an amending Bill, it was provided that such circulars should bear the authority of the person issuing them and the imnrint of the printer. It is a punishable offence, to publish circulars that do not compiv with those provisions, yet, although the abuse is as great as ever it was. there has not been a single conviction. The attention of the Department has been directed to these abuses, and its reply has been that it is no part of its duty to put the law in motion. That may be an easy way of escaping a difficulty, but the Department would have acted more honorably had it refrained from proposing such legislation. When the provision in question was inserted in the amending Bill, the Minister in charge of it said that he would not take the. responsibility of enforcing such legislation. I am convinced, however, that every honourable member who voted for it did so ori the understanding that if the Department discovered an abuse, it would vindicate its own legislation. If that had not been understood, some other method would have been devised to deal with such offences. Does the Minister propose in this Bill to remedy the difficulty? with, in this Bill. the matter has .been brought under the notice of the Minister, I trust that he will see that there is inserted in the Bill, before it leaves the Committee, a clause giving the Department power to enforce the provisions of the original Act. It will only be necessary to make one or two examples, and a very grave abuse and miscarriage of justice will be removed with much benefit to the community. Earlier in the day I questioned the Minister of Home Affairs in regard to the powers of the divisional returning officers, and, although I speak only as a layman, I take exception to the legality of the exercise of such powers. The reply seemed to me to indicate that the new practice introduced in the Department is perfectly legal. If that be so, the Minister should make some provision in his machinery Bill for meeting the new state of affairs. First of all, it is laid down as a constitutional principle, that an elector shall vote Only once at an election; and, apparently in order to keep within the spirit of the Constitution, the Electoral Act provides that a divisional returning officer shall not exercise a vote as an elector, but shall have the power to give a casting vote if necessary. divisional returning officer lives in the division in which he acts. ing to the new practice, a divisional returning officer need not be a resident of the division in which he exercises his",43,Brown Calare

I come now to the question of the rolls which are now being compiled. A new system is being introduced in that a large number of polling-places being dealt with under a collective system.

I merely remarked that that would be a better plan to adopt. WhatI desire is that the map should be taken awav, because, in my opinion, it gives no information. A simple list of the names of the polling places should be attached, as it always has been, to the Federal roll, so that any person buying a roll Some time ago I sugfor a subdivision or a division, could find out that within that area there were certain polling places. It would be a very simple matter for the Department to arI am told, range, and if there were any additions or subtractions to be made after the printing of the rolls, that could be easily dealt with by a notification in the Gazette. I know that on the border line between Riverina and Hume many electors do not know whether they belong to one electorate or the other. At the election held in 1903, in one case no less than ten persons presented themselves to the nearest polling place, which happened to be in the Hume electorate; but, unfortunately, the officer After did not know his duty, and refused to allow them to vote. He could have allowed them to vote on the "" Q "" form, as other If addiofficers did. Theytook the information for what it was worth, and would not go to the trouble of travelling to the proper polling place, and the consequence was that not one of them voted. What matters it to the Department whether a man lives in an adjoining electorate. Let an elector be given the privilege of recording his vote at the nearest and most convenient place. That is an easy matter to arrange. As rolls are supplied to officers, no trickery the Minister will look into these points and indicate his intentions before the Bill is taken into' Committee. I have had a bitter experience of the' administration of the Electoral Act, and I am speaking tonight with the object of trying, as far as I can, to protect the interests of every honourable member, and to guard against'fraud being perpetrated in their case, as, unfortunately, it has been in mine. ' the honourable member for Riverina, I have had to suffer to some extent from vagaries, or peculiarities, in the working of the Electoral Act. The system which is being introduced differs from that which was in vogue at the last election, when there was a separate roll for every polling place. A number of polling places are now grouped, and a common roll applies to every polling place therein. That appears to me to offer a very fertile means of committing fraud, if persons are anxious to defeat the.ends of justice and exercise a power which the law never contemplated that they should have.

They would make their claim to vote, and though they would undoubtedly be called upon to state whether they had voted previously at the election, there would be no means of detecting them if they did vote, unless it chanced that some person had seen them enter' different polling places and record their vote. That, in my opinion, is a very serious defect indeed. In Victoria we have a system which has very much to commend it, from my point of view, and that is the numbering of the ballot-papers. 1 should like to see it adopted for the Commonwealth. Of course, I know that it is urged that it affords a means of learnjustice rather than law would prevail, ing how persons voted, but in actual practice no one has ever been injured, to myknowledge, by the operation of the system. If there should be a scrutiny, and anybody should have committed an offence, it would be a very simple thing to obtain the proof and bring the culprit to justice. \. hope that the Minister will consider the advisability of embodying the system in the Bill. In my case the presiding oflicers were found to have committed a number of very serious errors. Indeed, it was owing to an error of these officers that I was unobservations in the hope that they will seated on petition. It came out in evidence that they had committed the error not only in my case, but also in regard to the Senate elections.

In the case of the second election which I had to con test, the returning officers were compelled to sign a declaration that they had read and fully understood their instructions, and it had a remarkably good effect. 1 do not know whether the regulations to be adopted for the Commonwealth contemplate that course; but I certainly think that if they do not, they should. that; because it affords a very good security for the efficient conduct of elections. sire to refer is that of objections to voters tion, I find that there is ho call for By scrutineers.

I have i't from various persons who acted as scrutineers in my case,, that though they protested against certain votes, those votes were allowed, and there was no means of identifying the votes afterwards. for in the Bill. that my experience of the Court of Disputed Returns is that, though it is designed to prevent unnecessary expense, it results in very heavy charges; and I have come to the conclusion that an Elections and Qualifications Committee, with whom would be. preferable. I feel somewhat warmly on this subject, because, although I do not care to cast a reflection on any court of l a w , ! am forced to the conviction that a Court of Disputed Returns is notlikely to inspire the same confidence as would a tribunal representing the various parties and sections in-the House. There is a sense of fair play amongst honourable members which would lead them to decide matters justly, while the cost would be comparatively infinitesimal. I offer these have some effect.

I trust that honourable members will assist us to bring that business to a conclusion; and 1 hope that the conclusion will be as happy and unanimous as that just attained. During the afternoon of the present sitting the Prime Minister made a quotation, :is he thought, from a speech by me which T challenged. He represented me as saying that we wanted to do away with State Rights. I challenged the accuracy of his statement, and he said that he had made [207] a note of my words, and there could not be any doubt about them. I then invited Hansard to produce an uncorrected proof of my speech. I have read it, and find that there is nothing in it to justify the Prime Minister's statement. I have shown it to the honourable gentleman, and he cannot find the passage. It is seldom that I Liddell, F . make a correction of this kind, but I feel [ifl £>justihed in doing so on the. present occaMathews, J. sion. The right honourable member for Mauger, S. East Sydney also said the other night that I had stated that we, as a CommonweaUh, McDougall, ] . K . could do as we liked with our money. I Palmer, A. C. challenged that statement, and have been Poynton, A. unable to find it in the report of my speech. Quick, Sir John The right honourable member said that he Reid, Sir George was not positive about the point. I find Roberts, E. A. that a report of . the statement was sent to Spence, W. G. Brisbane without a qualification, and that Storrer, D. some political capital is being made out of Thomson, Dugald it. I am sorry that the Prime Minister Thomson, John was so persistent in his statement to-day, Tudor, F. G. especially as. he must admit that the -Wilson, J. G. Hansard report does not give him a leg Wise, G. H . to stand upon. I wish to inquire what the Wynne, Agar business will be for to-morrow and TuesTellers: day? ter) f r o . 6 ] I desire to say that while the statement of the Leader of. the Opposition is correct, nevertheless, while he was speak. ing on the occasion referred to, I took down the expression as I thought it f e l l from his. lips. It was, as I understood, a statement about "" sweeping away"" State .Rights. the report. venient text to hang some remarks upon, in reply to the honourable member. He has since shown me the Hansard proof of his speech, and I find that there is no such' precise expression in it . There is an allusion to State Rights, but I feel sure that the word "" sweep "" was used in some way. there. Will the Prime Minister be kind enough to read the passage, if there, is still any doubt? after the honourable .member's assurance, but cannot comprehend how I came to misconceive the expression. sweeping away State Rights is not justified by the passage. Will the Prime Minister be good enough to read it?",50,Third Reading

321,Mr Fisher,"The suggestion about'part referred toTliere will urise in Australia a young militant and determined party which will nwcep uway all these stumbling-blocks in the way of true national progress. This determination to secure for the States rights which are not good for them, will not assist them '» any way, but wil) ultimately react against their interests, und, as (be honourable member for Robertson indicates, help largely to increase that section of the people who believe that we should have a National Parliament with much greater powers, and' State Parliaments with greatly diminished powers. .This is evidently a correct report, and I am not disputing it. But in some way I took the word "" sweep"" and the term "" State Rights"" down together. Of course, I do not challenge the Hansard report, and regret that I made the mistake. I have been asked to mention the business for Tuesday. On that evening we shall endeavour to arrive at a final determination with regard to the Northern Territory agreement, and I ask honourable members to then dispose of the Bill.
