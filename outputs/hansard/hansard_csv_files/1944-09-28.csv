Mr M'OBGAN I ask the Prime Minister whether or not, when investigations by the War Expenditure Committee disclose fraud against the Commonwealth, the committee has the authority to act promptly to bring the culprits to justice and protect the interests of the Commonwealth. If not, will the right honourable gentleman state on whose responsibility either criminal or civil action may be instituted? ' ture Committee has no authority to institute legal proceedings against anybody. Its authority is solely to report to me and to the Parliament. The law officers of the Commonwealth institute whatever investigation may be warranted by matters disclosed in the reports of the committee. If they believe that a prima facie case has been established, they tender an appropriate recommendation to the 'Attorney-fGeneTal. I have no doubt that the law would he invoked in circumstances which warranted such action. WAR. for Repatriation state whether or not the Government is making special provision for the repatriation in civil life of Australian prisoners of war who may shortly 1>e returning to this country? In view of the lengthy -period of imprisonment they have undergone, is it not likely that very great difficulties may have to be overcome in this regard? If the matter has not yet .been dealt with, will the honourable gentleman give consideration to it at an early date? soners of war return to this country, they will again come under the control of the Army, and those suffering from dia' abilities will eventually pass to the control of the Department of Repatriation.

Has the matter yet been dealt with ? MT. FOBDE -Sinc e my return from Brisbane, I have had a conference with my colleague, the Minister for Repatriation, and with Mr Richardson, chairman of -the War Service Homes Commission. Three blocks of land adjacent to the 112th Australian General Hospital, Greenslopes, just across Mary-street, are to .be made available as a site for a Bed Cross recreation hut. Steps will be taken by th6 Department of the Army, in collaboration with the Department of the Interior, to implement this decision. 1939-43 STAB. will have noticed that the Minister for the Army intends to adjust anomalies in connection with the issue of the 1939-43 Star. Hundreds of members of the Air Force have been omitted from consideration in connection with the award of this decoration. I refer to men who served in Britain. . Many of them became casualties, and discrimination has been practised against them because they are not members of air crews. Will the .honourable gentleman ensure that the consideration of their eligibility will be equal to that extended to men who have had service in New Guinea and the Middle' East? the statement of the Minister for the Army, .but I assure .the honourable member that consideration has been given to the award of this decoration to airmen who have served in certain areas.

The honourable member can say all that on a subsequent motion if this motion should be carried. the Opposition) [3.6] -The question before the Chair is that the Standing Orders be suspended to eniaible a motion to be made relating to the conduct of the Chair. I am not going to discuss the particular incident which gave rise to this motion, because I cannot do so at this stage, but I do say to honourable members on both sides of the House that any question which involves the decision of the Chair is not only one of first-class importance in a deliberative assembly, but also one of very great urgency. It is not a matter which should be allowed to rest. It should not be allowed to give rise to running discontent. It is a matter which should be disposed of in the interests of everybody with the greatest promptitude. For that reason, I hope that the Government will accept this motion in order that the whole matter may be disposed of before Minister and Minister for Defence) [3.8] I address myself to the argument of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies). Standing Order 287 prescribes the procedure whereby action may be taken in the event of objection being taken to a ruling of Mr Speaker. The standing order readsIf any objection is taken to tlie ruling or decision of the Sneaker, such objection must be taken at once, and in writing, and motion I cannot see that I am. made, which, if seconded, shall be proposed to the House, and debate thereon forthwith adjourned .to the next sitting day. That means that the motion must be made and seconded immediately after Mr Speaker's ruling has been given.

64,Mr Ctjrtin,"The Standing Ordersconform with those of the House of Commons. This standing order was devised so that debate on the ruling of Mr sure that the intention of the Leader of Speaker would he postponed until heated feelings, which perhaps would prompt mistaken judgments, had cooled. It was considered by the framers of the Standing Orders that consideration as to whether Mr Speaker's rulings should be upset or confirmed should be adjourned until the following day. The right honourable gentleman says that we should deal with this matter now. My point is that Parliament itself, over a long period, has prescribed as the most suitable occasion on which to debate Mr Speaker's ruling the day after the ruling has been given. The Leader of the Australian Countiy party ( Mr Eadden) has moved for the suspension of the Standing Orders in order to do now what the Standing Orders say should be done at the next sitting. I quite agree that urgent matters affecting administration can be dealt with more expeditiously than the Standing Orders prescribe, but I consider that it would be a cardinal mistake to set aside the procedure laid down by the Standing Orders to determine whether Mr Speaker's ruling should be confirmed or dissented from. [3.13] I have witnessed many occasions on which motions for the suspension of the Standing Orders have been made, but never an occasion before on which it was deemed necessary that the maker and supporters of the motion should state why the Standing Orders should be suspended. However, I do that now. The motion made by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Eadden) is not a motion of disagreement with Mr should be accepted by the Government. Speaker's ruling. It is a motion that the Standing Orders be suspended to enable him to make a motion of no confidence in Mr Speaker. I recall a precedent for this. The Prime Minister( Mr Curtin), when he was Leader of the Opposition, moved a vote of no confidence in the Chairman of Committees. I nm about to refer to that. There is a distinction between the two cases. In the onu case, the motion concerned the Chairman of Committees; but, in this case, it concerns Mr Speaker. I am quite the Australian Country party is to challenge, not Mr Speaker's ruling, but his partiality, good sense and judgment. Those are matters which should not be left until to-morrow, but should be decided on the spot, after due debate. We have witnessed this afternoon the naming and suspension of two honourable members. It would be quite easy for others to be named. I am quite satisfied with the name my parents gave me. In no sense is this a motion of disagreement with Mr Speaker's ruling. This is far deeper and far graver than that, for the motion challenges the partiality, good sense and, virtually, the honesty of the Chair. Having that in view, I said to the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) as he left the chamber, after his suspension, that he should consult Speaker Lenthall's ghost. I support the motion. This is not in any real sense a challenge to a ruling of the Chair. It is an endeavour, because of certain events to which I cannot refer, to express our lack of confidence in Mr Speaker's impartiality in discharging his important duties. But even if objection were being taken ,lo a ruling, the reasons given by the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) would have no application to this particular case. The Standing Orders provide for cases of emergency. When a matter of urgency arises, the Standing Orders may be suspended on a motion, duly moved and seconded, without notice. There is an important reason why the motion submitted by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Eadden) This is not a party matter; at affects the undoubted right of a. private member, at a time when practically all authority is vested in the executive, to question Ministers on matters of national and public importance. This afternoon, that right has been denied to honourable members by a display of partiality by the Chair. Consequently, members of 1ht» Opposition seek to challenge the manner in which Mr Speaker has discharged his duties by submitting a motion of no confidence in the Chair. I cannot understand",8,Appropriatio Nbill 1944 45

68,Mr Spender (Warringah) [3.15],"why, in those circumstances, the Government does not facilitate a debate on the subject. motion submitted by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) will provide honourable members with an opportunity to give reasons why, following recent occurrences in this chamber, the House should express its lack of confidence in the Chair. The Chair performs a simple, but tremendously important, ""function, namely, to ensure that, within the limits prescribed by the Standing Orders, the elected representatives of the people shall be given an opportunity to perform their parliamentary duties. Honourable members have the right in this chamber to state their views and to claim that certain action should or should not be taken, and within the limits of the Standing Orders, to seek information from Ministers. The honourable member for Eichmond( Mr Anthony) rose in his place and attempted to ask a question. That was quite proper. able member is now canvassing the merits of what will be a subsequent motion, and the Chair will not permit it. fringe your ruling, Mr Speaker. I am merely seeking some room for manmuvre for the purpose of stating reasons why honourable members should be given an opportunity to express their lack of confidence in your ruling. We cannot do so without examining the functions of the Chair and the rights of honourable members. An honourable member has the right to stand in his place and ask a question, just as a Minister has the right to reply or to refuse to reply to it. The honourable member for Richmond attempted to ask a question. able member is now canvassing whether my ruling was correct. Mi-. McEWEN I am not. When you interrupted me, I was stating a fact and I claim that, speaking to this motion, I am in order in relating the facts of recent occurrences. The honourable member for Richmond attempted to address a question to a Minister. I know, from what he told me, that the nature of the question"" was different from what the Chair presupposed. Now, the Chair is human and is capable of making an error of judgment. But an error of judgment must not be permitted to nullify the rights of honourable members. No more serious calamity could come upon us than a curtailment of the rights of private members as the result of a ruling by the Chair. The practices in parliaments arise in two ways, first, from decisions of the Parliament itself, as contained in the Standing Orders, and secondly, and even more importantly, from precedent. A precedent which may be established on this occasion is that the Chair shall be regarded as possessing the gift of second sight. regarded as being able to read in an honourable member's mind the question that he intends to ask. If , in the opinion of the Chair, the question should not be asked, Mr Speaker will have the right to order the honourable member to resume his seat. That occurred this afternoon. It would be a complete negation of the democratic system of government and of those principles of freedom about which so many words were uttered on a thousand platforms during recent months, if an honourable member, upon an imagined interpretation of what he intends to say, can be ordered by the Chair to resume his seat, and upon his claiming the right to express himself, be suspended from the service of the House. The second point which justifies an examination of the question whether the Chair, as the result of its recent decisions, is entitled to retain the confidence of the House, arises from the fact that this afternoon an honourable member rose in his place and said, "" Mr Speaker, I rise to order."" The Standing Orders clearly provide that at any time an honourable member may rise in his place and state a point of order. When he has done so, Mr Speaker shall uphold or reject it. Again, there can be no more serious infringement of the rights of honoraible members, nor can anything be more calculated to change the course of parliamentary discussion than to deny to an honourable member the right to question a decision of the Chair by taking a point of order.",9,Appropriatio Nbill 1944 45

89,Mr Harrison,"I consider that Ithis House, but also to every honourable member. If we are not afforded the right to discuss the substantive motion which the Leader of the Australian Country party desires to move, we shall be prevented from doing the work we were sent here to do. We shall be deprived of the right to express our opinions, and so will not be able to fulfil our functions as representatives of the electors. A decision whicli would have that effect would strike right at the roots of Parliamentary practice .and, in fact, of democratic rights. Mr 'Curtin -Parliamentar y practice ter has already addressed himself to the question. I am in the unfortunate position of not being permitted to express my mind gross reflection on the Chair. to protect me against interjections, especially from Ministers sitting at the table. I appeal to the House to agree to the suspension of the Standing Orders especially as the matter at issue involves the honoraible member who has been elected iby the House to protect the interests of members. I support the motion, for I consider that it is essential to debate, without delay, any complaint that may have been lodged against the conduct of the Chair. I consider that the Speakership is not only the highest office which the Parliament can give to an honourable member portance of the Speakership eannot be discussed on this motion. that the trustee of the rights of honourable members of the Parliament member is still out of order. of the presiding officer of this House is impugned in any way whatsoever, I do not consider that the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) should attempt to prevent the matter from being discussed immediately. The right honourable gentleman referred to a particular standing order whicli supported his contention. I direct attention to Standing Order 407, which readsIn cases of urgent necessity, any standing or sessional order, or orders of the House, may bo suspended for the day's sitting, on motion, duly made and seconded without notice. It ill became the Prime Minister, who has a wide knowledge of the Standing Orders, to fail to mention Standing Order 407, hut to spend his time in telling us a long story about the practice of the House of Commons. I submit that we are entitled to an immediate opportunity to discuss a matter which affects our rights as members of the Parliament and which, in fact, brings into question that fundamental consideration of democracy, freedom of speech and expression, which the Minister for Information ( Mr Oalwell) is attempting to suppress outside of this chamber by attacks upon the newspapers. -Although the Prime Minister has said that the .substantive motion which the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) desires to move could be debated to-morrow, by moving dissent from Mr Speaker's ruling, unique circumstances exist which make it desirable that the subject shall be dealt with at once. There should be no delay in coming to a decision when the privileges of honourable members are threatened. Ever since the establishment of this Parliament, 44 years ago, it has been the practice for honoraible members, at the beginning of each sitting day, to ask questions without notice. I understand that this practice is not recognized in the Standing Orders. In fact, one of the reasons for revising the Standing Orders honourable member is sufficiently conversant with the Standing Orders to know that he cannot canvass that subject on this motion. to the point made by the Prime Minister. The asking of questions without notice is integral to our parliamentary system.",11,Appropriatio Nbill 1944 45

He cannot, at this stage, deliver a lecture to the House or to the Chair on the reasons why questions without notice have become the practice of this House. That has nothing to do with the motion before the Chair, which is, whether the Standing Orders should be suspended to allow a certain subject to be discussed. Any debate at this stage must be confined to that question. deavouring to reply to a point raised by the Prime Minister, who stated that, according to the Standing Orders, the substantive motion of the Leader of the Australian Country party could be debated to-morrow. As the Prime Minister was allowed to submit his case, I consider that I should be allowed to state my reply. honourable gentleman is reflecting upon the Chair. The Prime Minister made no reference whatever to questions.

If the second alternative were chosen honourable members would be prevented from asking questions, until the motion had been dealt with, for it would take .precedence over other business on the day on which it was listed. I . suggest, therefore, that the matter should be disposed of immediately. It is necessary, of course, for dissent from a ruling to be indicated immediately, which, in itself, shows that there is urgency in the matter. I consider that if the procedure suggested by the Prime Minister be adopted the rights of private members to ask might disappear entirely.

108,Mr Mcewen (Lndi) [3.45],"I raisein this Parliament. In order to consider ihose rights, we must have in our minds a clear picture of the circumstances in which this Parliament came to ihe constituted, the nature of its functions, and how those functions are performed, by honourable members. The purpose of the Parliament is to give effect to the Australian Constitution, under which it was established as the supreme legislative authority in the Commonwealth. Prom its deliberations and decisions emerge all those matters which affect the safety and security of the nation, as well as the rights and freedoms of the people. The Parliament is composed of honourable members who have been elected to it in accordance with the law to represent their respective constituencies, and its functions are discharged deliberatively. The rules that govern debate are contained in the Standing Orders. The democratic structure embodying the rights of the people is affected by decisions concerning their livelihood and the security of the nation as a whole. Fair government can be assured only if full opportunity be given to those who have ibeen elected to act in accordance with the rights conferred on them by the Standing Orders, which are modelled substantially on those of the mother of all parliaments, the House of Commons. The Parliament functions on a party basis. The party which has the majority of members in this chamber composes the Executive, whicli in time of war is clothed by the Parliament wdth almost unlimited authority to act without reference to the Parliament. Members of another party or of other .parties compose the minority in the Parliament, and upon them devolves the duty and responsibility of safeguarding the interests of the people, by examining acts of the Government, and, so far as security permits, bringing to the light of day >all matters which they consider ought to be ventilated. The present system will continue to function only so long as the deliberations of this assembly are presided over by a Chair which exercises the utmost impartiality as between the majority and the minority representation, and gives decisions that are beyond question, safeguarding at .all times the individual rights of the representatives of the people. privilege ? The Standing Orders place well-defined limits on the length and subject-matter of the speeches that may be made from time to time, and the occasions on and frequency with which an honourable member may address the Chair. The sole function of the Chair is to ensure that the deliberations of the assembly shall be conducted in an orderly manner and in conformity with the Standing Orders. For the Chair to arrogate to itself the right to interpret the intention of an honourable member before he has said sufficient to disclose his mind would be not only to infringe completely the rights of honoraible members, but also to negate the whole system of government. The question of privilege to which I direct attention relates to a recent decision of the Chair. An honourable member, in accordance with established practice, rose to address a question to a Minister upon a matter which had arisen from an executive act that had been performed under the canopy of .the National Security Act. The Chair assumed the responsibility of deciding that the honourable member intended to ask a question that already had been answered and was, for some reason, improper. Perhaps that is not the most important basis upon which the rights of honourable .members could be limited or denied. Traditionally in British parliarments, the rights of members have been secured through the ages only as the result of continuous struggle. That those rights, and through their exercise the privileges of the people, will remain safe only so long as unceasing watch is maintained over them, is beyond question. able gentleman now to state his question of privilege. privilege is that an honourable member is entitled to ask ,a question and, concurrently, to raise a .point of order. Under the comprehensive system of rules which govern the debates in this House, many decisions have been made by the Chair. Surelyi t is not claimed that on every occasion the 'Chair, in the different persons who have occupied it gentleman satisfied that in his most recent, remarks he has stated his question of",13,Privilege

Is not a question of privilege involved when an honourable member seeks to enforce a right, either on his own 'behalf or on .behalf of another honourable member? Secondly, does not the determination of privilege ultimately rest with this House, irrespective of iany standing order? If so, on what ground does the Chair refuse to hear the motion of the honourable .member for lndi? is not necessary for the Chair to give reasons for its ruling unless' it so desires. The honourable gentleman does not suffer from any physical defect which would have prevented his hearing what I said to the honourable member for lndi. The matter has been ruled out of order. If any honourable member disagrees with my ruling, he has his remedy. WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION BILL 1944. Message recommending appropriation reported.

[4.31] I agree with the remarks of the honourable member, for Balaclava ( Mr pare and bring in a bill to carry out the foreWhite). One of ' t h e most disturbing things which Australians in our capital cities witness during loan campaigns is the "" travelling circus"". AlthoughI have never been to Wirth's Circus, people who have seen it inform me that it is a really good show.

The people are well aware that the loan has been launched, but the policy pursued by the Government does not insist that those who are able to subscribe shall do su, but leaves it entirely to the ""willing horse "". That policy is bad, and, sooner or later, will bring just retribution politically on the community. The Government's loan policy is creating huge debts, and the Government is not keeping a watchful eye on expenditure. The most important statement which I have heard recently regarding public finance was contained in the repiy of the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) to the budget debate.

The balance of the loan appropriation available at the 30th June, 1944, was £206,000,000.

During the budget debate, I mentioned that the Taxation Department was requesting people to explain where they had obtained the money to invest in Commonwealth loans, and I warned the Treasurer that this inquisition would have a most detrimental effect on subscriptions. Replying to my statement, the Treasurer leant nonchalantly against the table, scoffed, and declared that he had no evidence of the practice. I thought that I detected a note of disappointment in the Treasurer's voice when he made that statement, so I propose to place before him correspondence between the Deputy Commissioner ol' Taxation in New South Wales and a citizen who invested money in a victory loan. This illustration should convince the Treasurer of the advisability of restraining his bloodhounds in future and preventing their baying from frightening prospective subscribers. My correspondent, -whom I do not know personally, wrote to me on the 22nd September last that he had read in the Sydney Morning Herald the statement of the Treasurer regarding the alleged questioning by taxation officials of persons who had subscribed to the Commonwealth loan.

At the moment I am concerned chiefly that the Minister should reconsider the proposed repeal of the provisions of the principal act relaand there should be insistence on the protive to the limit of the annual bounty or, vision of ample supplies of spare parts. that he should explain more fully why this is considered to be necessary. The manufacture of tractors in Australia is of great imiportance to our agricultural industries. Prior to the outbreak of the war tractors were being efficiently produced Machines made here were comparable in every way with those imported from abroad. »I commend the Government for the encouragement that has been given to the industry, and I suggest that factories which have been diverted from tractor manufacture to other war needs should be released as soon as practicable for the resumption of tractor production. There is a tremendous demand for tractors throughout Australia. The machine has come to stay. Farmer -, are anxious to have on their properties mechanical power, which has been proved beyond doubt to be the most economical method. agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) that any portion of the bounty unexpended at the end of one year should be carried forward into the next year, so that the utmost encouragement may be afforded. At the same time, I impress on the Government the need to control retail prices fairly rigidly. Since normal production was interfered with by war conditions, prices have risen greatly, and I trust that the industry will be encouraged by having them maintained at a reasonable level. am glad that the Government is giving effect to the principle established twenty years ago, by its proposal to pay a bounty on the manufacture of tractors. Thus the cost of production will be materially reduced, and the retail price will be a reasonable one, whilst the manufacturer will obtain fair recompense. I welcome the increase of the total amount of the bounty from £35,000 to £100,000, and support the proposal of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) that any money unexpended in one year shall be carried forward into the succeeding year. Supervision should be exercised in order to ensure efficient manufacture, When I visited several of the great American factories that were manufacturing this machine and implements of war two years ago, I learned that the practice was to make simultaneously with the machines 100 per cent, of spare parts, in order that they would be available conin Australia. currently with its use. Throughout Australia there are thousands of tractors which cannot now be used because a spare part costing up to 7s. 6d. is not available to replace one that has been worn out. Apparently, many of the spare parts that are needed for some of the machines will never be available, because of a change of pattern almost yearly by one of the local manufacturers, and the absence of definite records of what changes were made. Efficient production will ensure a great future for the industry. Tremendous expansion of activity is already occurring in every avenue of production. The use of a tractor with I a log hauler attached haspractically doubled the area from which many hardwoods and soft-woods may be hauled, because the tractor can operate in ravines and other parts where the conditions are too difficult for the use of bullocks. In addition, the expeditious handling thus made possible has enabled operations to be conducted profitably in areas which otherwise would be neglected. By this means, employment will be stimulated. At least 2,000 or 3,000 more men are now employed in the timber industry on the north coast of New .South Wales, as the result of the utilization of mechanical power, and timber production has increased by at least three times compared with the pre-war output. That the cost of road-making has been substantially reduced by the use of the bulldozer and the tractor is unquestionable. The original estimate of the cost of a ro-d in which I was interested was £10,000, and the time needed for completion was to be eighteen months. With the use of a bulldozer, it has been constructed for less than £1,000",23,Second Reading

203,Sir Earle Page (Cowper) [5.2],"Iin. a period of eight weeks. A first class machine, with ample power and all necessary equipment, is essential. What is true of timber haulage and road making is true also of agriculture. During the last five or six years, agricultural production in Australia has been maintained largely as the result of the use of tractors. Great Britain has been more than doubled because the number of tractors available for agricultural purposes has been doubled. The use of mechanical power would .be of very great assistance in reducing costs and making reproductive from the outset many water conservation, irrigation, and power generation projects. The number of tractors needed will be considerably greater than is now available. The honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) yesterday mentioned the enormous sums that had been expended during war-time on the importation of tractors. Many of the factories now producing war requirements are so tooled that they would readily be convertible to the making of tractors. In the next eighteen months, we shall have to apply our energies to the defeat of Japan, consequently the bounty will not operate fully during that period, because many prosspective manufacturers will be deterred from beginning operations. Therefore, any amount unexpended at the end of -the year should not revert to revenue but should l>e carried over into the succeeding year. I commend the Government for having brought down this bill to continue the bounty on the manufacture of tractors. As those who are to participate in it will thus derive great benefit from Commonwealth revenues, they must manufacture the very .best tractors and also an adequate supply of spare parts, in order that the users may not be obliged to purchase >a new machine, solely because some small part is not replaceable. I support the remarks of the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), .who said that certain Australian manufacturers had not maintained supplies of spare parts during the great drive for the production of vegetables and agricultural commodities. I am a plain, blunt man, and give credit for either good deeds or misdeeds. The two manufacturers of tractors in the Commonwealth are, A. H . McDonald and Company, of Melbourne, which manufacfactures the McDonald Imperial superdiesel tractor, and the Howard Automanufacturing Company, which manufacturesin Sydney the Howard autuProduction on the land in cultivatoi"" tractor. I have received numerous complaints from constituents, particularly in the Lower Hunter areas, which contain some of the best agricultural land in New South Wales, in which Howard auto-cultivators are used, of tininability of the farmers to obtain spare parts from either the manufacturers or ihe agents. In one yard in which repairs were being made to tractors, I counted seven or eight Howard auto-cultivators that were lying idle. I understand that about ten machines which were urgently required for vegetable production wen 1 idle on the farms. Some of them had been out of commission for eight or nine months, and it was impossible to obtain spare parts from the company. Those who derive benefits from this, bounty should behave as other companies are required to behave when the Government assists them, by maintaining supplies of spare parts, in order that the farmers may not be handicapped in their important task of food production. The bill should stipulate that Australian manufacturers shall keep themselves up to date and produce tractors of the latest types that are being produced in the world. I believe that I am correct in saying that a crawler type of tractor is not being made. The McDonald machine may have alternative tracks fitted to it, but there is no machine comparable with the Holt caterpillar tractor, the Cletrac caterpillar tractor, or the McCormackDeering tractor. The manufacturers should be compelled to keep their machines up to date in comparison with those that are manufactured in other countries, and it should be a sine qua non that those who participate in the bounty should maintain adequate supplies of spare parts, in order that the operations of farmers may not be delayed interminably when a part has to be replaced. The policing of the bounty may be effected through the organization",24,Second Reading
204,Mr Abbott (New England) [5.9],"of the Tariff Board, or it might be done better through the State Departments of Agriculture. [5.15] -I support this bill, which provides for the payment of a bounty on the manufacture of tractors. I believe that it is wise to encourage the manufacture of machinery suitable for the working of big holdings. Some time ago, an order was placed in the United States of America for 10,000 tractors at a cost of £6,000,000. In my opinion, it would have been better to have devoted a part of this money to subsidizing the manufacture of tractors in Australia. Sitting suspended from 5.18 to 8 p.m. adequate financial inducement many Australian firms would undertake the manufacture of modern tractors. The firm of Walkers Limited, Maryborough, which has shown considerable interest in the construction of diesel engines, would probably have been willing to execute a large part of the order for tractors that was given to the American manufacturers. It is no answer to say that when that order was placed Australia could not afford the skilled labour and steel necessary for the local manufacturing of tractors, because, as I have commented previously in this chamber, skilled labour and steel are being absorbed in the construction, at the cost of £4,250,000, of a warship which, I hope, will be obsolete long before it will ever be required for active service. The labour, materials and money being expended, on the construction of that vessel could, with better results to Australia, have, been diverted to the manufacturing of the tractors which primary producers need so badly. The development of the tractor industry ought to contribute substantially to the solution of the problem of how to employ our men when the war ends. Instead of buying tractors abroad in future, I hope that the Government will supplement its payment of a bounry by placing orders with local manufacturers for all the tractors Australia requires. ter for Supply and Shipping) [8.4] -in replyI shall place before the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Keane) the suggestion of the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) that any part of the tractor bounty unclaimed at the end of the year should Ibe carried over to the following year. Originally, the bounty was limited to £35,000 a year. The Minister for Trade and Customs has supplied the following table disclosing that in no year since the inception of the bounty has the full amount been claimed:Bounty paid. £ ] 937-38 .. .. 25,550 193S-39 .. .. 17,313 193940 .. .. .. 12,452 194041 .. 6,750 194142 1,108 194243 .. S50 194344 .. 5,651 The bounty has been fixed at the rate of £100,000 a year on the recommendation of the Tariff Board, which recommended also that there should be no carry over, so that firms might not be enticed into the manufacture of tractors unless assured of a market. The appropriation of £100,000 annually for the purposes of the bounty is sulbject to review by the Tariff Board whenever the Minister for Trade and Customs may consider necessary. The right honourable member for Cowper (' Sir Earle Page) and the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) referred to the need for supervision of the manufacture of tractors. Section 10 of the principal act provides for regular inspections to ensure the maintenance of quality. It has been suggested that Howard Auto Cultivators Limited have-not given sufficient attention to the manufacture of spare parts. The firm's excuse was that it has been engaged on the manufacture of munitions. That excuse may not be valid in view of the fact that tractors are as essential as are munitions to Australia's war effort.

207,Mr Beasley (West Sydney,"MinisI n committee: The bill. In 1937-38 when £25,556, the highest amount ever paid in the history of this bounty was paid, 455 tractors were manufactured in Australia. Only 84 tractors were manufactured in 1943-44, when the amount of the bounty was £5,651. The Ministerf o r Supply and Shipping( Mr Beasley) said that the Government had decided that there should be no carry-over of unexpended bounty. However, I point out that the conditions which existed in the Australian tractor industry before the Avar cannot be regarded as a criterion for either the present or tlie future. We are, as it were, becoming "" tractor minded "". A f t e r the war we shall -be looking forward to greater development of the tractor industry, because we shall require a constantly increasing number of tractors for develop' mental work. The Government, therefore, ought to have shown more imagination in deciding its policy in this matter. A fte r the war, it will take some time for the firms which may be interested in the manufacture of tractors to convert their plants from a war-time to a peace-time footing. If the industry is to be encouraged the unexpended portion of the bounty should be allowed to carry over each year so that manufacturers shall have the opportunity to recoup themselves in subsequent years for losses which they may suffer in their earlier operations.

211,Mr Beasley (West Sydney,"Ministe rprincipal act, the cost of imported sulphur is based on "" all sulphur "", but this bill amends the definition to base the imported cost on "" crude brimstone "". Bounty will be payable on Australian elemental sulphur, or on the sulphur equivalent of sulphuric acid produced from any Australian material. accordance with similar provisions in other bounty acts, the bounty on sulphur, after the commencement of this act, will be reduced whenever new or increased customs duties may be imposed on imported sulphur by amounts equivalent to those duties. Under the principal act, an amount of £110,000 a year has been appropriated for the purpose of bounty payments, with a proviso that any unexpended balances could be carried over to succeeding years It is proposed under this bill to increase the annual appropriation to £180,000 and to eliminate the provision regarding unspent balances. The reason for the increase is to provide for bounty on 100,000 tons of sulphur a year, which is the present capacity of the plant in Australia and which is not likely to be exceeded, at least for a considerable time. At the maximum rate of bounty, £1 16s. a ton, this would require £180,000. The principal act limits the operation of the bounty to a period of five years, ending on the 23rd October, 1944. This bill does not impose a time limit for the reason that, if bounty again becomes payable, the Government intends to have the nature and extent of the ""assistance required by the industry again investigated by the Tariff Board. conditions cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, and this bill merely provides a safeguard for the industry, pending a further invesria-atinn. should overseas prices fall and import costs decrease. Under this bill, it is proposed to amend sub-section 2 of section 12 of the principal act, which requires bounty claimants to furnish a balance-sheet and profit and loss account, &c, each half year. The object of requiring this information was -The Minister for Supply and Shipping to have available an indication as to profit ( Mr Beasley), directed attention to the prospects for the year in order to ensure fact that no bounty had been paid on that excess bounty would not be paid. sulphur since 1940. But that is no In practice, it has been found that this entails considerable extra work by the bounty claimants and does not afford the department any great assistance, as, generally speaking, the preparation of the balance-sheets, &c, takes considerable time, and, consequently, are supplied to In the department too late to be of any real value. Therefore, it is proposed to require bounty claimants to submit balance sheets, &c, only in respect of each financial year. Al l other provisions in the principal act express the usual conditions and powers which experience has proved to be essential to the efficient administration of the bounty and the safe-guarding of the Commonwealth's funds. It is not necessary for me to recapitulate the history of the assistance given to the production of sulphur in Australia, which commenced in 1922, as full details were given when the Sulphur Bounty Act 1939 was introduced. I content myself with saying that in 1922, it was realized that serious economic waste was involved in the non-utilization of the sulphuric acid available in large quantities in certain materials and ores. Prior to 1922, this acid content could not be utilized as its extraction was not a commercial proposition. The establishment of sulphuric acid production has provided a much-needed local source of supply of sulphur, thus safeguarding the fertilizer and chemical industries It is also of importance from the defence aspect. Since the commencement of the present war, the cost of importing sulphur has Post-war greatly increased, and it is estimated that the saving effected on the quantity produced locally has been much greater than the total bounty paid. The sulphuric acid industry ha.s increased its efficiency from time to time. The present bounty of £1 73. a ton is 40 per cent, less than the original bounty of £2 5s. I commend the bill to the House as a progressive measure for an efficient and valuable Australian industry.",27,Second Reading
212,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [S.23].,"reason why the Government should not continue to carry expended balances from year to year. The Minister certainly indicated that the Tariff Board would review this industry from time to time, and, for that reason, the Government had not limited the amount to be paid by way of bounty under this legislation. The act itself provided that the bounty should operate for a period of five years. The Government proposes also to extend the bounty to Australian elemental sulphur. I should like the Minister to inform the House whether elemental sulphur is being produced in this country to any marked degree. The bounty was introduced for the purpose of giving an incentive to industry to recover sulphur from sulphuric acid. tralia has many suliphur-bearing ores, most of them were neglected for many years and sulphur was imported. Considerable encouragement has been given to the industry, which has suitably responded. The Government should not take any action to prejudice the efforts that have already been made to develop this industry. Under the principal act, an amount of £110,000 was appropriated annually for bounty payments. The bill increases the figure to £180,000. If the other restrictions were waivr>d. additional assistance could be given to enable the industry substantially to develop. The reason why the Government proposes to ask the Tariff Board to investigate this industry from time to time is fairly obvious. Honourable members can easily visualize that post-war conditions may materially affect our importations of sulphur. The price may be reduced and working costs may be decreased. The Government should not take any undue risks regarding that possibility, but should formulate a flexible policy for dealing with it. The industry is of substantial value to primary producers, because of its important to fertilizers. Therefore, representatives of the Australian Country party should ensure that the industry shall not be detrimentally affected in any way. 1 Mr Harrison. know that they are jealous of this inover undustry and will resent any interference by the Government to prevent its natural development. In addition, the industry is an important factor in supplying some of our defence requirements. The Opposition will not object to the passage of this legislation. urge the Minister for Supply and Shipping( Mr Beasley) not to take any action that will be likely to check the development of the sulphur industry, because it :s essential to the manufacture of the superphosphate so vital to our primary industries. Most of our country is hungry for superphosphate, but the supply of this fertilizer is insufficient to meet all demands. Australia is importAlthough Ausing low-quality phosphatic rock from the Red Sea area, although in Transjordania there is a huge deposit of rock of high sulphuric content, 74 per cent, which is almost as great as that of the Nauru deposits. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth Government has not attempted to obtain supplies of phosphatic rock from Transjordania, and I urge the Minister to examine the matter. Lack of superphosphate is one of the causes of the decline of primary production. With the exception of the drought, it. has been responsible more than any other factor for the reduced dairy production. ter for Supply and Shipping) [8.30] -in reply-The original amount set aside for this bounty was £110,000.

Theb ill seeks to authorize the extension of the bounty on wire netting for three years at the same rates as are provided in the Wire Netting Bounty Act 1939-1940, namely, 9s. 7d. a ton. The provisions in the principal act expressing the usual conditions and powers, which experience has proved to be essential to the efficient administration of the bounty and the safeguarding of Commonwealth funds, remain unaltered with the following exceptions («,) The principal act provided that any bounty appropriation unexpended in one year could be carried over to a subsequent year. This provision has been eliminated as the amount appropriated to pay in any year all valid claims. The amendment is desirable also so that the principal act may be brought into conformity with other proposed bounty legislation. (&) Under the principal act, bounty claimants are required to submit their balance-sheets, profit and loss accounts, &c, each half-year. This has been found to be of very little real value to the department and entails considerable work and expense for bounty claimants. This bill proposes to require manufacturers merely to submit their accounts each financial year. Bounty on wire netting was first provided in 1922 as an alternative to customs duties to relieve users of wire netting, who are very largely primary producers, of the burden of maintaining the -wire netting industry. Under bounty, the industry has made very good progress and gives considerable employment. The Tariff Board's report of the 15th September, 1944, expressed the opinion that the bounty could now be withdrawn. This opinion is undoubtedly correct as regards most, of the output, which is produced by two long-established firms in New South Wales which are earning satisfactory profits, and thereby are not eligible for bounty. However, the position of .a manufacturer in Western Australia is not on so satisfactory a level. This manufacturer, whose profit is less than the 6 per cent, specified in the. principal act, is concerned with his future in the post-war era, as he is working under some obvious disabilities compared with the manufacturers in New South Wale?. The Tariff Board has admitted that the Western Australian manufacturer has aided the food-production programme at a critical time during the war and that his establishment there assists decentralization of industry. Therefore, the Government has decided that there is justification for continuing the bounty for a further period of three years. -This is one of the cases in which a bounty has Droved successful in doing",29,Second Reading

218,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [8.37].,"the job for whicli it ""was originally designed. That is borne out by the fact that in New South Wales those firms which originally took part in the establishment of the industry of manufacturing wire netting have reached such a stage of efficiency that they now .make a profit much above the statutory 6 per cent. This bounty has been designed to help one particular firm in Western Australia. The bill to effect this purpose Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) w,a3 agreed to by Parliament in or about 1939. It virtually makes a gift of £5,000 to the one undertaking. It naturally follows that when the Western Australian project develops .to the. standard of efficiency of the undertakings in New South Wales, the bounty will automatically disappear. Indeed, the Tariff Board has declared that there is no need to continue the bounty, because the business has reached a stage at which it should no longer apply. But the board agrees that the people of Western Australia should be helped by the Commonwealth Government to establish the industry, thus carrying out the Government's policy of decentralization. It therefore recommends that in this case the bounty should be allowed to continue. It has been pointed out that the firm might have reached an improved standard of efficiency had it not diverted a large part of its plant and staff to food production, western parts of Queensland and New and that it should not be penalized for helping the Commonwealth's war effort. The sum asked for is small, the bounty has been in operation since 1939, and any encouragement that can be given to a firm of this nature to reach a. stage of should like the Government to consider efficiency equal to what has been achieved increasing the amount of the bounty, and in the other States should willingly be given. The Opposition therefore will not oppose the bill. I take it that the bounty is payable on all sizes of wire netting, but the Department-of War Organization of Industry some time ago gazetted a regulation that only rabbit netting of 1-J-in. gauge should be manufactured in Australia. This has created considerable difficulties member raised. I understand that the for many pastoralists because the gauge specified in the New South Wales Pastoralists Protection Act for rabbit-proof netting fences is 1^-in. Consequently, no grazier in that State, who uses the only netting which is available for rabbit-proof fencing purposes, namely, H-in. gauge, is able to receive the benefit of the half rates granted under the State act. I should like the Minister to take that matter up with the Minister for War and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully), so that the embargo on the manufacture of 1-J-in. netting may be removed. I appreciate the need for the bounty to assist a small manufacturing firm in Western Australia, where wire netting is so much required. No doubt New South Wales has had the benefit of the supply of wire netting made by the two major companies which manufacture w ithin its 7 borders. I could wish that the amount of the bounty could be considerably increased, so that a similar firm might be established in Queensland, because the present bounty appears to be of no particular use to those who need it in that, State, since no wire netting is available. I a.m sorry to say that that is the present position. Protest after protest is being made by local authorities in all the South Wales, but more particularly Queensland, that the dog menace is becoming so serious that pastoralists are being driven off their holdings, because they cannot get wire netting at all. 7 to take steps to make a supply of netting available to those districts, in order to prevent the dingoes from killing the stock and driving the western areas our of production. port the remarks of the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) and hope that the Minister, in his reply, will comment upon the points which the honourable bounty is payable on all gauges and",30,Second Reauino

The l i in. mesh has been established as the standard size by the pastoralist protection boards of New South Wales, because it is accepted as the most satisfactory for rabbit protection. I have no doubt that the Minister knows that those boards in certain circumstances and in certain districts strike a levy upon stock-owners per head of stock, for the purpose of raising funds to control the vermin. The Pastures Protection Board has encouraged settlers to use this mesh,' for it has provided that those who do so shall be liable for only half rates. The policy which this Government is applying, no doubt on the advice of the Department of War Organizationof Industry, cuts right across the policy that Has been approved by an act of the New South Wales Parliament, and is being applied by the Pastures Protection Board. member suggest any reason why the 1-J-in. mesh should have been preferred? would require a little less wire than l i in. mesh and it would also require slightly less zinc for galvanizing. Fences made of l i in. mesh netting are not nearly so effective as fences of l i in. mesh for small rabbits can get through them. It is most unfortunate that settlers, who are compelled by the exigencies of war to use 1-J-in. mesh netting, will not only be deprived of the benefit of the 50 per cent, reduction of their rating by the Pastures Protection Board, but will also have a less effective fence. Notwithstanding what the Minister has said I have seen no galvanized netting in my district for a considerable period. We all are aware, of course, that zinc has been in short supply. All the available zinc has been required for munitions purposes. It may be that that phase has now passed, and that some zinc could now be provided for galvanizing purposes. Wire netting is made from very thin wire, and, normally, in the construction of rabbitproof fences, the bottom part of the fence, including some of the netting, is buried under the ground. If black wire netting has to be used for these fences the results are not at all satisfactory, for the black wire rusts very quickly. I suppose its life would not be more than two or three years, and, in areas where the soil is highly mineralized, it would not be more than one year. From my own experience I know that galvanized netting has a life which ranges from 20 to 40 years. I question whether it is worthwhile paying the bounty when black netting is used, but I am not prepared to go so far as to ask that payments shall be limited to galvanized netting. I emphasize to the Minister the great hardships of farmers in these days. I am sure that those who are obliged to use black netting will suffer substantial financial loss. The labour charge is a considerable factor in the construction of fences, and it is desirable that the best possible materials shall be used, otherwise the value of the fence is greatly diminished. Mr .BEASLEY (West Sydney-Minister for Supply and Shipping) [8.51] -in reply-The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) referred to the amount of bounty that would be payable in Western Australia. The act provides that the amount may be up to £5,000, but. it is probable that only about £400 will be disbursed. In regard to New South Wales manufacturers, I am advised that neither Lysaught nor Kylands receives bounty, for their businesses are thoroughly established and their rate of profit is such that they are not eligible for .these payments. I bring to the notice of honourable members the following paragraph from a Tariff Board minute concerning wire nettingDuring: tlie last two years, owing to tlie demand for zinc for war purposes, the company has only been able to supply wire netting in an irngalvanizod state.

The great alumiment of the capital sums appropriated oi contributed by the Commonwealth and 1 the State. For its part, the State is to ensure that supplies of electricity required by the commission for the production of ingot aluminium shall be made available at a rate satisfactory to the commission. There are the usual provisions for the auditing of the accounts of the commission by the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth, and for the furnishing of reports at regular intervals. The agreement provides that the works of the commission for the production of established in Tasmania. This means that the smelter will be established in that State. Every ton of ingot produced requires 4 horse-power of electric power, therefore, a unit for . the production of 10,000 tons of ingot per annum, would require 40,000 horse-power. This power will be available in Tasmania from the large hydro-electric scheme there, at a price comparable with that which applies to the large aluminium smelters in North America-the figure mentioned is .Id. a unit. Nowhere else in Australia is there sufficient power available for this purpose at the present time, nor could it be supplied at anything like the price. The effect which the price of electricity has upon the economics of this industry may be gathered from the fact that each .Id. a unit means an addition of approximately £10 a ton to the cost of the metal. The world output of aluminium ingot power. In cases of extreme urgency power from coal has been used, notably in Britain, to produce this metal, but most of the coal power plants have now been closed, since coal is to-day probably the scarcest of minerals. No decision has been made yet on where the alumina factory is "" to be established. This will depend entirely upon economic and technical factors. Australia is fortunate in having large supplies of good-quality bauxite. Aluminium ingot is produced from alumina which in its turn is obtained from alumina-bearing materials, the chief nium plants in North America have to draw their bauxite from distant sources such as Dutch Guiana. The best Australian deposits of bauxite so far discovered are in the Boolarra-Mirboo district of Victoria. Deposits also exist in the Ouse Valley in Tasmania, the Emmaville-Inverell and the BundanoonMarulan-Crookwell districts of New South Wales, and in the Darling Range about 30 miles from Perth in Western Australia. In addition, there are* large supplies of alunite at Lake Campion in Western Australia. Experiments are being carried out by the Government of Western Australia, in co-operation with the Commonwealth, to see whether satisfactory alumina can be produced at reasonable cost from Lake Campion alunite. Western Australia already has a potash industry using alunite as the source material. It is to these alunite residues that attention is being given. There was. no aluminium ingot industry in Australia when this war began. There has been a limited Australian production of aluminium articles from imported aluminium ingot. Before embarking upon this project the Commonwealth had the benefit of the advice of leading Australian technicians, who carried out extensive investigations of the production of aluminium in North America and the United Kingdom. In addition, the Commonwealth copper and bauxite committee carried out a comprehensive survey of the bauxite resources of Australia. It is due to the efforts of that committee that we possess such a complete knowledge of the bauxite resources of this country and are able -to give the lie to the often-expressed opinion that Australia has not sufficient bauxite or that its quality is not good enough to be the basis of an aluminium industry. Already certain preliminary steps towards the establishment of the industry have been taken. Members of the commission-elect held their first meeting in Hobart on the 19th April, following immediately upon the signing-of the agreement between the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the Premier of Tasmania on behalf of the State.

It will be recalled tliat before this Government came into office, a previous administration entered into a contract for the supply of 20,000 tons of aluminium from the United States of America over a period of six years. This aluminium, of course, is required for our aircraft construction programme. Three years of that period have expired.

True, production will not be at tbe present high rate, but our defence industries must be maintained at a much higher level than before the war. quently, the availability of this metal in our own country will be of great importance. In addition, of course, there are 101 uses to -which aluminium may be put in the production of civilian goods. A. detailed survey has been made of Australian requirements of aluminium in the post-war period. 'This survey has indicated a minimum consumption of 6,000 tons per annum. Indications are that this will be greatly increased during the time required to construct and bring our new plan into full production. This may take two or three years or even more. not be committed to very much expenditure until then. tbe industry shall be financed on a £1for-£l basis by the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Tasmania.

The peace-time use of aluminium will be greatly in excess of what it ""was in 1939, particularly in the -field of architecture. It will be used operate both annexes for the duration of for window-sills, architraves, and even doors themselves. In the United States of America, aluminium is being used extensively in the manufacture of railway equipment. As a matter of fact, I believe that there are three or four trains made completely from aluminium. Thus, it will be seen that the uses to which this metal can be put are many and varied. The agreement is the main feature of Consethe bill. Another important feature is that the project may not be disposed of unless both Houses of the Parliament agree to that course being followed. smeltei'3. ber for Wilmot( Mr Guy) has referred to the smelters twice by way of interjection. The Government, for reasons that it considers wise, believes that it is advisable to take one step at a time in connection with this project. Therefore, the arrangement with the Government of Tasmania deals only with the erection of a smeltery. That appears to be the length to which that Government is prepared to go in order to have the industry established within its borders. This legislation will not prevent the Commonwealth from engaging in further development in connection with the rolling plant mills and fabricating section of the industry. The Government has some such plant at the extrusion works at Granville and Wangaratta. The Australian Aluminium Company Proprietary Limited exclusively owns the Granville extrusion, rolling and casting works. The. Munitions Department and the Department of Aircraft Production each has established an annexe adjacent to the works. The Munitions Department owns the remelt annexe and plant which were established for the segregation and rem citing of scrap aluminium. This plant consists of magnetic separator, drying drum, and furnaces for smelting. The Department of Aircraft Production owns the heavy forge annexe for the manufacture of forgings for air screws.

The Wangaratta works are owned exclusively by the Commonwealth. agreement has yet been signed, governing their operation by the Australian Alumi nium Company Proprietary Limited, but negotiations are proceeding which contemplate operation by the company for the duration of the war and six months thereafter. The foundry is complete, the hot m ill has been partly delivered, but not erected, and the cold stands and heat treatment tanks are in course of erection. The extrusion plant has been partly delivered, but not erected. It is expected that it will be possible to roll sheets by December, 1944, but it is not possible at present to state a date for the production of extrusion. Werei t so desired, the Government might be able to defer or cancel the completion of the agreement with the company. This legislation does not provide for the extension of activities beyond the manufacture of ingot aluminium; but should the Commonwealth wish to enter the wider field at any time, it w ill not be prevented from doing so. friends, doubtless, w ill have something to say in regard to the powers of the Commonwealth to engage in the manufacture of aluminium for purposes other than those relating to defence. as possible. gentleman and his colleagues may prefer to leave the determination of the matter to a judicial authority. The Government considers that the agreement with the State of Tasmania at least removes the danger of its being involved in any legal argument that might arise in connection with the matters with which the bill deals. I stress that the commission will decide the area from which bauxite supplies may be obtained. It may consider more desirable and economical the use of the deposits in Victoria instead of those in Tasmania. The Government is .particularly anxious to follow closely the operations at Lake Campion, in Western Australia, in the belief that the use of alumina from that source might be desirable. A good deal of experimental work will be necessary, and the stage has not been reached at which a firm opinion may be expressed. man information concerning production costs in other countries? figures with me.

259,. Motion (By Mr Curtin ) Proposed,"Last year, tbe Department of Supply and Shipping instructed that copper production should cease in the Mount Isa and Cloncurry districts. The operational period was subsequently extended to the 31st December of this year; in other words, the gougers and the Mount Isa Company were permitted to produce copper up to that date. Since early this year, no communication has been received from the department as to whether or not production will be permitted in the area after the 31st December, with the result that those engaged in it are concerned as to their future. For many years, the Cloncurry field has been a prolific producer' of copper. It covers approximately 20,000 square miles of country, and embraces an area approximately 300 miles in length and from 20 to 100 miles in width. Long before, as well as during, the last war, three smelters were operated in the district by three different companies, and from 1910 to 1919 the Hampden and Mount Elliott companies paid in dividents more than £1,250,000. The mines operated by those compjinies employed hundreds of men, and thousands of tons of ore, carrying from 3 per cent, to 6 per cent, of copper, was blocked out and developed, awaiting exploitation. Owing to the fall of the price of the metal, and the failure of the Government to grant ORE RESERVES MOUNT ELLIOTT HOLDINGS. Mount Elliott Mount Elliott Consols Great Australia Great Australia Dobbyn Mount Oxide Argyillia Lady Leases Crusader Mount Isa Number of mines operated by gougers-1940 , 70; 1941, 96; 1942, 92; and 1943, 74. certain freight concessions, these companies were forced to cease their operations in 1922, and all the smelters and mines were closed. From 1924 to 1929, quite a small number of gougers were operating in the area, producing ore which they sold on trucks in Cloncurry. In April, 1933, the price of copper slumped to £37 a ton, with the result that many parties distant from the railways had to cease operations. The roads became untrafncable, and the mines fell into disrepair. On the Ballara field, which is 26 miles from the rail head, 90 men used to be employed, but it had to close down. The Government of Queensland commissioned Mr Askill to report, on the field, and he suggested the establishment of a suitable treatment, plant. His report has -not been made public. The Commonwealth Government, in association with the Governments of Queensland and Western Australia, arranged for a geophysical survey of the mining resources of northern Australia, including Cloncurry, and the task occupied three years. This should be sufficient evidence of the vast possibilities of the northern mineral fields. A report was presented, which is now in the possession of the Commonwealth. Having regard to the extreme urgency of the situation, I place before the House the following particulars relating to the Queensland fields:Tons. Copper. Onld. Tons. Per cent. Dwts.

Isa and Cloncurry districts To-day, war there were thousands. As a means of stabilizing the copperin this northern section of Australia, them from being eliminated by foreign competition, with resultant unemployment in the Australian copper-mining industry. The number of employees directly engaged in Australia under normal conditions is about 5,000, with many thousands more indirectly engaged in coal-mining, transport, and the production of general supplies and equipment necessary to carry on mining, milling, smelting and refining operations. The annual production and consumption of copper in Australia just prior to the war were 'balanced at about 17,000 tons. With the post-war expansion of secondary industries there is every reason to expect an increased demand which can be met by the development of Australian production. Althoughi t may be possible to purchase imported copper at less than the Australian cost of production, this would result in sacrificing an important local indaistry. The same argument would a PPty to a large number of other commodities vital to the development of Australian primary and secondary industries, if their present protection and preshortage of supplies. ferential treatment were withdrawn. Taking sugar as one example only, it has been shown clearly, that the general development and prosperity due to the policy of protection and encouragement of this industry far outweigh in national importance any increase of cost to the consumer. Australia should be selfsufficient in products vital to its developagement and supervision. All of the ment and defence. 'So that the local metal market will not be disorganized by the release of large accumulations of war stocks of various metals, I suggest that these metals be held in reserve by the Government, and released gradually to make up any deficiency in local supplies over an extended period. It has been shown in the Cloncurry district that it is very difficult to obtain capital to re-condition and re-open a mine for production after it has closed down, even when a large ore-body is known to have been developed. Owing principally to the fall of metal prices after the last war, three smelters in the Cloncurry district ceased operations in 1922, and have not been re-opened. In 1925 Mount Elliott Limited spent £128,000 on a roasting and leaching plant, which did not operate owing to [61] the process being an infringement of a foreign patent. No further effort was made to re-open the mines beyond encouraging small parties of tributors to work the richer portions of some of them. Mount Elliott Limited has published an estimate of ore reserves in some of the mines. In addition, Mt. Isa Mines Limited, which has developed in recent years a large copper ore-body at Mt. Isa, estimates reserves at 2,500,000 tons of. ore carrying 3.2 per cent, copper, in addition to the adjoining large silverlead-zinc ore-body. [Extension of time granted.] Summarized, my suggestions for the development of the copper industry in the Cloncurry and Mount Isa districts are1. Stabilization of the Australian iprice of copper at a reasonable figure for a period of at least five years. -2. War stocks of copper should be held by the Government and released gradually over a period of years to meet any 3. Proved ore reserves warrant the re-opening of certain selected mines. The cost of purchasing, opening and dewatering the larger deposits is beyond the means of small parties, and I suggest that these be opened with government assistance and worked on a co-operative basis by a party with government manlarge deposits are held now by private companies or syndicates. The three most important areas, which also have railway communication, are(a) Dobbyn area-wit h six minesDobbyn, Orphan, Crusader, Mount Cuthbert, Warwick -Castle and Little Wonder'group, which could be developed for regular supplies, (o) Hampden-wher e Mount Elliott Limited has declared reserves of 450,000 tons of 4 per cent, sulphide copper ore developed in the Hampden Consols mine with a large tonnage of similar ore in the adjoining Hampden mine. (c) Trekelano-whic h has produced a , . large tonnage of high grade sulphide ore averaging 11 to 12 per cent, copper over a period of 25 years, but whicb is closed now owing to shortage of labour. 4. The erection of small concentrating plants to treat sulphide ore at each of these three centres, with smelting of the sulphide concentrates and crude oxidized ore at a central plant. 5. The construction of roads suitable for economical motor transport. more important roads required are(a) Direct road from Cloncurry to Mount Isa through Argylla, with branches at Ballara and Kajabbi. This would open an area of country where a large number of small lodes are known to exist, which have been worked in the past when the price of copper was high. (&) Direct road from Mount Oxide to Mount Isa. (c) Shorter access roads to individual mines could be constructed to connect with these main roads at comparatively small cost. 6. The provision of a water supply is necessary in most cases both for treatment purposes and domestic needs, and the location of treatment plants should be determined by the availability of suitable water supplies. -Early this week, I discussed with the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) a request made by the man-power authorities to local governing bodies for the supply of certain information. The Minister was somewhat staggered, and asked for time to make inquiries before replying. I could not conceive of any department asking for the information for which this department has asked unless something of great moment was impending. I therefore decided to raise the matter at the proposed secret meeting of senators and members, but that will not be held for some time. I am therefore compelled to take this opportunity to make the matter public. I have received from the town clerk of Woollahra the following letter:1 am directed to inform you that at the last meeting of the council a communication, dated the 30th August, 1944. was received from the Deputy Director-General of Man Power (New South Wales) stating "" t h a t in order to give consideration to the existing labour problems of local governing bodies, he has constituted a committee known as the Local Government Man Power Advisory Committee in order to advise him on this aspect of the subject. I was under the impression that with the diminution of Allied Works Council projects and munitions production, owing to the improved position of the war, there was no need for another committee on The man-power, but here we have one. The letter continuesThe committee has prepared a questionnaire for completion by the various councils throughout the metropolitan area in order that it may be in a position to give consideration to any labour requisitions which may be made to the Director. The questionnaire is a comprehensive one and provides for information in regard to al l activities of any council. The desired information should be supplied as far as possible on the accompanying forms, one to be used for each separate activity and returned not later than the 28th September, 1944. It is required that consideration be given also to tbe attached notes when completing the forms. As only one copy of each form can be provided, it may be necessary to reproduce in the councils office any further copies of the form. The information required to be supplied includesAlthough counicil staffs have been depleted, voluminous information has to be supplied in typewritten form. This is bureaucracy run mad. When the councils comply with the request the manpower authorities will have a more complete dossier of individuals employed by councils than even the Gestapo would think of having.

The council decided to ask me to protest against its being required to furnish the voluminous information which I have read, in addition to the detailed returns that have already been supplied. In fact, the last return was furnished as recently as the 11th May last, and the information filled sixteen foolscap sheets. The staffs of local governing bodies have already been reduced to a minimum. Honourable members have only to see the condition of the streets, gardens, and parks to know that it is almost a physical impossibility to draw any more staff from the municipalities. and gardens more important than winning the war? the request of the man-power authorities in this instance is not likely to assist in winning the war, because long ago every available man was drawn from the staffs of local governing bodies, so that even garbage cannot be removed at certain periods. The health authorities have taken action to ensure that the health of the community shall not be affected. The manpower authorities are promoting a "" paper "" war. I shall give to the honourable member some information that will stagger him. There are sources of manpower that can be drawn on without unduly fretting municipal councils with requests for information, which can be used only to bolster up a newly formed branch of a department. Any honourable member who has knowledge of the formation of .a new department knows that until it gets a staff, files and stationery, it has no prestige. In the same way, until this committee recruits staff and compiles dossiers, it will not be worth a "" cracker "". Supplying this information will not make one more man available for other work.

Usually at this time of the year, the man-power authorities make an attempt to find hands for fruit-preserving and jam-making factories, and comb most of the retail stores and banking institutions women. If the man-power authorities require additional assistance for government projects, they will probably be able to find it in the government departments and on other governnient works, where the keenness of the employees has slackened since the Prime Minister's announcement that the war was moving away from It has also recently come to my knowledge that a certain contractor on the cost-plus system, who -had a staff of men working on board a ship in Sydney Harbour, charged the Government 24 hours a day for them. When the Man Power Department investigated the claim it was found that one shift of men were sleeping on board the ship, but the contractor was charging the Government the full working time of 24 hours for all of them. That shows that in almost every instance where the Government dips its fingers into an industrial enterprise some one takes advantage of it, in regard to either the number of men, the cost incurred, or even the distribution of broadcasting licences. The same sorry spectacle is to be seen right down the line. As the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) is not present, I trust that the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), who is at present in charge of the Mr Harrison. business of the House, has taken copious notes of my observations, and will draw his colleagues' attention to them. Requests for information of this kind at this juncture represent simply the quintessence to explain to me what ter should take the matter up with the [Extension Director-General of Man Power, to enThe Minister for sure that local councils shall"" not be unduly harassed by this desire to establish one more department under the aegis of the Minister for Labour and National Service. been brought to my notice from time to time that a very desirable National Security (Landlord and Tenant) Regulation introduced for the benefit of the dependants of men in the fighting services has been much abused in actual operation by some of the people whom it was designed to help. As the Attorney General (Dr. Evatt) knows, I have been approached on the subject by an organifor young zation in Perth, and also by a member of the Western Australian House of Assembly. I have also received the following letter from a woman resident of Maylands:I am writing to yon now to see if you w ill add your voice to the number already trying to have the act amended so that at least private owners can have their own homes even in preference to soldiers' dependants. In Australia. our case, we were willin g to share w it h the tenant, but the tenant refused to share with us. I became ill with worry, being forced to suffer such hardship at the place where we had managed to get a couple of rooms. Our tenant (after eleven months) decided to allow us to use one room which we had locked, and had never let to them, but we had to make a door out to the sleep-out, as she refused to allow us to enter the front door. Being so desperate we were forced to sign an agreement which refused us the use of the kitchen and the bathroom. We had managed to borrow a little electric cooker, but as it failed the first time we used it , and we have not been able to replace it , I am at present cooking over an open fireplace in my own front room and using a baby's bath and wash-house troughs for myself, husband and two children to bathe in . Don't you thing the soldiers' dependants are carrying things a bit far? The husband in this case is stationed at Fremantle, and is home every night except one night a week. The tenant's excuse is that her two young children are not well, and she wants to give them a fair chance. We have two children, and they need a fair chance, too; after all, this is their home, and we pay the rates, and have taken the responsibility of trying to get a home together, and we need some",42,Coppee Production Cloncurry Mineral Field
266,Mr Burke (Perth) [10.8],"It hasconsideration. I hope that you will at least do your best to have the act amended, as it is causing great hardship to hundreds of people. I ask that a magistrate should be allowed a discretionary power to order that the tenant shall share the house with the owner who desires to return to it, or extend to him some other reasonable consideration. The regulation should be amended to that effect. The mere knowledge that the magistrate has that power will have the effect of making the tenant adopt a reasonable attitude when an owner desires repossession of his home or portion of it. I have known the man mentioned in the letter for many years. the war he sought to enlist, but was rejected for medical reasons: Since then he has been working for the Allied Works Council, most of the time on the Kalgoorlie aerodrome. Work on the portion on which he was engaged has now cut out, and he has returned to the city. His wife and children went back to Perth, but were unable to find a place to spend the night, and the wife was compelled to go to her home, which had been let to a tenant. The woman in the house would not allow her to enter by the door, so she entered by the window. The tenant went out, and next morning called the police to have the owner's wife evicted, even although the house is big and could easily 'be shared. The owner, who is a carpenter, undertook, if allowed back into the home, to build in the verandah to make a sleep-out, and use that to live in. I have spoken to a person associated with the appeals of soldiers' dependants. He tells me that in many instances he is able to make arrangements with the dependants of soldiers. In cases such as this he has endeavoured at times to use a measure of coercion, which he is not entitled to do, and has tried in all ways to make some of these people see that in the present desperate housing circumstances they should make every endeavour to use the accommodation to the best advantage, and recognize that owners who return have some rights. He agreed also that the actions of some of the tenants tended to make the position of ordinary soldiers' dependants practicably unbearable. We must ensure that the fullest possible protection shall be given to all at a time such as this, when housing is such an urgent need. Most certainly we must protect the interests of dependants of members of our fighting forces. We must also ensure that some individuals shall not be enabled by their selfish attitude to make more difficult the problem of housing people who desire to share their homes which they have let to tenants. I trust that the Attorney General will look into this matter as I understand it comes within his jurisdiction. There is a need for the exercise of discretion. I do not think that magisAt the beginning of trates would use such discretion unfairly. Rather would they take the opportunity to bring what may be regarded as moral pressure to bear on persons to share with the owners the homes which they occupy. If the Attorney-General can frame regulations to meet this case, he will make much easier the circumstances of many unfortunate people. support the remarks of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Burke). The case which he has brought to the notice of the House is almost identical with a case to which I drew attention in this chamber about a week ago. On that occasion I stated that, during the absence of his wife in hospital, the owner of a large weatherboard house at Cobram had let his home. Subsequently, he found that he was unable to regain possession of the dwelling, and that half of it had been sub-let to another tenant. After many months of pleading and cajoling, during which this man and his wife were assured by various solicitors that, under the existing regulations, they had no remedy at law, they were permitted eventually to occupy a sleep-out and a very small room which has no stove or internal lighting. When she wishes to enter or leave the portion of the dwelling which has been allocated to them, the wife, who is not long out of hospital, has to clamber through a window. That is the unfortunate position of these people who, after years of saving, managed to acquire sufficient capital to purchase a home of their own. I trust that the",43,Coppee Production Cloncurry Mineral Field
267,Mr Mcewen (Lndi) [10.17],"IAttorney-General (Dr. Evatt) will direct his attention to this matter as soon as possible. during the forthcoming recess to consider these regulations. It will be attended by representatives of all interests concerned. drought is widespread. The present which I wish to direct the attention of honourable members to-night is the serious drought which is affecting the whole south-eastern area of the continent, with the exception of the coastal belt. I speak of this matter with some knowledge, as I live within the affected area, and I assure the Government that the drought conditions now prevailing are unprecedented at this time of the year. Australia has experienced several severe droughts. Probably the most outstanding of these occurred in 1902 and 1914 when great national loss was suffered, and many thousands of farmers were ruined. To-day, the recorded rainfall over the whole of the wheat area of Victoria, and, I think, the central and southern wheat belts of New South Wales and adjoining areas of South Australia, is the lowest on record for this time of the year. RecentlyI travelled from Albury to the South Australian border by car and it was almost impossible to find a paddock coloured green by a crop-this , in what should be one of the flush months of Spring! One can travel for hundreds of miles through this normally fertile region without seeing green grass, crops, or even haystacks, because this is the culmination of a succession of very dry years. I believe that it is not an exaggeration to say that there will be vast areas from which practically every head of live-stock will have to be removed unless horses, cattle and sheep are to be allowed to die on the properties. No matter what helping hand the Government might hold out, this"" would represent tragedy in the lives of many thousands of good Australians. Certainly it would represent a tremendous national loss. I ask the Government, in view of what is not merely a local disaster, but a really national disaster of great magnitude, to consider making available a substantial sum of money for drought relief. It may be argued that the making of grants for this purpose is the responsibility of the States. That argument would carry some weight if the drought were confined to the borders of a particular State, but there is ample precedent for action by the Commonwealth when drought covers a very extensive area and unless some extraordinary and rapid change of weather occurs conditions can only become worse and worse. Normally, farmers in this drought area do not look forward to a break in the season until April, May, or even June of the succeeding year. It can be seen therefore that a long period of drought may have_to be faced. I understand that a Premiers conference will be held in Canberra next week. I suggest that before that meeting takes place, the Government should consider the desirability of making available a substantial sum of money for drought relief, and so be in a position to discuss with the State Premiers the possibility of employing State instrumentalities to determine who shall be entitled to relief, and who shall make the actual distribution. In addition to a straight-out grant for drought relief, the Government might reasonably take into account the higher value of wheat to-day. Eroni a strictly business point of view, the Government would be justified in making a further distribution on account of the wheat now held in various pools which have. not been wound up. A further advance on account of such wheat would be a tremendous help to wheat-growers. Obviously, drought relief in the form of a bounty on the wheat produced this year would be of little use. A reasonable form of relief might be a grant to tide wheat-growers over this period and enable them to sow next year's crop. Many thousands of those who are involved in this disaster are farmers who, in the past, have harvested substantial crops for which they were paid low prices, and who still have some equity in the various pools from which they hope to obtain further dividends. I shall not discuss to-day's values of wheat, except to say that, wheat is being sold for export at a price at least three times as high as it was at the outbreak of war. In the circumstances,",44,Coppee Production Cloncurry Mineral Field
268,Dr. Evatt,A conference will be held,45,Coppee Production Cloncurry Mineral Field
269,Mr Mcewen,"The main matter to it is not unreasonable to ask tbe Government to have regard to the higher value of wheat in the various pools, and on that basis to make a further advance to wheat-growers. A matter which is causing concern to many individuals and organizations, such as municipal councils and subbranches of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, is the acquisition of land, principally rich agricultural land, by persons of alien birth. There are in existence which, on occasions, have been reviewed by the Attorney-General-sometime s on my representations-whic h control the acquisition of land by aliens. Those regulations do not entirely deny to aliens the right to acquire land, and they certainly place no limit whatever, other than Treasury conditions, on the purchase of land by people who are in the category of friendly aliens. Frequently, permits to purchase land arc issued to naturalized British subjects, who were formerly nationals of nations which are now our enemies. this stage, argue that any country which claims to be free should deny to persons who become naturalized subjects the right to buy land, but I do contend that the persons who have a prior claim to the rich agricultural land of Australia are the men who, to-day, are in uniform, fighting for this country. In my opinion, it is an intolerable state of affairs that any man now with the forces who hopes on his return to Australia to take up land in his own district, should find, should he be lucky enough to return, that some Italian or other foreignborn person, however worthy, is the owner of the land which he hoped to acquire. The acquisition of land by aliens is going on to such a degree that I am receiving an increasing number of protests from persons within my own electorate. Generally, the regulations which control the acquisition of land by aliens, or which prevent such acquisition, are sound, and I have not much to say on that subject. There are, however, certain localities where there already exists a substantial aggregation of persons of alien birth. In my own district, Shepparton and Myrtleford are examples. settled in the Shepparton district? Italians and Albanians. Shepparton is becoming the focal point for Albanian immigrants. Of 86 Albanians who came to Australia in one year, 82 gravitated to Shepparton. That fact is evidence that these people tend to form themselves into communities. Many of them are good citizens; some of them have fought comprehensive regulations in pur Army; but nothing will convince me, or the parents of the men who are fighting, that these aliens, however worthy as citizens, should be permitted to become tbe owners of rich land in districts from which our own young men have gone to fight. I suggest that certain localities where aggregations of aliens exist should be declared "" closed "" areas, in which no person of alien birth, whether naturalized or unnaturalized, should be permitted to become the owner of freehold land or to acquire additional land, until the expiration of a prescribed I shall not, at period after the cessation of hostilities. Worthy naturalized citizens who wish to own land in Australia may seek it in the wide opeu spaces. I hope that the Government will heed my suggestion, and also that it will do something for the sufferers'from drought conditions. Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation) [10.35]; -Recently, a statement appeared in the press which indicated that members of the Royal Australian Air Force who were on loan to the Royal Air Force and were serving in the India and Burma theatres were not given proper consideration. In the Melbourne Age, of the 23rd September, under the heading ""Forgotten on. Burma front-Australian s with R.A.F."", a critical article appeared. This is apt to give a very distorted picture of the conditions under which Australian air crew personnel are serving in India and Burma, unless the full facts are given and understood. In the first place, it should 'be clearly stated that those members are serving on attachment with the Royal Air Force under the Empire Air",45,Coppee Production Cloncurry Mineral Field

272,Mr Drakeford (Maribyrnong,"Training Scheme Agreement, in exactly the same manner as those serving in the United Kingdom, the Middle East and elsewhere. The same conditions apply also to members of the forces of the other dominions similarly attached to the Royal Air Eorce. The general conditions of service are laid down in an agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Governments of the Dominions, and are known to all Australian air crew personnel, wherever they may be serving with the Royal Air Force. Honourable members may recall that, in June, 1943, I made a very comprehensive statement in this House in explanation of the policy and administrative principles that had been approved for adoption in relation to the granting of commissions and promotions of Royal Australian Air Force air crew personnel. These principles have since been implicitly followed, irrespective of the location of the personnel concerned. That statement also was published in the Royal Australian Air Force official journal Wings in order to ensure that personnel serving in all theatres would be made aware of the policies governing commissions and promotions. The time promotion system for both officers and airmen applies in exactly the same way in India as in other theatres of war in which the Royal Australian Air Force is serving. The commissioning policy is the same; that is, .there is no limit to the number of commissions that can. be granted to personnel on operations, and every member, if not recommended, has the right to make application for a commission. To superintend the application of this policy insofar as personnel in India and Burma are concerned, a Royal Australian Air Force liaison office has been established at New Delhi, and is directly responsible to the Air Officer Commanding, Overseas Head-quarters, London. I admit that New Delhi is a long way from London. They come under the jurisdiction of that officer, because they are serving under the Empire Air Training Scheme Agreement, .and are overseas. It is known that the liaison officer and his staff in India have not spared themselves in safeguarding the rights of Australian air crew in that Mr Drakeford. command. The liaison officer has frequently visited all units in which they are serving. He is aware of each member entering the command, of the member's seniority, and the full details of his service, including the time at which he may become eligible for promotion under the time promotion schemes. I do not merely accept an assurance. When complaints have been made from time to time, steps have been taken to have them brought under notice with a view to having the matter checked, so as to ensure that the men shall not be overlooked. The liaison officer is responsible for the transmission of recommendations for commissions or promotions to Royal Australian Air Force Overseas Head-quarters, London. It is known that he has been doing that work in a very systematic manner, and in strict accord with the approved policies. The statement has been made at times that the percentages of commissions granted are higher in Australia than overseas. My earlier statements on this matter apparently need reiteration. The percentages of personnel holding commissioned rank, in comparison with the total numbers of personnel serving in the various theatres of war, are 11 per cent, over the Royal Australian Air Force as a whole, both here and overseas, 9 per cent, of the personnel serving in the South-West Pacific Area, and 27 per cent, of the personnel serving overseas. Honourable members will agree that 27 per cent, is a high proportion. When I mentioned the matter on an earlier occasion, the number of members of the Royal Australian Air Force in Australia holding commissions was one in twelve, and in Great Britain, where the.fighting was mainly being done at,the time, it was one in five. Over all, it was one in ten. Those figures have been improved considerably by air crew members having become commissioned; now, the proportion of the men serving overseas who hold commissions is better than one in four. per cent, of the men in England are in air crews and, under, this scheme, are entitled to commissions. scheme, 33 per cent, is entitled to be commissioned on graduation, and additional men to subsequent promotion.",46,Coppee Production Cloncurry Mineral Field

274,Mr Drakeford,"Under theI want to remove the impression that the percentage of our men holding commissions is lower than the percentage in other air forces. It is very high. I say emphatically, after inquiry, that the percentage of commissions is higher in the Royal Australian Air Force than in any other Australian fighting service. of the proportions holding commissions in each of the overseas areas, namely, the United Kingdom, France, Middle East, India and Burma, are not readily available; but the figures I have cited will demonstrate that a comparatively high rate obtains in relation to members of the Royal Australian Air Force serving overseas. Australian air crew personnel in the Indian and Burma theatres are by no means forgotten or overlooked, as the press article alleged. Everything possible is being done to further their interests, and to ensure they shall be administered in accord with the general policies. PerJuly, and five in August, apart from sonnel in India and Burma admittedly are sorving under different conditions. I assure honourable members that the basic policies concerning the granting of commissions, promotions, repatriation, and other matters are being applied. The press article also referred to poor appeared in Wings and have been availmail facilities and lack of comforts. Certain delays are inevitable in regard to mail and parcel services, because of the irregularity of shipping between Australia and India. The sevenpenny air-letter service established recently is to know that some time ago approval was now available for the transmission of letters from Australia to Australian airmen in Burma and India. These new arrangements, with the existing airgraph service which has operated for a long time, and the ordinary surface mail facilities and cablegrams, should prove most satisfactory. (No effort is being spared to ensure the implementation of the best mail arrangements possible in all the circumstances. I stress that the Australian Comforts Fund is fulfilling a very important funccircumstances associated with the refertion, by including the Royal Australian Air Force personnel in India and Burma in its distributions of comforts.. This is in accordance with its general policy. A further very pleasing recent development is that the Australian Comforts Fund and the New Zealand Patriotic Fund authorities have provided the Australian Society at Calcutta with the necessary finances to establish and maintain a hostel at Calcutta for Australian and New Zealand personnel on leave, that institution being regarded by the Australian High ComI regret that details missioner in India as a very important amenity for the benefit of our airmen serving in that theatre. I understand that action is being taken to establish that hostel, which I feel sure will be very greatly appreciated by our men. With regard to the publicity aspects to which the article drew attention, it is agreed that,in the initial stages of service in India by our airmen, little publicity concerning them reached Australia. A considerable change has since taken place. This may be gauged by the fact that the press releases concerning them numbered four in April, six in May, thirteen in June, five in the several broadcasts, based on the work of the Royal Australian Air Force in that theatre. Several articles concerning India and Burma by authors in the force have also appeared in Wings. Several page articles, which I have read, have able to the men in India, proving that those men are not being overlooked or forgotten. Honourable members will be interested given to three press relations personnel being sent to India. These will provide first-hand information on the work of the Royal Australian Air Force in that area for war correspondents on the spot, and will maintain a steady stream of information to Australia for submission to the press in this country. That organization will also be used as an additional medium for the dissemination of current news from Australia. I have made full inquiries as to the ence in the latter part of the press article to the non-acceptance by the official publication, Wings, of a special article written on the Burma front by a well-known Australian journalist, who prepared it at the special request of the then editor of Wings. The journalist, on his return to Australia, offered to submit the article, but the new editor of the magazine, not knowing of the arrangement that had been made, did not accept it for publication. I admit that an error of judgment occurred. I regret that such action was taken, and. conveyed an expression of my regret to the journalist, informing him that, if he would now furnish the article, I would arrange for its publication in Wings. There the matter stands at present. draw the attention of the Government to the very serious position of the farmers in the northern and north-eastern parts of Victoria and in the western Riverina. I support the honourable member for that the people in those parts of the Commonwealth are confronted with colossal disaster from the agricultural point of view. I visited the area west of Ihe Loddon River last week, and the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) intends to go there on Saturday week. I hope that ne will take careful note of the conditions prevailing in that area and will report on them to the Government. I regret that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) is not in the chamber to-night, because I believe that the granting of the necessary relief to those people is beyond the capacity of the Government of Victoria. I hope that the Commonwealth Government will recognize the tremendous loss with which this country is threatened owing to the drought conditions prevailing. Many of the settlers will be forced off their holdings. Throughout the fertile area from Ultima to 'Charlton and through to Ouyen, not a crop will return sufficient wheat for seed purposes this year unless abnormal rains are experienced immediately. In many places the crops cannot recover under any conditions. Unless extraordinary rains are experienced, there will not be a living beast throughout those areas by January, except where irrigation has been provided. One can travel over many square growing areas have an interest in the miles of country without seeing a dam wheat pools, and Nos. 5, 6, and 7pools with water in it. The farmers there should be finalized. 'The Government have been encouraged by the Government to grow wheat, and a period of eighteen months is occupied in the production of a crop. I trust that the Government will take into consideration the representations of the wheat-growers' organizations that those who fallowed land and prepared it for wheat should receive recompense on an acreage basis. Those who have been encouraged by the Government's promise of a bushel subsidy on oats, to plant additional acreages, should also receive some recompense. If the Government does not do something to relieve them, that great fertile area will be practically deserted by the settlers who have struggled there for generations. honourable member refer? the Loddon, and west of Balranald in the Riverina. Areas in the western Riverina which carried over 500,000 sheep are to-day carrying approximately 100,000 sheep. Many farmers who have lived there practically the whole of their lives say that there will not be 20,000 sheep left by Christmas unless exceptional rainfalls occur. These people are not in that position owing only to the fact that no fodder is growing for their stock, but also because chaff and oats are unavailable. Even in the northern areas of Victoria chaff is rationed. People who are asked to produce butter-fat can obtain a certain quantity of concentrates, but it is essential that they should get chaff. The Minister for Agriculture in Victoria, Mr Martin, has done his utmost to meet the difficulties of the people, but when they go to town on market day, even though they have herds of 50, 60 or 70 cows, they can get only three or four bags of chaff. The production of butter-£at will be reduced tremendously owing to that fact, and the position is one that only the Commonwealth Government can relieve. It could obtain fodder from Tasmania and New Zealand. If the Government desires production to be maintained, it should deal with this serious situation immediately.

Particular mention should be made of those journalists associated with the Department of Information in the publication of Action. It is a splendid job. In the The Minister for Air( Mr Drakeford) referred to a newspaper article in which it was stated that airmen on the India and Burma fronts had been overlooked in the matter of promotion. I have not seen the article, but I point out that the position could be helped if the Australian liaison officer at Delhi were to inform commanding officers of the promotion procedure. In the Royal Australian Air Force, it is necessary for the commandmotion before he is promoted. The procedure is different from that in Great Britain and other dominions where some steps are on a time basis, and many English commanding officers do not know our system. The fact that 27 per cent, of our men overseas have commissions is not extraordinary. Under the terms of the Empire air training scheme, up the men themselves should be informed motion in due course they should apply for it.

This project has been submitted by the State authorities to the Co-ordinator-General of Public Works, with a request that a survey be undertaken with a view to permission being sought to proceed with the construction of the road as soon as conditions (i.e. availability of man-power andl materials) permit. 2.

295,Mr Dedman,"The answers to the""WHEAT INDUSTRY. upon notice1. What have been the losses of wheat by fire, storm, tempest and flood since the Wheat Boa.vd cancelled its insurance policy, and to what extent have premiums or other moneys been put aside to meet these losses? 2. What has been the extent of loss by fire to stock, plant and machinery in the ownership or under the control of the Government, for which no insurance provision has been made in the ordinary commercial way? 3. Are these losses a charge against the growers or the consumers, or w ill they be met out of revenue? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The estimated losses in respect of wheat for -the period from 22nd December, 1942, to 30th June, 1944, including claims which have not yet been finalized, total £158,200. These losses were abnormal, the sum of £124,500 being involved in respect of damage due to severe storms in Western Australia on five days in February, 1943. The claims on insurance companies in respect of wheat losses for tlie three preceding years averaged less than £17,000 per annum. The approximate premium income in respect of wheat for the same period was £96,600. 2. The Commonwealth acts as its own insurer in respect of ordinary Commonwealth permanently owned property, such as departmental buildings, equipment, stocks, &c. No policies are issued in these cases, and losses are not specially recorded, nor are premiums charged. The actual losses on this property would, however, be negligible in relation to the annual premium value of tlie property calculated at ordinary commercial rates. Losses to the extent of approximately £76,850 (mostly bush-fire losses) were incurred in respect of other commodities, which like wheat, are covered by an internal Commonwealth insurance arrangement. 3. The losses in respect of the commodities referred to in 1 and 2 are financed by premiums charged to the various controlling authorities, e.g. the Wheat Board, at ordinary premium rates based on the experience of insurance companies over a period of years. On this experience it is not anticipated that there will be any final deficiency which would have to be met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund in respect of these transactions. ter for Commerce and Agriculture, upon notice1. A t what price was the last sale of wheat to the United Kingdom made? 2. What quantity was involved? 3. What is the latest offer by the United Kingdom for 5,000,000 bushels or more? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. For destinations west of Suez-4s . 10.7d. A.C. for ibagged wheat, 4s. 5.Id. for bulk wheat. For destinations east of Suez5s. 4.5d. A.C. for bagged wheat, 4s. 10.9d. for bulk wheat. 2. 500,000 tons. 3. Negotiations are now in progress, but it is not the practice to disclose details which are under discussion. upon notice1. Has the Commonwealth Government power to acquire wheat in the post-war years to f ill Australia's quota for international relief in terms of the International Wheat Agreement? 2. Can the Commonwealth Government acquire wheat to meet Australia's quota under the same agreement for export, thus precluding the States or an individual or groups of citizens from exporting wheat? honourable member's questions is as follows:1 and 2. I have referred the matter to the legal officers of the departments concerned. The question is a complicated one and an opinion will be made available as soon as possible. HIGH COURT. Attorney-'General, upon notice1. When did the High Court last meet in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Alice Springs? 2. Is the High Court deficient in the number of justices necessary to enable it to administer justice in all States at reasonable times? 3. If so, does the Government propose to take remedial measures? honourable member's questions are as follows:I . The High Court last met in Brisbane this year, in Adelaidei n 1942, in Western Australia in 1937, in Tasmaniai n 1939. As to Darwin and Alice Springs, I point out that the law makes no provision for the court sitting at any place other than that at which a registry has been established. As a registry has not been established at either of those places, the court has not sat at either place. The recent sittings of the Full Court of the High Court at Adelaide was cancelled by the justices, but the court sat in original jurisdiction. There were five cases down for trial before the Ful l Court. I understand that the sittings were cancelled by a majority of the justices, partly by reason of difficulties of transport and partly by reason of the small number of cases.",52,Cameron Asked The 2 Council For Scientific And Industrial Re

303,Dr. Evatt,"The answers to the2 and 3. As to the question whether the court is deficient in the number of justices, I point out that tbe Honourable Sir Owen Dixon has now left Washington to resume his seat on the High Court bench. However, the question whether additional justices are required is a matter of general governmental policy and will be kept in view. the honoraible member for Balaclava ( Mr. White) asked me for informatio n regarding the functions of the A r m y Research Council and also its personnel, w it h rank and service in each case.

As the paper to print these novels comes from the newsprint pool, and many thousands of these novels are printed at a cheap rate, will he take steps to prevent exploitation of the Australian writer, by fixing the remuneration to the author as well as the profit to the' publisher? 3. Will he also consider the question of expired copyright, whereby these 'publishers raprint novels on which copyright baa been lost by effluxion of time, and on which no payment is made, thus depriving local writers of an opportunity to sell their material and frustrating the efforts to develop Australian writing? 4.

308,Writers. Mr Chifley,"The answers to thetransition year will have the, effect of substantially reducing the liability, and that it was desired that be would submit copies of his agreements with Lysoghts with regard to the assignment of the patent rights. The Commissioner subsequently advised Mr Owen, after examining tbe agreements, that his liability to tax. in respect of the royalties was not affected by the agreements. 3. Tlie Treasurer is not in a position to answer this question. 4. There has been no inordinate delay in dealing with the question of the taxation liability or his request to waive the tax claimed in consideration for handing over the patent rights. Mr Owen's return for the year ended 30th June, 1944, was only forwarded to the department on Sth September, since when the basis of the appropriate assessment has been receiving the Commissioner's consideration. I understand that arrangements have been made by Mr Owen's representative to discuss the figures with the Commissioner personally. 5. The Commissioner of Taxation has never issued any threat of bankruptcy to Mr Owen, nor could any such threat be issued prior to the determination af the actual liability. In the meantime, all that can be said is that Mr Owen's representations both to tbe Commissioner of Taxation and to the Commonwealth Government with regard to the transfer of tbe patent rights will receive due consideration. notice1.

If it is part of the national debt, will taxation collections 'be used to pay interest on such part of the debt, and to whom or what institution will such interest be paid? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. and 2. Central bank credit has been made available by the Commonwealth Bank against treasury-bills to finance the amount by which war expenditure has exceeded the available revenue and .public loon raisings of the Government. The amount of treasury-bills discounted by tbe bank for war .purposes since this Government took office and at present current is £342,780,000. 8. No.. 4. See answer to 3. 6. Treasury-bills form part of tbe national debt. 6. The answer to this is broadly ""Yes"", although, since the departments of the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Savings Bank are the principal holders of treasury-bills, part of the interest is returned to the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to this extent taxation is not needed to pay the interest. A small part of the interest is paid to other holders of treasury-bills, such as trading banks and State savings banks.",54,Reseabgh Council Which Copyright Has Expired The Money To Go
