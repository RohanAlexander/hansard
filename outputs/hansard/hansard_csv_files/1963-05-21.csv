In view of his statement at Casino yesterday, after his aerial inspection of flooding in the north coast area of New South Wales, to the effect that something must be done to preventflooding,1 ask: Has the Prime Minister noted and considered the representations and suggestions of the honourable members for Cowper, Mitchell afnd Macquarie on directed to you, Mr Speaker.

[58] formed myself not only of the remarks made by the honourable members referred to but also of the remarks made by people such as the honourable member for Richmond in the course of discussion of this subject. This is not a matter that can be decided out of hand. The Leader of the Opposition well knows that there is a long established practice that in the event of disasters of this kind we meet with the State governments, on a £1 for £1 basis, the cost of relieving cases of individual hardship and distress. Every now and then problems arise which go beyond that mark and we have always been willing to discuss them with the State governments. In the course of my visit yesterday, I found that local authorities were very grievously and too frequently affected by declare Australia's these floods. They have put their heads damage and, in some suitable cases, for trying to prevent it. They have put up a reasoned case to the New South Wales Government. The Government of that State, as everybody concedes, is the Government primarily responsible for works of this kind within its borders. I said in Casino yesterday, after making these two points, that if my long experience counted for anything I would not be wrong in expecting that when the State Government had had a look at the proposals we would hear something about them. At this stage I do not say what can be done or what will be done; all I want to do is to exhibit a very lively interest in thesefloodsand to say that it is intolerable that every year or two in these areas there should be disasters of this kind. The solution of these problems will require a great deal of co-operation and, if I may say so, aon-political examination. meal. I ask: Would you provide facilities",7,Setup

Why did the executive of the commission refuse this brilliant team permission to make a documentary programme on the Indonesian take-over of West New Guinea?

24,Mr Chaney,"My question is directedHas he seen a story, which appeared in the newspapers and was adopted by the Leader of the Opposition, to the effect that there is an unpublished understanding between the United States of America and Australia that provides for close and continuous consultation between Washington and Canberra about the use of facilities at the naval communication station at North West Cape in any South-East Asian crisis in which Australia and the United States may have divergent views? Is there any foundation for such a report? report in yesterday's press and I observed that the Leader of the Opposition had adopted it uncritically and certainly without inquiry. The fact is that there is no foundation for the report. However, I think it is proper that I make one or two observations in answering the question. In ordinary circumstances, I would be very loath to disclose what took place during negotiations so heavy and important as was the negotiation of this agreement with respect to the naval communication station at North West Cape. Having regard to this newspaper story and one or two other assertions made both inside and outside this House, I think I ought to make certain observations and disclose one or two things. In the first place, the United States Government did insist on sole control of this station. It made that a fundamental point of the negotiations. On the other hand, we insisted upon consultation, as is expressed under the heading "" Memorandum of Conin Article3 of the agreement. The American Government was not unwilling to afford us consultation within the full width of Article 3, but it was very concerned that Article3 should not be used as a means of seeking or obtaining control of the station. In the course of the discussions between myself, those negotiating with me from Washington and the American Ambassador, I put forward the meaning of the words of Article3 which I put upon them in my second-reading speech in this House. That was the natural meaning of the words. The American Ambassador reported to Washington the views that he and I bad discussed as to the natural meaning of the words of that article. He subsequently forwarded to me, under cover of a letter, a copy of a memorandum of his conversations with me before the agreement was made, relating to the intent, meaning and effect of the proposal I was making with respect to Article 3. He gave me the text of so much of his report to Washington as affected that part of the conversations and asked me whether I would agree that it was accurate. I did agree. I propose, Mr Speaker, in order to put this matter at rest, as I would hope, to read to the House the Ambassador's letter and my reply. read, as the honourable member for East Sydney says, the whole lot. date 7th May, 1963, the American Ambassador, in a letter addressed to me, wrote as follows:I enclose a copy of my memorandum of our conversation of to-day concerning the construction of Article3 of the VLF Agreement. Whereas this construction is not intended to restrict the Government of Australia's right of consultation, it is intended to spell out clearly that consultation does not carry with it any degree of control over the station or its use. If this is in accordance with your understanding, I would appreciate your so indicating. Enclosed was a part of his own record for his own government of our conversation, versation "", dated 7th May, 1963. This was the Ambassador's noteAfter a full and complete discussion regarding consultation on use of the Station with Minister for External Affairs, it was clearly understood that consultation connoted no more than consultation and was not intended to establish Australian control over use of Station nor to imply any Government of Australia design to restrict at any time United States Goverament use of Station for defense communications including, for example, communications for polaris submarines. It is also understood that it was not intended to give Australia control over or access to the contents of messages transmitted over tha Station.

Your memorandum is entirely in accordance with my understanding. Outside of that, there are no arrangements between the United States of America and ourselves with respect to consultation under this agreement. This exchange was in the course of negotiation before the agreement was signed and it resulted from American insistence on .having sole control of this station. External Affairs whether there are any unpublished documents in his possession, having relation to this matter, which he would care to make public. Are there any other documents, or any other correspondence, or any other notes that have been exchanged which, in the light of his revelations of a few minutes ago, should be made public so that the people of Australia may have a clear picture of what has transpired between the Australian Government and the United States Government in respect of the establishment of a radio communication centre at North West Cape? somewhat of a pity that this sort of question is not asked before a lot of public announcements are made and arguments put forward. announcements so that the arguments will not start? answer the question first. On the matter that has been brought up and that we have been discussing, there are no other documents. However, it is proper for me to say that in the negotiation of an international agreement of this kind there are many matters not proper to be put in the agreement but incidental to carrying it out. They are dealt with in minutes. There are minutes that do not relate at all to the subject-matter we have been discussing, but which relate to incidental matters. I am reminded, for example, that this proposed centre may interfere with ithe telegraphic or telephonic lines controlled by my colleague, the Postmaster-General, and there are provisions for the United States Government to bear the cost of any damage caused in this way. But these are incidental matters, and they are to be found in minutes subscribed to by both to the Prime Minister. I refer, by way of parties. They do not relate to the matter that we have been discussing. addressed to the Treasurer, relates to the forthcoming introduction of decimal currency. Is the right honourable gentleman aware that the heads of the education departments of the various States are shortly to meet and confer on desirable changes in the education curriculum? Is he aware, further, that one of the matters that will probably be discussed is the desirability of or necessity for changes in the curriculum consequent upon the introduction of decimal coinage? In order to facilitate intelligent discussions by these people of such changes will the Government make a decision as early as possible on names of new coins and other matters incidental to the introduction of the decimal system? honourable member that our work in connection with this matter is being pushed forward with as much speed as possible, having regard to the very many other important and pressing matters engaging the attention of the Government. I can tell the honourable member that as recently as last week a special committee of the Cabinet dealing with this subject considered a number of problems associated with changeover, and the Cabinet itself has since had discussions arising from the talks of the committee. I am hoping that we will reach finality on some of the important outstanding questions, such as the establishment of an authority to deal with various matters related to the changeover, the names to be applied to the new currency units, the range of coinage, the weights and dimensions of the coins and so on. Some of these questions involve technical considerations which have to be discussed with relevant departments, such as the Postmaster-General's Department. I can assure the honourable member that I am just as anxious as I gather he is to see that any uncertainty surrounding the changeover to decimal currency is removed as soon as it is practicable to do so.",13,United States Naval Communication Station

Is the Prime Minister aware that legislation involving this money has now been passed by the Tasmanian Government for the purpose of granting a subsidy to the company controlling the King Island scheelite mine, to assist it to carry on its operations and thus provide employment, directly or indirectly, for some 400 people at Grassy on King Island?

I will be better informed on the matter when I have had a detailed discussion with my colleague, the Minister for Trade, who, as the honourable member knows, bas been to the United States. As to the early part of the question, I was very happy to find that the requests of the Tasmanian Government, put through me to the Government of New Zealand, were, to the extent he has described, successful. I know that Mr Reece was happy .with fhe result and I , personally, am delighted to see the direction in which the money is being used. to the Minister for Supply. Will he tell the House whether all Commonwealth cars are to be fitted with safety belts, resulting in their passenger capacity being reduced to a maximum of three to a car? If this is true, wil) it mean that passengers, by compulsion, will have to use the safety belts? Will such a ruling also mean that the fleet of Comto meet these changed circumstances? senger-carrying vehicles in the Department of Supply's fleet are progressively being fitted with safety belts. However, the average passenger-carrying capacity of these cars wil] not be affected thereby, and, consequently, there will be no need to increase the fleet. It has not been found practicable to make the use of safety belts compulsory, but I hope that as evidence continues to mount of the advantages of the use of safety belts in the prevention of injuries and fatalities, passengers will voluntarily use the equipment.

Is it a fact that the Government of Indonesia adopted a regulation in 1960 regarding the development, refining and distribution of oil in Indonesia?

Have they undertaken to act as agents for the Indonesian Government and hand back 60 per cent, of their profits to that government? If so, will he undertake to study the regulation and the agreement to see whether a similar agreement can be negotiated with the overseas oil companies operating in Australia? to have a look at the matter raised by the honourable member. to the Prime Minister.

Why has this election promise not been fulfilled? man should know that on several occasions during the last few years this Government has acted in concert with the Queensland Government to reduce the incidence of unemployment in that State between December and April. During this year special grants were made to the Queensland Government for that purpose. I have pointed out to the House on other occasions that seasonal workers receive rates of pay substantially in excess of normal rates to compensate for the periods when they are not seasonally employed. I think that is ""the answer to the first part of the honourable gentleman's question. My department co-operates closely with the Queensland ""Department of Labour and offers all the help that it can to reduce unemployment during the period that I have mentioned. My department will continue to do so. As to that part of the honourable gentleman's question relating to young people leaving school, he should know that his statement is not in accordance with fact. This year we have not had a great deal of difficulty in placing young people in employment in any State. In fact, the record is a good one, and I hope soon to be able to announce the figures. When I do so I am sure the honourable gentleman will be delighted because he will learn how quickly these young people have been placed in employment. question to the Treasurer by stating that I think it is generally agreed that the consumption of wheat and wheat products in Australia is a good background to the sale of our wheat crop. Has the Treasurer received representations from Australian biscuit manufacturers urging that the 12+ per cent, sales tax on biscuits be removed, because biscuits are such an important part of our food? Is it not a fact that during lengthy holiday periods when bread is not readily available the tendency to use biscuits becomes stronger? If the Treasurer has been informed of this position, has he given any consideration to removing, either wholly or in part, the present sales tax on biscuits? representations for the removal of the sales tax on biscuits and on a great many other items. The representations for the removal or reduction of taxes go well beyond the field of taxation, as he will readily appreciate. As an experienced member of this House and previously of a State parliament, he knows that one of the problems of government is to secure the necessary revenue for the purposes of government from the sources which the public is willing to approve. Amongst the welter of suggestions that I receive for the removal of sales tax and other forms of taxation I would welcome sometimes a few suggestions as to other directions in which revenue could be obtained. If these suggestions were forthcoming perhaps I would be able to meet more readily some of the requests which are put to me. I can assure the honourable gentleman, and others who have made similar representations to me, that their requests will be considered when the Budget is being discussed by Cabinet. i the Prime Minister. In the last few weeks there has been a disquieting number of announcements by personages in high places, including lately the Minister for Labour and .National Service, trying to inhibit public servants from taking part in industrial or political activity. Will he give the House an assurance that there will be no interference whatsoever with the rights of public servants to act as the rest of the community acts in their civil, industrial, or political capacities? has been any interference, as far as we are concerned.

This whole project, it is fair to contend, was conceived in servile subservience, confined in sordid secrecy and born in sardonic servitude. The Government's handling of this controversial issue has been characterized by blatant contempt for both the Australian people and those who represent them in this Parliament. Tenders were called for the construction of this military installation and work actually commenced before any legal agreement had been signed. These things were done before there was any democratic opportunity for this Parliament to discuss the proposal. This contemptuous attitude is unworthy of a government that was elected with fewer votes tban the Opposition received and with precisely the same number of seats as the Opposition has in this House. At long last, well after the horse has bolted, the Government has been forced by public opinion and the tenacity of the Opposition to bring this agreement to the Parliament for ratification. To some extent at least the connivings of this Government are now about to get an airing. The first rumours and rumblings in conyears ago.

They were not able to disclose anything about the Government's intentions in connection with this base. It has been left to the Australian Labour Party to stimulate a public conscience and awareness about this matter. Not one branch or forum of the Liberal Party did anything but completely accept this package deal. The Australian Country Party was obviously completely ignored. There has been no regard by the Government parties for Australia's interests in this involves the denial of the Commonwealth matter. No inquiry has been made as to who should give the order through this station for the firing of Polaris missiles. There has been no regard to the extent of the military build-up that might take place in these 28 square miles of Australian soil, which may come to be known in the future as the Little America. How many troops will be stationed there in times of peace? No safeguard has been provided in respect of this matter. It appears that honourable members opposite just do not care. They have no desire to placate the intense anxiety of many Australians and certainly the anxiety of many of our Asian neighbours. This grim and foreboding business heralds a' new era for Australia. We are now to be projected into the nerve centre of the cold war. We are to be projected into an irretrievable alinement for better or worse, but heaven knows for what. No one has any idea of what the future holds. We are to be projected into an involvement with mobile nuclear bases in the form of skulking submarines with their Polaris projectiles. We are to be elated that another nation will have open season to do whatever it wishes from our soil without Australia having any effective say in the matter. proudly seek are fundamental to the preserOur gratification in all this is that on occasions the Australian flag is to be unfurled when the American flag is so presented. This is poor consolation for the Australian people. While many would concede the grim into an Australian tradition by the sacrinecessity for this communications station, fices of Australia's sons in war and peace. only the Prime Minister( Sir Robert If the Government has been unable to Menzies) would say, as he did on the sense this feeling which prevails around the seventh of this month, "" I am delighted that countryside, it should take the first opporthe station is being established "". Let me tunity to test the people's reaction by a tell the right honourable gentleman that there referendum or preferably by a general elecis no cause to be delighted that this base tion. The Prime Minister last month has become necessary in his view through the aggravation of world tension. A new threat has come to humanity and Australia may get a cold or even a hostile reception from its Asian neighbours, with possible subsequent adverse effects on our trade and our living standards. These are matters not for elation or delight but for disappointment and despair. This bill proposes a lot more that just a communications stationa lot more than a mere addition to Australia's defence. It Prime Minister's declaration regarding the containment of the nuclear club, because implicit in this bill is a sub-letting effect of nuclear weapons. This bill involves the abandonment to another country of Australian soil for the first time in the 193 years since Cook arrived. It involves a very severe handicap to efforts to obtain a nuclear-free zone, which, after all, is the status quo. We have had such a zone for the last twenty years or so since the first bomb was dropped at Hiroshima. It involves the inevitability of Australia being a target for attack by nuclear or conventional weapons in any future war. It involves Australia's alinement in the cold war. It involves our inseparable association for 25 years with the foreign policy of another country, whether such policy is right or wrong. More importantly, it involves the denial of the birth right of present and future Australians to decide whether they are to be involved in any war. We of the great Australian Labour Party make no apology for seeking assurances regarding the manner in which this base may be used. The six qualifications we vation of Australian nationhood. We seek the right to make our own decisions as to whether we are to be at war with any power, and we shall never willingly relinquish that right. It has been forged demonstrated his attitude, which is in contrast to that of the Australian Labour Party, when he spoke at the State Women's Council of the Queensland Liberal Party. He attacked the Opposition and claimed that Labour jeered at the need for great and powerful friends. He said that Labour believed the best way to deal with them was to kick them instead of bowing the knee. Of course, his allegation is completely false, but his advocacy of bowing the knee is an indication of how much he is out of step with Australian dignity and national pride. Labour does not want to kick our friends and allies, and it does not want to bow the knee. We believe in close cooperation with the United States of America in respect of trade, economic affairs and many other matters of mutual interest, including defence, but we are not prepared to bow the knee to any power. Labour does not stand alone in this matter. The British Labour Party vigorously criticized the Macmillan Government for its acceptance of the Polaris base at Holy Loch. As a result it was given a much better deal than Australia is getting at present. Two years later, the view of the British Labour Party is about to be vindicated. Harold Wilson, leader of the British Labour Party, will lead his party to the poll and he is bound to sweep the Conservatives out of office. Let me tell the House what the British did achieve. I refer to the House of Commons"" Hansard"" report of the parliamentary proceedings dealing with the agreement associated with the supply of United States ballistic missiles to the United Kingdom. This agreement was signed in Washington on 22nd February, 1958. Clause7 of the agreement, which is very clear and explicit, statesThe decision to launch these missiles will be a matter for joint decision by the two Governments. That is, of the United States and Great Britain. In his speech on this matter, Mr of Australia's history that Australia should Duncan Sandys saidThe agreement provides that the missiles shall not be launched except by a joint positive decision of both Governments. Later in the same speech he said there would be special arrangements for ensuring that there would be rapid consultation about the joint decision, but he did not think the House would expect him to go into detail. Finally, Mr Duncan Sandys had this to sayThe decision will be taken in the same manner as the arrangements for taking decisions under the Attlee-Truman agreement. It will require a joint positive .decision of both GovernmentsI emphasize Governments-no t mUitary commanders. The United Kingdom Government was successful in obtaining a much better deal in connection with bases in Great Britain than this Government has even been interested in endeavouring to obtain on behalf of Australia. In Canada, the conservative Diefenbaker Government made the supreme political sacrifice in order to save that country from becoming subservient to the United States owned and operated Bomarc missiles and Voodoo jets which, as honourable members know, are equipped with nuclear weapons. The United States intervention in Canadian politics was so complete that at the first sign of non-conformity and non-co-operation on the part of the Diefenbaker Goverament, top level criticism from the United States brought about that government's Waterloo. So we of the Labour Party stand in very good company. We stand with the British Labour Party. To a considerable extent, we stand with the Macmillan Government which indicated and obtained what it wanted in connection with its agreements, and we stand with the Canadians who felt that it was their duty to obtain a measure of national recognition and retain a measure of national pride. We are told here that the people of Australia do not want safeguards. We are told that a recent gallup poll revealed that the Labour Party is pursuing an unpopular line. But the significant point is what the people were asked in connection with this gallup poll. I would suggest that the present Government should ask the Australian people a question along these lines: Would you agree for the first time in the 193 years relinquish to a foreign power in times of peace a part of Australia for military purposes without adequate safeguard? Such a relinquishment of our territory has never occurred before. We believe that this is a bad time to set such a precedent. I suggest that the people should also be asked: Would you agree to the establishment of a United States naval communication station in Australia in circumstances under which Australia would be denied any say in the control and operation of that station? What does this proposal involve, when all is said and done? It means that if this base were built orders could be given from Australia to wage a war with nuclear or conventional weapons against any country and that Australia need not be consulted. When we think of recent contemporary issues this could apply to the involvement of the United States in Laos, Viet-Nam, Tibet, the Indian border dispute or Cuba, because all these places were danger spots, and there could be many others in the future. For instance, the United States could become involved in disputes arising in connection with the offshore islands of Matsu and Quemoy, near China. It could apply to the involvement of the United States in Berlin, or even in Jordan. Recently, an announcement was made that we were close to war in Jordan. Who knows what may happen in the next 25 years? The United States was not committed in any way in connection with Indonesia's claim over West Irian, and if Australia had made a stand in connection with West Irian, or even in Asia, as the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) reminds me, there is nothing to indicate that the United States would have stood by us. This naval communication station is to be established solely for purposes connected with the foreign policy of the United States and is not concerned at all with the defence of Australia. Lest there be any doubt concerning the similar *ight to other Asian nations, such inadequacy of the present agreement, I make as Indonesia with 96,000,000 people, China some brief reference to the Minister's with between 600,000,000 and 700,000,000 second-reading speech. On the point whether people, India with 436,000,000 people, the there is to be any provision for consultation Philippines with 25,000,000 people, Japan with Australia, the Minister saidI am sure it wiil be obvious that unless it were 23,000,000 people? When we go outside desired to create unilateral right of veto on the the Asian theatre and think of the southern use of the station-and it is not-join t operation hemisphere, which maru/ of us would like is in fact impracticable. Later, he saidIt is not intended to give Australia control of or people. She also would be entitled to access to the content of messages transmitted over nuclear weapons or to have a liaison with the station. He also saidThe width of the area of possible consultation people, Brazil with 15,000,000 people, the does not imply any right of control over the Congo with 14,000,000 people, and Nigeria, 6tation. So it is beyond doubt, as* the Minister southern hemisphere, with 30,000,000 certainly agtin put it beyond doubt at quespeople. Yet here we have Australia tion time to-day, that Australia will have no say whatsoever in the operation of this base. Contrast that state of affairs with the position in Great Britain, in Canada, and, I believe, in Italy at the present time. We should also ask the Australian people: Do you want Australia to be the first nation in the southern hemisphere to be associated with nuclear weapons? I well recall that, on 6th April, 1961, a conference of Commonwealth Prime Ministers made an announcement concerning the need for rapid agreement with relation to nuclear weapons. That announcement wasSuch an agreement is urgent since otherwise further countries may soon become nuclear powers, which would increase the danger of war and further complicate the problem of disarmament. So this base is in contravention of the spirit of the decision of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. It is also in contravention of the decision of the World Parliament, the Hth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, which made its position very clear. Later, the Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations circularized about 104 nations asking them to indicate the conditions under which they might be willing to enter into specific agreements to refrain from manufacturing, or otherwise acquiring, nuclear weapons. It is significant to mention now that this Government refused to co-operate with the United Nations in this connection. If we, a nation of 11,000,000 people, claim the right to be an agent for a power with nuclear weapons, how can we deny a with 94,000,000 people, or Thailand with to see made a nuclear-free zone, we think even of South Africa with 16,000,000 a great power that possesses them. We think also of the Argentine with 16,000,000 the southern part of which comes within the pioneering the way for all these countries to acquire nuclear weapons. Our ideal, our aspiration, to have the southern hemisphere declared a nuclear-free zone, does not mean leaving our country undefended; it merely seeks agreement of the nations which are parties to the Antarctic Treaty and others within the southern hemisphere to the declaration of such a nuclear-free zone. As the Reverend Alan Walker said at the Lyceum Theatre, Sydney, yesterdayAustralia could become a base from which security and peace could spread outward to a war-conditioned world. We should seek the co-operation of our neighbours in removing the threat of a nuclear war from our hemisphere. According to a recent statement by the Minister for External Affairs, no fewer than 320 atomic, nuclear and thermo-nuclear weapons have been exploded since 1954, leaving in their wake devastation, the contamination of the atmosphere, and the scourge of diseases such as lukaemia, which afflict the human race. This Government has always been intent on adopting a provocative attitude towards the nations of Asia and other parts of the world. It forthrightly supports the threatening of Castro in Cuba and interference in affairs in Malaya. Why does the Government always choose to be obtuse, and old fashioned, in those matters in connection with which it is so important that we have good relations with other countries? Wc always seem to be under the domination of our Prime Minister and the Minister for External Affairs, who are so terribly obtuse, old-fashioned and out-of-date that their actions amount almost to an insult to the 600,000,000 or 700,000,000 Chinese to whom, during the last few years, we have sold over £100,000,000 worth of wheat. We all recall the last notorious appearance of the Prime Minister at the United Nations when he succeeded in alienating Australia from all but three nations in his defence of South Africa's racial policies. Here, again, instead of supporting conciliatory overtures to our Asian neighbours and instead of working towards non-aggression pacts and disarmament in the area, this Government chooses to bristle with provocation. Because there are so many honourable we have heard so much recently. The members on this side of the House who Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell), in want to express their own indignation, and his speech on this bill, endeavoured to the indignation, probably, of millions of Australians, I should perhaps curtail my remarks. Let me say, however, on this matter, which is of vital signficance to Australia, that, not long ago, Admiral J. H. Sides, of the United States of America, who came to this country in connection with the Coral Sea Week celebrations, set out to placate us. He said that the proposed naval communications station at North West Cape would not be a top-priority target in the event of a nuclear war, and that priority would be given to bases that could deliver weapons that would do damage, not to a base that merely provided a means of communication. There can be nrdoubt, however, that, without this proposed naval communication station, nuclear war in the southern hemisphere, the western Pacific and the Indian Ocean would be most unlikely. It is important for members of this Parliament to realize that this base will be instrumental in controlling ten or twelve submarines, each equipped with no fewer than sixteen Polaris missiles, each missile having 30 or 40 times the destructive capacity of the bomb that devastated Hiroshima during the last war. We believe that this represents a great hazard to the Australian people and to the safety and security of the world, and consequently the Australian Labour Party contends that there is a dire necessity for Australia, through its Government, to have a say in any decision that may be taken regarding the operation of these submarines carrying nuclear weapons. Indeed, Sir, we re-affirm our intention to re-negotiate the agreement and to ensure for Australia an effective voice in the conduct of military establishments on Australian soil. Speaker, if ever one could describe a speech as supporting the ambitions and interests of Russia and China, that description fits the remarks just made by the honourable member for Hughes( Mr L. R. Johnson). The interesting fact is that he is the first Opposition speaker to address himself to the principles stated by the 36 people about whom",18,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963

How at the mercy of the nations to the north if extraordinary it is for members of the Ausnuclear weapons were banned in this tralian Labour Party to talk about a secret hemisphere. agreement that will keep the Australian people in ignorance! I remind the House that, in relation to the American base on Manus Island, we were told only that the Labour Party. I say very definitely that if Americans had decided to abandon the Labour were in office to-day we would not base. A year or so later, when the present have this agreement with the United States Government was in office, we found that for the establishment of the proposed base the Labour Party would not agree to the at North West Cape. There is no doubt terms that the Americans required if they about that. We hear honourable members were to remain on Manus Island. If that opposite criticizing this Government's efforts was not deceiving the people of Australia in defence. They say that we are not by a secret agreement, what is? I believe that the establishment of the proposed naval communication station at North West Cape will be a great step forward in the defence of Australia. This base will be an important factor in the global defence system of the United States of America. We, fortunately, are in a position to play our part and become a factor in that defence system. Ever since Australia has been settled by Europeans, we have looked to the British Navy to protect us. And most effectively we have been protected. alines itself with the left would be suited But now we are defenceless in the southern hemisphere and left to our own devices. Our only chance of real defence is complete alinement with the United States.

Particularly, we were rather concerned' when the Dutch had to get out of West New Guinea.

However, that sort of programme would suit the Communist element. The element that if we ruined our economy in an endeavour to do these things. In agreeing to the establishment of the proposed base at North West Cape, we are alining ourselves with the greatest power on earth. What is most power with a very sincere belief that it should endeavour to make the world a better place to live in. I suggest that the Labour least the best that we can find:",22,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
60,Mr Einfeld,This Government is not,23,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
61,Mr Barnes,"In this instance we areI conclude my remarks by stating that I support the bill. Labour Party obviously regards this measure as one of supreme importance. If there should happen to be a nuclear war in the world, there will be no protected occupations and there will be no people too sick to go into the front line. There will be no protection for the mother, let alone for her baby. Let us realize that what underlies this measure could involve all of that. The whole notion, the whole strategy of war as we have known it in the past is abandoned in this concept of the strategy of the mutual deterrent. The Labour Party is trying to make clear by constant reiteration in this debate that the issue is not whether we are for or against the base. Unfortunately, the decision on that matter has been made for us by the failure of the great powers, so-called, of this world to reach agreement on world disarmament. This unfortunate situation having been inflicted upon us, we of the Labour Party have deliberately determined that, reluctantly -indee d very reluctantly-w e must support the proposal for the base. Where we take issue with the Government, and take issue very strongly, is on the matter of who controls the base and all the strategy that flows from it. We are not by any means alone in this country or outside of it in raising this important and crucial question. Within our own community there are responsible people like Stuart Howard, writing for "" Muster"", a paper that is by no means a Labour Party paper -mor e often than not it puts the views of the Country Party-and putting the same views as we hold. Stuart Howard writesWhether by chance or design, the really basic issue in the many raised by the proposal to establish the United States communication base in Western Australia has not been presented to the Australian people. He goes on to sayThat issue is whether, under the terms of the agreement being negotiated with the United States, Australian governments are to be consulted and to share in decisions relating to the uses to which the base may be put in circumstances in which action could automatically plunge our nation into war. ask for a nuclear-free southern hemisphere, references to our obligations to a powerful ally, talk of how many millions the Americans will spend on the communications establishment and of the amount of Australian labour and materials it will absorb-al l these things are of comparatively no consequence at this point and in fact are serving mainly to keep in the background the tremendously vital question-that of Australian sovereignty. The Prime Minister has made no straight-forward statement on this aspect of the proposed agreement, but I and, I am sure, a formidable number of other Australians would not accept quietly an arrangement under which this country could be committed to war, not by our own elected government, but by remote men in Washington whose national interests in the always possible event of conflict must inevitably over-shadow ours. I am sure that in saying that Stuart Howard was speaking for a good many people in this country. His view has been echoed by responsible governments in other parts of the world-government s that claim to be on the friendliest of terms with our great ally, the United States of America. My colleague, the honourable member for Hughes( Mr L. R. Johnson), quoted from a document showing that in other countries this subject of control has been the subject of a continuing fight from 1956. Whether in relation to the installation of ballistic missile bases, whether in relation to the establishment of radar devices for the detection of nuclear weapons launched by a possible enemy, or whether in relation to the stationing of nuclearpowered submarines in harbours or ports, this battle has gone on iri every European country and is still going on to-day. The crucial issue at the moment within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization-the organization that joins together the western allies in their defence planning-is the issue of resistance to one-nation control of the destinies of all the other member nations. We in Australia will be a servile race if we do not lift our hands in protest against an action whereby we will sell out our sovereignty and become an element in what I might call a nuclear-colonial system. We will be no more than a colony again. We have degraded ourselves. We have given away our national prestige and the things that we talk about on ANZAC Day. Our men fought to keep us free and independent. These are things that are not looked upon lightly by the great United Slates of America. The Americans would Arguments over whether Australia should respect us if we stood up for our rights in this matter, just as they would respect us if we did the same in the economic sphere.",23,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
62,Mr Reynolds (Barton) [3.50],"Th eOur country has been inundated by capital over which we have little control. We will wake up one fine morning to find that we have said out Australia militarily, politically and economically. The Labour Party seeks to arouse the consciences of people who accept these things willy-nilly. Of course, we realize that, because of the resistance of Russia and China, principally, to United Nations inspection forces enforcing disarmament by on-the-spot inspections, unfortunately we have to live in a world jn which mutual deterrents are the order of the day and are the only means by which we can continue to exist. I repeat that the issue is not whether we are for the base or against the base. The issue relates to who controls it-Australi a or the United States. Our mutual destinies are involved. We must trust each other. We are invited to trust the United States. Is it too much to ask that we, as a sovereign country, be allowed to look at the messages that go through a communications base located on our own soil? It is an affront to my sense of national dignity that we should be debarred from that by a genuinely friendly country, or that we should debar ourselves. I am sure that our Government is responsible for this restriction, not the United States Government. We have opted out of giving ourselves a right of real access in order to see what is going on in the basea real right to know what is happening, not only at the point of the firing of a weapon, but in relation to the world strategy that leads up to such a situation. The Prime Minister, for his own political convenience, sees these questions just in terms of black and whit#-of extremes. He raised the dramatic point of whether, after a missile had been launched in Russia, China or somewhere else, we could get together to decide whether we ought to retaliate. Of course, such an idea is stupid. The late Mr Gaitskell put the point quite properly for the British Labour Party. The point is not what happens at that crucial moment. We of the Labour Party contend that Australia should have a fuller and more real say in the strategy, the international policy, that leads up to such a situation. We Australians want to have a say in the deployment of our naval forces and other kinds of forces. If those forces were to go into a certain area and be intimidatory agents, that could lead to a nuclear attack on us by some other country. We want to have a say in those things. We do not think it is necessary to wait until the moment that buttons are pressed. We believe it should be possible for countries such as this, engaged in friendly relations with the United States, to lay down principles guiding the action that should be taken in an emergency situation. We are not suggesting that we should wait until that momentous time to be consulted. Australia and the United States should get together and jointly decide on the action to be taken in these contingencies. That, of course, is what Britain is doing and what other Nato countries are doing. It should strike any red-blooded Australian as an affront that we opt ourselves out of any say in this matter, while Germany, an ex-enemy, and Italy, another ex-anemy, are considering joint control. We have opted ourselves aut of any participation in control by negotiating this agreement with the United States. We are selling out rights that Germany and Italy are not prepared to sell out. In the case of those countries the United States is not asking for the same degree of control as it is asking for in connection with the proposed Australian centre. Machinery should be worked out by means of which we can have an effective say in the whole strategy leading up to allied defence, as is the case in these other countries I have mentioned. countries military bases are involved, whereas what is proposed here is just a communication centre. get down to that petty level in your thinking? If you cannot realize that this centre is to be a vital element in the global nuclear strategy of the western countries it is not of much use for me to address my remarks to you. The Prime Minister, for his own political purposes of course, has played the whole thing down. He would have us believe that this communication centre is just one of those odd installations with great masts sticking up in the air. He pretends-and I give him a lot more credit for intelligence than to think that he means it-to be so naive as to believe that this will be nothing more than a remarkable message-carrying instrument with some",24,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
63,Mr Kelly,But in the case of those,25,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
64,Mr Reynolds,"Are you going torather odd and very high masts. Such a suggestion is, of course, an affront to the intelligence of the Australian electors, and I hope they will take the opportunity in the next couple of weeks of letting the Prime Minister know of the resentment they feel at having been treated in this contemptible manner. Not only has the Government been servile in establishing our foreign relationships, at first economically and now militarily, but it has now gone further and is trying to put it over the Australian people. No wonder that somebody writing in one of the evening newspapers a few days ago said: "" For goodness sake don't try to delude us. If we must have these weapons for our defence, we are prepared to face up to the situation, but don't underthe Prime Minister, for his own political estimate our courage and our capacity to do so "". The Government has shown that it is not prepared to take the people into its confidence. Other countries, in their alliances with the United States for defence purposes, have been able to reach agreement with that country on a far more satisfactory basis than we have been able to do. On 22nd February, 1958, an agreement was signed between the United States and Great Britain on the use of the Thor missiles located in Great Britain. Paragraph 7 of that agreement said: "" The decision to launch these missiles will be a matter for joint decision by the two governments."" Yet the Prime Minister ridicules our suggestion of joint control. He sneers at it. He says it is unreal, although other countries have been able to secure such arrangements. I am not going to give the House all the available evidence, although there is quite a lot of it. I will simply take the case of a country which, in the last World War, was not our ally. I refer to Italy and the proposals for locating Jupiter missiles in that country. The agreement made in that case provided that any decision on the eventual use of the missiles would have to be taken within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and subject to the approval of Italy, which would certainly not strike the first blow. Is there any reason for the Labour Party to be ashamed of demanding similar conditions from the United States as were given, by agreement, to Germany and Italy, to say nothing of our own mother country, Great Britain and, of course, other countries that I have not mentioned, such as Greece and Turkey? I have by no means exhausted the list of countries with such agreements. It seems to me, as a matter of fact, that Australia is the only country that has not been given this consideration. It is the only one that has been demeaned in this way in regard to its national prestige. The Prime Minister goes on to sneer at the Labour Party's attempts to curtail the whole wretched spread of nuclear armaments. He sneers at the Labour Party's proposal to declare, by unanimous multilateral agreement, the whole of the southern hemisphere and China a nuclear-free zone. We put this into our agreement, but again purposes, ignored it. We have asked that all the nations in the southern hemisphere, as well as those just to the north of the equator, and including China, enter into a multilateral agreement not to manufacture these weapons, not to test them and not to store them for future use. The Prime Minister sneers at this and comments: "" How unreal is this proposition. It would be no trouble for Russia to fire an inter-continental missile across the world, or to send one of its very fast bombers across the world, and so introduce a nuclear missile into the southern hemisphere. It would be no trouble for Russia's concealed submarines to do it."" All this is true, and it must be acknowledged. Our proposed agreement would have that kind of limitation. But doesn't the Prime Minister appreciate, and doesn't the Government appreciate, the virtues of our proposal? There would still be a balance of power between the United States and Russia, if the present struggle must go on, but by contracting the southern hemisphere countries out of this rat race of nuclear armaments we would, first, ensure that there would be no testing of these instruments in the southern hemisphere. That is a very important matter for all of us. Everybody knows of the great difference between nuclear armaments and conventional armaments. Conventional armaments are lethal only when they are actually fired in war, but the testing of nuclear armaments not only causes damage by polluting the atmosphere, it also sows the seeds of destruction for babies yet unborn. So if we could have the southern hemisphere declared a nuclear-free zone, as a starting point, such an arrangement would have a lot to recommend it. Secondly, the acceptance of that proposal would give a moral lead to the rest of the world and might result in efforts being made to have other areas declared nuclearfree. We have such an arrangement in the Antarctic, and we simply want to extend the area to be declared nuclear-free so that it will include other parts of the world. We want to set up machinery to ensure the success of such an agreement. Naturally we do not take all countries on trust. The Labour Party has a very real outlook on these matters. It says that such an agreement would have to be subscribed to by all the signatory countries, and that all those countries would have to submit to a United Nations on-the-spot inspection force. We would want China to be one of the signatory countries. We would not make any such agreement unless it was ratified by China. If China comes in alongside all these other countries that want such an agreement we would give a great moral lead to the northern hemisphere and to the two great powers, the United States and Soviet Russia. When the Prime Minister sneers at the Labour Party's proposal for a nuclear-free zone I hope that the people who hear him will consider the matter in the terms in which the Labour Party has made the proposal, not in terms of the misrepresentation that the Prime Minister is trying to get across to the Australian people. One of the loose terms in the agreement is in Article 3, sub-section (1), which refers to the arrangement excluding purposes other than defence communications. It provides that the communications base will not be set up for purposes other than defence communications. Well, the point is that nobody has defined defence communications. The Attorney-General( Sir Garfield Barwick) is a most eminent legal authority-mak e no mistake about thatar.d in any other kind of bill or legal document he would be looking for a definition of defence communications. I have known people to suggest that it would be for the defence of the United States of America to catch Russia or China unawares and lob an atomic missile on those countries and wipe them out. They reason, "" Get rid of them now before the ultimate day comes"". That is their notion of defence. We hear such wild talk sometimes among the more irresponsible people in our own country. I am not saying that such suggestions are characteristic of people in the United States of America, or of our own people. But, when I consider that we are taking a plunge in the dark that will commit us for 25 years ahead, I have to think of what kinds of people may take control not only in our own country but also in the United States. With all the respect in the world for our United States friends I must tell the House of an interview I saw on television in Sydney on Sunday with the so-called "" Bull"" Connor, an administrator in one of the southern States of America, and of the performance he put on. It was a display of utter irresponsibility. He is, of course, disowned by the great majority of his American fellow citizens but, nevertheless, he occupies for the time being a position of great trust. order. Is the honourable member entitled to discuss the domestic policy of the United States in regard to this bill? for Barton is in order. possible that there are many Americans who disagree with the policies of their own government. They have done so in the past and will do so in the future. WhatI am saying is that Australia, as a sovereign country, should not be required to take these things on trust and should be given the same rights as have been extended to other countries in this matter of joint consultation and decision. I am suggesting that this ought to be done. The Attorney-General( Sir Garfield Barwick), in the drafting of this bill, has for some reason or other not seen fit to define many of these critically important terms regarding what is defence. Australia cannot afford to abdicate its responsibility in these matters by leaving all these decisions to others. The abdicating of its responsibilities is no more than we expect of this Government. On the domestic front, it evades its national responsibility by saying constantly, "" This is a matter for the States "".",25,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963

67,Mr Reynolds,"I suggest that it isWhen it is reminded that there are ways and means of getting national responsibility by amendment of the Constitution, the Government, does nothing about it. If it can take the easy way out of this situation it will throw up its hands and say: ""This is too hard for us to worry about. Let the United States look after it. Give the Americans a clean bill for the next 25 years. Let us put our trust in some foreign country-eve n if it is a very friendly one at the moment-bu t for goodness sake do not saddle us with the responsibility. We do not want to have the hard sweat of protecting Australia's rights."" It may mean that we are to be involved in a war in the declaration of which we would not have any decision, but at least it relieves the tired old deterrent and its possible use in a situation Menzies Government of having to make hard decisions. My belief is that the Government has not made the kind of effort which would have earned the respect of the United States of America and which would have earned us the kind of conditions which every country except Australia has received. I , therefore, think that the Government is under justified criticism for the way in which it has handled this matter. My point is that it is not only a question of what happens when a bomb is delivered by an assumed enemy. There is discussion at this moment within Nato as to whether there is a case for a point of time in conventional warfare when the Allies, facing overwhelming forces, would be entitled to be the first ones to use nuclear weapons. If that situation is being discussed and if we are, in certain circumstances, to be the ones to unleash the nuclear deterrent, then surely Australia will be involved in a war in which there is no protection for anybody-mothers , babies, the sick, the dying and the rest.. They all will be front-line troops in a nuclear war. Yet this proposition is to be considered without Australia having the right of an effective say in determining in what very special circumstances the Allies would consider themselves entitled to make use of the nuclear deterrent. If the nuclear deterrent means anything, the difference in attitude between those two jt must be a deterrent-thi s was hinted at honourable members. by the honourable member for McPherson countries using nuclear weapons but also tion ( Mr Calwell) in regard to this bill. against them using overwhelming conventional weapons. As a matter of fact, that happened in Cuba, when the United States acted in an invidious situation. We never bargained to have any say in that act beforehand, but we were the first ones to rush in afterwards. We claimed great prestige for being the first country to support what was done at that time. I think the action in that case was worthy of support, but if this Government was just as prone to be the first into the field and demand a say in any action to be taken it would be entitled also to be in for the kudos if a successful result occurred. I have made my point on the new nuclear such as we were confronted with in Cuba, if this is the way we must keep peace and preserve our national and territorial integrity. We are assuming that there can be situations in which we-the Allies or Western countries, call them what you like -ma y conceivably be the first to launch a nuclear war against possible enemies. If that is to be, and if our communications base at Exmouth Gulf is to be part of a world communications system which is to be an agent of this process, well, shame on Australia in being a party to that and not demanding a say in the working out of such a policy and the exigencies on which the supreme commander, on behalf of us all, might launch us all into war. We are not against the base in the unfortunate circumstances with which we are confronted in the world, but we question most seriously the absence of control as befits a sovereign country. -The honourable member for Hughes( Mr L. R. Johnson) and the honourable member for Barton( Mr Reynolds) spoke for the Opposition this afternoon. I think we found their speeches both shocking and surprising. If they will forgive me, let me say that I found the former shocking rather than surprising and the second surprising rather than shocking.

69,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [4.16].,"I want to refer to three rather surprising points (hat he made. In the first place, he said that the Australian Ltbour Party objected to what the Government had done because it believed in full parliamentary control. Yet he contradicted himself a few moments later when he said he was proud to do exactly as the 36 members of the Labour Party's federal conference told him. He confessed himself to be a puppet of these 36 people. This is not parliamentary control. If this is what he believes in, then it is as well that he should never be Prime Minister, l f this is the kind of thing he believes in, then he does not believe in parliamentary control. The next thing he said was that he believed in open decisions openly arrived at. Was the notorious conference at the Hotel Kingston, which laid down his policy for him, open to' the public? Was this an open decision openly arrived at? We know that these things are done in secret. We know, which is worse, that the election of these controlling 36 is done in secret. Honourable members opposite display the greatest moral indignation when anybody endeavours to find out the principle in regard to the election of these 36 people who make up the government when Labour is in power. During the debate last Thursday we heard the honourable membei for Bowman( Mr Comber) speak of those who said anything about the way in which Labour arrived at its decision as listening at the keyholes-ope n decisions, openly arrived at! Surely the Leader of the Opposition could not have been speaking seriously. Then there is a more important matter. He said that each of these 36 people recorded, in substance, a vote in favour of the resolution to allow the base to go on, under conditions it is true, but to go on. I am not so much concerned with the conditions as I am with the matter of whether Labour felt the base should go on at all. When the Leader of the Opposition said that all 36 had voted for it in substance, he said something which was not true. It was contrary to the facts. We do not know everything that oceurrexi at this notorious Hotel Kingston conference but we do know that the initial vote was 21-15 on the Western Australian resolution, which was against the base outright. Of the 36 members, 21 voted that the base should be allowed to go on, with conditions, and fifteen voted that it should not be allowed to go on at all. Those fifteen were reiterating what had already been decided by the Labour executive which, in default of a conference, is the supreme governing body. There is no doubt about this. I have in my hand "" F a c t "" of 8th November, 1962. This paper, which is the official organ of the Australian Labour Party in Victoria, had this to sayLabour opposes nuclear bases. The Federal Executive of the Australian Labour Party has declared its opposition to the erection of nuclear missile bases in Australia. A resolution from the Western Australian branch called on Ihe Federal Executive to state the party's attitude clearly. The Federal Executive resolved unanimously that it would oppose the building of bases in Australia which could be used for the manufacture, firing or control of any nuclear missile or any vehicle capable of carrying a nuclear war-head. There is no question that the base in Western Australia comes within that definition. There is no question that the Labour executive did vote unanimously. It was only when the political consequences of this became apparent that the Labour executive falsified its own minutes-it did just that-and brought this matter to the sphere of the conference. Even under political pressure of the very highest order, of those 36 there were still fifteen who stood by the old unanimous resolution of the federal executive. These arc the faots. It is also an unfortunate fact that the original unanimous vote of the executive and the subsequent vote of the left-wing minority of the conference followed the Communist line. This vote had been engineered by the Communists. There is no question about that. There is no question that the Communist infection within the structure of the Labour Party is very heavy. This stands on the record as a matter of fact. Opposition says that it is not true. He will permit me to quote from "" The Worker"" of 4th March, 1963, an official organ of the Labour Party, which statesThere will be Communists at work in all States, but perhaps more especially in Queensland . . . Communists will seek to ensure that nothing is",28,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963

To seize control of these would be just about to in courage and resolution in dealing with seize control of the Australian Labour Party and this infection which he knows very well the Labour movement. Those are not my words. They are the words of "" The Worker"" and they are true.

I say this again because he Trades and Labour Council. Of the present Trades and Labour Council Executive of thirteen, six are Communists. He went on to speak of the extent of Communist influence. The same man states that if the Communists capture the Queensland Trades and Labour Council they will go perilously close to controlling the Labour movement. In the face of evidence of this character, does the Opposition contend that there is no Communist infection in the Labour Party? That would be pure persiflage, and Opposition members know it. Fairly recently-in 1961-the Deputy Leader of the Opposition directed attention to the extent of Communist penetration in an effort to screw the Leader of the Opposition up to the point at which he would do something about it. The Leader of the Australian Labour Party in this House knows that he has failed, not in intention but in courage, to deal with this issue. He knows this on his own conscience. I know very well that not only is the Leader of the Labour Party not a Communist but also that he is opposed to communism. he is opposed to communism.

I gather that the Leader of the Opposition would like me to do so. However, the truth just the opposite. I say that he has failed exists in his own party. He was not present in the House during the disgraceful scene which occurred a couple of weeks ago when I brought these facts into the House and the Opposition made concerted use of the Standing Orders to prevent me having my say. The following week the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) said that if I were to bring this matter into the House again he would give me the treatnow knows that what I am saying, in point of fact, is true. The Labour Party is infected with communism. Let us have a look at how this occurs. It occurs because of the way in which the controlling 36 people are elected. Of those 36 people, as I have said, when it came to the showdown fifteen took the outright Communist line of rejection of the base altogether. The voting on the original resolution was 21 to 15. Two people in addition to the fifteen took the left-wing view of the compromise resolution. The rightwing compromise resolution went through by 19 votes to 17. One more person, Mr Duggan, from Queensland, vacillated undl fairly late in the piece and was brought over only at the last moment in order to save the conference from collapse after it had been deadlocked eighteen-all between the left wing and the right wing. the debate? to do with the debate because it has to do with the real policy of the Opposition.

77,Mr Wentworth,"It has everythingQueensland, Victoria and Western Australia. Let us have a look at those States. Let us look, first, at Victoria. This is Labour-in-politics convention which was held the State wbich is most familiar to the Leader of the Opposition and the one which is for him the lost opportunity. In Victoria, the selection of Australian Labour Party candidates is done not by local councils but by a committee of 25, with two representatives only in each case from the electorates themselves. These 25 are under left-wing control. They include people to go into these matters. I have said somelike Mr Brown, one of the delegates from the Australian Railways Union, who attended a conference in Tokyo; Mr He is on the Queensland delegation; one of McNulty, who has the Stalin Silver Medal; Mr Stout, who has gone on record as saying that he always gives his second precontrolling people in Queensland. He has ference, after Labour, to the Communists; Mr Brebner, the man who helped to engineer the infamous Communist take-over at Yallourn; Mr Buder, of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, who was campaign secretary in that union for Southwell and Carmichael, who are both acknowprominent in the left wing and who was on the so-called convening committee in the early 1940's. If my memory is incorrect, I will stand corrected on this point, but I fancy that even the present Leader of the Opposition at that stage had something to say about the Communist associations of that convening committee. The 25 people also include Mr Crawford, who is an organizer for the plumbers' union, a Communist-controlled union; and Mr O'Brien, who stood on a unity ticket with Brown of the Australian Railways Union in Victoriaa collaborator with Communists. Those people have absolute control over my Victorian friends in the Opposition because they determine whether or not those members of the Opposition will be selected as candidates. So you had better please those 25 people, or you will not get your endorsement. That is probably why the Leader of the Opposition was frightened to take on the Victorian pro-Communist element in the Australian Labour Party, and why he was unwilling to have a showdown with them although so many of his friends urged him to do so and, I think, urged him with some reason. Then we look at Queensland. Little need be said about it since the last notorious after Mr Williams of the Australian Workers Union made the statement which I have quoted. That convention verified dramatically the fears that Mr Williams had of a pro-Communist take-over of the Labour Party. As a result of that convention, the so-called left wing, which has in it people like Waters and Nolan, gained control. I know that it is difficult always to have time thing in another place about Mr Waters. NowI might have a word about Mr Nolan. the six delegates from Queensland to the federal conference last March; one of the been made an honorary young Communist. I find that in the "" Railway Advocate"" of 15th March, 1959. I have in my hand a photostat copy of the relevant cutting. He had a long history of pro-Communist actiyities before he became an honorary young Communist. In 1948, he was the guest speaker at the Brisbane City Hall at a sponsored pro-Communist meeting. In 1955 he was a speaker at a Communist Party political rally in the Brisbane City HaU. In 1958 he was a delegate to the Stockholm congress for disarmament which the British Labour Party and, I thinkalthough I am not certain of this-the Australian Labour Party also outlawed as a Communist front. He was a delegate to a recent meeting of (he World Federation of Trade Unions in Budapest. You have to be fairly strong stomached to be a delegate to a meeting of that federation in Hungary. Not only did he attend that meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions which is denounced by the Labour Party as a proCommunist front, but in fact he chaired some of the sessions. Will it be said that that man is not infected with communism? Will it be said that a delegation which includes that man is not infected with communism? When you find that the delegation not only includes that man and Waters but also speaks the Communist mind, then you can draw only one conclusion. There is not the slightest doubt that the so-called peace front, although it includes a large number of. honest and decent people, is being manipulated as a Communist front.",30,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963

WhatI suggest to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is that he fails to distinguish between the rain and the umbrella. are debating an accomplished fact. The agreement to establish the naval communication base has been accepted and signed. For better or worse, this country is now committed to whatever may eventuate during the next 25 years. This quarter of a century could easily be decisive to our country, our race and our civilization. We have Clearly passed to a foreign country the right to make decisions on foreign policy and war on our behalf without either our knowledge or our consent. Only the future will prove whether this decision is wise or unwise, but it most certainly is our duty in this House to subject the agreement to the closest scrutiny on behalf of the people in whose interest we act. The Government has endeavoured to link the agreement with the ANZUS pact and has tried to show that unless it is ratified, AusWhat is our position if any of the missiles tralia would be going outside the spirit of that treaty. This, of course, is nonsense. The ANZUS pact is a treaty of defence. The three countries bound by it are committed to go to each other's aid immediately should any of them be attacked. We have no obligation whatever to assist either of the other two countries should they engage in military aggression. We are not interested in any protests that neither America nor New Zealand is likely to engage in aggression. We are not conducting guessing games; we are considering facts. Much has been made by honourable members on the Government side of what they consider to be the absolute necessity for the United States to be able to use this base instantly if it were attacked, but this aspect of the proposal is not in dispute. It must be quite evident to any one with any knowledge of the ANZUS pact that should the United States be attacked, we are already committed to give all aid, including war on whatever nation may have made fhe attack. In these circumstances, the wireless facilities pect for the innocent bystander. In those at North West Cape would be automatically at the disposal of the United States, even if the station were under our sole control instead of the sole control of the United States. What we object to is that the station Is still, in the terms of the agreement, at the sole disposal of America should it not be attacked but should it attack some one else, thereby involving Australia in a war in which we may wish to have no part. America has defence agreements and treaties with many countries other than Australia. America is quite entitled to have these agreements, and they are no concern of ours except that we could become involved in them through agreements such as that now under discussion. For instance, America has an agreement with Nationalist China binding it jointly to resist any attack by Communist China on Formosa. We have no such treaty. What is our position if America attacks red China because the Communists have attacked Formosa or any of the smaller off-shore islands in this area? Or if America becomes convinced that red China is about to attack and decides to get in the first blow and use a base on our territory to do it? When considering this matter, we must remember that there are other complications. used hit the wrong country? Would we wish to be involved in any way with landing a nuclear missile on innocent people? A missile aimed at red China from the Indian Ocean could hit India, Pakistan, Siam, Malaya or any other country in the line of fire. I do not make this statement on my own authority, but on the authority of no less a person than Major-General Benjamin Foulois, formerly head of the United States Army Air Corps. According to a statement published in Lhe Brisbane"" Telegraph "" as recently as 20th April last, this gentleman had this to say after making a tour of the west coast of America inspecting aircraft and missile basesDon't put too much faith in missiles. You never know where they are going to hit. Just how much General Foulois knows about this subject may be open to question, but it is certain that he knows more than does any honourable member in this House, and he says that they may land anywhere within their range. That is quite a proscircumstances, can any one be surprised that the Australian Labour Party is not desirous that Australia should hold the weapon while some one else pulls the trigger without her consent?",32,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963

What we want is representation either at North West Cape, or in Washington, or at both places, that will protect us against the use of this installation in any circumstance other than that of attack within the meaning of the ANZUS or Nato agreements. The answer to the question, "" Do we not trust the Americans?"", obviously is, "" Do not the Americans trust us?"" We are told that the United States insist upon having the right under the agreement to be the sole judge of whether the base shall be used or not, but that condition has not been applied to its arrangements with other nations. instance, on 22nd February, 1958, Great Britain signed a five-year agreement with the United States in connection with Thor missiles. Paragraph 7 of that agreement readsThe decision to launch these missiles will be accepted as the nation's main security. a matter for joint decision by thc two Statements like these are made because Governments. Great Britain has also an agreement in Menzies Government is doing in connection connection with the Clydeside base for with this matter. They even suspect that Polaris missiles.

Furthermore, we learned The base, then, is a priority target, in the from the report of the debate in the House opinion of this American publication. of Commons on 17th February, 1960, that Mr George Ward, Secretary of State for with nuclear weapons is Russia, it is most Air stated that the Fylingdales station, important that we have some idea of what an early warning station which cost the Russians think, and we find this state£43,000,000 sterling, of which £35,000,000 ment published in the Sydney"" Sun"" on was contributed by the United States, is 2nd April, 1963commanded and operated by the Royal Air Force.

This Government falls into grave error if it imagines that public opinion in this country is so much in support of this agreement that it will approve of any terms and conditions. I remind honourable members that a prominent Methodist Minister, who is well known in Queensland, the Rev. Alan Walker, stated at a Methodist youth rally held in the Brisbane City Hall on 5th May that thc Federal Government's decision to establish this base was a tragic blunder. Again, in the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" of 15th May, the Right ReverendM . A. McAlpine, Moderator of the General For Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in New South Wales, is reported as having made this statement in Scots Church, Sydney, on 14th MayAustralia must think in terms of its own defence and development, independent of sources formerly people are not happy about what the The Australian Government deceived the public Under that agreement, British conover the United States radio base at Learmonth, West Australia, according to the American magazine "" R e p o r t e r "" . . .

By attempting to conceal what was bound to come out some day, the Government had brought As the only nation able to attack the base Australia could be one of the first targets in a",33,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
95,Mr Gray,"The Prime Minister conThe article referred to what had been published in the authoritative American magazine called "" United States News and World Report"". It continuedThe magazine gave the first English translation striking power. For example, the Russian of excerpts of a new detailed strategic study pubsubmarines carry from two to six missiles lished by the Soviet Ministry of Defence. . . The plan was worked out by 19 high-ranking Russian officers. . . . They threatened that in the event of war crush-and the range of the missiles is not known ing blows would rain on nations with United States military bases in their territory. The Prime Minister insists tlhat the base under discussion is not a military installation. He has even stated that it is not a base at all but simply a wireless relay station. But in this instance, what the right honourable gentleman thinks, or, for that matter, what the Americans think, is not important. What is all-important is what the Russians think. If there should be a war and the Russians did decide to attack Australia what would be the likely result? Has America undertaken to defend this base in any way? Or is this to be left to us? For that matter, is there any defence? Is this simply an American outpost to be used for the moment and then to be abandoned, and us with it? In fact, this was told to a prominent and reliable Australian recently in America by an American defence expert. He gave it as his opinion that Australia could not be defended and, in any case, was expendable so far as the United States was concerned. He said that it would go to the Asians after the war. I am not prepared, of course, to disclose the name of my informant, but I can name another prominent American who holds the same view. When giving evidence before the United States House of Representatives Appropriations Sub-committee, the Commander of the American Marine Corps, General David M. Shoup, saidOnly a little bit of Australia and New Zealand would be left after a nuclear war. . . . The yellows and browns would then take over. That statement was published by the "" Telegraph "" on 19th April of this year. It might be of interest to note that at this stage Russia has more experience than America in connection with nuclear weapons. For example, Russia has exploded thf gross equivalent of 305 megatons while the United States of America has exploded the equivalent of only . 143 megatons. Russia is also well ahead with ballistic missile submarines and claims to have 71 in commission now, whereas the United States claims only 41 in 1963 but says that this number will be raised to 80 by 1967. But the Americans are well ahead when it comes to effective which cannot be launched from below the surface of the sea-the vessel must surface and elevate its launching gear from the deck to exceed 360 miles. On the other hand, the United States has the ability to strike from submerged positions up to an extreme range of 2,875 miles from the launching position. As at this time, she could launch a total of 656 missiles against a Russian total of less than 426. The Polaris missile is no better than it is claimed to be, and it is not very large. In all, it weights 15 tons. There are three types of Polaris missiles. They are all 50 inches in diameter, but they vary from 28 feet to 31 feet in length, tiheir travelling speeds vary from 7,000 to 10,500 miles an hour and their ranges vary from 1,380 to 2,875 miles. It is claimed by the Americans that these weapons have absolute accuracy and, if correctly set and launched, will strike the target without error. Other experts, however, are of the opinion that the missile, no matter what the launchers do, is liable to an error of some five miles at extreme range. As the warhead has a blast area over a radius of three miles, it could miss a military target entirely. When aimed at a city, the possibilities are very different. It is then possible to secure accuracy of 100 per cent. In any case, the station to be constructed in Western Australia is absolutely necessary if the Polaris fleet is to operate successfully in the Indian Ocean or the western Pacific, not only from a communications point of view, but to ensure that the missiles are correctly launched. No one really believes that this communications station is merely to broadcast birthday greetings or Christmas messages, although it may do both of these things. It will transmit continuously for the purpose of confusing any enemy or potential enemy, and it will very definitely assist the submarines to fix their positions at any time and provide and check information to be fed into the projectiles when required. The Prime Minister has stated that the purpose of the station is not to provide navigational assistance for submarines, and he has repeatedly stressed that all types of naval vessels will be communicated with by the station. But any surface vessel may be satisfactorily contzcted without all this expense. Let the Government state that this station would have been built were there no submarines involved. Australian naval vessels also may use the station. But could we not communicate with our own Navy without it? We have no submarines yet. When we get them, will they be equipped to take advantage of the ability of this station to communicate with submerged vessels up to 4,000 miles away? According to American information, the submarines have four separate means of determining their positions, including an antenna to receive radio-navigational aids transmitted b> super-powerful shore stations. Added to these shore stations shortly will be two naval communications relay vessels, one for each station. The system will then cover the world. All treaties relating to defence are entered in;o entirely with a view to adding to the security of the state or of extending its territorial possessions or influence. Few nations have ever undertaken military risks unless in their own interests. Australia, in this instance, is entirely concerned with its own safety, and so is the United States of America. We have something to gain and we have something to offer. The agreement with which this bill is concerned is a treaty of mutual value. We do the best v.: can in all the circumstances, and we o w it to ourselves to see that we gain the best possible terms. We accept the American alliance, but we do not hold up thc United States as a sacred cow that is beyond criticism. And no doubt the Americans would be the first to agree with i: . There is much criticism of the United States and her policies in other parts of th world. Nations other than Australia have received much more favorable treatmen: in the establishment of American bases, as I have pointed out. But still there is criticism. The"" Royal Air Force' iarterly"", in volume 3, No. 1, has this tc say""There is a strong suspicion in London that the US. effort to wash out the Skybolt is a thinly disguised attempt to blackball Britain out of the nuclear weapons club . . . If the Skybolt play is successful in dealing Britain out of the nuclear deterrent group, then it will be even more feasible to throttle the French effort to build its nuclear delivery systems (This) would polarize international relations between Washington and Moscow, leaving Ch^aman Krushchev and President Kennedy free to negotiate without interference by troublesome allies. ""These nasty thoughts are one reason why the Skybolt issue has far-reaching international implications that extend beyond any budgetary or technical problems. If these fears by the British and French are unfounded, there still remains the basic question of US. integrity in relation to its allies. The US. is already on record as having pulled the technical rug from under French IRBM "" That means intermediate-range ballistic missiles"" development, although no prior assurances were involved. If it now scuttles Skybolt and the British deterrent after repeated firm promises to deliver, it will be sad to watch the devaluation of US. stock on the NATO bourse."" Are such sentiments anti-American, or unfair to our ally across the Atlantic? The editor writesI doubt it, as they appeared in ""Aviation Week"", America's leading aviation journal, over the signature of its Editorl The ""Royal Air Force Quarterly"" stated alsoThere are many who see this as the thin end of a mighty wedge. In fact, some critics regard the whole Polaris deal as a deliberate political manoeuvre to lessen British influence and to force the United Kingdom into the European community, militarily as well as economically. What this publication has to say could hardly be taken as being said in support of the Australian Labour Party. Now we have a report from the London"" Punch"" that is based on an article taken from the London"" Times"". The article in "" Punch"" is headed "" McNamara's Ragtime Plan "", McNamara being the United States Secretary of Defence, and stateston correspondent, ""has completed his strategic thinking"". This is an event of some magnitude, sjnce the fate of the human race may depend upon it, and the civil thing to do is to spare a couple of minutes to consider what his strategic thoughts amount to. The object of a deterrent being to deter, America's strategic thinking has been focused, until lately, on that benevolent goal. The otherman",34,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
96,""" Mr Mcnamara"", Writes The Times Washing","had to be made to realise that if he fired first he would wish he hadn't. Now the whole point of a deterrent is that it should be absolute. It is madness to deter slightly, or in a humane sort of way. When planning a deterrent war that is never to happen you must go the whole hog. Preparations must be made, and be seen to have been made, on a scale large enough to ensure the annihilation of every man, woman and child in the opposite camp. You can then feel confident, so the theory runs, that they won't press the trigger. This is the Doctrine of Massive Retaliation. The drawback to massive retaliation is that if it has to be put into effect it loses its appeal. It invites massive re-retaliation; and no country likes to base its strategic thinking for long on a doctrine that includes its own extinction. Is there not, people begin to ask, some interim, some less cataclysmic mode of retaliation that might suffice, at least in the early stages? To this problem the US. Defence Secretary and his advisers have addressed themselves and they have now come up with the Doctrine of the Controlled Response and (more precisely) the Doctrine of Counterforce Retaliation. Briefly, the idea is that if compelled to retaliate, you hit back in the first instance at the enemy's missile bases, avoiding his cities in the hope that he will pay the same respect to nuclear exchange need not necessarily lead to a multi-megadeath war,"". Indeed, given good civil defence and (I suppose) a properly doctrinaire approach by both sides, he thinks the casualties in a breezy counterforce engagement might not exceed eighteen megadeaths. For the benefit of the uninitiated, I point out that a megadeath is 1,000,000 dead people. The article continuesBut before we all start picturing ourselves as survivors of a third World War swapping cosy thermonuclear escape stories, I must sound a note of warning. There is a snag. Unilateral counterforce warfare is feasible only so long as both sides have an ample reserve of missilesa "" Surplusage "" is perhaps the word. This is because neither side can afford to use up so many missiles in an attempt to destroy the other side's missiles that it has surely Australians are aware that some of not enough left to destroy, or threaten to destroy, the other side's cities as well-unles s the other side happens to be similarly and simultaneously short of what I hope I may call, not without relish, the Minimal Extinction Quotient. Moreover (and mark this closely) the other side must not be allowed to get short, since the nearer its declining stockpile approaches to the MEQ the more likely it is to switch in a panic from counterforce to multi-megadeath war. There is here, then, a situation that calls for very delicate operational tactics by both sides, not only to conserve their own supplies but to guard against a too drastic reduction of the enemy's. If you think that this is a lot of whimsical the Menzies Government to have faith in phooey, you are invited to read the London its own people and its own country. We ""Times"" of 27th November, 1962, where agree with Mr Douglas Wilkie, who, in the he would in fact welcome a further round of Soviet rearmament if it gave Russia a our intelligence. sure second-strike capability. The doctrine of reductio ad absurdum, which is that if the logic of the situation leads to lunatic consequences the situation ought to be changed, has apparently not yet been brought to the notice of either side. Secretary for Defence, is the man in the Pentagon-the man behind the man in the White House to whom we have given the right to press the button in Australia without either our knowledge or our consent. A paper as prominent as "" Punch"" writes him up as a "" person who, in actual fact, ought to be behind bars "". The whole world has cause to fear a nuclear war, which we are convinced should be avoided by any means within our power. We are of the opinion that this Government has not done enough in the field of conventional defence. For instance, we could have done better than to purchase the three American-built destroyers which are expected to cost us more than £60,000,000. We could have built these vessels ourselves, based on a better model-the British missilelaunching cruiser "" Devonshire "". Experts here are of the opinion that we could have built no less than nine of those vessels for the same expenditure. The Government's excuse that we could not arm them with the required missiles and equipment is not acceptable. We are able to produce the Ikara anti-submarine missile, which was invented in this country and which is now being considered by both England and the United States for arming their navies. As far as electronic control equipment goes, the equipment in use by the Americans at Cape Canaveral was designed and built at our Weapons Research Establishment in South Australia. This country can do the job if it is given the chance. Our scientists and workmen are second to none. This is evident, apparently, to every one but the Government. We are being reduced to the status of a satellite and to the stature of a central American banana republic by the failure of Nuclear dangers we can take, but not insults to",36,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963

If that is soI do not concede for one moment that it is so-surel y that would be one very good reason for supporting the establishment of this radio base without any of the equivocation that we have seen displayed by honourable members opposite. The attitude of the Australian Labour Party to defence is traditional and one that it has taken up with real consistency for decades. It was described very aptly by a member of the Labour Party who later became Prime Minister. In 1938, the late Mr Curtin said thisT say that any increase in defence expenditure after the Munich Pact, so far as Australia is concerned, appears to me to be utterly unjustifiable, an hysterical piece of propaganda.

They seem to believe that base is concerned. I say to him: What if if we can cut ourselves off from the other countries of the world, we can be left alone and allowed to go our own way. Things just do not work out that way. One would have thought that at least the Leader of the Opposition would have learned something in his many years in this Parliament, that he would have learned that we can be secure only if we are prepared to defend ourselves. He was in this Parliament when Australia and other countries learned this lesson, but many honourable members opposite are not impressed by what the Leader of the Opposition should have learned. The policy of the Australian Labour Party in relation to this radio base and to other defence matters involving our great allies is one of limited co-operation which would very nearly lead to neutralism, as far as Australia is concerned. Honourable members opposite would impose conditions on tbe help we are prepared to give to the United States and Great Britainconditions which would make the radio base inoperative and useless. In addition, they want to put conditions on the assistStates or Great Britain.

Great Britain has been in the firing line for 2,000 years, fighting for freedom, and particularly in the last 50 or 60 years. I i Great Britain had not been in the firing line to the United States in an attempt to knock fighting for freedom, we would not be here to-day and this Parliament would not exist. This attitude of our opponents is completely unrealistic. If the United States were attacked the ANZUS Treaty would involve us much more assuredly than this agreement. Morally and legally we would be involved and bound to support our allies, with or without the radio base. We could not escape the consequences of a world war if we tried to stay out of it. If the United States lost, Russia would absorb the countries that had stood aside. The so-called neutralists would be rolled over within a year of Russia having won a nuclear war. Our survival depends upon the survival of the United States. This bill recognizes that fact, and this Parliament should recognize it. All Australians should recognize it. In doing what we can to assist the United States we make the position of the Western countries stronger than it is at the present time. I want to say something about the possiare not available, have not been published bility of joint control, which is the main and cannot be read.

That agreement is quite marines or surface ships in the waters to different from the agreement now being our north and to our west. In addition, it debated by the House, because it involves should be realized that we will at times missiles, whereas the agreement we are want to be sending messages through that discussing involves a radio base which can base in a code that Australians would use, send messages to vehicles carrying missiles. and it would not be a United States code. There is a great deal of difference between But the main reason why joint control the two kinds of documents. Don't at a vital moment would be impossible is honourable members realize that the United to be found in the time factor. Polaris States gave the Thor missiles to the United missiles that would be fired from nuclear Kingdom? Article3 of the agreement with submarines are not first-strike weapons. regard to those missiles said, "" Ownership They are not accurate enough to knock of the missiles and related equipment shall out a missile base in some Communist counpass to the United Kingdom "". These were try.

There is all the difference in the try to start a nuclear war.

From the time those missiles were sent until the time when the order went out for the Polaris weapons to be used would be a matter of only 15 or 30 minutes. Polaris missiles are not first-strike weapons; they are second-strike weapons because of their degree of accuracy. For this reason they can never be used as aggressive weapons, but only as an answer to aggression. We have heard a great deal from the Opposition about agreements between the United States and Italy and between the United States and Turkey. There is not one member of this Parliament who has read either of those agreements, because they are not available to be read. When honourable members opposite get up and say that the agreements provide that the Italians or the Turks will have more control in their countries than the Australians have in this country, I simply reply that they are talking so much nonsense. The agreements world between the circumstances of that agreement and those of the agreement with people has been indulged in by the Oppowhich we are now concerned. But let us also have a look at the relathe Opposition ( Mr Calwell) and the tionship between the two countries, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr United States and the United Kingdom, Allan Fraser), in connection with this matter in connection with the use of the Holy Loch of control. I understand it is a dictum of establishment. We will find that the posithe law that ignorance is no defence to a tion of the British Prime Minister and the breach of the law.

102,Mr Malcolm Fraser,"They arewe would say to the United States and our other allies, ""We will accept conventional armed help from you, but only help by way of conventional arms "". If we were attacked by somebody with nuclear missiles the Americans would not think much of that kind of proposition, would they? Secondly, the proposal for a nuclear-free zone would destroy ANZUS and our co-operation in it, and ANZUS is this country's mainstay of survival. Are we so naive as to think that in the event of war any aggressor nation in this part of the worldand the United States is not going to be an aggressor, nor are we-woul d respect any agreement that might have been signed, no matter how many people had signed it? In addition, the proposal would upset the balance of power because of Communist superiority in conventional arms. It would weaken the United States and the United Kingdom. It would weaken their power of retaliation, because it would affect Western bases and it would not affect a single Communist base. It would weaken, in other words, the West's nuclear deterrent without affecting the deterrent of the Soviets and the other Communists. is their idea. The only disarmament which makes sense is world disarmament, both nuclear and conventional. The Communists will not accept this, because they will not accept the vital elements of inspection and control. Therefore they seek to weaken the West by getting a nuclear-free zone here and a nuclear-free zone there. This is impossible, munists, through their Communist unions and it would be suicidal for Australia. Occasionally, Mr Deputy Speaker, nations take a path which leads to their destruction as a result of some ill-advised act of their leaders. History is littered with the ashes of appointed by a Labour government. cities and nations as a result of these happenings. If we do not co-operate in the spirit of ANZUS with our allies, future historians will record that this was where Australia made decisions fatal to her survival. Complete co-operation is the only course that is open to us. There is no safety in isolation; there is none in neutralism or in half-hearted co-operation. With responsibility to our children and respect and trust for our allies, with tradimunist. I do say they are affected by what tions of defence of freedom unequalled by any other nation, there is nothing in honour that Australia can do but accept with some pride and fortitude the obligation that the world sets on free men to stand with our allies. Courage and resolution in this provide the foundations on which our defences are built. If we lack courage, or falter, or lose understanding of our position, we risk the destruction of our people. The curse of Australian politics for almost the whole of the existence of Australia as a Commonwealth has been that we have never had a united foreign policy except, to a limited extent, in the days of calamity during the war. The reason for this has been described many times but it was described most ably by a former member for West Sydney, Mr Jack Beasley, who was later a Labour Minister in a Labour government and, later still, a high commissioner appointed by a Labour government. He described, quite clearly, after the famous "" hands off Russia"" resolution which led to the formation of the first Australian Labour Party-Non-Communist , which included the then members for Lang, Dalley, Cook and Reid, how the Communist Party took over the control of the Labour Party organization in New South Wales. He described how it infiltrated into the party and affected the policies of the party. 1 recommend honourable members opposite to read this speech by a member of the Labour Party-no t by the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth). They should read the speech, because it sets out, in clear terms, how the Comand Labour Party conferences, can infiltrate and affect Labour policy. This was a speech made by somebody who, after he had made it, was made a Labour Minister and, later still, was a high commissioner This is not the time or the place to discuss the infiltration by the Communist Party into the ranks at the base level of the Australian Labour Party. But it is, perhaps, pertinent to look at the effects of this infiltration in statements by honourable members opposite. AlthoughI will quote certain members of the Opposition, in no case do I say that any of them is a Com-",40,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
103,Mr Jess,That is their idea.,41,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
104,Mr Malcolm Fraser,"Of course it has happened in the lower ranks of their own party. In the middle of 1962, at a State conference of the Australian Labour Party, the honourable member for Wills( Mr the United States. But he saidBryant) saidThe US. and Russia, backed by Great Britain and France committed acts of aggression which threatened the world with war. You will note, Mr Speaker, the way in which the honourable member equates the acts of Great Britain and America with the acts of the Communist imperialists-the Russians and the Chinese. Two weeks ago the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) made a speech which could not have been more anti-American if it had been made by Mr Khrushchev himself or by some Chinese professional American-hater. As reported in the press he said these words. . . during which time no one can foresee the course of world events or even imagine what forces which suit her, will desert those she should be -fascist , democratic or Communist-wil l rule America. . . . He showed complete lack of faith and a complete lack of trust in our allies. We all know the statement made by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) in 1961, when he said that Castro was a great socialist. He said that he himself was a great democratic socialist and that Castro had done what any democratic socialist would have done in the circumstances. This, again, was taking the view of the Communists. More shameful than any of these speeches was a speech made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro late last year during the debate on the United States action over Cuba; and it is perfectly consistent with what the honourable member said in this Parliament much more recently. He said that the American action was a violation of the United Nations Charter. He said that Khrushchev did not yield to the American ultimatum but achieved everything in accordance with his previously planned strategy. He compared America's defence of the 2,500,000 people in West Berlin with the enslavement of the people of Cuba by .the Communists of Cuba with the aid and assistance of Russia. speech for yourself and see what he said. This is precisely what he said. He said also that he was certain that world war was F.3823/63 -R -[59] no part of Khrushchev's strategy. You would have thought that the honourable member would try to be equally flattering to Now we come to this position. America did not take her case to the United Nations and I think she stands condemned for not having done so. When the honourable member said that he knew it was untrue. It was a deliberate misrepresentation. President Kennedy, in the sixth article of his statement on the Cuba situation to the people of the United States and the world, said the matter was being referred to the Security Council of the United Nations. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro continuedIn the light of the American action over CubaI suggest that we can have no real and positive faith in the value to us of American action, because she acted in her own interests without consulting us. As was shown by what happened in regard to Indonesia, America, in circumstances supporting and defending. . . . So we stand alone in the world. This was a shameful speech against our ally. The only question which remains is whether this reveals a genuine hatred of the United States or a great pandering to the left wing of his party and the elements outside the party which support it. I would sooner it were the first, because that at least would be an honest attitude. If it is the latter, he should save his time. His own party would never accept him as leader because he is regarded as too smart by half. In the current debate the honourable member for Eden-Monaro again said that the communications station would be used only if there were a nuclear war. This, again, is untrue. It is not correct. It is wrong. There are ruder terms which could be used and which would apply equally to what he said. He stated that Labour would move amendments to the bill which would be vital. I agree that they would be vital, because if agreed to they would destroy the bill and there would be no radio communications base. This is the objective of many honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro said the Opposition would not vote against the second reading or the third reading of the bill, but that, in fact, an amendment would be proposed to the motion for the third reading which would be equivalent to voting against it. So this, again, was untrue.",41,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
105,Mr Bryant,That is nonsense.,42,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
106,Mr Malcol M Fraser,"Read theThe Leader of the Opposition has said he wants to maintain the American alliance. I hope he means this and I believe he does. But this does not stand beside the policy that his party has adopted on the radio communications base, or its nuclear policy, or the statements of his supporters. If he meant what he said he should be prepared to do what he can, in peace, to avoid war. But, of course, we know that he cannot, because he is not his own master. He has to do what his left wing and his outside organization tell him to do. I believe that Australia will view with dismay and disgust the fact that men who are not Communists can be so weak as to absorb their policy and advocate it to the detriment of Australia and the destruction of the Australian people. I can understand men of goodwill-sincer e but misguidedwishing to keep Australia apart from the divisions which split the world. Such men are set apart from the honourable members 1 have mentioned by the fact that they do not unfairly burden the United States and the United Kingdom with blame. They recognize Russia for what she is-dominat ing, imperialist and unscrupulous. They are not apologists for the evils of communism and they do not damn their friends by false accusations. Our friends on the Opposition benches know where Australia's safety lies. They know the insidious influence always present in their ranks, as shown by their own former colleague, Mr Jack Beasley, but they are not strong enough to do anything about it. They have not the strength of will to stand for Australia in this particular to a consideration of some of America's matter against the outside influences in their own organization. In all this, the Leader of the Opposition stands doubly condemned because he knows precisely what the position is. He knows where Australia's interests lie but he lacks the courage and basic character and is prepared to put Australia in jeopardy and at peril to preserve his own position as the leader of a divided party. If we have concern for our own survival we must stand and co-operate with our allies. We must seek no alternative, for there is none that would leave honour to this Parliament or to this people. propose to spend much of my time in answering the McCarthyistic nonsense and rubbish which has been uttered by the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser). As I have said in this House on other occasions, the McCarthy episode was one of the most disgraceful episodes in American history. It is no wonder that the honourable member has become so sycophantic about American foreign policy. I stand as an Australian, not envious of the Americans nor fearful of the Russians, but very watchful of all governments, no matter what their colour, and particularly watchful of this disastrous dichotomy-the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party-whic h has had control of this country for the last thirteen or fourteen years. Would any honourable member on the Government side commit himself without equivocation to some aspects of the Government's foreign policy? How many of them would stand forthright and four-square in public and support the attitude of the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) six years ago when he sponsored the murdering of Egyptians to protect commercial interests in the Suez Canal? How many other people in this country would do so? Was not that a black page in our history? ln this agreement the Menzies Government is writing, blindfold, a commitment to American foreign policy for the next 25 years. I have a great respect for the American people and the American Government. Honourable members opposite would do well if they turned their hearts and minds political principles. They might examine the American Congress and the way it works. They might see that there are people in America who will take up disputes with the Government in the Congress and not be accused of treachery or of being traitors or Communists. It is the free play of opinion in the community that is important. This Government has trespassed upon our rights by producing an agreement signed, sealed and delivered before any person in this place was consulted. It has committed Australia, unconsulted, for the next 25 years, aud for that it will answer to the Australian people.",42,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
107,Mr Bryant (Wills) [5.40],"I do notThis debate is the impeachment of the Liberal and Country parties before the people of Australia. We shall make absolutely sure that the people are fully aware of all the implications of this agreement before the next election. It was with some concern this afternoon that I watched men whose attainments in certain fields are of a high order prostitute their talents. I saw the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) and the honourable member for Wannon exhibit a most miserable and faithless attitude to their parliamentary duty. The honourable member for Wannon misquoted history. He did not look for facts. He did not take the trouble to follow through his researchesI do not know whether he did them himself-o n the United States and the United Kingdom agreement on Polaris missiles. He tried to mislead the House on the significance of the Polaris missile base in Western Australia vis-a-vis the base at Holy Loch in Scotland, so I shall take some moments to deal with his argument on that score. BeforeI do so I should like to mention the points on which we disagree. First, there is the Government's failure to consult the Parliament or the people before they were for Wannon on the question of joint control. committed. Secondly, there is the GovernThat is the first point at which we join issue. ment's failure to protect Australia's interests He chose to say that we did not know what and rights. There is no doubt about that. we were talking about and that we had The most disturbing feature of this debate deceived or misled the Australian people on is to hear honourable members opposite, the question of joint control in the United many of whom have given great service to Kingdom. What is the exact position? The this nation, so completely sycophantic honourable member for Wannon had done towards other people's foreign policy. They some research, as I pointed out earlier, to have shown an attitude of mind which no the extent of reading what Mr Macmillan decent American would adopt in his had said in the House of Commons in reply Congress. They have shown an attitude of to a question without notice. Would any complete cynical acceptance of the belief one take any notice of the answers which that Australia has nothing to offer io world the Australian Prime Minister gives in this affairs.

There is also the introduction of As far as I can make out, that is not chala target area. Australia has been placed lenged by any one. As the honourable right in the target. Yet a case has not been member for Reid( Mr Uren) pointed out, made out that the strategic position has this base will be the Achilles heel of the changed so fundamentally in the last few Polaris submarine system. The honourable years that the establishment of this base is member for Wannon then tried to equate a vitally necessary. I think I could challenge the strategy of this base. We are concerned about Australia's commitment because it has been a part of the pattern of our history over the last 65 years that Australia will stand up for itself, will answer for itself and will make its own decisions. Any self-respecting Australian with a regard for our historic role in world affairs would, I believe, agree with me on that. Every Australian outside this place to whom I have spoken, once this issue has been made clear, has been clear on that. When the issue has been made clear to the people of Australia, honourable members opposite will answer for their actions at the next election. Some of the Government's policies give me the horrors-it s domestic and foreign policies, its gerrymandering of electorates, its floggings and hangings and its plural voting, as one might put it-bu t the signing of this agreement is the worse act ever performed by an Australian government. This complete and absolute commitment, in a way which I am sure the people of Australia cannot yet understand, is something which will be challenged on every voting-paper at the next election. I take issue with the honourable member House to questions without notice? You could not take the slightest notice of them, There is no doubt that submarines will be Polaris submarine operating in the Atlantic Ocean with a Polaris submarine operating in the Indian Ocean. The base at Holy Loch is in a completely different position from that in which the station at North West Cape will be placed. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes), who is interjecting, should be able to read just as well as the rest of us can. When submarines are in the United Kingdom's territorial waters, the United Kingdom has absolute control. That position is completely different from the position which will apply with the Australian base. The honourable member for Wannon quoted a statement by the United Kingdom Prime Minister, but I should like to read a considered statement which was made in the House of Commons on 4th November, 1960, by the United Kingdom Minister for Defence, Mr Watkinson. He saidTo come to the detailed problem of control, I must return to what the Prime Minister said on lst November. First of all, he stated that the facilities in this country, which include territorial himself. waters, will be operated under exactly the same arrangements as those applying to the existing bomber bases and missile sites, that is to say, joint consultation in an emergency. The Australian Prime Minister seemed to think that this was an absolute impossibility in our own case. Watkinson saidI do not think that he actually mentioned this, but perhaps I might make it plain to the House that our control within territorial waters is absolute. I hope that that message has got through to honourable members opposite. league who sits beside you was sacked too, but that establishes his integrity. In some ways a sacking from the Menzies Ministry might well be an accolade. Mr Watkinson went onWe have a firm assurance that these missiles would not be fired in any circumstances in the United Kingdom territorial waters. I do not think that the Prime Minister brought that out, and so I add that to the facts now. That statement has not been refuted. There has been no qualification. In the first instance the relationship between the United Britain get a better deal than Australia? Kingdom and the United States and the relationship between Australia and the United States on this issue are completely to know. Why did Italy get a better deal different. The Government has accepted a completely different point of view in this instance. One of the newspapers pointed out that the base in Western Australia is as much a part of the Polaris weapon system as the launching pad itself. The Government has accepted the position that WJ should have no say. That proposition has been pooh-poohed. The Prime Minister has sneered at it. The whole situation of the Labour Party has been confused. If we want to know exactly how important the Prime Minister thinks this is, we have only to look at this statement. He said. . . then in the event of a war breaking out in which nuclear weapons were involved, if you like, Australia could nullify the effect of United States nuclear weapons in the southern hemisphere by saying to the United States, "" You are not to use this communication station."". So this communication station is just as much a part of the firing of the weapon system, according to the Prime Minister Until recently the Prime Minister has been off-handed in his answers to questions to a point almost reaching deceit. When challenged in this debate he comes to the point of saying that we could nullify the Continuing, Mr eCect of nuclear weapons in the southern hemisphere by saying, in effect, "" You cannot use them "". The point is that the Prime Minister himself has said that this station is fundamental to the weapon system of Polaris submarines. In the United Kingdom, if there is to be any firing, any operation of missile bases or anything else, the United Kingdom is to have joint consultation and, in the actual firing, absolute control. This is not the question that the honourable member for Wannon raised. He raised the question of those weapons which had been handed over to Great Britain for her own firing. This base is part of the machinery for Polaris missiles, which will be operated from Australian territory, and we are to have no say. That is the point at issue and the point on which we on this side of the House challenge the Government in particular. Mr L. R.

110,Mr Bryant,"That is what we wantthan Australia? Is it not a fact that under the Spanish agreementI have the words of the Spanish agreement here somewhere a bomber cannot take off unless the Spanish Government gives its approval? Why is it that we are further down the line than any other nation? That is the point at issue. Why is it that Italy, Spain, Turkey, Greece and Great Britain all can receive fairer treatment and be put in a position of partnership, but Australia cannot? Australia has no use for sycophancy or satellitism. ment with Spain? for Bradfield, by interjection, is mouthing the completely inept approach of honourable members opposite to all of these issues. This has been one of the fundamental issues of Australian history-that we will control our own destiny. The honourable member might turn his attention to General de Gaulle who had a few words to say about why he should not accept a complete and absolute commitment in these matters. This has been a question throughout Australian history. In pre-federation days Deakin contested with Chamberlain the right of Australia to have its own say. Deakin's story of federation tells how Chamberlain attempted to keep control of Australia's foreign policy, defence and similar matters. Part of the story of the beginning of the Australian federation was a demand by Australian leaders to make their own decision. When the Fisher Government came to power exactly the same thing happened. That Government had to fight to establish the Royal Australian Navy. That was opposed, too. In 1916, 1917 and 1918 the question of the control of Australian forces overseas arose. It took most of the First World War to get them under the control of Australia's own generals. But surely honourable members opposite can see the point. Then we can turn to the story related by Mr Hughes. I will not read it. Most of it is set out in the pages of ""Policies and Potentates"". As far as I can determine, most of it is pretty close to source material. The story starts on page 237 with his struggle against American President Wilson. For some reason or other, President Wilson did not want us to have any say in Papua and New Guinea. Then we come to the recent war, which I think is a most appropriate example. Lionel Wigmore, in his book ""The Japanese Thrust"", recounts at page 449 the struggle of the Curtin Government against the Churchill Government to get control of Australia's own troops. The point at issue was the disposition of the Australian Seventh Division. If the Curtin Government had not carried on that struggle to get control of Australia's own troops and brought it to a successful conclusion, what would have happened to that division in Burma or Java? Is there any honourable member opposite who would not now support the position that the Australian Government took up? The British leaders and the American leaders wanted the Australian troops in Burma or in Java. The people supporting them were the non-government members of the Advisory War Council. The present Prime Minister was one of them. On that occasion, as on this occasion, he showed no concern whatsoever. He was supported by Sir Earle Page and Viscount Bruce, who was then in London. They supported the point of view that Australia had no right to dispose its own troops and had no control over its own destiny. This is the point on which we join issue with honourable members opposite: Australia must control its own affairs and any commitment on foreign policy, defence or anything else which gives a blank cheque to some other government must be reconsidered. In this case we say that this provision must be taken away and that the American people must understand quite clearly and forthrightly that we on this side of the House, representing the majority of the people of Australia and having the same number of seats in this House as the Government has, say that Australia must have an equal say. I am sure that the American people and the American Government would support us in that matter. The second question is the term of 25 years. Has any government the right to tie our hands for the next 25 years? Would anybody on the other side of the House give a written guarantee in respect of Australia's foreign policy for the next 25 years? If you turned back the pages of history, would you still be in complete agreement with all the points of foreign policy over the last 25 years? Is there anybody in this House who will stand up now and say that the Prime Minister was right in 1956 over the Suez crisis?",45,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963

I challenged the honourable member for Ballaarat and other honourable members opposite to say whether they were prepared to hand over control of the station and without any qualification to place Australia in what might be called the cauldron of the cold war. I asked them to say, if they were prepared to rely on American foreign policy for the next 25 years, whether they would have been prepared to do so for the last 25 years.

124,Mr Erwin,In the situation as it was,47,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
125,Mr Bryant,"The honourable member that they supported the policy then. What kind of men are these to be charged with fhe responsibility of conducting Australia's affairs? The Prime Minister has said that the establishment of this base is very important and that is fundamental. He has saidAustralia could nullify the effect of United States nuclear weapons in the southern hemisphere . . . He has said further that by adopting the policy of the Labour Party we couldstrike out of the hands of our friends and allies the nuclear weapon in some vast area while leaving it completely in the hands of our potential enemies . . . This is what the Prime Minister has said. The Labour Party's policy on this matter is that Australia's involvement in war is a question for Australia alone. What is wrong with that? Is any honourable member opposite prepared to tell his electors that he opposes this view? We believe that Australia alone should decide its involvement at all times and under no circumstances and under no agreement should Australia become automatically involved in war. Our policy also isIn the event of the United States of America being at war or threatened with war by another power, Australian Territory and Australian facilities must not be used in any way that would involve Australia without the prior knowledge and consent of the Australian Government. What is wrong with that attitude? Is there any honourable member opposite with any spark of Australianism in him who would not support this attitude? I said earlier that every other nation had adopted other methods in dealing with the United States of America. I quoted Italy and Spain. I was challenged about Spain, but Article3 of the United States and Spain Defence Agreement saysThe time and manner of wartime utilization of such areas and faciUties will be as mutually agreed upon. Mr Philip Noel-Baker in his book ""The Arms Race"" saidThe air bases have runways long enough for jet bombers loaded with H-bombs; but they can only be used if Spain, after consultation, is willing to consent. He quotes the "" Times"" of London and the "" Times"" of New York to support his view. What is it that Australia lacks that Spain has? Some honourable members opposite would seem to have some political affinity in this kind of base that it was not long with Franco and Spain. These are matters on which the Government has been challenged and these are the matters upon which it has deserted its post. This debate is an impeachment of the Government. It has become almost traditional for Australia to fight against the parties now in power in order to assert its rights. Before the suspension of the sitting I referred to the historic struggle between Curtin and Churchill on the disposal of the Australian armed forces. Is there any honourable member opposite who would say to his electors that he would have liked to have seen the Seventh Division lost in Burma or Java? That is what the present Prime Minister sought to do. That is what the leader of honourable members opposite-the man they follow uncritically-sough t to do. He was a member of the Advisory War Council. For my authority I refer to the official history, at page 449. We believe that the United States should not have sole control of this station. We say that this is a question of great moment and should not be treated lightly. We say, further, that the Government should not have ventured upon this agreement without discussing it first with the Parliament and the people of Australia. We can show that this is one aspect of our policy. Let me refer to the question: Can you have regional disarmament pacts? I refer honourable members opposite to three in particular. One goes back to 1817. It was the agreement between the United States of America and Great Britain about the frontier between those two countries. At this time feelings were running high between them because in 1812 there had been a conflict between them. I refer the House to the agreement between Norway and Sweden and to the agreement between Turkey and Greece after the last war. These are cases in which regional disengagement and regional disarmament have worked. That is the principle on which our nuclear-free zone is based. Another question relates to the strategy of this matter. This is perhaps not the occasion on which to debate the strategy of the base. It may be good strategy for America but it could easily be bad strategy for Australia. I remind those who would put their faith ago that people were putting faith in the Maginot Line and Singapore-defence s that had been designed by generals and admirals, but they ceased to exist. This agreement may be another Maginot Line in the Menzies strategy. Put not your faith in bases. Look at what has happened to them. Cyprus as a base was vital on one occasion, was not vital later and again became vital. This also happened with Suez and with Kenya. It has happened with them all. But the Government is committing Australia and Australia's children and grandchildren for 25 years. They are committed but unconsulted. If one thing affected me more than another during the course of this debate, it was the attitude of the Prime Minister when he was questioned on the establishment of this base. He said he was delighted that this base was here. What could he bc delighted about? He could perhaps take comfort from the fact that Australia had great and powerful allies. But would any man with any conscience or any sensitivity towards world affairs have used the word "" delighted""? I shall quote the views of other people in these matters. Pope Pius XII. in 195: saidThis is the spectacle offered to the terrified gaze a time when the free world is facing a as the result of such use: entire cities, even the largest and richest in art and history, wiped out; a pall of death over pulverised ruins, covering countless victims with limbs burnt, twisted, and scattered while others groan in their death agony. you have? Pope Pius XII. He continuedMeanwhile the spectre of a radio-active cloud House appreciated the value of the friendhinders survivors from giving any help and inexorship and support of the United States of ably advances to snuff out any remaining life. There will be no song of victors, only the inconAmerica at another time of danger to this solable weeping of humanity, which in desolation country and welcomed American aid. will gaze upon a catastrophe brought on by its own folly. I have quoted the words of Pope Pius XII., but the honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Jess) says this is the voice of Moscow. members opposite who say that I opposed 1 leave the House with this thought: These it, I say that I am afraid I was a little too are the words with which sensitive people busy to be able to oppose calling the United describe the crisis facing civilization. The States of America to Australia's aid at that Prime Minister of Australia is delighted. me say that the one thing which honoranswered from this side of the House many able members opposite said this aftertimes. I refer to the allegation that this noon and which the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) said this evening, with which I agree is that this is a most important matter. It is perhaps one of the the most important matters to have come before this Parliament for quite some time. It is important not only to all honourable members of this House but also to the people of Australia, and the people of Australia should consider very deeply and sincerely some of the statements that have been made by members of the Opposition during the course of this debate because the members of the Opposition are the alternative government of this country. The honourable member for Wills and some other honourable members opposite have made great play upon the words of the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies), who said, "" I am delighted "", when he was questioned about the making of the agreement covering this base. They have distorted the meaning, the purpose and the thought in the mind of the Prime Minister when he uttered those words. Any one who examined the question asked of the Prime Minister and the answer given by him would realize that in saying, "" I am delighted "", the Prime Minister was implying that he was delighted that, in a time of trouble and difficulty, in threat to its safety and security, a threat that comes not from any country in the free world but from the Communist countries behind the iron curtain, Australia, as one country of the free world, should have the nation and a great people like the United States of America and its people. I remind honourable members opposite that the John Curtin to whom they refer constantly in this time.

129,Mr Ward,You opposed it.,49,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
130,Mr Lucock,"To those honorableGovernment failed to make adequate preparation for our defence in the days between 1939 and 1941 and, prior to that, from 1937 onwards. In 1942,1 had the privilege of returning here in the company of a topranking officer who had attended the defence conferences which had been held in various countries during the early days of the war. He said that many top-ranking people had admitted the tremendous value of the work that had been done by the Lyons Government before the outbreak of war and later by the Menzies Government in preparing this country to defend itself. It has been pointed out on more than one occasion-and all the comments of the Opposition cannot deny the truth of the statement-that John Curtin paid a tribute to those who had preceded him as Prime Minister of this country. he made the statement. He could not advertise our defence position to the world. cover-up by John Curtin. There was no cover-up by the government which preceded him. I remind honourable members that shadow factories were established prior to the war. They were ready to go into production immediately after war broke out. If honourable members study the history of this country they will see the splendid results that accrued from that preparation. Let me refer again to the Empire Air Training Scheme which was acknowledged to be one of the best schemes for the training of fightEver since she received her independence, ing men ever devised. That scheme was put into effect prior to the take-over by the Curtin Government. When commenting on this base, the honourable member for Wills asked, ""How do you know this base will be of any value?"" He compared it with bases at Cyprus and Suez. I suggest that such a comparison is typical of the short-sighted argument advanced by the Opposition in connection with other matters to-day. I consider the base in the light of the protection that it will afford us in the next 25 years, which is the period of the agreement. Earlier to-day, the honourable member for Hughes( Mr L. R. Johnson) said that this Government was putting forward a proposition that did not have the support of the Australian people. I suggest that he should go outside and listen to the views on this matter of all sections of the community, not merely those of the section whose voice alone he appears to be able to hear. If he listened to all sections of the people he would know that beyond all shadow of doubt this Government has strong support throughout Australia for the establishment of this communication base. One thing that has surprised me about honourable members opposite in this debate is that they appear to have been laying emphasis on fear, fear of an atomic war, fear of the unknown nuclear future. I would say that no one with any thought, with any intelligence or with any feeling would not worry after what we have seen and what we know in connection with the advances made by science. But, as has heen said by honourable members on this side of the House, in the world of to-day we must be realists. Surely to goodness any one who looks at the world situation must appreciate that we will not avoid war merely by closing our eyes to the realities of the situation or by merely closing our eyes and saying that the situation that faces us does not exist. I do not doubt that the honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren) is sincere in his desire for peace. Nor do I doubt the sincerity of some of his comments about peace and the maintenance of peace; but I point out one glaring example in recent times of the need to be prepared. I refer to the attack by China upon India. India's one desire has been to develop her territory and provide for her people. In all his utterances at all times, the great Prime Minister of that country has talked about neutrality. He has stated repeatedly that he does not want to be linked with one camp or another, that he does not want India to be alined with one camp or another, that India had to think only of her own security, her own protection and her own defence. But what happened to India? Again, can anybody say that the people of Tibet wanted war? Yet what happened in that country? Any one who doubts that anything might happen in this part of the world has only to read the report presented to the United Nations on what we might call the rape of Tibet. These are all clear illustrations of the need to face the realities of the present world situation.",49,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
131,Mr Ward,You know quite well why,50,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
132,Mr Lucock,"You say that was only aIt is one of the great facts of life that like to read Article3 of the agreement, to-day we need to be in a position to defend which is the schedule to the bill. It statesourselves, and to do that we need strong and noble friends. I said earlier that this proposal represented a serious matter for the House and for Australia. If we examine the arguments that have been put forward by honourable members opposite it becomes obvious that in the background there is a knowledge by honourable members opposite that they are in a most difficult position over this matter. They realize that if they actively and positively oppose the establishment of this base they will arouse an adverse reaction in the hearts and mindj of the Australian people and yet, if they support its establishment without equivocation they will be criticised and condemned by a certain group within the Labour Party. Let us take one of the arguments that members of the Australian Labour Party have constantly been putting forward. In one of their criticisms of the establishment of the proposed base, they speak of sovereignty. I remind Opposition members that a Labour government gave to the United States of America the right to try its own service personnel under its own law when those personnel were established in this country. This was done not by an act of the Parliament but by administrative action. The United Kingdom did the same, but it obtained reciprocal rights with respect person can be elected to State and Federal to its own servicemen in the United States. It may be that if we look into the matter, we shall find that at that time Russia was an ally of Australia, whereas, to-day, she is no longer our ally. In 1947, conscious of a need for the establishment of defence services in Australia, and realizing even in those days the danger of an upset that could come from within Australia and the need to take all steps possible to ensure the safety and security of Australia, the Chifley Government introduced a measure that was enacted as the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act. The honourable member for Barton( Mr This is not a mere boundary dispute or a quesReynolds) said earlier to-day that Australia tion of small territorial frontier adjustments. Apart ought to be consulted in certain matters and from the vast and fantastic claims that China has should have some say in what was done made, before the time came for the actual pressing While Notes were being exchanged for arranging of the button. On this point, Sir, I should talks and discussions to ease tensions, and even (1) The two Governments will consult from time to time at the request of either Government on any matters connected with the station and its use. (2) Except with the express consent of the Australian Government, the station will not be used for purposes other than purposes of defence communication, and appropriate Australian authorities nominated by the Australian Government shall at all times have access to the station. In my view, when set against the statements made by Opposition members, this reveals the fact that they are endeavouring, as it were, to keep a foot in each camp. We have been told that there is a degree of McCarthyism evident on the Government side of the House. Whenever the danger of Communist infiltration is pointed out, this cry will always be raised, for it represents one means by which the people who sit opposite hope to throw a smokescreen over the accusations that are made. Frankly, 1 believe that this debate and events preceding it have shown a remarkable left-wing influence in the Opposition. These are factual points put forward in the cold light of day. My friend and colleague, the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), pointed out the associations of some of the members of the executive of the Australian Labour Party. Yet it has been said that the Labour Party has been founded on democratic lines and that any councils! Nobody denies that, but I think it is an obvious fact of this situation-a n obvious fact that must be appreciatedthat, in some of the unions, there is a very strong Communist influence, and indirectly that influence must make itself felt to the detriment of a policy put forward in the Australian Parliament by the Australian Labour Party. I mentioned earlier, Sir, that all of us and all who have any consciousness of the future of the world desire peace. I should like to quote at this point the words of two people. The first quotation is as follows:China has already occupied 12,000 square miles of Indian territory during the last five years. dates and places were being suggested, further aggression started by China on September 8, and further areas of Indian territory were occupied in a new sector. The issue involved is not one of small territorial gains, one way or the other, but of standards of international behaviour between neighbouring countries and whether the world will allow the principle of "" Might is Right"" to prevail in international relations. Bearing this in mind, India will continue to resist aggression, both to preserve her honour and integrity and to prevent international standards from deteriorating into the jungle law of "" Might is Right"". When aggression is continuously taking place and vast Chinese armies are moving further into our territory, how can we discuss or talk about a peaceful settlement? The first essential is that the Chinese forces along the India-China border should go back at least to where they were prior to September 8, 1962. In this hour of crisis, when we are engaged in resisting this aggression, we are confident that we shall have your sympathy and support as well as the sympathy and support of all countries, not only because of their friendly relations with us, but also see what relevance the alliances mentioned because our struggle is in the interests of world peace and is directed to the elimination of deceit, dissimulation and force in international relations. Those are the words of Mr Nehru, the Prime Minister of India. Would anybody say that Nehru was an aggressor? Would any one say that the armies and the people of India attacked the people of China? Next, I want to read to the House the following words:PeaceI want among all mankind, but I don't want peace at any cost, and certainly not by placatpowers will be able to use it. The United ing the aggressor or at the cost of honour. Those words were spoken by Mahatma Gandhi. In the present world situation, when, as I said at the outset, we face aggression by the Communist powers, we in Australia ought to be thankful in more ways than one that the United States is prepared to link herself with this country in pacts such as the ANZUS and Seato pacts and with the free world in pacts such as the Nato pact. No one would be silly enough to say that we would at all times agree with the statements or thinking of the United States. But, in a free world, and especially in the Western world at present, what is needed is a strong and unified front on the part of all the nations of the free world against the Communists to show, without doubt or hesitation, that any aggression would be to the detriment of the Communists, and to the detriment of civilization. If we were to show that we were fearful of the future, and if we were to shrink from the responsibilities that are ours, we would not be woarthy of the sacrifice made by the men and women of Australia in two world wars, wbich I heard mentioned this afternoon by an Opposition member. At this time, it is necessary that we in Australia, without fear and without equivocation, show those who are our potential enemies-surel y no one would think that the United States or the United Kingdom would ever be our potential enemies-that we, at the time of testing, will aline ourselves with those who place liberty and honour above all else. Speaker, the Australian Labour Party agrees on the need for alliances and also in general agrees with the remarks by Mr Nehru and Mr Gandhi which were quoted. It is very difficult, however, to by the honourable member for Lyne( Mr Lucock) and the remarks quoted by him have to the present bill. None of Australia's allies will be able to use the naval communication station which we are discussing. New Zealand will not be able to use it, although that country is allied with us in the ANZUS pact and in the South-East Asia Treaty Organization. None of the other Seato powers will be able to use it. None of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Kingdom itself will not be able to use this radio station. The United States of America will be able to use it, and Australia will be able to use it with the permission of the United States, although that country will have a veto over the use of the station by Australia. Nor, Sir, is this station needed for any of the purposes of Seato, or probably of ANZUS. If one assumes that China is the menace which the honourable member for Lyne says it is, then this station is not required to cope with China. The United States of America, with its present forces, can target any position in China. Insofar as it is necessary for strategic bombers of the United States or of Britain to use Australia, there is the Darwin air base. Insofar as it is necessary for the United States or Britain to use any radio station in Australia for their ships or aircraft, the Darwin radio station is adequate, and so are the radio stations in Canberra. The characteristics of this radio station are that it will allow America to use its",50,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
133,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [8.29],"Mrnuclear deterrent in those parts of the Soviet Union which it cannot reach yetthat is, those parts of the Soviet Union which cannot be reached from the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, or the Arctic. It will allow Polaris submarines to fire their missiles into central Russia in the area south of the Aral Sea, firing those missiles over west Pakistan and Afghanistan. Those are the characteristics which this station has and which no other installation in Australia, in the south seas or in the whole of the Pacific and Indian Oceans at present has. The station is not necessary to cope with China, because China does not have nuclear weapons yet, although it may have in the next year or so. Still less does China have a means of delivering nuclear weapons. Therefore, there is no prospect of nuclear weapons being used by China against the continental United States and thus obliging Australia to come to the assistance of the United States. It is only in the last fortnight that Governlight at the establishment of the station. ment members have admitted the facts and He is a queer fellow who can express delight features of this station.

Whoever could have inferred or deduced from the Prime Minister's statements of last May and this March that the station was essential for the effectiveness of America's nuclear deterrent, or that it would be used to make the retaliation to some nuclear attack by giving the signal "" Go "", to quote his phrases of last Thursday night? It is necessary to recall these omissions from the Prime Minister's earlier statements, because they show either that the Government did not know the facts of the station or would not impart them to the Parliament and the people. It was the Australian Labour Party which elicited and discussed the facts of the station and then determined and published its attitude towards the station. The Australian Labour Party accepts the station as a grim and awful necessity. We do not share the Prime Minister's deThe Labour Party wants alliances.

The Prime Minister is reported to have said at Port Pirie, ""The United States would need these facilities only in the event in the United States denoting suitability for of a great war "". His speech last Thursday night turned on the necessity for a prompt decision and an immediate signal to retaliate with nuclear weapons against some nuclear attack on the United States. In these circumstances there is no doubt as to what Australia's attitude and obligations would be. Under Article IV. of the ANZUS Treaty Australia recognizes that an armed attack on the continent of the United States would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the has given, consent to the relaying of signals through the station at North West Cape. trol can be applied even if the Government such a contingency there would be no room or need for dispute, delay or The Prime Minister, however, should Naval units, whether surface vessels such as carriers, or submerged vessels, submarines, action. The wireless station in North West Cape will give an added flexibility and efficiency to the massive naval forces . . . "" Flexibility"" is a technical strategic term limited as well as total war. "" Sole"" suggests that some of the submarines are thought of as detachable from the main force for limited use. It is this possibility of limited nuclear war in our area which makes joint control all the more necessary and, I suggest, just as possible now as it has been with all the other allies of the United States. No American nuclear weapon can be used without an express order by the President. To compensate for exposing her allies to additional risk through the establishment of nuclear bases and vehicles on their soil-base s which have cost the United States much more than this station will cost-the United States has been prepared to concede a joint decision and control to all her allies. Britain has been party to arrangements for joint decision in respect of bombers, missiles and submarines. Mr MacMillan described the original bomber agreement to the House of Commons on 12th July, 1960, in these wordsAs the House knows, an understanding was reached between the United Kingdom and United the House of Commons. Mr Watkinson, the States Governments in October, 1951, under Mr then Minister for Defence, gave a firm Attlee's premiership, under which the use in an assurance that Polaris missiles would not be emergency of bases in this country by United fired in any circumstances in United KingStates forces was accepted to be a matter for dom territorial waters; that British control joint decision between the two governments in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the within territorial waters was absolute, and time.

This arrangement is very close to the situation which can arise from the station at North West Cape, from which the United States might wish to send a signal which might incidentally involve Australia in a limited nuclear conflict. It was still possible in Britain, but not now possible in Australia, according to Government members. In November, 1960, the question of the Polaris base at Holy Loch and its submarines was twice raised in that the government was "" satisfied that these greatest degree of consultation with this country and our allies that the situation As regards all facilities in the territory, including the territorial waters of the United Kingdom, exists over United States bomber or missile bases in this country.

144,Mr Whitlam,"They are America's sage of What Mr Macmillan said about theItaly and Turkey concerning the Jupiter missiles also provide for joint decision, indeed, since it is technically possible to have it, for joint control through the "" double-key "" system. The Italo-American agreement differs in one particular from the AngloAmerican agreement concerning the Thor missiles. Where the latter requires only the approval of the British and American Governments for any decision to use the missiles or their warheads, the Italian agreement lays down that any such decision would need the approval of the Italian Government and of Nato Supreme Head-quarters. Last Saturday, the Melbourne "" Herald"" published an article which said that the vast Goose Bay air base for the American Strategic Air Command was under Canada's final say in respect of all movements and control at the base. This was a preDiefenbaker arrangement. It may be said that all this happened in 1958 or 1960. If, however, things have changed since then they have changed so as to make joint control more practicable. Early warning systems have improved and so also, we trust, have allied intelligence systems. If any further proof were required that joint control is practicable, let us come right to the present day. A meeting of Nato Ministers is opening in Ottawa tomorrow to finalize details for the establishment of a Nato nuclear force in Europe. Mr Trevor Smith reported from London in last night's Melbourne ""Herald"" that this Nato force wouldconsist of US. bombers and Polaris submarines, British B-bombers and British Polaris submarines beyond our Government's capacity? when they are built. He addedThe new force will come under the European Supreme Allied Commander. But the political control-the final word whether the buttons can be pressed-wil l remain with the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Britain. That is to say, the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Britain will have a power of veto or a joint decision on the use of the Nato force by the Nato Commander. What further confirmation does the Government need that joint control can still work without seriously limiting the effectiveness of the nuclear deterrent? Joint control is equally practicable with a missile communications station, for the control is political, not technical. Right through the piece the Government has been wallowing in ignorance and delusion. It is completely untroubled by facts or conscience. It has just not done its homework. I have heard interjectors from the Government side say, ""This is not a missile site ""; but the missile site-in this case a submerged Polaris submarine-is dependent on a signal from the station at North West Cape. Discussing the problem of joint control in relation to the Thor missiles in the United Kingdom, the Minister for Defence said that there would be special arrangements for ensuring rapid consultation about the joint decision, but he did not think the House would expect him to go into details. Although Mr Sandys would not go into detail it is fairly clear how joint control has been made to operate without limiting the capacity of the deterrent to deter. In the first place, various contingencies are set out and the reaction of each government is predetermined. This meets the problem of unprovoked Russian nuclear attack, which the Prime Minister says is the only way a nuclear war could come about. One contingency which an Australian government would clearly set out would be a Russian attack on the United States. The ANZUS alliance commits us in the event of such an attack to come to the help of the United States without delay and without dispute. It has not been beyond the capacity of the United States and her other allies to set out various contingencies and their reaction to them. Why should it be As the Polaris is a second-strike weapon and confined to highly specialized functions upon which allies may readily agree, we believe that the problems of joint control will be manageable. We do not underestimate them, but experience in other countries proves that the problems are manageable and solvable. When we come to building-up situations, such as the Cuban crisis last November, it is possible to apply joint control at the time. To achieve this, it would be necessary for Australia's representatives in Washington to be closely and continuously briefed on political and strategic developments and the likely United States response to them. This would be a decided advantage, not only in applying the principles of joint control, but also in remaining intimately informed of United States attitudes and policies. There is little doubt that the system of joint control could be worked out if the Australian Government had the will to do so. Why should our Government have failed when every other one of America's allies succeeded and America quite willingly accepted? The United States Government would appreciate our problem as it has appreciated such problems in respect of so many other countries. It would seem that joint control would have to be at the political level, as it certainly would not be feasible at the technical level, that is on the station. The White House, not the station, makes the decision. Joint political control has worked in Turkey, Italy and Canada and it should work in Australia. Joint decisions have always been the rule; Australia will be the first and sole exception. Joint control is not as difficult in practice as the Government might superficially, spuriously and speciously make it appear in theory. Allies have a community of interests and ideals and should be able to work out a mutually satisfactory arrangement. All that we assert is that there should be no annihilation without representation. Treasurer) [8.58] -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell), when opening the debate for the Opposition, said that this is a momentous debate. I think those of us who have heard what has fallen from Opposition speakers agree that this is undoubtedly the most important debate in the lifetime of this Parliament. We have seen, more starkly exposed than ever before, the state of mind of the alternative government of Australia on great questions touching the security of every man, woman and child in this country. On what has come from the Opposition we would wish the future of Australian government to be judged, and we would stand confidently by that verdict. I believe most Australians share my own view, and that of my colleagues, that once the United States authorities had demonstrated to the satisfaction of this Government that it would add to the defensive capacity of the forces of freedom in this part of the world to have a communications centre at North West Cape we willingly and freely entered into that arrangement. I am confident that the overwhelming majority of the Australian people support us in that decision. The need for the communication centre was explained convincingly by the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) when introducing the bill. That need was confirmed with graphic realism by the statement of the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) that pending disarmament on a grand scale the existence of the nuclear deterrent, the capacity to deliver the nuclear deterrent at the right time in the right place, is the condition by which we live. Do honourable gentlemen opposite disagree with that as a statement of fact? It may be an uncomfortable fact but it is part of the condition in which we live at this time. Mankind has lived through many terrors in the long history of the human race and mankind has had to learn to live with those terrors until an answer could be found to them. Over this generation hangs the terror of nuclear war and we have to learn to live with it and to find an answer to it. But while we are finding that answer does anything to-day stand more securely for our strength than does the nuclear capacity of the United States of America? It is to strengthen the effectiveness of that nuclear deterrent that the Australian Government has entered into this agreement. The Leader of the Opposition, in a speech that was more notable for its emotional fervour than for its logic, pleaded with us not to divide the Australian people on this issue. But the Australian people are not divided on this issue in the broad and general sense. It is rare to find, by every practical test that one can apply, a community so united on a great issue of this kind. When it suits their book honourable gentlement opposite like to quote the results of gallup polls taken from time to time. What was the result in the most recent gallup poll taken on this issue, in May of this year? At that time, 80 per cent, of the people said that they favoured the establishment of this base, 11 per cent. a very small percentage in terms of a demonstration of voting strength on a matter of this kind-sai d that they were against it, and 9 per cent, said that they",56,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
145,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"were undecided. If honourable gentlemen opposite had to enter a political contest on those terms they know that they would be annihilated. Yet they say to us, ""Do not divide the Australian people "". But on an issue in relation to which the Australian people are so overwhelmingly behind their Government they then set out themselves to divide the Australian people. Honourable gentlemen opposite will not accept the clear facts which have been demonstrated, not merely by a test of public opinion of that kind but also by the observation and experience of all of us in this place. These experienced politicians, knowing all that and being fully aware of the state of public opinion but too timid to resist the pressures directed against them as a result of their narrow conference majority, against the weight of their own political judgment continue striving in this floundering fashion on an issue of such consequence to Australia. Most Australians have recognized the vital importance for Australia's security of the strength and efficiency of the American fighting services. They know that if the United States is to be able to assure the security of free peoples in this part of the world, it must be strong and capable of matching any potential aggressor. The point has been made by some honourable members that we are discussing a communication centre and not a military base. For my part, if the United States had required a military base in this remote and sparsely settled area of Australia as being necessary to discharge effectively its obligaLabour Party-le t no one have any doubt tion under the ANZUS or Seato pacts and its determination to preserve the freedom of the world then I , together with the great their fault if it does not-woul d frustrate majority of my fellow Australians, would have concurred in America's establishing a military base at the location in question. When I say that my mind goes back to the time not so long ago-certainl y within the recollection of some of us in this Parliament -whe n an American proposal was made to the then Australian Government to establish a great defensive base to the north of this country on one of the islands within Australia's administration. government of the day rejected that proposal. I have always felt that it did a great disservice to Australia and that it weakened our defensive capacity. It is obvious from what we have heard from honourable members opposite during this debate that had the proposal to establish the communication station been submitted to a government made up of the present Opposition it also would have been rejected, just as the earlier proposal was rejected by a previous Labour government. It is my purpose, in the time available to me in this debate, to strip from this issue the camouflage which has been constructed so clumsily around it by the Australian Labour Party. It is my purpose to try to sweep away the cobwebs from the musty arguments which have been advanced by the Labour Party to justify its attitude to the bill. The most charitable interpretation to put on the propositions which have come from the leader of the party and other senior spokesmen is that they are trying to reconcile the irreconcilable. The merest analysis shows that their arguments lack logic, reality and good sense. They are obviously trying to mask the deep divisions which led the federal conference of the party to a 19-17 vote and to issue its humiliating directive to them, and which left 27 votes in the caucus opposed to the establishment of this centre. What is the object of the manoeuvres on which the Labour Party has embarked? Having regard to the tactics adopted by the Leader of the Opposition and his party, if this bill is passed by the Parliament it will be passed without the help of the Australian Labour Party. The Federal Parliamentary about this-ha s committed itself to a course which if it proved successful-it will not be this project. If we can accept the gallup poll as a fair guide and as a means by which the people express their opinion, at least 80 per cent, of the Australian people have indicated that they support the establishment of the proposed centre. But the project would be frustrated if the course on which the Labour Party has embarked were followed through to success. how. Members of the Labour Party have deliberately and with set purpose created a",58,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
146,The Labour Mr Bryant,Tel l us how.,59,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
147,Mr Harold Holt,"I will tell yousituation which could halt the project at this stage. The Parliamentary Labour Party has put the project in peril in two ways. First, there is its declaration that if it came into office it would set out to re-negotiate the agreement. Here is a party, as matters stand in this place, within one vote of government. If the United States authorities were to view the Labour Party's declaration seriously they might say very understandably that they would not go ahead with the project while there was so much uncertainty about it and while they were faced with conditions which were unacceptable to them. Honourable gentlemen opposite say that they do not accept the present conditions. Do they choose to persist with that argument in the light of what we have heard from the Minister for External Affairs to date? They have put this project in peril by pressing for conditions and by claiming that they will re-negotiate the agreement. Indeed by forcing a vote in this House they seek to secure a situation in which a renegotiation of conditions would emerge with the risk that those conditions would halt this project. Secondly, the Labour PartyI want the House to note what a senior spokesman for that party said on this matter-ha s put it on record that it will divide the chamber several times in the course of the consideration of this legislation, each time on a vote that will be vital in its effect. That statement was made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) who was chosen quite deliberately as the senior spokesman of the party to follow the Prime Minister at a time when it was hoped there would be the largest listening audience for the Labour point of view. I quote directly from what he said, as reported at page 1524 of ""Hansard""The Labour Party, as its leader has announced, will divide the chamber several times in the course of this measure, each time on a vote that will be vital in its effect. The Leader of the Opposition threw the gauntlet down this afternoon. He stated in the plainest terms where the Labour Party stands on this issue. That is the honourable member for Eden Monaro speaking with the full authority of the Labour Party. A few moments later he saidThe Leader of the Opposition has stated the various votes that the Opposition will call on this measure. Each of them will be vital in its effect on this legislation. One of those votes will be on the Labour Party's proposal at the third-reading stage that this bill should be postponed for six months. I wonder whether all members of the caucus were made aware of the full significance of that move. Were they aware that it is the traditional parliamentary method adopted to kill a bill? It disposes of a bill even more effectively than does downright rejection. This practice is traditional in the House of Commons, the mother of parliaments. It has been adopted by this Parliament and it is specifically mentioned in our own Standing Order No. 237. So, in moving to defer this bill for six months, the Opposition will be seeking to reject the bill altogether. Did all honourable gentlemen opposite appreciate that when the recommendation was made to them? Did they know that the purpose of that manoeuvre was to kill this project outright? When the Labour Party decided on these tactics it knew that if it mustered its full strength it would require only one voteor as matters stand, two votes-fro m this side of the House to have the numbers to defeat the bill. The Parliamentary Labour Party knows that it had 27 members opposed to the course it finally adopted. It knows that we do not apply the same caucus compulsion to our members as to how they shall vote. The Labour Party will not get the extra votes that it needs; but it was prepared to risk that possibility and with it to accept fhe defeat of the bill. This is the stage that the Australian Labour Party has reached along the sorry road travelled since the narrow majority of the federal conference gave its humiliating directive to the elected representatives in this Parliament. Those who wish to see the proposal defeated have succeeded in bringing their party to a point where any defection from the Government side could produce that result for them. Fortunately for Australia, Sir, there is the unity in the Government ranks to hold the decision where most Australians would wish it to remain. Either the Labour Party leaders were so confident of the strength and unity of support in the Government ranks that they could take this course without risk to the project, or they bave done so-som e recklessly, little caring whether the project goes forward or not; others acting in downright opposition to it. This, Mr Speaker, is the undisciplined, divided rabble that offers itself to the people of Australia at this time as the alternative government. Let us look at the argument on sovereignty. Any one listening to Australian Labour Party spokesmen in this debate must have been struck by the old fashioned, out-moded quality of their thinkfirst obtain his instructions from a federal ing. That clearly appears on the issue of sovereignty. There are many situations in the world of to-day in which governments, deliberately and voluntarily, have placed some restriction on the freedom of action of their own countries in order to benefit from similar self-imposed restraints or other an earlier political figure who had his probobligations assumed in relation to them hy other countries. That is a commonplace feature of the modern world. We have seen examples of it in this Parliament in the arangements that we have made under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the International Monetary Fund and the obligations under the ANZUS pact and the Seato treaty. Action or that kind is not a surrender of sovereignty. Indeed, it is an exercise of sovereignty to secure compensating advantages meriting the selfimposed restraint. The Opposition's argument in relation to this communication centre exposes again its lack of realism. When it comes to the United Nations-a n organization which we all hope to see strengthened over the years -thi s question of sovereignty is never raised by honourable gentlemen opposite. Does any one to-day regard the United Nations as a substitute for the strength and security that we can get from our powerful ally, the United States? I now come to the argument on joint conand thorough consultation, with full control. Direct consultation between heads of government, as honourable gentlemen opposite must know, would be virtually impossible in the minutes that would elapse for retaliation in the event of nuclear attack. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) has talked about the position of the President of the United States as though he were a political head for this purpose. The President of the we? United States, for this purpose, is the commander-in-chief of the forces of the United gentleman would seize on a word. There States. He stands in a very different relahas never been anything of the humiliating tionship. Mr Macmillan dealt with this kind that the honourable gentleman tries to aspect convincingly in the House of Commons as recently as 1960, in the statement quoted by the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser). On the showing of the leader of the Australian Labour Party, no Labour leader would have the authority to make a speedy decision on a matter of this sort. He must conference of 36 people scattered throughout the Commonwealth. He would need more than twenty minutes to do that. The Leader of the Opposition needed more than twenty minutes in a Canberra hotel corridor to get his instructions on this issue. I recall lems of leadership. He is recorded as saying: "" There go my people. I must follow them, for I am their leader."" The leader of the Australian Labour Party cannot claim even that inglorious degree of participation in the policy-making of his party. On his recent showing that has been made clear to the Australian people. On the question of consultation and control the Leader of the Opposition has fallen into a pit of his own making. He has argued throughout that the United Stales would willingly reach agreement on a basis of joint control. The revelation earlier to-day by the Minister for External Affairs confirms that sole control was sought at all times by the United States and firmly required as a condition of the agreement. This Government gave a realistic recognition to that necessity. We are assured of consultation. We have that assurance in the terms of the ANZUS pact. We have it in the express language of this agreement. We know from past experience that in a period of crisis there would be the most complete sideration being given to Australia's views. We can take some pride in the fact that during the life of this Government this small country-smal l in terms of population-ha s been given such a ready audience and access by the Government of the United States and that our views",59,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
148,Mr Bryant,"We have audiences now, do",61,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963
149,Mr Harold Holt,"The honorableinfer. In our relations with the leading figures of the United States our Prime Minister talks on a basis of equality. He is listened to as few other men in the public life of the world are listened to when he talks to the President of the United States. That access is not confined to him. Other Ministers of this Government have been given the same receptive hearing by the President and the senior spokesmen for that country. We have no doubt that whatever we have to say in any situation of crisis will be listened to and given every consideration. Now let us take this fantastic argument about obsolescence. The Leader of the Opposition put forward the argument that this communications centre is likely to become obsolete quite quickly. We also heard from the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant), the spokesman for the Labour Party on these great issues of defence. When we debate the Defence Estimates, he is put up by the Labour Party to express its attitude on defence matters. He questioned the strategy of this development, and for good measure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition threw in his contribution. He was by no means persuaded that there were not more modern ways of going about this business. Here are these lay political figures, ill-informed, pitting their judgment against the technical judgment of the highest figures in the fighting services of the United States and men in those services who are prepared to back that technical judgment with some £33,000,000 of expenditure on this communications centre. They apparently think that the expenditure is likely to produce something of value for them in its contribution to defence. What is obsolete in this situation, of course, is the thinking of the Australian Labour Party. It could do with a thorough spring cleaning of its ideas. It should jettison all the doctrinaire rubbish and class-war junk that it has been harboring in its mental attic since the 'thirties. Then we have the argument about the 25 years. Labour members, including the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Eden-MonaroI single them out as two of their most senior spokesmen on these matters-hav e argued that a life of 25 years for the agreement is too long. They point to changes in allegiance that have occurred around the world in our lifetime. They point to the fact that at one time we fought alongside Russia and at another time we have been hostile to fhe views of the Russian people; that the Japanese at one time were fighting against us and now are collaborating with us in areas of trade, foreign policy and so on. The clear implication of what they are putting is that it would be dangerous and foolish for this country to tie itself into a defensive and security arrangement with the United States for a period as long as 25 years. Mr Speaker, this argument reveals the mental attitudes of honourable gentlemen opposite. Because it is so revealing, I find it deeply disturbing. Honourable gentlemen opposite ignore the special relationship that exists between Australia and the United States of Americaa special, intimate relationship. Do they deny that there is a special and intimate relationship in this part of the world between Australia and the United States? They put it in the same category as our relations with the other countries to which I have referred. They ignore the special significance to Australia and Australia's security of this relationship which must continue to exist between this country and the United States if we are to remain secure. Without our alliance with the United States, we would be vulnerable indeed, despite the most energetic and costly efforts that we might make to strengthen ourselves. But even more importantly, this argument ignores the fundamental character of the great international struggle of our times. In the ideological conflict between the forces of freedom and the forces of communism, we stand with the United States on the side of freedom. It is unthinkable to us, as it is to all but very few Australiansapparently in that few are the members of the Parliamentary Labour Party-that we should ever find ourselves anywhere else but standing with the United States on the side of freedom. Australia has no choice of neutrality in the world of to-day. We long for permanent peace in a world which has by general agreement, faithfully observed, reduced its armaments and resolved against the nuclear weapon. But in the absence of those conditions, just as the nuclear deterrent is the condition by which we live, so the strength and support of the United States are the conditions of our survival. By comparison with the contributions of our great ally, we have not so very much to give, with our limited population, our limited resources and our great compulsions of development and population growth. By providing a place on our soil for this centre a centre for communications directed to our mutual security-w e can make a contribution of some continuing value, recognizing that we do so willingly and freely, and confident that this friendly alliance will long endure. In that belief we are equally confident we have behind us the great majority of the Australian people. Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) commenced his address by stating that this was a most important debate. No one will disagree with that; but it would have been an infinitely more important debate if it had preceded the completion of the agreement. What the Parliament is now asked to discuss is an agreement that has already been entered into by this Government and the Government of the United States of America. The Treasurer referred to the results of gallup polls. He talked about a gallup poll showing that 80 per cent, of the people supported the agreement. If the Government and the Treasurer really believed that, this would be the opportune time for them to test the matter before the Australian people. I well recollect an occasion in 1951 when a gallup poll showed that the great majority of the Australian people supported the action of the Government. However, when the matter was stated to the people and they began to realize the enormity of what the Government intended to do, the majority of the people showed at a referendum that they were opposed to the action. The Treasurer said that Labour's policy relevant period. He wrote to the editor of is determined by the federal conference of the Melbourne "" Herald"", and these are 36 men. Who determines the Governthe terms of his letter, which is rather ment's policy? The Government admits shortthat the back bench members have not had Dear Sir, any say at all in the matter. Probably Cabinet has not had a great deal to say about it, because Mr Gullett, a former post-war years I personally met and discussed Whip of the Government parties in this in chamber not so very long ago, said that the that the reason wby bis Government withdrew Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) had been responsible for foisting second-raters on the Australian community. The present Cabinet of second-raters no doubt nominally determined the decision on this matter. However, everybody knows how the Prime Minister dictates to and dominates the Cabinet. This decision was almost certainly, in fact, made by one man alone. BeforeI deal with the situation generally, let me refer to one or two of the remarks of honourable members opposite. Of course, when the Treasurer talks about the federal conference of 36, he is joined by other Libera] members in suggesting that some of the 36 federal conference Labour members are either Communists or are under Communist influence. Government supporters -Hear, hearl for it. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) mentioned eight Labour conference members from Victoria and Queensland whom he claimed were either Communists or were under Communist influence. He did not mention them by name. But I challenge the honourable member for Mackellar to name outside this Parliament the eight members of the federal conference whom he believes are either Communists or under Communist influence. The Treasurer, in trying to bolster up the case alleging the great performance of the Government parties in defence, referred to an incident shortly after the termination of the last war when, according to the Government, the Labour Government of the day refused the Americans the opportunity to continue with the base at Manus Island. Nothing is further from the truth. The Americans themselves withdrew from the negotiations. I have with me a copy of a letter written by Mr John J. Dedman, a former member of this Parliament who was Minister for Defence at the As Commonweallh Minister for Defence in the this question with the then Minister for Defence United States of America. He informed me",61,United States Naval Communication Station Nant To This Government This Matter Has Agreement Bill 1963

While I am on the subject of the Government's war record, let me remind honourable members that the other day the Prime Minister again challenged me with regard to the allegation I made shortly after the Labour Government took office, regarding a plan of strategy prepared by the preceding government-whic h was of the same calibre as this Government-to abandon large sections of Australian territory without firing a shot. When I first made the allegation, the Prime Minister said it was a figment of my imagination. Let us examine whether it was or not. In October, 1941, the Labour Government, came to office. It is perfectly true that we did not take over from the Menzies Government; we took over from the Fadden Government because Mr Menzies had already resigned; he had run out on his own government. The supporters of his own government had sacked him; they had dismissed him because of his incompetence and because of his unpopularity. The Fadden Government then collapsed, and we took office. It is perfectly true, as the Prime Minister said, that Japan had not then entered the war. Japan entered the war later in the year, and in March, 1942, General MacArthur arrived in this country. Now let me give the House one or two facts to ponder over before honourable members opposite attempt to dismiss this to fight even a defensive war. Up to this time as a figment of my imagination. The honorit was planned to sacrifice the great western and able member for Lyne( Mr Lucock) spoke northern regions of the Australian continent. about a statement made by the late Mr Plans John Curtin shortly after we took office in which Mr Curtin referred to the high state He mentioned the Brisbane line, although of efficiency of the defences of this country. this Government still denies that such a I was a member of that Labour Governstrategic plan ever existed. Let me now ment, as was my colleague, the honourable answer the Prime Minister who said that, member for Bonython( Mr Makin). We at the time his Government left office Japan know what the situation was then. We also had not entered the war. Anybody would know why the late Mr John Curtin made imagine that it was a surprise to the Prime that statement, as does every member of the Minister that Japan came into the war. Did present Government. He made it because he not anticipate that Japan would enter this country had been left defenceless. With the war and, if he thought that Japan would the Japanese threatening us to the north, be our enemy, what plans did he prepare he had to bluff and pretend that our to defend this country? Honourable members opposite say that the defences of this country were then in a good state of preparedness. Will any member of the Government deny that in May, 1941, just before we came to office, there was a secret meeting of the Parliament? Do they not remember that the then Minister for the Army, Mr Spender, a member of the Liberal Party, sought a secret meeting of the Parliament because he could not tell honourable members in open sitting the exact state of the defences of this country? The then Minister for the Army stated in this Parliament that if one armoured division of Japanese troops landed on Australian shores at that time it could overrun the whole of the Australian territory. That was said during the secret meeting of the Parliament. So much for the preparedness of the anti-Labour government of that time to defend Australia. I mentioned earlier that General MacArthur arrived in Australia on 17th March, 1942. If any honourable member wishes to ascertain the state of affairs in Australia at that time, let him get from the Library a book entitled ""MacArthur, 1941-1951 "". The co-author of this book is none other than Major-General Willoughby, who was a prominent member of General Douglas MacArthur's staff. I shall quote a few short extracts from the book to illustrate the state of the defences of this country at that time. Major-General Willoughby saidAustralia had practically nothing with which were completed to abandon New Guinea and to scorch the earth above the Brisbane line. Now let me quote an extract from a submission made to the War Cabinet at the time. On 10th June, 1941, the then Prime Minister made a submission to the War Cabinet directing attention to the view expressed by the Chiefs of Staff on the probable entry of Japan into tbe war and the need for a plan to meet a threatened Japanese invasion. AllI say to the Prime Minister is that if his Government had not prepared a strategic plan to abandon all of the territory north of the Brisbane line, let him tell this country what plan his Government did prepare to defend Australia. The Brisbane line strategy was its plana plan that it is not prepared to accept to-day or to admit ever existed. I turn now to one or two other matters. This proposal is an important one for the Australian people. It is fraught with great dangers. Any person who has listened to this debate must recognize that fact. What kind of base is proposed? The Prime Minister lacked candour throughout the whole of the negotiations. He is reported in the Brisbane"" Courier-Mail"" of 24th April of this year as having saidThe United States Navy Signal Station at North they agree over the re-arming of Japan? West Cape would not be a fire control tower for a Polaris missile in a submarine but only a communication centre to pass messages from the United States. That is a distinction without a difference. What messages would the Polaris submarines be receiving in a time of war? Of course the station would be used for the purpose of giving orders to fire these to re-arm Japan-that was lying-and Labour missiles. It may be argued by honourable knew it. members opposite that technically this is not a military base. But it is a base to tion be used for military purposes and, from the viewpoint of the Australian people, Because they did not agree, the Prime Miniswhat is the difference? Tbe same argument ter played the role that he frequently plays applies to sovereignty. We hear the lawyers -that of the Charlie McCarthy doll for argue as to what constitutes sovereignty, overseas interests. He bowed the knee to whether it is important that Australia them. In such clashes, the Prime Minister should acquire the land and lease it to the has always capitulated. Other national United States of America, whether the title leaders have not surrendered in the same ought to be retained by Australia, and way as the Prime Minister of this country whether we ought to have the right to fly has done. our flag alongside the flag of the United States of America. But what is the bourne "" Herald"" published an article relatimportant thing? From the viewpoint of ing to the air base at Goose Bay in Labrador. the security of this country, the important It referred to the activities of the United thing-and it is the only matter of sovereignty that counts with me-is who will control the base and whether the Americans are to have sole control of it. The Labour Party asks for joint control because it is fearful that sole control presents a threat of Australia's involvement in war. It is the Labour Party's opinion that there ought to be prior consultation before and not after an act of war. I believe that with sole control, once war is declared by one of the parties to the agreement the other will be automatically and inevitably involved. Of course, the Labour Party wants to retain an alliance with the United States of America. We want to retain friendship with every nation of the world. We are not anxious to go to war with any of them. But who will deny that occasions have arisen in the past when there has been a divergence of opinion between Australia and the United States of America on questions of policy, and who will deny that differences may again arise in the future on matters of policy? Are the Americans favorable to Australia's restricted immigration policy? Did Australia and tbe United States of America see eye to eye in connection with the dispute over West New Guinea? DidI want to quote what was said by the Prime Minister himself about the re-arming of Japan. We were charging him at the time with favouring the re-arming of Japan, and he denied it. His remarks were reported in the press in these termsAs for the charge that the Government wanted Australia had consistently expressed its opposito Japanese re-armament but the USA. and the United Kingdom didn't agree. As recently as 17th May last, the MelStates Strategic Air Command, and mentioned the great number of planes continuously coming and going.

The United States made by none other than the present Prime Congress insists that it make the decision, Minister of this country in this House on and when the time comes the Congress may 20th March, 1946. Let me give the House a further quotation to show that there are others who recognize the possibility that other policy differences may arise between the United States of America and Australia. Does any honourable member opposite suggest that the "" Anglican"" is under Communist influence? On 28th February of this year, in a leading article, that journal statedThere are strong grounds for believing that the monly known as the Seato Agreement. United States Government has made two things Are honourable gentlemen opposite, when clear to our own Government That is this GovernmentFirst, that Australia will receive no help whatit only to the resisting of Communist ever from the United States when the Dictator aggression?

State department publicly but "" unofficially *' effect that its commitment under paragraph informed the Australian Press that however 1 of Article IV. applied only to Communist "" embarrassed "" the United States might be in the event of an Indonesian attack on East New Guinea, public opinion in our great and powerful ally would not favour supporting Australia. I want to know what aid the proposed naval station will be to Australia's defence. That is the important thing from our viewwhich the invasion comes. All that the The United States Congress, which will accompli upon which it will be asked to record its judgment, as we are asked to do be of an entirely different opinion from that now held and have an entirely different outlook. Whether we get the aid that we are told will be forthcoming and which we sincerely hope will be available to us in the event of a threat of invasion will depend on the attitude of the United States Congress at the time. Let mc turn now to the South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty, which is comthey mention that agreement, aware of the fact that the Americans are committed by Foster Dulles, a former United States aggression. An Indonesian attack on Australia might be regarded as not being Communist aggression, and assistance from the United States might not be forthcoming to us. It is true that certain trouble spots were to be outside the assigned area under the Seato Agreement. The agreement does not apply to Formosa or to Hong Kong. Mr House, on 15th May of last year, when he Casey, as he then was, who was at the time the Australian Minister for External Affairs, regarded this as a wise provision, for he saidThe Australian Government considers that this limitation of the Treaty area is wise and prudent. weapons by the Soviet, the United States might I , too, think it was wise and prudent. In what circumstances will the proposed communications base be used? Everybody knows that the United StatesI fully support its attitude in this respect-ha s declared that its policy is based on what is known as the second-strike strategy. It has declared that it will not fire the first nuclear missile. The United States will, so it is said, use nuclear missiles only in the event of a nuclear war occurring as a result of some enemy first firing a nuclear missile at the United States. But even adherence to this attitude is not unanimous in that country. Admiral Radford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the United States, was reported in the Sydney press as having said, in an address to the United States Congress, words to this effectAmerica would use atomic weapons to win a war without regard to objections from Allies who feared a Russian atomic attack. Mr Quarles, United States Secretary for nation, they should risk annihilation for the Air Force was reported as having said82,000,000 of their people and injury for The US. is prepared to use nuclear weapons to another 24,000,000. I say that that would win a little as well as a world war. If honourable members read the memoirs of in the interests of their own country. Lord Avon, who was Sir Anthony Eden, they will find revealed the fact that only the opposition of Churchill and Eden prevented explosive weapon so powerful that, theoretiJohn Foster Dulles's plan for intervention cally at least, it has no limit and could in the Indo-China conflict by atomic destroy the earth itself. Therefore I ask: weapons. Therefore, we have to ask ourWhose should be the obligation to decide selves: Is this a consistent policy on the tvhat use will be made of this base? I part of the United States of America? believe that the least that the Australian Would the United States risk an attack on Government should have asked for was its own territory with nuclear weapons to to share in the responsibility, so that this defend Australia against invasion? I think country would feel some measure of that the Americans would hesitate to do so. security, as little as it might be-som e I do not blame the American leaders for certainty that this base would not be used this. Their duty is to defend and repreto the detriment of the Australian sent the interests of their own country and community. their own people. But I do condemn the Australian leaders, who are not as mindful and as careful as the requirements of the Australian community demand. The honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) can see the danger. In this was explaining France's reasons for wanting to develop its own nuclear weapons, he saidThe French had the fear that any country might have that if they were attacked with nuclear not be willing to risk a counter attack on their cities by coming to the aid of the French with American nuclear weapons. France is a Nato ally of the United States. I admit that such a decision would be a dreadful one for the leaders of any country to have to make. Of course, we know that there is no defence against nuclear attack for the civil community. Mr Duncan Sandys said once that there can be no defence for the civil population against nuclear weapons. Mr Charles Shafer, a United States civil defence expert, said in evidence to the United States Congressional Atomic Energy CommissionAn all-out enemy attack with no evacuation would result in 82 million dead and 24 million injured. The decision that the Americans, through their leaders, would have to make would be whether, by adhering to some agreement which they had entered into with another be a dreadful decision for them to have to make. In my opinion, they would decide The H-bomb, as it is now termed, is an I wish lo refer to one other aspect before I conclude. I think the decision made by the Government is wrong. I think it is going to do a great deal of harm to Australia. To the north of us are many millions of people with whom Australia is trying to build up a friendly relationship. Has any thought been given by the Government to the probable reaction of these people to the establishment of this station? There is no doubt in the world that many of them will regard it with great suspicion. They will consider it probably as some move to take up offensive action against them. I think that all of these mattters should have been discussed, but this debate has been curtailed. There are members of this Parliament who want to express a point of view but who will be denied an opportunity tc do so in this debate. They will not be given an opportunity because the Government has decided that the debate must end this evening. Why must it end this evening? Why does not the Government continue the debate and allow the Parliament to sit longer, if it is necessary, so that every aspect can be covered and every member of this Parliament can express an opinion? Is this the last request we are to receive for the establishment of a foreign base on Australian soil? It may be only the first. If other requests are received, does the Government believe that, having committed itself with respect to one base, it is committed to agree to others? I think that is a most serious thing for the Australian community and that the Australian community ought to be consulted about it. I believe further that the Government, if it is so confident that it has the bulk of the Australian people with it, ought to test their opinion. Let me finally say that the Australian believe in Australian democracy we ought Labour Party is a peace-loving party. We to believe that those decisions should be want to live at peace with the nations of made here by our own elected representathe world. We want to retain our alliance tives. If we did not believe in that, if we with the great American nation and we believed in sacrificing our independence, want to remain ut peace with other nations if we believed that we ought to be the as well. I think it would be a mistake satellite of another country, obviously we for Australia to commit itself in advance, would support the Government. 1 believe as the Prime Minister attempts to do, to that the Australian community is a freedomtake the side of America on every occasion. loving community. The Australian people President Kennedy will not always be Presiwant a Labour government. I am fearful dent of the United States of America. As of this Government, particularly under a matter of fact, in a few years he will the leadership of the present Prime Minister, cease to be the President. Suppose the next President were Mr Nixon, who wanted a hit-and-run policy on Cuba. We can look at all the corrupt administrations that, in error, the Americans have backed throughout the world. They backed the rotten and corrupt administration of Syngman Rhee in South Korea. They backed President Ngo Dinh Diem of Viet Nam and Chiang Kai-shek in Formosa. In supporting these regimes the Americans may have had tbe best motives in the world, but tbey certainly made some bad decisions. We ought not to put ourselves in the foolish position of saying that whatever decision they make, no matter who is in charge in the United States, we are with them. This agreement is for 25 years, and in that time there will be six different Presidents in the United States of America. It could even be that there will be a President who is regarded as tending to the left in politics. Would this Government then believe that in any conflict in which a nation so led became involved we would inevitably and automatically be involved alongside that nation? I believe that each issue as it arises has to be determined by the Parliament of this country and has to be judged by our people. We have to ensure that we retain and defend our freedom of action and our right to make our own decisions. Therefore, I believe that, if given the opportunity, the great majority of the Australian people would determine that the Australian Labour Party was correct in saying that the sole right to operate this base should not be given to a power which is not responsible to this Parliament. Whatever decisions are made affecting war or peace or affecting the security of our people, if we and I hope that it will not long remain in office. order, Mr Deputy Speaker.

I simply draw attention to this matter. Deputy Speaker, let me say that I was premost of which were highly irrelevant to the sent at this secret session. In passing, I say debate. The one serious charge he made that it was farcical, but I can confirm that was that this agreement was an accomeverything the honourable member for East plished fact and that nothing that might Sydney said to-night about what was said happen in this House could alter that situaat that time by the then Minister for tion.

Looking at this matter a little more a myth. An essential part of the case of seriously, I suggest that we should consider the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was one or two comments made by the Deputy built up on a false basis. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) during his speech. He said that it was only because of Labour's efforts that the facts casting naval signals station with nuclear concerning the North West Cape naval sigweapons. If this station does play any part, nalling station had been brought out and or is designed to play any part, in the firing publicised. It is true, unfortunately, that of Polaris missiles, those missiles will be a great many members of the Labour Party a very long way from Australia. They will take so little interest in defence matters not be fired from Australian soil. There that they probably did not realize the is no real parallel between what will be a significance of everything involved, but naval message transmitting station and a certainly a number of honourable members big and powerful nuclear base with guided opposite did. It is quite probable, and it seems missiles and a whole nuclear armament. very likely, that Russian intelligence got wind of what was planned some considerable time ago. It is also obvious that many Opposition's proposition is that in the moves would have to be made by America ordinary transmission of messages from the and Australia when the negotiations had President of the United States, or from the reached various stages of maturity, long defence head-quarters of that country, to before anything firm had been decided upon. American naval forces the Australian But even in those early stages there is no Government would have the right to hop doubt that the Communist Party was alert in and stop such transmission at a critical to what was proposed, and if you consider moment. Once the station is opened, the the authors of early questions in this House passage of messages will be a continuous on the subject you can be pretty certain that process, and apparently what the Opposithose gentlemen knew all about it, even tion would want to do would be to say though their right-wing colleagues were still "" no "" if a particular signal was sought to fast asleep. But the most serious feature of the transmitted after a nuclear attack on the speech of the Deputy Leader of the OpposiUnited States, the Australian Government, tion was its gross dishonesty concerning the if the Labour Party was in office, would noon. He documented case after case and showed that no such joint control existed. control is that of the Thor missiles in defences, and in the case of the Thor misas far as nuclear weapons are concerned, is We should not confuse a relay broadAnother effect of the adoption of the be transmitted in an emergency. In other words, in the event of a message being have the right to stop the transmission of that message until the Government had blown the whistle, summoned the 36 and asked them whether the message should be permitted to pass. This would be a hopeless position. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition skated around it by talking about pre-determination. Can you imagine what hope the Deputy Leader of the Opposition or any Labour Prime Minister or potential Prime Minister would have of pre-conditioning the 36 and achieving predetermination? The truest words in this debate were spoken by the honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser), who said that this issue deeply divides the two sides of this House. Also, of course, it deeply divides the Labour Party. It is a sad thing for Australia that it does, and it is a sad thing for the good, stalwart, patriotic memof his party a spurious appearance of bers of the Labour Party that it does. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) has, of course, been placed in an almost intolerfor the second reading of the bill"" but he able position by this state of affairs. We would probably not be wrong in assuming that if left to himself the Leader of the Opposition would like to see this station established, and established on the only terms on which it would be a practical proOpposition-as the Treasurer ( Mr Harold position. That is his desire, but no doubt inspired by Communist and other extreme left-wing sources there has been strong opposition in the Labour Party to this measure. It came forward, first, in its most dangerous form in a resolution from Western Australia. The unfortunate and embarrassed Leader of the Opposition began by appealing to the federal executive but apparently it was opposed to the station, though he did succeed, at that stage, in putting a ban on Labour members talking about the matter until the 36 faceless men of the conference had made their decision. The serious part about this is that when he appealed to those men who constitute the governing force of the Labour Party-the 36 men-as the honourable member Wentworth) has said fifteen of the 36 were opposed to having this signal station on any dom. A lot of that research has been in terms at all. The Leader of the Opposition finally reached a stage when they would only just agree to a course of action which would render the building of the signals station impossible but without appearing to do so. For obvious reasons, mentioned by the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) and the honourable member for Mackellar, the Opposition in the conference is a great deal stronger than it is amongst the members of the Labour Party in this House. At least we can see that when members of the Parliamentary Labour Party meet in Canberra the majority of them in favour of the establishment of the station is much greater than in the conference. Let us now consider the unfortunate position in which the Leader of the Opposition finds himself in this curious exercise of trying to run God and Satan in harness at the same time and keep a firm front. We can sympathize with him in the course to which he has resorted. He has succeeded temporarily in giving to members unity. He appeals to the public by saying, in effect, "" Wc will not oppose the motion then seeks to placate a section of the party by indicating his intention to propose an amendment to the motion for the third reading which would kill the bill. It is curious that the Leader of the Holt has already pointed out-shoul d refer to the radio installation as becoming obsolescent, this view apparently being based on an odd word he had with Sir John Cockcroft. The Leader of the Opposition said that the station is going to be out of date and obsolescent in about two to five years because by that time Telstar will take the place of this kind of station. He reasons in this way: The station will take almost two years to build, so that it will be out of date by the time it is built and there will be no need for it. This is a very curious attitude, because apparently the United States Navy is very ill-informed on this subject. It is not very long since I read that the United States Navy spends more per annum on scientific research than for Mackellar ( Mr is spent on all branches of scientific research in the whole of the United Kingthe field of communications and has shown notable results. Had the Leader of the Opposition really been anxious to consider whether this station would become out of date he might have considered another development. I refer to satellites, circling the earth, from which nuclear warheads can be launched. That technique has already proceeded some way and part of it was used the other day by the Soviet in its latest moon shot. The military implications of that were clearly noted. One of the great interests of the United States and Soviet service authorities in space is this very development. The time is probably not far distant when satellites circling the earth will be able to pinpoint any position on it and discharge nuclear warheads at it. This is a very inconvenient development for the Leader of the Opposition and it is just around the corner. It so happens that the force of gravity is such that satellites pass as freely over southern skies as they do over northern skies. Perhaps the Labour Party has some hitherto secret method by which the force of gravity can be so amended that that will not be so. But the world will certainly wait with great interest the unfolding of this great discovery. The Leader of the Opposition and other members opposite have drawn red herrings across the path. A powerful section of the Opposition really is opposed to the station but the Opposition realizes, nevertheless, that the people of Australia do want it. Honourable members opposite have therefore sought refuge in drawing red herrings across the trail. One of them is that Australia should retain the right in moments of crisis, when perhaps this communications station is needed for instant nuclear retaliation, for the Government to hold up proceedings until it has made up its mind whether a crucial message should be passed on. Another story told by honourable members opposite was about the secret agreement, but that was blown out to-day and I will not go on with it. Another and more important aspect of this question is a much more likely situation than a nuclear warthe ordinary and more conventional type of warfare. Provided the deterrent is kept effective on both sides we have virtually a nuclear stalemate and it is in these conditions that the proposed station may perhaps be even more significant Although the United States N2vy has Polaris submarines, they are only a very small proportion of the total number of submarines operating on either the Russian side or the American side. Nowadays sea power is exercised primarily by large aircraft carriers and submarines. They are the two major weapons to-day, around which are many ancilliary craft. In our area we depend in the end, in a nonnuclear war, on American sea power and America's capacity to control the seas around Australia and particularly to the north. For most of our lives this job has been done by Britain and it has been British sea power which controlled the situation. But provided sea power is held in the hands of our allies, Australia cannot be invaded but her supplies can be moved and her war effort can be conducted. The moment control of the seas is lost-whateve r else may be our position-Australi a becomes almost fatally vulnerable. It was United States sea power which saved us during World War II . and made our land campaigns possible. To keep the United States sea power as strong as possible lies at the very root of our security. There has been a lot of talk about what Labour did during the war. We all remember Mr Curtin's appeal to Americaunabashed and without inhibitions. Some such words were used to describe it. In those days the Labour Party turned freely to the United States. The Labour Government acknowledged United States help and, in fact, placed the Australian armed forces under American direction and much of our economic effort indirectly under American control. That was a separate situation. A large section of the Labour Party would like to do the same thing again but we must recognize that another large section of the Labour Party still comprises isolationists. They have not yet woken up to the kind of world in which we live. Many of their councils are governed by a kind of ostrichlike folk lore. What really causes trouble on this issue is certainly not the great body of Labour supporters but that small, very powerful and determined element which directly and indirectly comes under the sway of Communist and neo-Communist influences. That section of the Labour Party bas. a long and ugly record. It is a pity for Australia that the Leader of the Opposition has been faced with that dreadful position. One point which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro made very strongly was that we are tying ourselves up for 25 years. Can any one in this House visualize Australia being sufficiently populous in 25 years, or sufficiently powerful at a time when power is being cast on an increasingly large scale, to defend herself unaided? Can any one see any source of power which is likely, within 25 years, to replace the United States as our only possible ultimate shield? If any one does, he should not complain about 25 years being too long. He should explain his views. It is unfortunately true that members of mobilize this nation's resources so as to be the Labour Party, not necessarily in this in a position to resist, with our allies, the House but certainly outside it, are strongly enemy that threatened our shores. The opposed to the United States and in fact to honourable member for East Sydney replied anything which would ultimately lead to to a statement by the Treasurer ( Mr Harold the downfall in this area of Communist Holt) regarding Manus Island being made forces. The position will be the same in available as a base for the American forces. 25 years. What is the Labour Party's attiGovernment supporters have repeated contude?

The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) referred to the deplorable depletion of arms and equipment whioh was evident when Labour assumed office in October, 1941. I was a member of the War Cabinet at that time and I can verify the honourable member's statement. Australia was ill-prepared to meet any attack that was likely to be launched against it, and it was only after some time that we were able to The"" Hansard"" report of 9th February, 1949, is in these terms England( Mr Abbott) has been very consistent on point.

Respect matter. He continuedHow could we give up part of a territory which we shared as partners in a common cause. under our trusteeship responsibilities is an integral part of a territory which Australia is bound to defend? According to Admiral Hamilton, Manus is the Scapa Flow of the Pacific, and it is the duty and right of Australia to develop it as the forward base for our carrier arm. I should be surprised and astonished to hear that any reason was given to anybody in this country to complain about that attitude. We have never received any complaints about it. The President of the United States of America has not so much as breathed a word on the subject. As I have said, the relations between our two countries could not be more cordial than they are to-day. That is a complete denial of the accusations made by honourable members opposite about the Manus Island base. It verifies what was said by the honourable member for East Sydney to-night. It represents full justification of the position of the Labour Government at that time. It gives a complete and emphatic denial to those who have said otherwise. I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) on the splendid speech that he delivered in this House last Thursday on this proposed communication station at North West Cape. I thought his speech was reminiscent of those made by that illustrious leader in war-time, John Curtin. Good, wholesome Australian sentiment was expressed in its text. For two reasons I claim to speak with some positive understanding on the subject that is before the House at present. I refer to, first, my experience as a war-time Minister for the Navy and, secondly, my knowledge of the American people. No nation can claim to be supreme in its powers of government if it has not authority in respect of actions in its territory. That is axiomatic. The rights of the Australian nation reside in this Parliament. Our first duty is to our own people. They must always be our first consideration. By that right to nationhood we have an opportunity to offer friendly relations. Some nations respond with greater goodwill than do others. It is to those countries control. which seek good understanding that we feel the closer drawn in our associations and interest. The United States of America is one Australian representative on the Far Eastern F.3823/63 -R [60] of the countries with which we have extremely close ties of friendship. We respect, appreciate and value that goodwill. We came and mutual trust were further cemented as That brings me to one aspect of this agreement between Australia and the United States for the installation of this communication station at North West Cape. The agreement, in its text, does not exclude explicitly the possibility of joint control. However, the interpretation that has been given by the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) and later by the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) makes it necessary to secure a more positive assurance of Australia's right not only to have the use of the communication centre for Australian defence forces but also to share in the responsibilities of its control. There can be no logical objection to that because Australia has already proved its ability to share responsibility with the United States. During the war tense and urgent problems arose, but they were speedily resolved between the commander-in-chief, General Douglas MacArthur, and the Prime Minister of that time, John Curtin, by daily communication secured instantly by secrephone. By that means they consulted one another about the things that should be done. There was joint control in regard to the operations that were so vital at that time to the defence of this country as well as to the progress of the forces of the countries that were allied with us. It was necessary to have proper co-ordination of effort and understanding in order to determine how the forces could best be employed. At Washington and the United Nations there was the same co-operation, irrespective of the political complexion of the government. As the Australian representative on the Far Eastern Commission which was convened in Washington, I sat as a full partner in controlling the operations of General Douglas MacArthur who, on behalf of the allies, commanded the occupation forces in Japan.",73,Speaker Mr Largely Of His Own The Brisbane Line The

Do they think it wrong which.peace depends.. In common with other members of the-, have been able to protect the Australian and allied naval vessels that were lost in an Establishment at I am sure that when the Leader of the Australian Labour Party meets the President of the United States of America and Do honourable members opposite believe for Australia to ask that it be consulted on these matters and that it be given the right to determine whether it will be committed in the event of a war? These matters are basic to the continued independence of Australia and its people. I have always found that people in the United States of America have a respect for Australia and are willing to co-operate with Australia on matters of mutual concern. It would not be proper for me to refer to the many instances in which this willingness was shown during my term as ambassador in the United States. I believe, however, that I am entitled to show the extent to which the Americans went in dealing with a Labour Minister. I refer to Dr. Evatt, who was at the time attending a meeting of the United Nations Trusteeship Council. At one of the sessions, the proceedings were not very easy for Australia. I was told to interview the leader of the United States delegation. With prompt and clear emphasis he said, "" You tell your Minister that Australia can have whatever your Minister thinks will serve its interests best"". This is what happens when we have a Minister who will stand up for his country and who will insist on our sovereign rights being recognized. When we do this, we earn the respect of those with whom we negotiate. I had another example of this attitude when I was Minister for Munitions. A joint committee dealt with questions of production. Honourable members may remember how Sydney Harbour became cluttered up with landing craft which were required for use by our troops in their advance upon the islands to drive back the Japanese forces. Unfortunately, those landing craft did not have the necessary power units. We had been promised the power units from America but, unfortunately, for soxie reason we did not receive them. I decided that we could wait no longer and that we would make in Australia whatever motors were required to meet our own needs. The American lend-lease representative became very concerned about the attitude that I was adopting. I told him emphatically that there was such a thing as reciprocal lend-lease and we were under no obligation in respect of these motors. Finally, he said to me, "" I must admire you for standing up for your own nation "". We need that attitude to be adopted more often; if it is we will certainly earn the appreciation of our friends. It would seem that Australia is forgotten by this Government when it is considering policies which could have serious effects on Australia's interests. Honourable members on the Government side have suggested repeatedly that a Labour government would be unwilling to co-operate with the United States of America. This is a sinister and damaging insinuation, and history proves it to be false. On every occasion when Australia has been faced with a crisis, the Australian Labour Party has been called to office. On three occasions now the palsied and ineffectual efforts of Liberal Party and Country Party governments have resulted in the people demanding that a Labour government should take over and become the protector of this land. I say that the people of the Australian nation would like to have the opportunity of expressing their view upon the attitude that has been adopted by this Government towards defence during its period of office, and particularly at this time. The members of the Government, however, would not dare go to the people on this issue for they know that if they did so they would be politically scorched alive by the withering answer of the electors. opening his speech, the honourable member for Bonython( Mr Makin) said he regretted that we had only two days in which to debate this issue. The reason for that is that all honourable members want to conclude the sitting by next Thursday for reasons that are well known to them all. One thing you can depend on is that although the time for this debate is short I shall not take my full time as the honourable member for Bonython did; I shall take only portion of my time and allow my colleagues on this side of the House and as many honourable members as possible on the other side of the House to express their opinions on this very important subject. Generally, the best way to begin a speech is to rebut what has been said by ihe speaker who has just concluded his speech because what he has said is still fresh in the minds of the people who have been listening to our debate. When the honourable member for Bonython was speaking about what he said to the Americans when he was representing Australia in the United States he said, "" It would not be right for",74,Speaker Mr Largely Of His Own The Brisbane Line The
166,Mr Turnbull (Mallee) [10.53],"I nme to state what happened when I represented Australia in America"". I agree entirely with that but, strange to say, the honourable member for Bonython is quite in accord with the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) in stating what happened in a secret meeting of this Parliament. I cannot understand the logic of that thinking. It appears to me not to exhibit what the honourable member for Bonython so proudly calls the Australian spirit. After all, Australians must be fair, and if one side of the argument is right then the other is wrong. I should like honourable members to ponder over what has been said by the honourable member for East Sydney and the honourable member for Bonython to-night. Of course, I come down strongly on the side of the honourable member for Bonython because I believe it would not be right for him to make disclosures about things that occurred when he was Australian Minister in the United States of America; but I am amazed to think that he can approve of what has been said by the honourable member for East Sydney. The honourable member went on to say that the Americans have a tendency towards urgency and speed. When it comes to combating the use of nuclear weapons, the very things we want are urgency and speed. them. an urgent realization of the situation and have chosen his words better because they speed in deahng with it are important. But, did nothing to improve this debate on the strange to say, history discloses that the subject under discussion. Americans are not given to urgency and speed. On at least two occasions the British and the Australians have deplored Lhe Prime Minister John Curtin. It was not my length of time it has taken America to join privilege to be in this House while he was in world conflicts in which both Britain and Prime Minister but, from what I have heard, Australia have been engaged.

I want to speak now about the Deputy took over. I do not think that is correct. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). The non-Labour Government that preceded It is a very old truism that a bad start to a the Curtin Government began many things speech may be forgiven, but a bad ending never. It is very doubtful whether there has ever been a worse ending to a speech than the closing words of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the chamber to-night when, after stating Labour's case, he said, ""Labour believes in no annihilation without representation"". I wrote down his words. That statement appears to me to be a gem, one of the best I have ever heard in this House. Just ponder over it-n o annihilation without representation! What does it mean? IfI wanted to distort the statement, I could make it appear to mean that, once having representation, let annihilation proceed-as long as you can make the representation annihilation may follow and everything will be all right. Of course, I know the honourable member did not mean that, but, for a man who has been in this House for a long while and made speeches here and elsewhere, it was a deplorable end to the case he submitted. I know every honourable member of the Opposition agrees with me when I say that. After all, they know what representations are. Representations may be successful or otherwise. We all have made representations to Ministers at times, but there has been no guarantee that those representations would be successful. To-night it would appear to me that the attitude of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that as long as the representathe slaughter. I do not think he meant to To-night we have heard a great deal about Curtin was trying to cover up the really deplorable state of our defences when he",76,Speaker Mr Largely Of His Own The Brisbane Line The

168,Mr Turnbull,"But if they are used convey that meaning, but if not he shouldthat played a magnificent part during the war. One was Australia's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme, under which so many Australian airmen trained in Canada. Those airmen later played a magnificent role in the Battle of Britain, which meant so much to this country. The Government that preceded the Curtin Government also sent troops to Malaya. I would say that if it had not been for the Australian troops in Malaya holding up the Japanese on the Malayan Peninsula for about six weeks there would not have been a Coral Sea Battle. Let us make no mistake about that. There would not have been a Coral Sea Battle and the Japanese would probably have landed in Australia. The Government that preceded the Curtin Government set the seal on a great war effort. Yet people say that the present Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies), who was Prime Minister early in the war, walked out of office. Could we get anything more ridiculous than that? What happened was that two members who had supported the non-Labour Government crossed the floor of this House in 1941 and voted that Government out of office. One was the gentleman who was at the time member for Wimmera, whom I later followed as the member for that electorate, and the other was the gentleman who was then member for Henty. Those two members decided to vote against the Government. The member for Wimmera based his decision more on matters relating to the wheat industry than on the conduct of the war. I do not know why the member for Henty voted as he did. The Government and the Opposition of that day were fairly evenly matched, as the Government and the Opposition are to-day, and the decision of those two members to vote against the Government caused its defeat. It was not a matter of the Government walking out of office, but merely of two of its supporters act in the same tradition and not say, when crossing the floor and voting with the Opposition to defeat that Government. had been killed in an aircraft crash, too. just pointed out, a number of Ministers had at the same time, tell the people of Ausbeen killed in an aircraft crash that had tralia and the world that Australia is so taken place at Canberra shortly before. From what I have said, we can see that certain things said by Opposition members will not bear the light of truth. Honourable members opposite make statements such as, "" The Minister admitted certain things "". It is all very well for them to use such words, but the correct thing would be to say, "" The Minister made certain statements "". Some Opposition members think that people outside this Parliament who are listening to the radio broadcast of these proceedings may take more notice when a statement is twisted into the form, "" The Minister admitted this "". This sort of thing is all wrong. I do not expect Opposition members to say whether I am right, but I can estimate -no t guess-wha t happened among them. Is it not a fact that, before they came into the House to speak on this measure, they were told that, to serve the interests of the Opposition best, they must refer to this naval communications station as a base? We know that is right. They were told that. There is not the slightest doubt in the world that they were told to refer to the proposed station as a base. Most of the Opposition members in whom I have the greatest confidence do not deny this. Opposition members were told to use the term "" base "" to convey the suggestion that the communications station may be used as a base for vessels carrying nuclear weapons. This will be merely a communications station and will serve none of the purposes of a base. Therefore, I cannot see what other reason honourable members opposite have against calling it a station. I go back now to what John Curtin said about Australia's defence being efficient. Labour speakers agree that he said that but say that he did so to cover up the fact that our defences were so weak. I only hope that Opposition members will continue to our defences are strong, that we are so weak that any nation could invade us and take this country without difficulty. Honourable members opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot say that John Curtin, for the good of the Australian people, said weak to-day that any country can come in",77,Speaker Mr Largely Of His Own The Brisbane Line The

170,Mr Turnbull,"As the Minister has that Australia's defences were strong and,and take over. Which is right? This question can be answered by me only by saying that the Opposition speaks with two voices. The other evening, the honourable member for Kingston( Mr Galvin) said that he agreed that we should have a base. He wanted it to be under dual control, but he came to the conclusion that there should be a base. A lot of honourable members opposite say that we should not have a base. I have written down the statements made by some of them. The honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) was very much against having the station at all. He said, "" The approval of the base will be challenged on every voting-paper at the next election "". ment will be impeached. word what the honourable member said: "" The approval of the base will be challenged on every voting-paper at the next election"". Why not challenge it here and now? This is the time. Why wait until the next general election? If the honourable member is against the station-and he said he was-wh y does he not vote against it? There is an obvious answer to that question, but I shall not go into the details. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition Opposition members are only spurious and put up a case that he considered was do not put a case for Australia or state the proven. He said that the base is not genuine attitude of this Parliament. required.

He member ought to understand how honordid not seem to realize that quick action is able members on this side of the House what will count. Quick retaliation against feel about being asked to tie themselves to the enemy is what is important. I made notes of certain other things that were said by Opposition members. I want to refer to some of them briefly. We were told that the proposed naval communication station would be a threat of forced entry into war by Australia-that if the United States took some action of which Australia did not approve we would be embroiled, in a, war. Another Opposition member said that we are tied to the United States through the ANZUS and Seato pacts and that if the United States enters a war we must stand behind her with all the weight of arms and all the forces that we have. So what is the difference? I cannot understand what the difference is. On the one hand, Labour says that we have great faith in the American nation and then implies that we cannot trust it. America will spend many millions of pounds on this base. I find myself using the word "" base "" because Labour speakers use it all the time. But this is a communication station, not a base. The Americans are to spend many millions of pounds on it. Surely to goodness, after spending so much on it, they have the right to control it as they think fit, and especially as it is in our interests. The Prime Minister made it very clear that the station is designed for communication with naval vessels generally and to permit speedy action in the defence of the United States and of Australia. But member after member on the Opposition side of the House has said, ""The Prime Minister did not say that the station was designed to convey messages to submarines "". Every honourable member knows that submarines are units of naval fleets. These arguments that are used by The honourable member for East Sydney the policy of certain Opposition members. I have watched very carefully the expressions on the faces of honourable members opposite when certain things have been said, and, if I were a betting man, I would make a wager that I could pick out those who really favour this station and those who do not, with a 10 per cent, margin of error. I am sure that I could do that just by watching the faces of honourable members opposite.",78,Speaker Mr Largely Of His Own The Brisbane Line The
171,Mr Bryant,I said that the Govern,79,Speaker Mr Largely Of His Own The Brisbane Line The
172,Mr Turnbull,"This is word forThat concludes the comments that I want to make on what has been said by honourable members opposite. I would not be justified in my rebuke of the honourable member for Bonython if I dealt with those comments at greater length and perhaps restricted the time available to those who will follow me. I want now to state my case in relation to the proposed naval communication station. I am in full accord with the Government's decision on this station. Some people say that Australia should remain independent. Does that mean independent in peace and not in war? Other people say that we should ally ourselves with strong nations. In that respect, there is no alternative in my mind to alliances with the countries of the British Commonwealth and the United States of America. Does any one think that there is a real alternative? The only other course would be to ally ourselves with Russia and Red China. Does any honourable member think that should be done? Surely not. We want to have an independent role in peace, but we cannot afford to have it in war, because we are not strong enough. I believe that the only way to ensure our continued physical occupancy of this country and the only way in which to maintain the freedom for which our men laid down their lives in two great wars is to ally ourselves closely with the British Commonwealth of Nations, and with the United States of America. The honourable member for Mallee( Mr become more clouded and it has become Turnbull) criticized the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) for his remarks about the phrase "" annihilation without representation"". I point out to the honourable member for Mallee that what we on this side are objecting to is that the Government which he says that he strongly supports is prepared to accept the possibility of annihilation but is not prepared to attempt to obtain representation in decisions relating to the possibility of annihilation. Once again in this debate we have witnessed the exhibition which honourable members opposite invariably put on when they are faced with a challenge from the Australian Labour Party to which they have no effective answer. The speech of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Cleaver) was a typical example of the lengths to which some of them are prepared to go, by way of untruths, smears, misquotations and distortions, in their attempts to fool the Australian public and to try to divert 1 attention from the real issues involved in the subject under discussion. Honourable members opposite employed much the same tactics in the last election campaign, when they had absolutely nothing to offer the people but knew very well that the policy of the Australian Labour Party was finding favour with the Australian electors. Apparently they have forgotten that they used those tactics in an election campaign which resulted in the majority of the Government in this House being reduced from 32 to two. I would strongly advise them, if they want to lose further ground in the next election, to use those tactics again. There is no doubt that the Australian public is finally becoming aware of the purpose behind these tactics. The people know that smears and untruths are used by fhe Government parties to cover up their own inefficiency. In this case, they are used also to cover up the Government's lack of courage in measuring up to its responsibility in the matter of defence. The bill now before us for consideration appears to supply the information which members on this side of the House have been endeavouring to obtain, without success, from the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) and other Ministers for the last twelve months. However, as the debate has proceeded, the issues have more difficult to determine just what the agreement does provide. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) have gone to great pains to show that just because the agreement does not say what it is supposed to say, it does not mean that it does not say it. That is how I interpret the speeches of the Prime Minister and the Minister for External Affairs. It may sound a little Irish as I have put it, but not half as Irish as the interpretations we have heard from honourable members opposite. This bill concerns the establishment of what is termed a United States naval communication station, and it is the most important measure presented to this House for a good many years. Not only is it very important, but it' is unusual to the extent'",79,Speaker Mr Largely Of His Own The Brisbane Line The
173,Mr Collard (Kalgoorlie) [11.11],"that it deals with the installation of a military station in Australia by a foreign power, for use only by that power. Under those circumstances, it is rather difncult to understand why the Prime Minister and other Ministers have been so loath to give any proper and straight-out information as to the station's purpose and use. The Prime Minister and all other Government members know very well that the exact purpose of the base has never been made clear. Surely, Sir, the people of Australia were entitled to know what its purpose and its use would be. Certainly members of this Parliament were entitled to know, and, not knowing, were quite entitled to ask questions in the House and to receive firm and proper answers to those questions. But apparently the Prime Minister did not think so, because he became very critical of any one who dared to ask a question and at no time gave a direct answer. Let us look at what the "" Weekend N:ws"" of Western Australia had to say on this subject as recently as 30th March of this year. I should explain that this newspaper is not one that favours the Labour Party. As a matter of fact, it is usually very critical of the Labour Party. I shall read what it printed about the Prime Minister's statements regarding this base. The comment came after the Prime Minis-; ter's second statement, that of 26th March, which he refers to as giving "" further information "". The report is headed "" US. Base "", so the honourable member for Mallee should also criticize the newspaper for using that term. The report statesFederal Parliament has resumed and Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies is coming under Opposition pressure to tell thc Australian people just what are the implications of his Government's base, because nowhere in the agreement is it decision to allow the United States Government to build a naval communications centre at NorthWest Cape in Western Australia. The only information on the obvious main purpose of the £40,000,000 radio base has come from the ALP. The report continuesAt no time has Sir Robert Menzies even hinted at the true purpose of the station: that it will provide the United States with the means accurately to discharge nuclear missiles from submarines thousands of miles away from Austraha and, by inference, because of this fact, will bematters connected with the station and its use. come a target for those at whom these missiles are being launched. Sir Robert has contented himself wilh slating the ALP. for the conditions it has laid down for its approval of the station. The matter boils down to the exact degree of participation or consultation any future Australian Government might be expected to enjoy in the operation of the station, and on this matter Sir Robert has been very silent. News"" of Western Australia. The report goes onBecause of the possible way in which the station might be used, Sir Robert will be pressed to state in precise terms how the agreement, when it is finalised, will affect Australia in its relationship with its neighbouring nations in the near north, surely a matter of great importance. But it is another matter altogether whether Sir Robert will be prepared to say very much.. For the moment, he will have the excuse that the agreement is not finalised, but if the whole question of the station is to be a major electoral issue, as it surely will be, both the Opposition and the majority of the Australian people will demand to know more once it is signed or ready for signing. If the experience of the British Labour Party in forcing information on the Polaris submarine base at Holy Loch in Scotland from the Macmillan Government is any criterion, the Opposition looks like having a hard task with Sir Robert but any reticence on his part could tell against him politically. Here we have, in a newspaper that does not support the Labour Party but normally supports the Government, ample evidence that others beside members of the Labour Party are not satisfied with the attitude of the Prime Minister and others in regard to the giving of information on this subject. I thought, when first reading the agreement, that Article3 was a vehicle whereby the Australian Government would be able to negotiate with the United States with regard to having some say in the use of the laid down that the United States is to be in sole control, nor does it say anywhere that the United States is not to be in sole control. SoI suggest that it was reasonable to come to the conclusion that Article3 was the part of the agreement which would supply an avenue of negotiation on that point. I would like to read the article in question. It states(1) The two Governments will consult from time to time at the request of either Government on (2) Except with the express consent of the Australian Government, the station will not be used",80,Speaker Mr Largely Of His Own The Brisbane Line The

It was only as for the benefit of both countries. We late as this afternoon that the Minister, believe this is of the greatest importance replying to a Dorothy Dix question from now, as it was when the late John Curtin the honourable member for Perth( Mr sought American co-operation during World Chaney) took the opportunity-and took up War II . But while we accept the principle a large part of question time in doing soof reading documents and memorandums not accept the condition under which which, he claimed, showed that Australia America is handed all rights to determine had said it wanted consultation and that issues which should be determined by America would have nothing less than sole decision of the Australian Government and control. Then the documents went on to not of some outside power. So we say say that what the article set out might be that the station should be under the joint what the Minister meant, and what it did control of Australia and America, acting not set out was what America wanted, and in co-operation and co-ordination for the so everybody was happy in accepting somegreatest benefit to both countries. thing that was not there. However, if article 3 does not give Australia-anyrightsin regard to any part of the operation of the control of the base with America? Is there station, I cannot see what good purpose the something peculiar to Australia that prediscussions or consultations are going to vents us from enjoying joint control in achieve.

If Australia can countries is surely good enough for have no rights in regard to matters conAustralia.

177,Mr Collard,"It is in my electorate,quite agree that if war does come to Australia it could come overnight, or even more quickly. But then Government members go on to argue that joint control would mean that before anything could be done it would be necessary to call the Cabinet toge.her, and that then the Cabinet would have to conduct a discussion, arrive at a decision and then forward its decision to the base. They say that this would result in unnecessary delays and that for this reason joint control would be ""impracticable. That argument does not convince me at all. I am not convinced that we should not have joint control by reason of this argument put forward by Government supporters-and it is the only argument I have heard them put forward. It is, however, an argument that convinces me that if Australia should be attacked to-morrow or the next day, or next year, or at any time while this Government is in office, the Government will never be ready to meet the situation. It is clear that this Government has no plan, and has made no decisions about what should be done by way of immediate retaliation if Australia is attacked. Apparently if war came quickly the Government would have to call the Cabinet together and go through all these devious processes that Government supporters say would cause so much delay before arriving at a decision on what should be done. I suggest that any government worthy of the name would, particularly in these troublesome times, be always in a position to come to an immediate decision if the need arose for it to do so. Would not the position be the same if this base were under joint control? Would not the governments be in constant consultation with each other, studying trends and developments all over the world, so that they would know instantly what move to make if war came to Australia? I see no reason why, with good government and good co-operation, there should be any need in an emergency to call the Cabinet together. I believe that all necessary steps could be determined well in advance of any outbreak of hostilities. The fact is, as I see it, that the Government does not want to have any say in the operation of the base. It does not want to be in a position where it will have to shoulder any of its responsibilities to the people of Australia. Government members have failed so miserably on previous occasions, in times of war and near-war, they have failed so badly in providing Australia with adequate defences, that now they have not either the competence or the courage to make decisions for themselves. Has the Labour ?arty anything to be ashamed of if you refuse to insist on having government it will want to have some say on such important matters as the defence of our country, and on such vital questions as whether we will involve our people in war? I suggest it is something to be ashamed of if you refuse to insist on having a say and leave some other power to make the decision. The honourable member for Swan, if I understood him correctly, said, with his usual disregard for the truth, that we would close the base if war broke out. We have never said anything of the sort. We simply say that we want the right to make decisions as to whether Australia will go to war or whether we will become involved in hostilities that develop between other countries. Surely it is the duty of a Commonwealth Government, elected by the people, to insist on such a right. Surely the people would expect the Australian Government, and not that of some other country, to decide whether we should be at war, or whether we should do something that would bring war. It is idle to say that because this station is to be only a communications base it will never become deeply involved. The truth is that it will direct messages to naval vessels, and those messages could be for the <i-spatch of mis: siles which might result in world conflict. When such a situation is likely to occur there can surely be no proper reason why Australia should not have the right to determine whether it will be involved. Honourable members might be interested in a report, published in the "" Sunday Times "", of views expressed by Mr Brand, the Premier of Western Australia where, unfortunately, for the moment there is a Liberal Government. Mr Brand saidI have seen models and plans and when I was in the States recently I got more details. According to all these things it is just a big installation for keeping in touch with submarines, space capsules and so on. That is the first mention of space capsules, and I do not know what the "" and so on "" is. The report continuesHe added if later developments caused it to be considered as a military target for nuclear attack: "" There is only a few kangaroos and emus up there anyway."" His thinking is evidently the same as that of Liberal and Country Party members in this House-completel y unconcerned with what can happen to the people of the north-west. Every one knows that if this base is attacked the country for miles around it will be affected. But this Government, like Mr Brand, gives no thought to the people employed and living at the base or those employed and living close to it. 1 realize that there are areas of Australia to which an enemy would assign priority for attack once Australia was involved in war; but, in my experience, communications have always been a very necessary part of either defence or attack in time of war, so the base area will automatically become a priority target if Australia is involved in war. If American naval forces fire on some other country's vessels it is only natural that that country will want to destroy the communication centre which is giving the instructions for the destruction of its ships. Surely we should be looking for means to defend Australia against any attack which may be made upon us! If this base becomes the subject of attack that will mean war to Australia. While we all pray that that time will never come, we know that war can come and that we could not survive if we were dependent upon Australia's present defences. In the time remaining to me I will read to the House some leading articles from the "" West Australian"" newspaper, which is noted for its support of Liberal governments, both State and Federal. We know that the *' West Australian "" would turn over backwards to support Liberal governments. But it knows very well that if it went to the lengths of supporting this Liberal Government in matters of defence it would look ridiculous. The first article Mr Jeff Bate -What is the date of that article? 1962. That is not very long ago. What has this Government done since then? The article reads as follows:Canberra is still acting as though our defence effort, now £210,000,000 a year out of a gross national product of over £7,000,000,000 should be little more than a token gesture to Seato. The spending of a further £56,000,000 over three years is a trivial addition that is unworthy of Australia. The article also statesPublic opinion is far ahead of Government planning. The Government should expand its policy and order the necessary ships, planes and equipment for quick delivery. Another article in the "" West Australian "" dated Monday, l l t h February, 1963, reads, in partWhile the Federal Government continues to show indecision in defence, Western Australia is virtually dcfen -eless, without aircraft and without facilities for servicing our own or allied ships. An article in the same newspaper, of 27th February, 1963, is headed ""Unbalanced Air Services Lack Striking Power"" and statesIt is becoming increasingly difncult to detect any coherent pattern in Australian defence policy. An article in this same paper, dated 31st January, 1963, statesOur defences are inadequate and will continue to be too weak with the meagre additions proposed in the new two-year programme. The third of the continent in Western Australia remains virtually undefended. Another article, dated 20th February, 1963, is headed "" Australia is Evading its Defence Responsibilities"". It reads as follows:Navy Minister Gorton would have no rejoinder if he should be told bluntly in Washington that Australia is not pulling its weight in defence. So we are getting back to America. A further article in the "" West Australian"" dated l l t h February, 1963, is headed ""RSL. Wants Defences Overhauled"". It statesThe national executive of the RSL. to-day decided to urge the Federal Government to overhaul Australia's defence measures. This is a newspaper which normally supports this Government. It is obvious that the arguments being used in this debate by supporters of the Government are simply intended to be to act as a smoke screen in order to try to conceal from the people the fact that we have no defence, and in view of the way the Government is going we never will have any defence. rather amusing to hear the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Collard) spend most of his time reading newspaper clippings tp the effect that Australia has",82,Speaker Mr Largely Of His Own The Brisbane Line The

179,Mr Jess (La Trobe) [11.35],"It wasinadequate defences and that the Government should do something about the matter. Yet the Labour Party has said that the construction of the proposed radio communication base at North West Cape should not be carried out. This contradiction is quite confusing. In regard to newsto make our contribution to the defence paper reports, perhaps I can be more up to date than the honourable member. I refer the House to two Communist newspapers, dated 16th May. One is the "" Guardian"" which writes up in lyrical verse what the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) said last week in the House. This journal thought he made a wonderful speech, and so do:s the Communist "" Tribune"".

This lists the items put forward ment of the United States signal station at by branches of the Australian Labour North West Cape.

I think that a naval communication station at North supports the argument that the only people West Cape shows in a most practical form who are getting joy from Labour's policy that our alliance with America is not just at this stage are Communist supporters in a hollow promise but is based on effective Australia and outside it. This afternoon co-operation between our two countries in the honourable member for Hughes( Mr a spirit of mutual trust. L. R. Johnson), the honourable member for Barton( Mr Reynolds) and many other honourable members opposite talked about Garfield Barwick) made it clear to the House the British Labour Party and the situation when introducing the bill that although the in England. If we are to examine what is Australian Government had constitutional happening in England, let us begin by power to sign the agreement without prelooking at England's defence policy. senting it to the Parliament the Goverament National defence policy has been increashad decided to submit the agreement to the ingly based on the realization that no counParliament for approval before exchanging try can protect itself in isolation and that it with the United States Government. In the defence of Britain is possible only as a very comprehensive and well-prepared a part of a system of collective defence. speech the Minister explained fully to the That applies also to Australia. At the House, and indeed to the people of same time the United Kingdom continues to work for the attainment of international agreement on disarmament under effective control. So does the Australian Government. The 1962 White Paper on Defence stated that "" the basic objective is of the free world and the prevention of war in accordance with the arrangements we have with individual countries and under collective security treaties"". That is exactly what this Government has done. Its policy and its basic objectives are similar to those of Britain, as indeed thzy should be. Australia and the United Kingdom are part of the system of collective defence of the free world. However between the United Kingdom and Australia there is one great and disturbing lack of similarity on matters of defence. The Labour Party in the United Kingdom has a policy similar to that of the government and indeed it can be said that there is a national policy; To me the agreement with the United The Minister for External Affairs( Sir Australia, the purpose of this station and the terms and conditions which had been agreed upon by the two governments. He explained that the station will be as it is described in the agreementa naval communication station, a wireless station, nothing more or nothing less. Honourable members opposite have mentioned other countries such as the United Kingdom, Turkey and Spain and the agreements that they have signed. No one in this House has been able to find those agreements nor has any newspaper been successful in this regard, but perhaps some of our leftist friends have been able to obtain information through secret sources. The Minister also explained that the station will have no other capacity than to transmit and receive wireless messages, including signals at very low frequency capable of being received by submerged naval vessels as well as by surface vessels. The station will be used by Australia and by our allies. Certain honourable members opposite seem to have the opinion, as has been apparent from their questions over the last few months, that it is all right for a naval surface vessel to be contacted by signal but -oh , my goodness-neve r a submerged naval vessel. Do they not know that mobility and ability to move undetected under water are the greatest assets that a submarine has? Do they not think it essential that submarines should be able to fix their position? Do they not realize that the majority of the Russian and the proposed Chinese ships are and will be submerged? Do they believe that the Western world should not be able to direct its ships to where they can be most effective in an emergency? Or is it their intention simply to impede the defence of the West and of the free world? The establishment of the naval communication station at North West Cape will increase significantly the capacity of the United States of America to perform its part in the ANZUS pact as well as in the maintenance of peace in the world generally. The permission by Australia to allow the base to be built here allows us to show conclusively that we too are prepared to play our part in this most important task. Let honourable gentlemen opposite realize that Australia's future security must of necessity be tied up with the obligations that we have accepted with the United States of America under our alliances. Australia cannot isolate itself. Such a policy would be only suicidal. Do honourable gentlemen opposite feel that America has an obligation to protect us while we should not commit ourselves in any way to mutual defence arrangements? From Australia's viewpoint the most important change in the world situation must be the emergence of Communist China. China already has moved into Tibet, has moved against neutral India and has contributed to the maintenance of Communist regimes in North Viet Nam and in North Korea. She is strongly committed to nationalistic expansion and the world-wide extension of Communist imperialism. She is strongly pursuing these objectives throughout South-East Asia. Unless we of the free world can show that we have the means and are resolved to resist aggression, we and the other small countries will cease to exist. Before long China will announce that she has nuclear capacity. But even without this, weight of numbers must be on her side in any conventional war. The Communist parties throughout Asia-in North Korea, Noith Viet Nam, Thailand, Malaya and Burma-ar e all pro-Chinese, as indeed it would appear is the great Indonesian Communist Party. We know also of the division in the Australian Communist Party on the Soviet and China lines. Perhaps the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) may be able to tell us which line is winning. China must be considered a direct threat to the small countries of Asia. Only by effective action by the United States and her allies can the spirit of these small countries and their desire to choose their own destinies be maintained. However, let us look at the internal situation confronting Australia and endeavour calmly to find the true policy of the alternate government of Australia-the Labour Party. Where does it stand? How much of its recently changed policy-changed , I remind the House, by one vote-ca n be considered genuine? We must ask ourselves-indee d not only this Parliament but also the people of Australia and our allies-wha t would happen if the complete rejection of the base, as proposed by the seventeen at the federal Australian Labour Party conference in Canberra on 18 th March of this year, had been carried and if Labour were in office and the one vote that defeated the rejection proposal swung to the left. How much of the executive decision was political opportunism and how much was honest? In his speech, which sounded like an actor reciting bad lines-line s which he himself did not believe in but which the 36 directors of the play had made him deliverMr Let us imagine the situation in which Calwell saidI accuse the Prime Minister and those of his colnuclear attack on the Western world. The leagues who have discussed the station with having attempted in the most unscrupulous fashion to try to mislead the people about the attitude of the Labour Pary to the agreement. But this is not the object of the Government. It is the object of the Labour Opposition. The tactics foreshadowed by the Opposition are designed to kill the bill, and thereby to oppose ratification of the agreement with the United States, and to do this in a manner which the Opposition hopes will not be obvious to the people of Australia. Party realizes that again it is caught in the net of intrigue woven by its left wing and pro-Communist supporters. Mr Calwell may claim Mackinnon) Order! member for La Trobe will refer to the Leader of the Opposition in the correct way. Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition may claim that Labour's tactics are a technical device to direct attention to the bill's insufficiencies. He knows, but does not say-and hopes the public will not realize-that Standing Order No. 237 of this House provides that an amendment to defer the third reading of a bill for six months, if carried, shall finally dispose of the bill. In plain words, the agreement with the United States of America would be killed if Labour's proposed amendment were accepted by the House. Let it be understood that that is Labour's objective. The rhetoric and the grand gestures about Labour's concern being in the best interests of Australia are dangerous. The signal station is a station, not a base. Australia has the right to use the station. No nuclear arms or anything else are to be stored there. It is part of the communications network which is vital to Western defence. What are Labour's objections? Can we accept this suggestion of joint control as genuine? Can we take seriously the suggestion that nuclear strategy can allow in emergency the delay and confusion that Labour proposes? one of the Communist powers launches a United States President, warned of this, may have a matter of minutes to send a signal to United States forces to allow them to take counter-measures which may save the free world, which includes Australia. The signal is sent urgently to the United States commander at the signal station at North West Cape. Even seconds may count. Under Labour policy the commander, after receiving the signal, would then have to get on the trunkline or send a telegram to the Leader of the Opposition if he, by some The Parliamentary Labour tragedy, were the Prime Minister. He may not be in Canberra. He may be behind a bush outside a hotel. He may be waiting to get his instructions on the latest unity ticket. He may even be in Melbourne with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition The honourable the Victorian Labour Party executive intends to stop co-operating with the Communists on unity tickets. However, after some days he is found. What happens then? He has to rush to a telephone and find Mr Chamberlain, who has to find the other 35 gentlemen who probably would have to find an available hotel with a free room in which to hold a conference. As the enemy would be a Communist power, the executive would probably take three days to come to a decision. Can we imagine the commander at North West Cape all this time explaining to the United States President that he is trying to get a decision from the Australian Government as to whether it approves of the signal or not? By that time there would be no president. No United States of America! The free world would be finished! Some sections of the Labour Party, I am sure, would be able quickly to come to terms with the enemytheir terms, not ours.

If the agreement provided for a veto then, in the event of war breaking out in which nuclear weapons were employed, a left-wing government could nullify the effect of United States nuclear weapons in the southern hemisphere. Could America accept this position? Labour members say that this is not their purpose. 1 agree that the majority are anxious to co-operate and are genuine in this desire. But let us remember also, when honourable members opposite lay claim to winning the last war, that one problem that still remains unanswered is what would have happened if Russia had stayed on the German side in 1940. recall the problem that Labour had to face at that time, a problem which circumstances spared the party from answering. I admit, here, that Labour leaders at that time spoke firmly for Australia. But what pressures from left-wing unions and delegates would have occurred if Russia had remained our enemy?

Well, to gain some idea, let us look at some of the statements by certain honourable gentlemen opposite-the Parliamentary Labour Party-and consider them carefully. Let us note, also, the closeness of the remarks in point of time to to-day. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) who occupies a seat on the front bench of the Labour Party made a speech which is reported in "" Hansard"" of 29th November, 1962, at page 2737. This speech has been quoted extensively. I shall read only the concluding portion which is as follows:1 think it is most important for Australia at present not to get tied up with America. To put American bases on our soil is to be finally and fatally tied to American policy of action and the consequences of American action. In the Let us turn back the pages and light of the American action over CubaI suggest that we can have no real and positive faith in the value to us of American action. On 29th November, 1962, the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) another front bench member of the Labour Party, made a speech which he concluded as follows:The proposition that we have a nuclear-free zone in the southern hemisphere, that we abjure for all time foreign bases and nuclear bases, is not suicide but salvation for the Australian people. On 29th April, 1962, the honourable member for Yarra who will follow me in this on the Yarra Bank made a statement which was reported in the Communist for Yarra made a speech which was reported in the ""News Weekly"" of 20th . . . expressed the view that Australia had recommendation-suppor t for a nuclear-free zone Numerous speeches by the honourable members opposite give much food for thought, but let us compare the defence and foreign affairs policies of the Communist Party and the Australian Labour Party. Common to both those policies are the following objectives:-Making the Pacific a nuclear-free zone, disbandment of ANZUS and Seato, opposition to the re-arming of Japan, revocation of all agreements for the use of Australian bases by United States, British and other military forces, and drastic reduction of military expenditure to release money for the national need. The July decision of the Australian Labour Party federal executive cleared the way for two important drives by the Communist and pro-Communist forces. The first was the nation-wide petition organized by the Australia and New Zealand Peace Congress, and the second was the development of the attack on the proposed North West Cape station which was initiated Ln Western Australia. Can Australia afford to accept the present policy of the Labour Party as a genuine policy and risk finding that it has made a wrong choice-perhap s too late? The insidious propaganda which is being put out by Communist-front organizations, frequently using innocent dupes for their purpose is one of the most frightening and diabolical of schemes. It is intended for but one thing-to take from the people their will to resist. The most active Communist-inspired peace bodies in Australia are the Australia and New Zealand congress committees for disarmament and international co-operation. These committees were set up to carry on the work of the agree that freedom without responsibility Australia and New Zealand congress for disarmament and international co-operation which was held in Melbourne in 1959. The idealistic phrases of these Communist supporters and their friends have extremely difficult to understand the posidiffered little from what has been coming tion chosen to be taken quite deliberately out of Moscow since the last war when the by the honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Soviet began the calculated campaign of Jess) who has just sat down. His remarks world conquest, and from Peking since the were not made in the heat of the moment; Communists commenced their drive forhis speech was prepared outside the ward. They say to the West: You should chamber, and he carefully read it at a rapid abandon all military and naval bases of speed. It was something which had been whatever nature; you will terminate all misprepared coldly and deliberately-somethin g sile and space exploration, leaving both viciously and deliberately distorted. Not fields for the Communists: you will terone of the statements that the honourable minate all nuclear and thermo-nuclear member made about the attitude of the experiments and leave these fields to the Australian Labour Party or of any one of Communists; you will not tolerate nuclear submarines-onl y Communist ones; you will abrogate all treaties and alliances and mutual assistance for defence with other governments; in fact, you will give up anything that may give you anv hope of resisting Communist advances and preventing Communists from over-running your country and the world. All this has the familiar ring of the debate which has been going on in this place. The Communist agents and stooges say, in effect: "" We are speaking in the cause of peace and removing the causes of friction and war. All you have to do is to surrender."" These actions are insidious, evil and despicable. Every word that these people use has represented the dream of the Communist leaders since the end of the last war. They say, in effect: "" Get out of this. Get out of that. Scrap this. Scrap your defences. Abandon your friends. Give the world to communism. Forget your responsibilities to humanity and surrender to us."" The 25th April is hardly a month away. I often wonder what those whose death we commemorated on that dav would think of some of the propaganda which we hear in Australia at the moment. However, I am confident that the majority of Australians are prepared to play their part in defence of liberty, goodness and freedom and that they welcome the agreement to join with the United States of America in the establishment of this most important adjunct to the defence and peace of the world. The Australian people have and will always is self-destructive. Therefore, I am sure that this bill is supported by the majority of the Australian people.",87,Speaker Mr Mr Whitlam Waiting To Hear Whether
182,Mr Cairns (Yarra) [11.59],"It isits members to any matter to which he referred to-night is true. Every one of those statements is a half-truth or a complete distortion. If that came about as a result of a spontaneous speech or a statement in the House that might have been provoked, one could understand it and forgive him. But a deliberate statement like this, made coldly and with calculation outside, is that of a man who could be trusted with no power or responsibility; that of a man who is raw material for any aggressive or fascist movement which might arise in this country; that of a man who would have no respect whatsoever for the feelings or the position of any one else; that of a man who is prepared without provocation and without any incitement to allege disloyalty and dishonour in others; and that of a man who deserves no answer whatsoever. We have reached a situation to order. I ask for an apology. The honourable member for Yarra is making me out as being a fascist. I am not a fascist. I have had to explain this to honourable members before. There is no substance in the point of order. Wednesday, 22nd May, 1963. brought quickly to an end as a result of the gag being applied. order. I asked for an apology. DoI not get one? I object to the words used by the honourable member for Yarra. my memory serves me rightly, the honourable member for Yarra did not say that the honourable member for La Trobe was a fascist. I will accept that. the most important matter ever debated in this House. After this bill, Australia will never again be in the same position as it was before. Whatever we may think about the validity of and necessity for it, this bill will change fundamentally the position of Australia in the worlc Before this bill Australia was able to choose its course in war or peace. But no longer will it be able to make that choice. From now on we will be automatically committed to any action taken by the President of the United States in relation to involvement in nuclear war. We are inevitably involved from now on. Many important consequences follow from that, but the matter at issue in this debate is a simple one. The matter at issue between the two main and great parties in this country is the degree of decision or influence that Australia should have in these important matters. The position taken by the Oppositiona clear and distinct position-is that the Opposition stands for the sovereignty of Australia. We say that Australia shall not be involved in war as a result of any decision by any other country, unless that decision is considered and made by the Australian Government. What we propose to do in this chamber is to follow procedures which are calculated to have included in the agreement between the Australian Government and the American Government the conditions that our party has decided are essential. Any implication that a postponement of this bill for six months is related in any way to Standing Order No. 237 is a complete distortion of the truth. The position is that we are proposing the postponement of this bill because there is no other constitutional procedure available. We cannot propose an amendment of thc agreement here and now because the rules of the House will not permit that. This matter has been checked by our party with the Clerks of the House, and that is the procedure that has been laid down for us. The only procedure that is possible under the Standing Orders of this House is the procedure that we have adopted. My desire at this stage is to attempt to summarize the position taken by the Opposition up to this stage in the debate. We have submitted that the Government has endeavoured to conceal the true nature of the base that is proposed to be established in Western Australia. We believe that the Australian people are vitally interested and concerned in this matter. We do not accept any superficial judgment of their attitude that any gallup poll that has been referred to can produce. We know that the question",89,Labour At The Cross Roads

189,Mr Cairns,"This has probably beenasked by the people who took that gallup poll was: Are you in favour of the establishment of an American radio station? That is a harmless question. That question concealed as much about the nature of the base as the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) and other members of this Government have concealed. It was not until 26th March of this year that the Prime Minister or any one else was frank on this matter. On 17th May of last year the Prime Minister made a long statement in this House. It takes up nearly two pages of closely typed foolscap. In no other part of that statement did the Prime Minister give any real indication of what was involved. In fact, the Prime Minister took up in this House and elsewhere-and so did other members of the Government partiesa position of criticism and intimidation of members of the Australian Labour Party who probed into the question in an endeavour to find out more. All the time the Government has taken up a position of implying disloyalty and association with Communists against any one who has seen fit to ask questions about this base. At all times the deliberate policy of those in charge of the Government was to endeavour to intimidate and to drive away the questions asked by members of the Opposition in this respect. But they have failed to do that. The Prime Minister was completely decepStates. To what will those signals be sent? tive, if not deliberately deceptive, when he Probably to ten or twelve submarines which left out reference to submarines in what he had to say on this matter, because every one knows-the Opposition has submitted evidence accordingly-that the significant thing about this proposition is communication with submarines. That is the only thing that counts, because in relation to every other naval vessel that will be around Australian shores there already exist in other radio stations the means to communicate with such surface vessels. The significant thing about this station which is proposed to be established in Western Australia is the on this subject. Each submarine carries sixvery low frequency section of the station which will be there and which is necessary only for communication with submarines. It is necessary to have a very low frequency to penetrate water. Even then not a great depth of water can be penetratedprobably no more than 20 or 30 feet. So we will have submarines trailing aerials near the surface if they are any distance away from the station. The vital thing about this station is communication with submarines, but it was not until 16th May, in answer to an interjection from me, that the Prime Minister was willing to mention submarines at all. No one could be deceived by the stupid explanation that he endeavoured to give to cover up that situation. He was not willing to mention the significance of communication with submarines. It was only on 17th May that the Prime Minister was willing to mention that the actual decision to fire Polaris missiles from the submarines would be made by the President of the United States, and that that decision would have to be conveyed to those submarines through this radio station. It is only as a result of the Opposition's action that fhe true facts have emerged. But for the action of the Opposition, the people of Australia would have had no knowledge of what was involved in this proposition. The Government would have chosen to ignore and to brush aside the interests of the Australian people in matters of foreign policy, as it has always done whenever it could. Let me sum up briefly what the Opposition says this base is. First, it is a station which is designed and will be built mainly for the purposes of sending signals to fire Polaris missiles from submarines. Those signals will come only from the President of the United were described by the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mr Macmillan, on 18th November, 1960, as ""mobile underwater rocket bases "". "" That is what Polaris is,"" said Mr Macmillan. This afternoon somebodyI think it was the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser)-sai d that the Prime Minister of Great Britain was not nearly as frank as this Government had been. But if we read the records of the House of Commons in November, 1960, we will find a great deal of frankness from him teen missiles and each one of them has a warhead equivalent to between 600,000 tons and 1,000,000 tons of TNT. or, in fact, a warhead 30 to 40 times the size of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.",90,Labour At The Cross Roads
190,Mr Forbes,"This was all well known..one from anything said in this House. Not one honourable member on the Government side mentioned these things until forced to do so. Not one of them was prepared at any stage to discuss these things until they were forced into the light of day by the Opposition. The position is that this radio station is, as it has well been described, the Achilles heel of the nuclear weapon system in this part of the world. It involves almost certainly the inevitability of attack. Why does it involve this? Because if an enemy can get in first and strike this radio station with nuclear weapons, he can prevent the signal from being sent from the President of the United States of America to the submarines to fire. The station will be the first priority target of any enemy concerned in a war. It is extremely unlikely that nuclear weapons which would be fired at this station would be limited to Western Australia. The whole of Australia is likely to be involved and therefore I say that from now on the future of Australia is completely changed. This decision vitally involves Australia in any nuclear war that might occur. Previously, there was a chance that we would be left out. There was a chance that, in the event of nuclear war, Australia would not be attacked with nuclear weapons. The whole case for isolation from nuclear war has been brushed aside by the Minister for External Affairs and other Ministers who csnsider there is no validity in it. But there is a chance of a very great validity in the case for isolating Australia from nuclear war. This is a responsibility that each and every one of us has to this country. If we can bring about survival in a nuclear war by exclusion from nuclear attack, that should be our prime responsibility. This is the view of people of great sincerity in many parts of Australia, but it has been held up and distorted by members like the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), who have rat-trap minds, as inevitable evidence of Communist association. The Australian Labour Party has had the courage and the guts to face a situation that hardly any honourable member on the Government side considered was a moral question at all. Supporters of the Government take everything as a matter of routine -the routine of the cold war emerging from one position to another inevitably without any thought of the moral questions involved. But the Labour Party did ""not take that easy view of the situation. It faced up to all the consequences of the moral decisions involved. Many people, Christians and pacifists, with greater concern for their fellow men than any one on the Government side can claim to have, also have taken up this position. That is evidence that this view does not identify any one with communism. The Australian people from one end of the continent to another must now awaken from apathy and disinterest. Nuclear war is now a vital question for Australia and its people as it never has been before. If there is one thing involved in the acceptance of this base it is that we will not be able comfortably to avoid our responsibility for making decisions because we will not be able so easily to consider that we are isolated and that we can think of lighter and easier things. We are facing-and will ^e facing every day from now ona position which might lead to our own complete and total destruction. Therefore, we must seek to have more say in our affairs and to put the Australian point of view more clearly and positively. No longer can we be disinterested and unconcerned. We will not bc able to leave things to the United States or somebody else. We must be concerned-and vitally concerned-in these matters from now on. We must seek and work more than ever for disarmament. We must question the assumption that all the faults in respect of disarmament are on one side only. We must seek the establishment of conditions in our association with other countries. The Australian Labour Party recognizes that we are involved-by world events and by this bill-in everything that goes on in the world to-day. But we should not ba involved without conditions. We are involved in an alliance and an association in which we are parties principal and not minor characters. We are involved as a co-operating partner and not as a neutral satellite. What conditions does the Labour Party identify as essential in this situation? These conditions emerge after very detailed and great consideration-consideratio n for which honourable members on the Government side have no respect. They brush these conditions aside as unimportant and",91,Labour At The Cross Roads
191,Mr Cairns,"It was not known by anyinsignificant-matter s about which they were not prepared to have party meetings. They sneer at faceless people outside, but those faceless people are citizens of Australia. They are members of the general public who have the same rights and liberties as any one who has been in the gallery of this House during this debate. They have the same feeling of responsibility and the same dedication to the interests of Australia as any one else can claim. This term "" faceless people"" indicates the lack of respect that Government supporters have for the ordinary common citizen outside this place. According to Government supporters, people must have special distinctions to escape from this classification "" faceless"". One of the conditions established by the Australian Labour Party is that Australian sovereignty must be maintained. One has only to look at this agreement to see that there is no sovereignty in it. We believe that Australia's involvement in war is a question for Australia alone to decide at all times, and that in the event of war, Australian territories and facilities shall not be used to involve Australia in war without the prior knowledge and consent of the Australian Government. Who will say that these conditions should not obtain? They have always been of great significance to Australia. It was a Labour government which established an Australian Navy to avoid being subject to or part of the British Navy. In the much discussed question of Manus Island, the question of sovereignty was vital. I shall quote from '* Hansard"" of 17th February, 1949. The strength of the Labour Partys' decision on Manus Island was based on the opinion of Sir Thomas Blarney who had been commanding officer of the land forces in the South-West Pacific area. Sir Thomas said on 7th July, 1947Tlie Commonwealth would be following a very short-sighted policy if it established joint control of Manus with the United States. Manus Island is vital to the defence of Australia and should be held solely under Australian control. That was the issue involved in relation to Manus at the time, and the decision taken by the Labour Government in Australia was one it was advised and recommended to take by senior military officers. To-day we stand upon the tradition of Australian sovereignty, the tradition of not being involved in war unless the Australian Government makes the decision. That is the condition on which the whole structure of Australia has been built over the years and we do not intend to give it up now. What is the Government's attitude? Does it attempt to deny the validity of any of these principles? Not one word of denial bas come from the Government side of tbe validity of the principles that have been so well stated by ths Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) in this debate. Not one member on the Government side has chosen tc debate, examine or deny any of these conditions. The only answer Government supporters have chosen to give to the position taken by the Lahour Party is that these conditions are impossible and that the United States of America would not accept ther». Has the Government tried to get the United States to accept them? Is there any evidence that the Minister for External Affairs or anybody else has said that the United States has ever asked for those conditions? The Opposition has produced some disturbing facts for condemnation by the Parliament and the people. We were able to produce facts to show that the agreement between Mr Attlee and President Truman in 1951 concerning the stationing of bombers in England gave the British Government the right to say whether the bombers would take off on a mission or not. We produced the quite startling evidence for the research conscious members on the Government sidethere are one or two of them, according to the best informed papers-that the Thor missiles stationed in Britain in 1951 were not United Kingdom missiles. In"" Keesing's Contemporary Archives"" at page 16063, the following statement appearsThe agreement for the supply of United States ballistic missiles lo the United Kingdom was signed in Washington on February 22nd. That agreement has been quoted several times by honourable members on this side of the House. Clause7 saysThe decision to launch these missiles will be a matter for joint decision by the two Governments. Mr Duncan Sandys said the Government and not some military officers would make the decision. We were able to show (hat this position obtained also with Polaris missiles. This was done by directly quoting from column 602 of the House of Commons ""Hansard"" of 4th November, 1960. Mr has, to put the position of Great Britain, Watkinson, the Minister for Defence saidTo come to the detailed problem of control, I must return to what the Prime Minister said on lst November. He said that the Prime Minister for some reason or other did not make a complete statement about the position. The honourable member for Wannon has been using the incomplete statement of the Prime Minister to establish his position. For the information of the research conscious member for Wannon and those people who were able to assist him, I point out that Mr Watkinson said. . . I do not think that he That is, the Prime Ministeractually mentioned this, but perhaps I might make it plain to the House that our control within territorial waters is absolute. We have a firm assurance that these missiles would not be fired in doubt looked at the ANZUS treaty and saw any circumstances in United Kingdom territorial waters. In contrast to this, we are erecting a communications station in Western Australia which will be used to fire not one submarine's missiles but the missiles of every submarine in that area. We are erecting a device that would invite retaliation and attack far more than anything at Holy Loch in Scotland would. But the United Kingdom was concerned to obtain an undertaking from the United States that missiles would not be fired in territorial waters without the consent of the British Government. On the other hand, the Australian Government has been prepared to accept a base which will be used to fire the nuclear missiles of perhaps ten or twelve submarines in various parts of the Indian Ocean without asking for any undertaking or guarantee whatever. The Opposition has been able to show by quotations from ""Keesing's Contemporary Archives"", of which details have been given, that an agreement similar to that with the British Government applied to Greece, Turkey, Italy and even Spain. It was made quite clear that the agreement to give joint control to those countries was not limited to conditions other than those of emergency. Joint control applied to the emergency use of the missiles just as much as it applied to other uses. The Australian Government has ehosen to do what these could have come closer to the United other countries were not willing to do. The Government has been willing, as it always the United States or some other of its great friends before Australia's position. We have a greater respect for many of these nations than has the Government. I will put my respect for and understanding of the United States second to no member on the other side of the House. For many years before I came here I lectured on the United States and I came to understand the significance of the United States, I am sure, far more than has any one on the other side of the House, with few exceptions. I will put my affection for the best side of the United States in no way second to that of any one on the other side of the House. What is the nature of this bill? It is an agreement in which the Government has asked for nothing. The Government no an undertaking by the United States to do something in accordance with its moral obligation. The Government had a wonderful opportunity with this agreement to add something to what it already had, but the Government was not prepared to take the opportunity. It was not prepared to seek from the United States an agreement to consult on events leading up to an emergency situation. Every one knows that in the last fifteen or thirty minutes of a crisis-w e should hope it will never come -consultatio n cannot take place, but consultation can take place before that situation is reached. We know that on the three occasions when nuclear weapons were likely to be used, consultation had to take place. Mr Attlee had to go to Washington in 1951 when the Korea crisis arose. Mr Eden had to go to Washington in 1954 when the Dien Bien Phu situation arose. And lo and behold, who did we find in Washington in 1955 telling the American Government that it should not consider nuclear weapons in the second Formosan crisis? We found the Prime Minister of Australia there doing it very secretly, telling no one and not even making any obtainable public reports. Some provision for consultation cciild have been included in this agreement. We in the events that might lead up to a crisis as a result of something that could have been put in the agreement. But nothing of that sort is attempted. This was left, no doubt, to the legal luminary, the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) who is more concerned, I should think, with legal terminology than he is with the empirical representation of Australia's interests in international affairs. So we have States. The agreement for Australia is negagained nothing in this agreement. We could have had something in the agreement about territorial changes in Australia and in Australia's Territories. We could have sought an agreement from the United States that it would not look favourably upon any territorial changes to the north of Australia. We could in that way perhaps have gained some specific and positive security in relation to Indonesia. But no one on the Government side considers that any of these matters are necessary. The Government is quite willing to take whatever the United States is prepared to hand out. But presumably no Minister or any member on the Government side is willing to put Australia's interests sufficiently far forward to ask for more than the United States is prepared to give. base? base if this can be achieved, but we are not in favour of a base that gives Australia nothing in exchange for this vital undertaking which we have given to the United States. honourable member's time has expired. This agreement is completely one-sided and unbalanced. It gives to the United States something that is of vital importance to the United States, but it gets for Australia nothing that is important to Australia, except some extension of the moral understanding and undertaking that exists between us and the United States. Here was a golden opportunity to develop the Australian contractual treaty relations with the United States still further. Here was an opportunity to obtain something in this agreement that would have given us an assurance of United States assistance against aggression should it take place. But there is nothing of this. All we have is what was in the ANZUS treaty. This is a provision that the constitutional procedures of the country shall be used to determine what takes place. It is worth noting that in the ANZUS treaty there is a requirement that constitutional procedures will be used by both countries, but there is no requirement in this agreement that any constitutional procedures will be used. This agreement is completely empty of content and it is not worth the paper it is written on, as far as Australia is concerned. This is a vital undertaking for the United tive, conditional, indefinite and vague, but for the United States it is positive, substantial and of vast importance to that country. I refuse to believe that any government concerned to act in the best interests of Australia could not have done better than this. 1 am absolutely certain that the United States would have responded to a positive control in relation to this station. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) has challenged the Government to hold an election upon this issue. Is the Government going to take up that challenge? Let us fight an election on the issue of Australia's sovereignty and the right of Australia to avoid being involved in a war unless the Australian Government decides to be so involved. Let us fight an election on the issue of whether Australia will be subject to annihilation without proper representation. That challenge has been issued to the Government, but there is no sign whatever of the Government accepting it. a.m.] -The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns), in his usual way, has endeavoured to skip over the points that do not support his argument and to lay great stress on those that do.

I remind honourable members that the report on this survey says something entirely different.

Not only are Labour members obliged to obey those directions, but fear of losing their endorsements keeps even moderate members in line. I think it was a revelation to many people when they read in the press of the overwhelming number of Victorian Labour Party moderates in this House who toed the Victorian ALP. line on this issue. I remind the House that the six delegates to the federal conference who came from Victoria voted en bloc against this radio station, unconditionally. It was this kind of direction, particularly on foreign affairs and defence, that caused the 1955 split and the formation of the Democratic Labour Party, which also was trying to tell the Australian public this story. Now at least we have a searing spotlight on the crisis between the right and left-wing factions in the Australian Labour Party. This has caused the picture to stand out in stark reality, and this debate has removed any doubt that the policies of the Australian Labour Party are laid down by this 36-man body. The majority of them are trade union leaders and too many of them are representatives of Communist-controlled unions. This 19 to 17 decision in favour of this station shows how policy can be affected by the whim of one man. I think it shocked the majority of the people of Australia to learn how deeply the Communists have infiltrated into the Labour Party about? hate to see a party that was once so strong now split in this fashion by the Commuattempts to undermine our defence efforts. nists. Let us have a look at what has happened in this set-up; let us have a look at what happened to the Leader of the the Australian and New Zealand Congress Opposition. Having his hand on the pulse for International Co-operation and Disof public opinion, he detected a change in armament. This body was affiliated with the the attitude of the public towards the World Peace Council, a body which was defence of this country and decided that banned by the British Labour Party as being perhaps the present ALP. policy was not a Communist organization. It pursued a exactly what was wanted and he had better change it. While trying to change horses in mid-stream, he said, in effect, ""We must get away from our ordinary policy of cutting down the defence vote and so on, and we must push the Government for not having more adequate defence and for not having fully equipped forces"". But he reckoned without these 36 so-called faceless men who direct the policy of the party, and .he overlooked the fact that the left-wing group of this federal council was so set on denying the United States of America this communication centre at North West Cape. As I have said, as a result of this exercise there is widespread alarm in Australia to find out just how far Communist infiltration has progressed towards turning the Australian Labour Party into a popular front party. HereI refer to what Senator Cavanagh said in the Senate on 7th November, 1962. He is reported at pages 1269 and 1270 of "" Hansard"" of that date as having saidI am enunciating Labour policy . . . whether we like it or not. Communism reigns over a large portion of the globe. At the present time Communism has ambitions. It is not getting on too well with what we call Western democracies, but whether we like it or not it is an established part of the world system to-day and we must learn to live wilh it or perish. A policy of so-called peaceful co-existence! There is no need to traverse again the factual and recorded instances, which are too numerous to mention, in which Labour policy is on all fours with that of the Communists. Nor is there need to prove how many limes the Labour Party has attacked the Government for spending too much money on the defence of this country. No one will deny the 1945 campaign election Dr. Evatt, who wanted to cut the defence vote by £100,000,000 per annum to increase social services, or the many other [Quorum formed.] I wish now to refer to a body known as",96,Labour At The Cross Roads
197,Mr Galvin,"What are you so happy bid of the former Leader of the Opposition,",97,Labour At The Cross Roads
198,Mr Stokes,"I am not happy; I justcampaign for disarmament, but completely neglected the fact that both nuclear and conventional weapons should be included and that a system of international inspections is required. It attacks the free world which agrees to both these requirements, and it pursues policies on side with Russia, which is the only power standing out against those requirements. Some few months ago, I was rather surprised to receive a letter from the town clerk of a municipality in which I understand eleven of the twelve councillors were elected on Labour endorsement. This letter, which is signed officially by the town clerk, states that he has been directed by his council to inform me that the council supports this organization's point of view calling for a reduction of the provision of £200,000,000 which is made in respect of defence each year. To that letter was attached a letter from the Australian and New Zealand Congress for International Co-operation and Disarmament which statesOur purpose will be to impress upon tha. GovernMunro Bryant. It is stated at the top of this ment and the Opposition the need for National Budgets to take into serious consideration the allocation of moneys in such manner as to meet the urgent requirements of the peoples in many fields such as education, health, social services, &c. From our point of view much of this can be achieved by re-thinking all the situations which cause our Government to spend no less than £200 million on defence per annum. This letter is signed by a man named S. Goldbloom, and I remind the House that this Mr S. Goldbloom stood for election as Labour candidate for the La Trobe electorate in 1958. At the last general election, he stood as a Labour Party candidate for the Senate. He is the secretary of the Australian and New Zealand Congress for International Co-operation and Disarmament, which has been condemned by the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies), the Attorney-General( Sir Garfield Barwick), and Mr Casey, now Lord Casey, when he was Minister for External Affairs, as a straight-out Communist-front organization. This Mr Goldbloom rejoined the Victorian Labour Party, and, as I have said, contested the La Trobe seat as the endorsed ALP. candidate in 1958. He rejoined the Labour Party after the 1955 split. His endorsement was objected to by the chairman of the ALP. Migrant Advisory Council in Victoria, Mr Bono Wiener; and the secretary of that council accused Mr Ten members of the Melbourne University ALP. Goldbloom of being a hidden Communist. They requested the Victorian Labour Executive to withdraw Mr Goldbloom's endorsement. The result was that the two migrant leaders were expelled from the ALP., its Migrant Advisory Council was disbanded and Mr Goldbloom was allowed to contest the seat of La Trobe as a Labour candidate. This was the man who had been associated with the ALP. He is the man who is sponsoring this campaign for a reduction in the vote of £200,000,000 a year for defence. Perhaps that might not seem so strange, but I received from the same organization another letter dated 2nd April, 1963, which invited me to joint its ban-the-bomb march into the city. This letter from the Northern Regional Committee of the Australia and New Zealand Congress for International Co-operation and Disarmament is signed by a former mayor of the same municipality as that to which I have referred. The chairman of this committee is a man to whom we have listened in this House to-night, the honourable member for Wills, Mr Gordon letter that Mr G. Bryant, M.H.R., is the chairman of the organization. He is a man who speaks here with two tongues. He has been to New South Wales and has addressed the Australian Defence League on the need to build up our defences in this country. Yet he comes here and speaks of principles, although he is chairman of an organization which is anti-Australian and which condemns expenditure on defence and wants to have the defence vote reduced. Is that the kind of thing that we may expect from honourable members opposite who speak to us about principles and sovereignty? These people have no principles whatsoever. I challenge the honourable member to deny that he is chairman of the northern regional committee of the Australian and New Zealand Congress for International Co-operation and Disarmament. Do not run away with the idea fhat only we on this side of the House have branded this organization as a Communist-front organization. I have in my hand a photostat copy of an item in the Melbourne "" Sun News-Pictorial "" of 22nd April last in which it is stated, in reference to the banthe-bomb-marchclub slipped into the march ahead'of the Seamen's Union contingent as it left the Trades HaU. They carried placards condemning all nuclear testing, Russian included, and attacking Communist colonialism-""No Foreign Troops in Angola, Hungary"" . . . "" Chinese Colonialism-Tibet, India, next?"" The students' pamphlet said: "" It is obvious that would have been a very good idea if the the ANZ Congress is not an organization genuinely interested in peace. It is"" a phony ' front' organization "". So the Melbourne University ALP. club also condemned the organization as a Communist-front organization, or a phony front organization. The honourable member opposite of whom I have been speaking, and who perhaps has had a better chance than have other honourable members opposite to evaluate the defence needs of this country member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth). and to give a lead to his party, is tied up We excuse him, because we know that with an organization which is definitely antiunder every caTpet, in every waste paper Australian and pro-Communist. That is basket and under every table he sees a typical of the Aunt Sallys which the Communist. Opposition has put up on all sides. I am afraid that the Opposition, in taking the stand that it has on this bill, is merely trying to save face with its 36 executive members. It is rather horrifying to think for the purpose of trying once more to gull that, but for one vote in this House, the the people into believing that the Australian Opposition would be the Government, and Labour Party is a Communist party.

Of course, the facts have emerged on this side of the House, from the masterly exposition of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) and from every member of the Labour Party who has taken part in the debate.

We are fighting to ensure that we shall not be involved in war unless we have the right to say we shall be involved, or unless the Government has that right.

202,Mr Luchetti,"The Government isStates spokesmen have made no statements whatever that would lead anybody to believe that the United States would not have accepted Labour's conditions. On the contrary, it would have accepted them, and we in the Australian Labour Party believe that when we are elected to govern at the next general election we shall be able to re-negotiate the agreement on the principles that we have stated. We are satisfied that the United States Government will accept our conditions, and we pray that this Government will go to an election on this issue, for we are sure that Labour will be elected to govern if it does. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Stokes) said quite clearly that a gallup poll had shown that 80 per cent, of the people of Australia favoured the establishment of the base. I was one of those who made up the 80 per cent. Let me say to the honourable member for Maribyrnong and other honourable members opposite who are full of these accusations, including the honourable member for Moore, who is not in his own seat, by the way, Sir, that the best gallup poll is an election. Let us have an election. That is the gallup poll that tells the story. If honourable members on the Government side of the House want an election, let us have it. We shall welcome it, and we shall come back with strength and the numbers and shall form a government. The Government has been very evasive on the whole matter of this base. It is quite clear that if the Australian Labour Party had not taken the initiative the people of Australia would not know anything at all about the base. The gleaning of information began on 16th March, 1961, when the honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren) asked the Minister for Defence( Mr Until the Labor Party debate few Australians Townley) a question on the matter. The Minister answeredThere has been no request from the United States Government to this Government for any station of any sort in the north of Australia. On 15th August, 1961, the honourable member asked the Minister a further question about the base, and the Minister repliedI refer the honourable member to the statement that I made in the Parliament in September of last year. United On 6th September, 1961, the honourable member again asked the Minister a question on the subject. The Minister, in the course of his answer, statedThere is no intention of using anything but a conventional power source for such a station. On 27th March, 1962, the honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney), who is Government Whip, asked the Minister for Defence a question about the base, and the Minister, in his reply, made a better statement about the matter. On 17th May, 1962, the Prime Minister made a statement OH the subject. But none of the things said on behalf of the. Government on all occasions was clear, and each piece of information was dragged out by questions asked mainly by honourable members on this side of the House. On 28th August, 1962, the honourable member for Reid asked a further question and received some sort of an answer. Throughout, all that was said was evasive and nothing was clear. On 1st May, 1963, the Sydney ""Daily Mirror"" published an article under the headlinesWriter accuses PM. Deception over US radio base. The article was in these termsNEW YORK, Tuesday -The Australian Government deceived the public over the US radio base at Learmonth, West Australia, according to the American magazine Reporter.

The news, as the Government had hoped and planned, had excited little interest Beyond the Prime Minister's deliberately vague description neither the Australian Labor Party nor the public had been given any information. To all intents and purposes it was just a costly radio station, said Warner. By attempting to conceal what was bound to come cut one day, the Government had brought charges that it was a ventriloquist's doll for Washington. Warner said that the Government's strange behaviour showed its deep anxiety over current trends in Asia.",100,Labour At The Cross Roads

One of the planks in our platform is joint control. We believe that joint control of this station is consistent with dignity and Australian tradition. We believe joint control to be in line with agreements made under the North Atlantic Treaty by Britain* and Italy and under the Central Treaty Organization by Turkey. The honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Jess) said, "" Nobody can lind these agreements "". I have in my hand a copy of an agreement for the supply of United States ballistic missiles to the United Kingdom. My possession of it almost compels me to say that the honourable member perjured himself. Not only I but also many other honourable members have copies of this agreement.

James Harrison) quoted the agreement last Thursday evening, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) and other honourable members quoted it to-day. Lest (he honourable member for La Trobe doubt me, I point out that I have obtained a copy of the agreement in an extract from "" Keesing's Contemporary Archives"", 8th to 15th March, 1958, at page 16063. The relevant part of the extract reads as follows:An agreement for the supply of US. ballistic missiles to the United Kingdom was signed in Washington on Feb. 22 by Mr Christian A. Herter, US.

Any such joint decision will be made in the light of the circumstances at the time and having regard to the undertaking the two Governments have assumed in Article5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. The Prime Minister and various Government supporters have said that joint control will not be practicable. I have shown that in the agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States joint control is believed to be practicable. The same principle is inherent in other agreements made between the United States of America and other Nato countries and between the United States of America and Turkey. Only recently, there emanated from Washington a suggestion for a direct telephone line between the White House and the Kremlin so that the President of the United States could ring Mr Khrushchev or Mr Khrushchev could ring the President, lf that is practicable it is just as practicable to have a telephone line between the White House and the Lodge in Canberra, so that the President of America can ring up the Prime Minister. I bet the telephone would be engaged every time he rang! But the President could ring up the Prime Minister if he wanted to and make direct contact. Let us be partners in this undertaking, not a lackey, and not a passenger. Let us assert ourselves for once in this contribution we make for the defence of the country in which we are so vitally interested. Is it not important that we should retain our dignity? Is it not important that we should retain our standing? The honourable member for Swan is interjecting. How would he know of those things?

The Australian Labour Party is totally opposed to Australia being involved in war by mistake, by default or by the decision of any other government. We must make up our own mind. We support the ANZUS pact. We believe in the mutual defence treaty that exists between Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America. We believe in all of those things. in this base? in this speech that I am for the base, but he is either deaf or has been asleep. None so stupid as he who will not learn! Admiral Sides was here recently and was reported in the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" of 6th May as saying that the base would not be a priority target. He did not give us a written guarantee of that. He did not guarantee that it would not be a military target; he just said that it would not. But when I turn to the Sydney ""Sun"" of 2nd April, 1963, I read the following item under the heading "" Australia as Red Target""Australia could be one of the first targets in a That is nearly 4,000 fewer in the permanent "" nuclear blitzkreig"" planned by Russia in the forces in 1962-63 after an expenditure of event of war. A Soviet blueprint for mass destruction of the United States and missile attacks on its allies was revealed to-day in the authoritative American forces numbered 27,572, and the citizen magazine, "" US. News and World Report"". The Labour Party maintains that Australia ought to be consulted, and that we should not be involved in war when we have not given our decision. I think that that is reasonable. Any reasonable man agrees that we should object to any attempt by the Government to give away Australia's right to make a decision as to whether it should be involved in war. Finally, Sir time. To explain something to the honourable member for Moore will take twice as long as it would take to explain the matter to anybody else. Each Government supporter who has spoken in this debate has expressed his gratitude that at last we have something good in the way of defence. Each one has suggested that when we get this base we will really have something in respect of defence. Is it not pretty horrible that this Government, after being in office for fourteen years, and after spending more than £2,500,000,000 of the taxpayers* money, has to say to the world, in effect: "" We are completely defenceless. Our only salvation is to get America in. We cannot do anything for ourselves."" Government supporters have been saying all day that we are defenceless and that we cannot do anything for ourselves. They have not said that we have spent on defence more than £2,500,000,000 over a period of fourteen years, but they have said, in effect, that we have no defence. They all are very thankful that America is to build this base. Let us have a look at the record of this Government on defence. I quote from the defence statistics circulated by the Minister for Defence( Mr Townley) for the years 1950-51 to 1960-61. I shall not quote all the information. In the Royal Australian Navy in 1952 there were 14,144 personnel in the permanent forces and 7,398 in the citizen forces making a total of 21,542. The estimated average strength in 1962-63 was 11,392 in the permanent forces and 6,543 in the citizen forces giving a total of 17,935. £2,500,000,000 on defence! In the Army in June, 1952, the permanent forces 42,858, making a total of 70,430. In 1962-63 the estimated average strength for the Army is, permanent forces 22,100, citizen forces 30,370, making a total of 52,470. So there are 18,000 fewer men after ten years in which the Government has spent £2,500,000,000 on defence! Deputy Speaker, how much this recital hurts the honourable members opposite but I must give them this medicine, because it may wake them up to the needs of Australia. In the Royal Australian Air Force in 1952 the permanent forces numbered 15,527, and citizen forces 5,512 making a total of 21,039.

Let us be satisfied to accept what Government members themselves have said.

(2) Our air defences are negligible, our aircraft are obsolete, and our Navy, although about to be expanded, is seriously underpowered. (3) The Australian Government is not spending an adequate amount of its revenue on defence. Is it not dreadful that men in America are saying that the American Armed Services Committee has come out with the report indicting this Government for its lack of defence preparations? Now, in this debate, we are discussing what articles there ought to be in the agreement. The Labour Party says clearly that we should preserve Australia's dignity and standing. Let us put some effort into our fighting to-day, as the veterans and pioneers did in the early days. Let us say to the people of the world, and certainly to the Government of the United States: "" We are not going to give away any part of our sovereignty. We are asking you to trust us and you ask us to trust you."" If there is to be mutual friendship let us say to America: "" This is a matter of mutual trust You trust us and we will trust you. Let us together control the orders that will go from this base to submarines to send Polaris missiles to the enemy. Let us do it together. Let us say to ourselves as good friends, that we trust each other and that the base will be under our joint control."" Let Australia stand up with its full personality and say that when we want to be involved in a war, our Government will be the Government to say so. The Labour Party will support the base, but we will move amendments because we believe it to be consistent with dignity that Australia should say, "" Let us hope that the Government in its wisdom will fight properly for the premember for Phillip( Mr Einfeld), who is a of his colleagues in this debate.

Before that happens, Sir, may I say briefly something about the struggle that has been waged by certain sections of the community to prevent the acceptance of this request by the United States Government? Let me repeat that by permitting the building of this base for defence purposes the Government will ensure that we do not surrender any part of Australia's sovereignty. When built, the base will be operated solely by Americans, but it will be available also to our defence forces. The United States of America will enjoy security and freedom of operation, but the terms of the concession specifically prevent the base from bemg built up as a base for attack, either by rockets or warships.",103,Labour At The Cross Roads

It is this fact which seems to have caused so much anguish in the Communist Party in Australia. It is this aspect that I want to refer to for a few minutes, because I believe that people outresist its demands. I remind you, Sir, of side Australia are most concerned about the influence that this party wields in our country. It has been exemplified in this debate to an alarming degree. One of the wonders of Australian politics, particularly only party in this Parliament that has dared to people who live outside this country, is that such a small party as the Communist Party, not represented in this Parliament or in the State Parliaments, can exert such influence in the community. Let me take this a little further. In April of this year the Tasmanian State Conference of the Communist Party was held in Hobart, and the General President of the Australian Communist Party, Mr Dixon, made it perfectly clear that his party opposed the building of the base at North West Cape. He said that in the event of war between the People's Republic of China or the Soviet Union and the free world-as represented by the United Statesnuclear submarines could be directed to their targets from the base. He went further and said that there is only one position tiDn in the Pacific and in South-East Asia, Australia can take up on this question, and that is not to have any part in what he described falsely as "" arsenals of nuclear weapons or bases in our territory"". He recommended that the Communist Party unite its forces to demand the abolition of the base. I want to draw your attention, Mr Speaker, and the attention of this House, to the words of the General President of the Communist Party at the Hobart Conference, as recorded in "" The Tribune"" of 24th April. His concern was not for Australia's security, but for what would happen to the Soviet Union in the event of wara country that is already armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons. Within a few days of this statement House what appeared to be a concerted being made in Hobart, at least five memmove to attack the project. The honourable bers of the Opposition brought petitions to member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) explained this Parliament couched in terms similar to to the House in some detail last November those expressed at the Communist Party how his party's executive was opposed to conference in Hobart. These members, I the purposes of the base. In clear ringing would say, either believe in the terms of tones he told us that there was no division those petitions, or, if they do not, believe in the Labour Party on this matter and there that the influence of the Communist Party had never been a suggestion of a division is so strong that they dare not resist its demands. That, to me, is one of the greatest dangers confronting the people of Australia to-day. The influence of the Communist organization is so great that certain sections of the community fear to the petitions that were brought into this House by members of the Opposition only a few days after that conference, and I point out that the Opposition party is the to bring in any petitions relating to that conference. It is obvious from what has been said in this debate that there have been for some time now developments within the apparatus of the Australian Labour Party which future political scientists will examine with awe and wonder. I want now to refer to the cliff-hanging, if I may so describe it, attempt of the Australian Labcur Party junta to lift off the load of its left wing, so that it can struggle into some sort of position in which to face the Australian people. This struggle is concerned largely with defence and has produced some very weird results indeed Were the issues not extremely serious, with vital overtones for Australia's future posithe results would be really laughable. You. will recall, Sir, that the situation arose from the fact that the Labour Party vehe-. mently objected, irrespective of what face it may put on the matter during this debate, to the establishment of a radio station at North West Cape, to be a joint United States and Australian station. The establishment of this naval communication centre was agreed to by this Government at the behest of the United States. It will be recalled that the Prime Minister subsequently announced the general terms of the agreement which was to be made. This was hardly done before some members of the Labour Party began in this I am sure that the honourable member for Parkes sincerely meant this at the time, and wishes that he could still be so forceful about it. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren) and others have already given us a pretty fair picture of a party taking a very definite stand on this matter. It was about eight weeks ago-in Marchthat the fascinating developments began to occur, when a division was supposed not to exist. Serious breaches occurred and the most influential "" No base in WA."" supporter, Mr Chamberlain, was outvoted by one vote on the executive. No less a person than the honourable member for Watson( Mr Cope), Sir, tells us that the honourable member for Parkes, the honourable member for Reid and others were mistaken about policy on this big issue. Some one, he said, had posted misleading information on the party notice-board. That is what the honourable member for Watson told us. This inconvenient policy of opposing the communication base, I believe, was never Labour policy. The inference is that in future the honourable member for Parkes and the honourable member for Reid, I suggest, had better make sure that they are looking at the right board in their party rbom. The Leader of the Opposition himself, in a public statement a few weeks ago, on the North West Cape project, put a wonderful ring of irony into his words when he said , "" The Labour Party is realistic "". Sir, 1 so am I . I do not believe that anything in the Labour Party has changed. I believe that the hard core of Australian Labour Party opinion is still committed to the wuzzy idealism of the "" ban-the bomb-ers"", the traditional isolationism of "" It can't happen here "", the dangerous lethargy of the policy that we had better be red than dead, or to such stuff as has been confided to this House by the honourable member for Reid, that we need have no fear of the people of red China, although there are Indians dead on Indian soil to prove him so tragically wrong. I-have sat here for years and heard coming from the Opposition all these ideas about nuclear-free zones and the uselessness of the South-Bast Asia Treaty Organization. I cannot believe that a mere Duggan dodge is going to get honourable members opposite to sing a different tune. F.3823/63 -R. [61] I should like, Sir, to direct particular attention to the bid made by the Australian Labour Party in its statements after its recent head-count in Canberra, linking the North West Cape communication centre with the stockpiling in Australia of nuclear weapons. This is the bit of the statement that escaped treatment at the hands of the new image-makers. This is an indication of our old friends, the woolly-minded lefties at work. For years it has been the Communist and near-Communist role in Australia to drag the peculiar terror of nuclear weapons into defence and foreign policy issues. The idea is to frighten people just for the sake of frightening them, because frightened people can be relied on not to face issues. Fear saps resolution; fear dulls initiative; fear is a weapon-so runs Communist thinking on these matters. Let us say loudly and clearly where the truth lies. There never has been any suggestion that the North West Cape base would be a centre for stockpiling nuclear weapons. There has been no suggestion that any stockpile of nuclear weapons be established in Australia. The North West Cape base will be an important part of a world pattern of defence establishments; but then, Sir, it will not, after all, be the first such establishment in Australia. Largely at the instigation of this Government, there are already in Australia many important defence establishments at which vital research and development work is going on. We are already deeply committed to a complex, programme with the United States of America, Great Britain and other countries of the Atlantic alliance. This programme covers missile development and manufacture, space research and satellite launching. The Labour Party will find, Sir, now that it has decided for a time to try to get back into the defence picture, that things have changed vastly since it was ousted from government. When I recall how pettishly a Labour government forced our American allies to abandon their base at Manus IslandI ask: How can these people be trusted? The evidence is clear that if they ever get back into power they will do, in regard to the North West base, what they did in regard to Manus Island. It is my profound hope that nothing will happen to interrupt the programme of defence development. The powerful, thwarted left-wing of the ALP., on its own undertaking, will certainly cut our defences if it gets a chance. What the Labour Party leader says on national and international policy in this chamber no longer matters. It is not worth a row of beans. What does matter is what the radical, left-wing Labour executive says. What matters is what the 36 men say, as evidenced recently in Canberra, when the Leader of the Opposition was kept waiting for days outside a meeting convened to tell him what he could say and what he could not say about the North West Cape agreement. IfI understand the Leader of the Opposition aright, he is now trying to enunciate a defence doctrine based on a new foreign relations concept of limited liability. What he seems to be saying is, "" We will not be committed beyond the point that we name "". The idea of limited liability, Sir, was developed by the lawyers about 100 years ago. It proved to be a first-class way of enabling people to limit their risk when entering a foreign enterprise. But does anyone seriously believe that this cautionary contrivance of commercial conduct can be made the basis for international policy and international treaties? Can we offer a hand to be shaken on condition that it is not shaken too hard? In other words, the Labour Party leader believes that our attitude to the North West Cape project should be to encourage the United States Government to spend £33,000,000 on'the construction of a low frequency communication station, but if the United States Government wishes to use the station for conveying messages in order to defend its country from nuclear attack, it must first ask the permission of the Australian Government. And if Labour happens to be in power, it would be a question of referring the matter to an outside executive of 36 men. I believe, Sir, that we can give a lead to international conduct from commercial practices, a lead that has special significance in this dangerous, sudden world in which we live. I believe that our principle in treaty obligations should be that of partnershipjoint agreement of the utmost good faith, with nothing held back and everything comnoticemitted. The Government, without apology, regards the United States as our parnter, just monwealth as much as is Britain. Over and above the wives and members of their families? details of any treaty, we make no secret of the fact that we are morally pledged to our partnership with all our resources. There is no withholding, no limited liability. Let me end on this-note: We have faith in our partner, a faith which is as important as our commitments; and I strongly believe that that is the feeling, that permeates the minds of most of the people of Australia. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and committed pro forma; progress reported. Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. House adjourned at 1.41 a.m. (Wednesday). The following answers to questions were circulated:Use of Commonwealth Vehicles. Mr Ward asked the Prime Minister, upon notice1. Are ex-Ministers provided with Commonwealth car transport between their homes and an airport, railway station or wharf only when proceeding to or from a sitting of the Parliament? 2. Have any ex-Ministers in the lastfiveyears been provided with Commonwealth car transport outside this concession? 3. If so, what are the details, including the purpose for which the Commonwealth car was made available? Sir Robert Menzies -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. In the case of travel to and from Canberra, Commonwealth motor car transport is provided in city and suburban areas between home and airport, railway station or wharf, to ex-Ministers entitled to life gold passes and who are still members, and to whips and certain incapacitated members. 2 and 3. Yes, in the circumstances mentioned by the Minister for the Interior, during the adjournment debate in the House on 27th March, 1963, and to ex-Ministers in the period immediately after they ceased to be Ministers.

Have Commonwealth car drivers been instructed not to require Ministers, their wives or members of their families to sign the trip sheets which other users are normally required to do? 5. If so, what is the reason for this discrimination between users of Commonwealth cars?

However, wherever possible, facilities were made available for disabled ex-servicemen along the progress routes in capital city. Mr Ward asked the Prime Minister, upon notice1. Was it stated in the preliminary announcements that the recent visit to Australia of Her Majesty The Queen and His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh was to be, unlike the earlier tour in 1954, conducted in an air of informality? 2. In what material respect did the recent tour differ from the earlier royal visit? Sh* Robert Menzies -The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows:1 and 2. Her Majesty The Queen and HisRoyal Highness Prince Philip asked in the course of the initial discussions about the 1963 visit that arrangements should permit them to visit Canberra and each State briefly, and that the visit to each place should centre aronnd a notable event at that place.

What countries maintain diplomatic relations with Australia, and what is tbe status of their representation in Australia? Sir Garfield Barwick -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows1. Australia maintains diplomatic relations, in the strict sense of the expression, with most countries of the world with certain notable and well known exceptions deriving from political reasons. The honourable member, however presumably means to refer to the maintenance of diplomatic missions in the respective countries. The"" List of Permanent Missions Overseas"" published by the Department of External Affairs shows the number and status of Australian diplomatic missions abroad. 2. See 1. 3. ""The Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure of the Commonwealth Government for the Year ending 30th June, 1963-Schedul e of Salaries and Allowances for the Department of External Affairs"", gives the number of diplomatic staff maintained at Australian diplomatic missions overseas. 4. The association of Australia with or membership of, an international organization can take a number of forms. Thus the Austrahan Government is a member of the United Nations Organization, Universal Postal Union, etc. The Australian Government is associated with other international organizations without tha government itself being a member, e.g. the International Commission on Irrigation and Drahuge, in which Australian membership consists of the membership of an Australian National Committee. This committee can and does rely on the Government for financial support. Australia in a non-governCountry of Origin. United Kingdom New Zealand Other Commonwealth Countries Australia Re-imported Czechoslovakia Denmark Italy Netherlands Norway Switzerland Other Foreign Countries Total mental sense, is associated with international organizations covering a very wide field of interest indeed, e.g. medical, legal, artistic, philatelic, etc. Thus the total number of international organizations with which Australia can be said to be associated is very great and no comprehensive list is available. 5. In referring to the maintenance of diplomatic relations with Australia by other countries the honourable member presumably wishes to know what countries maintain diplomatic missions in Australia. The"" Diplomatic List"" shows the countries maintaining diplomatic relations witb Australia and the status of that representation. The documents listed in the above answer are available to honourable members in the Parliamentary Library. Cheese.
