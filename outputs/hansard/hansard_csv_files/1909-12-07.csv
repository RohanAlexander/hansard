0,"?Gouse Of Eeptcsentatibes. Tuesday, 7 December, Igog. And Read Prayers. Make A Personal Explanation. Some Time Ago I Raised A Question In This House In Regard To The Fremantle Municipal Tram","way loan, and the honourable member for Fremantle, acting, as I believe, in good faith and quite conscientiously, denied that my statement was correct. I am now in the happy position of being able to show that it was, by quoting the. following paragraph from the Perth Truth of 27th ult Most Truth readers will remember that some time ago this paper contained a paragraph I took my information from the financial columns' of the Age and the Argusindicating that the statement made by King O'Malley, M.H.R., on' the occasion of the raising of the Fremantle Tram loan, to the effect that the flotation had proved a failure was, despite denials by interested parties, absolutely correct. At the recent tramway social held in Fremantle, Mayor Thomson of the eastern suburb of the Port stated emphatically during the course of a speech that he knew O'Malley was correct at the time the statement was made, but from purely local reasons he, Thomson, could not then bear testimony to the truthfulness of the utterance of the Federal legislator. Thomson added that before relinquishing his present Mayoral position he hoped to more publicly vindicate O'Malley who had been unjustly treated in the matter. You will thus see, Mr Speaker, that once more are the righteous vindicated. a.m., '",14,Setup

Is he aware that the Postal authorities of the same State, when asked to remedy this rough, incomplete work, by finishing the poles in a tradesmanlike manner, whilst admitting the need for finishing and painting them, have tried to throw half the cost of their own departmental work on to the municipal authorities, who receive no part of the revenue from the use of the poles ? 3-_ Does he not consider this system of administration should be altered, seeing that the telephones are a substantial source of Commonwealth revenue, that the ratepayers of the municipalities have to pay f u l l rates for their telephone service, and that the municipalities themselves do not share in the revenue? made, and the desired information furnished, as soon as possible. upon notice1. Whether it is correct, as stated by the Minisjust; and the honourable member for ter for Defence on 3rd December, that the Surplus Revenue BiU as agreed toby the State Premiers, providing that the Surplus Revenue Act 1908 be amended to "" so debited to the several States that the capitation in the case of each of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland shall be to the capitation in the case of each of the States of South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, in the proportion of three to two,"" represents to the State of Victoria a saving of about ,Â£150,000 on her proposed contribution to the purposes of old-age pensions under the provisions of this Bill? 2. If this is a correct presentment, of the position, will he state from what State or States funds this difference will be made good? order, my point of order being that this question does not represent in any way whatever what I said. The statement that I did make was uttered during the consideration of the Surplus Revenue Bill, but not in the connection in which the honourable member has put it. In other wordsy the matter I spoke of had little to do with the particular matter mentioned in this question. .said that Victoria would take .Â£150,000. _ fence has risen to a point of order with regard to the accuracy of a statement made in a question. I have to point out that the Chair and the House always hold an honourable member who puts a question upon the notice-paper responsible for the accuracy of the statements made in that question. to the honourable member's questions are1. The Minister of Defence was referring to>. the fact that under the new arrangement the amount of ^5,543,750 will be distributed amongst the States on a population basis. If this amount had been distributed in accordance with the; present bookkeeping system, Victoria would have received ^150,000 less. 2. If Victoria had received ^150,000 less, the other States would, of course, have received more, and vice versd. of order raised by the Minister of De-! fence on my question, I think an explanation is due from me. I placed the question on the no.tice-paper for the reason that, when we were discussing the Surplus Revenue Bill, the question arose as to the fairness of callinar upon V i o toria, New South Wales, and Queensland to contribute in the proportion of 3s. to 2s. I then stated that, in my opinion, such a proposition was unfair and unYarra, with me, objected to Victoria and the States mentioned, being thus penalized. The Minister of Defence then said, "" I hope you will not forget also to mention the fact that, under this provision, Victoria gains ^150,000 a year.""",16,Postmaster General S Department Subscribers To Bendigo Telephone Ex Change Tender S For Insulators Female Cleaners Sydney Retiring

30,Mr Thomas,"Ir a view of the pointnnancial agreement with the Commonwealth. ber for Calare then rose and asked whether, if Victoria was to gain ,Â£150,000 a year, -the Minister of Defence would kindlly say what State would make up that amount. plied that all honourable members had to do in order to get the information was to look at the Budget Papers. I asked the Treasurer if he would be good enough to give us the information, but he said, he could not do so off hand, but would endeavour to obtain it if I gave notice of a question. I ' 'gave notice of a question, and the Treasurer has given a reply. going to have a discussion on a Question which has already been settled by the House. I do not think that any statement of the honourable member for Yarra has been called in question,, and that, there.fore, there is any need for him to make an explanation. If there is that need on the part of the honourable member, I hope that other honourable members, whose names have been mentioned incidentally, will not also find it necessary to make explanations. If the honourable member for Yarra feels that he has been mis represented or misunderstood, I shall be glad to hear him. the Minister of Defence, as to the gain which he said would accrue to Victoria, that has given rise to this discussion. The Minister now says that he was referring to the nnancial agreement, but I point out that that agreement was not mentioned in the course of the debate.

There is a foot-note, which I think has crept in under a misapprehension, and I desire to have the matter cleared up, so that no injustice may be done. The footnote is to the item of .Â£800, for "" Representative in England,"" and reads as f o llows :This salary is paid to Colonel Bridges-hi s place in Australia being taken by an Exchange Officer from the Imperial Forces. I. am not seized with the facts, but I understand that Colonel Bridges was formerly Chief of the General Staff in Australia, an appointment with a duration of three years. He, however, resigned that office to go to England, to what would generally be regarded as a more important office, namely, that' of the representative of Australia on the Imperial General Staff. The foot-note informs us that an Imperial officer is now occupying Colonel Bridges' position in Australia; but that Imperial officer is under the Chief of the General Staff here, who is, since Colonel Bridges' departure, General Hoad. In other words, unless this foot-note is an error, it shows that Colonel Bridges will have taken a step down, and I do not think that any of us would wish to do an injustice to a public servant, especially a public servant of the character, attainments, and reputation of Colonel Bridges. It ought to be perfectly clear that, when Colonel Bridges returns, the fact of his absence will not penalize, him in any way. A t present, however, he,' apparently, is to have a step down, owing to a little foot-note made in the Departmental office, perhaps by some one who steps overI do not know-that may or mav not be the case. Minister of Defence) [11.27] I hope that there is no stepping down so far as Colonel Bridges is concerned. Whatever has been done is with Colonel Bridges' concurrence, and, at the time of his leaving, I know that the arrangement was eminently satisfactory to himself. know about the foot-note? whether he knows anything about the footnote, but he did know about the exchange officer. thing. is nothing without the fact.

I am going to do my best to remedy that, and to see that all the State forces, as far as possible, will go to camp for eight days. The provision for an extra nine days' training is for the technical arms of the service, as has already been decided upon. In addition to the sixteen days which the infantry and horse sections of the forces get, they are to get nine days, bringing their total training to twenty-five days per annum. The third item is for vehicles We are seeing if we cannot improvise our transport, or the non-technical part of it , and so save ourselves hundreds of thousands of pounds, by making arrangements with owners of private vehicles which are suitable for this class of work. that direction in this year's camps.

Will trie Minister transfer the money which was to be spent at Wyong to Cessnock? Minister of Defence) [11.41] I have been asked about this matter already, and if the facts are as alleged, I see no great objection to the transfer being made. rate, I shall have none. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 104 (Victorian Military Forces, District Head-Quarters Staff), Â£[3,645. [11.42] I notice that the cost of the Head-Quarters Staff is considerably increased. That does not confer any benefit on the great multitude of the people. The vote for the Permanent Forces for Victoria js increased this year from Â£ 5 9 , 2 1 5 to ^63,278. Minister uf Defence) [11.43] -The increase referred to is rendered necessary by the special provisions that we are making this year for a Military College, and the general instruction which will ,06 necessary for the training of the new arms of the forces, amounting altogether to Â£[7,000 or Â£ 8 , 0 0 0 . This increase represents the por r tion of it allotted to Victoria. [11.44] I notice that Â£[25,769 is voted for rifle clubs and associations for Victoria for the current year, as against Â£[26,707 voted and Â£[26,791 spent last year. Does the Minister anticipate a considerable r e ; duction on this item? There has been a great deal of complaint in country districts for several years past about the absence of facilities for rifle clubs. One cause of trouble is the difficulty of getting range sites. In some of the older settled districts We shall make a test in sites that have been used for a number of years have been condemned as unsafe, and there is a difficulty in obtaining others. There was a case at Molong, where a site which had been used for a number of years was condemned. Arrangements were made with a large land-owner to secure a piece of suitable ground, but it vvas nearly two years before the matter was finally settled, and the new range was opened for practice only so late as last Saturday week. According to the local opinion, the long delay was largely due to the unbusinesslike methods of the Department. A similar complaint has been made, with reason, in other cases. For years the Forbes Rifle Association was using a -ground in regard to which no trouble was experienced until a Departmental officer condemned it. Efforts have been made to secure an extension of the area by adding part of the travelling stock route or common, but that is opposed by certain interested parties, with the result that the members of the local rifle club, Australian A t any Light Horse, and other bodies are now without opportunities for practising shooting. It is a difficult matter to obtain an altogether new site. . If an area removed from the town were acquired, those who O'MALLEY (Darwin) desire to practise shooting would be considerably inconvenienced, and possibly put to expense, because of the distance. The desirabilitv of providing suitable sites for rifle ranges near centres of population should be dealt with by the Department; .with a view to devising something better than the present slipshod method of dealing with the difficulties which arise. I suggest, too, that the Minister should",19,Department Of Defence

These applications should be dealt with as speedily and effectively as possible. If we throw difficulties in the way of the formation or practice of rifle clubs, the enthusiasm of those who wish to fit themselves for the defence of the country will cool clown. A t the present time, rifle clubs are ridiculously short of weapons. some cases only five or six rifles have been supplied to a company of fifty or sixty men, which is disheartening. No doubt this deficiency will be remedied by the small arms factory. justice to my constituents, and in the interests of the Department, the Minister will give careful consideration to the matters which I have brought under his notice, and remedy what are very real and .serious grievances. -Prio r to the Commonwealth taking control of Defence, mounted riflemen were in many of the States supplied, with saddles, and I understand that the practice is still being continued in some cases. There is a large number of mounted riflemen in Victoria, and they would like to be placed in the same position as those in other States who have been favoured by being supplied with saddles. ter whether, when he has sufficient funds in hand, he will see that saddles are supplied to the mounted riflemen in this State.

After a matter leaves the Central Office, it passes through so many channels that it is difficult to sheet home responsibility; but the honourable member may accept my assurance that I intend to trace out causes of delay and to endeavour to remove them. I shall have the Apparently question referred to by the honourable member for Balaclava looked into, with a view to doing what he suggests, but the consequent expenditure will be large. A sum was placed on the Estimates to provide saddles, but it was so large that the Department was reluctantly obliged to strike it off, to make provision fdr things that were even more urgent. I hope that it will not be long before the matter can be attended to. [11.57] -In my opinion, the delay referred to by the Minister occurred in this way. It is thought that no document can be properly delivered in his Department I hope that, in until it has been passed from rooster to rooster, through quite a number of hands. In my opinion, the honourable member for Darwin has shortly put the real cause of the trouble which has been referred to by the honourable member for Calare. I endorse what the latter has said, and am convinced that the Minister firmly intends to remedy the existing abuses. ( The matter which I wish to bring under his notice is this. Guns and ammunition, sold by the Department as useless, have been sent to India, and used by the frontier tribes there against British troops. If the ammunition was good enough to be fired at British soldiers, it was I ask the Minissurely good enough to be used for practice purposes here. If the Minister makes inquiries, and ascertains the names of those who purchased this material, the thing will never occur again, because if it be ascertained who, bought it, it will be easy to discover how it came into the hands of the frontier tribesmen. I hope that tomorrow I shall obtain answers to my questions concerning Major Carroll; but if there should not be an opportunity then, I ask the Minister to permit me to send them When I have to him direct. Major Carroll had his -Uttle more time, as I hope to have after rank conferred by a greater soldier than Australia has ever possessed.

A few officers may became ""curled darlings"" if they remain top long in one community, or because they have influence with the press. If any of our officers have press influence, we must know how they have obtained it. It is recorded in the annals of the French Department that certain men there were able to keep themselves in high positions by giving to the press information which even the Government did not obtain. I hope that such a thing will not occur in connection with the Commonwealth Defence Department; and am sure that the Minister of Defence, whether in office or in Opposition, would do his utmost to prevent an officer remaining in the service after it had been proved that he was improperly supplying information to the press. We insist upon discipline in the ranks, and there must be discipline amongst the officers.

It would be far better to abandon the project than to allow it to be a farce. Unless we have a good attendance the camp will not be usef u l for training purposes, and will certainly not convey to' Lord Kitchener an adequate idea of the strength or capacity of the forces in Victoria. Minister of Defence) [12.6] I have no information beyond that vvhich I have already given, namely, that we are going to have in Victoria a Kitchener camp just as we shall have Kitchener camps in other States. More is being made of the matter in Victoria than in any of the other States. I do not observe in the other States any such criticisms as appear in the press of Victoria from day to day. In Victoria the usual period of encampment has been four days, whereas in other States it has been eight, and the adjustments that have been necessary to bring about the change in this State from four to eight days do not appear to be regarded very favourably in some quarters. But I cannot permit little inconveniences to interfere vvith the effective training of the troops. I deeply regret to hear that many of the men are not likely to go into camp in Victoria. I hope that the information is incorrect, and can only say that Whatever may I know nothing of Head-quarters being averse to these camps.

[12.9] I am confident that the members of the Defence Forces in Victoria are quite as willing as are those in the other States to go into camp irrespective of whether the weather is warm or cool. The point which the Minister of Defence has missed, however, is that most of our Militia men have already put in the requisite number of drills, and that if they are required to go into camp for eight days early in the year, they will have to serve for four days without pay. Militia men are for the most part working on wages. winners, and they can ill afford to suffer the pecuniary loss which four days in camp without pay would involve. There are many employers who will treat their men liberally, but there are others who will not make good any part of the loss sustained by their employees in attending camp. will be paid for the extra service.

They say that all they desire is that their fares shall be paid, and' that they shall have a good time. Surely men must have a holiday once a year. The whole community cannot consist of public servants on permanent pay, but I urge the Government to so arrange the encampments as to enable them to fit in with public holidays.

When that statement was made, I did not care to bring Mr Hesketh's name into the discussion, but I felt that if such advice as that had been given by him to the present Minister, it was very different from the advice that he had tendered to me only a. little while before.

(3) The result of our examination is that the telephone system in the Metropolitan Area alone has, under the Commonwealth, returned a net profit of over jÂ£ioo,ooo. This profit has been made chiefly in the years 1901-7; the results for 1907-8 and 1908-9 respectively were a small profit of about ,Â£4,000 and a loss of about ,Â£7,000. The decrease in 1907-8 and the loss in 1908-9 are entirely due to the introduction of the measured-rate system.

We shall be able to supply you with complete figures in support of this statement, based upon an analysis of the revenue for the last year.

As the result of my speeches and those of others, information being placed before Parliament as to what is done in other countries, the Postmaster-General of the day, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, instituted a partial toll system. His toll rates, however, were too low, and a further objection to his system was that it permitted the subscribers of the day to choose between remaining on a flat rate and coming under the toll rate. This undoubtedly resulted in loss to the Department, because, of course, every business man made a calculav tion, and when he found that it would be cheaper to remain on the flat rate, did so, while if he thought that he could save by changing to the toll rate, he did that.

116,The Chairman,"W it h the consent-am rather pleased that the report of the 'expert Committee made clear what I have -been endeavouring to emphasize for some time past, namely, that the sjstem intro-duced by the honourable member for Eden Monaro, when Postmaster-General, permitting those who desired to do so to remain on the flat system was absurd. -with the Postmaster-General, a Mr Alcock said that some years ago the telephones paid in Victoria. That statement is borne out by the report of the expert Committee; 'but I point out that, when the telephones were paying in Victoria, and, probably, in the other States; the whole of the subscribers were under the flat rate, and each -one had to pay Â£ 9 per annum. for private subscribers. Ibusiness people; and I believe that in Adelaide the rental was Â£ 1 0 . A man like Mr would charge for services rendered. The GoAlcock, who used his telephone fifty times a day, would naturally elect to remain on the flat rate, seeing that, even under the toll system of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, the charges would have come -to Â£ 2 4 a year. Another absurd idea was to permit subscribers, under the toll system, 2,000 free rings, and, at the same time, give them the privilege of charging a penny per ring to any person who wished to use the telephone. Of course, I do not 'know what was in the mind of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro at the time, 'but I take it that the 2,000 free rings were allowed on the basis that the average num-ber of rings per day was six. It will be seen, however, that, if 2,000 free rings were permitted, and a subscriber allowed -to charge a penny per ring to non-subscribers, he would receive for the 2,000 free rings Â£ 8 6s. 8d., while he was called -upon to pay only Â£ 5 to the Department. Such a system, if universally acted upon, -must result in a loss. Not long ago, a friend of mine started in a small way in a grocery business, and, when I suggested -that he should have a telephone, said he -could not afford the Â£ 5 . I advised him to scrape the money together, and he did so, with the result that, on the first day he -had eight rings paid for by non-subscri'bers, on the second day ten rings, and on -the third day seventeen rings. rate, it can be seen that in a very short time he would receive more than he was called upon to pay the Government, and really .got his telephone free. 1 did not think he was assisting in defrauding the revenue? practice is resorted to all round. I asked a question in the House as to whether this was permitted, and the official reply was in the affirmative, the justification being that In an interview the privilege resulted in more business. If there were no free calls allowed, it would only be fair to permit a subscriber to charge a penny per ring, because, then, the more rings there were the more profit to the Government. It is only fair that we should have a statement from the Postmaster General as to whether he intends to estab lish the toll system or the flat rate system. In the Age of 12th June, 1909, the PostT h e rental was Â£5 master-General, speaking in reply to a deputation, is reported to have saidBut of one thing he was convinced-the time had arrived for the abolition of the old fixed rate system and the substitution of a system that vernment hacl a right to review the rates and regulations with a view of equalizing them.

I do not particularly object to the expenditure; but we know that, when Parliamentarians are on a Committee of the kind, and are allowed Â£ 1 per day for expense?, there is a hue and cry in the press. Whilst the figures of Mr Alcock are no doubt correct wide. At that are told that, up to a certain time, the telephones in Victoria paid, but that only means that the persons who did not use them up to the extent of Â£ 9 per year made them pay.

129,Mr Thomas,"In what way? Wethe cost of attending to them in the' exchange amounts to Â£ 1 0 , so that such a subscriber did not in any way help to make the system pay. I still believe that the rates I suggested were fair and equitable. tee may sustain trie honourable member's contention. Postmaster-General to accept those rates, but merely to tell us whether he proposes to adopt the toll system, or, if he has abandoned that idea, what are his reasons for doing so. ' The Sydney Daily Telegraph, in its issue of 5th March, 1909, saidIt has been made plain several times that this journal is in thorough accord with the idea that justice in the method of charging for the use of the telephone must be part of the satisfactory solution of the departmental problem. Subscribers who, as Mr Thomas points out, make from 76 to 105 calls per day on a single instrument, are getting a measure of service for which other subscribers whose need of the apparatus is less insistent have to pay. What Mr Thomas should guard against is any desire on the part of the officials to evolve some fancy model system, which may cost so much that the more general use of the telephone will be discouraged rather than encouraged. I quote that to show that whilst the Melbourne Age and Argus have been opposed to the toll system in any shape or form, the Sydney Daily Telegraph thinks it is fair and just. I admit that the charges may be too high, and that the question depends a great deal upon what is charged for the services rendered, but that paper believes that the system itself is the fair and proper one. The Sydney Morning Herald of the same date wrote as followsAnd This refers to the Postal Departmentis a matter of funds. Those funds Mr Thomas proposes to get in part by raising the rates against telephone users. As to this, we may say that it is fair enough to require payment in proidea of the Postal Department having a portion to service rendered. People who use the telephone a great deal should be willing to pay more than those who use it only betimes. I shall be glad if the Postmaster-General will tell the Committee in his reply whether he proposes to adopt the toll system or to revert to the old-fashioned flat rates. Passing away from the question of the telephone, I may say that I have come to the opinion that the Postal Department should have the right, to build its own post offices of other works. In times past some honourable members have said that there was a great deal of circumlocution in this matter, and that with the Home Affairs Department on the one hand and the Postal Department on the other people hardly knew what was being done. AlthoughI did not favour.the idea some months ago, I am rather in favour of it at the present moment. a Postal Public Works Department? clerks of works, &c. That is a beautiful proposition ! at Yarra Bend. great deal of the blame that has been attached to the Postal Department in times past has been in many instances due to the fact that promises have been made by the Postmaster-General, and works have been sent on, but have 'been delayed or held not to be urgent by another Department. mises have been made which another Department has attempted to completely upset. good reason for it. Postal Department that ""gets the blame. The Postmaster-General promises a post office, his Department says it ought to be built, and the question is sent on to the Home Affairs Department, so that the work may be done. It is delayed there, but the Postal Department and not the Home Affairs Department gets the blame. That is somewhat unfair. I admit that the to better the machineformation of a Works' Staff might mean such an added cost that it would be better for the Postal Department to put up with a certain amount of unfair and unjust criticism, but at present I rather favour the works branch of its own. I think that it is a mistake for postmasters to be mixed up with electoral work. I have always felt that no postmaster should be compelled to act as returning or deputy returning officer against his will, and that it was a mistake to thrust that work upon those officers. the staff equally suitable? it is necessary to appoint Government officers.

At Gawier some time ago we had the case of a postmaster who was a most excellent officer, and had this work thrust upon him against his will. He made a big bungle of it, and the consequence was that a vote of censure was passed upon him by his Department. I do not know whether he did not lose some of his pension also. This was rather a hard case, because he had not been accustomed to the work; he was an old man, and had almost finished his work so far as the Postal Department was concerned. I have a similar case in my own constituency. I know that the postmaster at BrokenH ill does not desire to have thia work thrust upon him. He is a very capable officer so far as his own Department is concerned, ancl has endeavoured to. do his work under many difficulties, and has done it well; but he has arrived at an age at which he feels.that electoral work would be new for him, and interfere with his postal work. It is unfair to ask men who have devoted the whole of their life to another kind of work to undertake electoral work. possible to dissociate it altogether from the staff of the Postal Department, for most of the men in the postal service already have quite sufficient to do. wish to direct the attention of the Postmaster-General to the items aggregating Â£ 2 6 , 8 6 0 for the conveyance of mails to Europe vid Vancouver. If the present Government had been responsible for the contract I should have felt inclined to move for a reduction of the vote, with'a view to preventing a recurrence of what has happened ; but, in the circumstances I shall content myself with drawing the attention of the Postmaster-General to certain facts that have come under my notice. I do.not pretend that it is the duty of the Government to provide for the carriage of produce on mail steamers, but when we pay such large subsidies to steamers to carry the mails, their space should be available for the benefit of the whole of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. Just before the contract was entered into, I wrote to the then Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Barrier, pointing out that a firm in Sydney had a monopoly of in the service the whole of the refrigerating space in these boats. I naturally expected the honH e can be disciplined, orable member to put his foot down very firmly on anything in the shape of a monopoly. I informed him that several Brisbane shippers who had tried to secure space in the Vancouver boats had been absolutely refused. The firm that had secured the monopoly of the space, offered to buy our produce but would not accept our cargo at double the rates which they were themselves paying. The reply which I received from the Postal Department was as follows:I have the honour to inform you, inquiry has been made into the matter, and attached hereto for your information is a copy of a letter received from the manager of the Canadian-Australian Royal Mail line in regard thereto. 2. I am to add that there is no provision in the contract in connection with the service in question which would enable this Department to allot cargo space. I was rather surprised that the Postmaster General should have gone to the shipping company only for information as to whether certain things did exist or not, but it Was pointed out to his evident satisfaction by the company that there was no remedy for what was complained of. I am exceedingly surprised that the honourable member took up this attitude seeing that he had tried very hard to burst up the I shall be glad if it is found shipping combine that existed some time ago. I wish to refer also to the service in country telephone exchanges. In many country districts the lines are overcrowded with work. The Department are not in a position to erect new trunk lines, and in many of the fairly large centres the work cannot be coped with. I have suggested to the Department that they should extend the service from eight to twelve or sixteen hours a day. This would give more time for the working of the lines, and effect a great saving to the Department at a very small cost, or if a saving cannot be made, the public would be convenienced by being given twelve or sixteen hours in which to do their work. It seems to be at present a hard-and-fast rule of the Department that where a twenty-four hours' service cannot be granted, only an eight hours' service w ill ' be given. A departure from the rule has been made in connection with the Esk exchange. There has been a slight loss, which the Esk residents have borne, but the district has benefited immensely by the service, and the increased",30,Honourable Members Hear Hear

The grievance is a legitimate one. Officers in the Clerical Division start, so to speak, from scratch, and are thus placed on an equality ; but in the General Division, the position is different. It appears that an examination is held in one branch of the Department tc enable officers in the General Division receiving Â£ 1 5 6 per annum to qualify for the higher grade, the salary in respect of which is Â£ 1 6 2 per annum, and that the men in that particular branch thus obtain an advantage over men in other branches.

I shall not enlarge upon the matter; but I ask' the Postmaster-General to give it his attention. I desire now to refer to the position taken up by the ex-Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Barrier, who to-night has urged the virtues of the toll-rate system in connection with the telephone service. I am glad to say that when I dealt with the subject on the ist September last, I accurately gauged the position, and showed clearly and unmistakably that there was no reason for raising the telephone rates iri Victoria, as had been done by the ex-Postmaster-General. I then pointed out that, from my reading of the figures, the telephone system in that State had been created out of its own proceeds. Instead of losing money, as the public have been led to believe, the telephones have been a continuously paying concern, and have accumulated a profit of something like Â£[300,000 H is expertness and his -that is, the whole telephone system of Victoria. To-day we have the report, or a portion of the report, of the Committee of inquiry, in which my statement is absolutely borne out. I am anxious that this should be known, so that the question may, before another Parliament meets, engage the attention of the Postmaster-General and the Government, and they may be prepared to put the system on a satisfactory basis. My statement was that, during twenty-two years, nine of which were under the adI have already asked ministration of the Commonwealth, the profit I have mentioned has been made. The report tabled to-day contains the following passageThe telephone system in the metropolitan area alone has, under the Commonwealth, returned the net profit of over ,Â£100,000.

Chapman system. the Chapman system, or to the system of the honourable member for Barrier; I am reading the report, which clearly shows that the telephones were paying well. I hope that the measured rate system is dead and buried. This is a business Department; ancl the honourable member for Barrier, who is always quoting Mr Arcock, does not deal with it as a business man would do in any large concern, and take the little and the big together.

The report goes on to sayIn the meantime we may remark that the work at the Exchanges of recording the calls registered by the attendants costs in the aggregate more than the revenue received from the measured rate. That is to say, the number of employees required to record the calls absorb the money received from the measured rate. must allow for the 2,000 free calls. results. We see, first of all, that the telephones in Victoria have paid, and can be made to pay; and 1Â° presume that, if separate accounts were also kept in the other States, the result would be similar. In Sydney, where there is a better telephone circuit, I think the system would be found to be a paying one. I have now said all that is necessary to show that the Postmaster General did a wise thing when, on entering office, he suspended the operation of the new rates, and reverted to the old system. [8.52II desire to draw the attention of the Postmaster-General to a few items on the Fstima.tes in the hope that he will take some action. First of all, I see that for rent, repairs, and so forth, under the heading of works and buildings, there is set down a sum of Â£52,478, and my objection to the amount is not only that it is large, but also that last year we voted Â£6.600 for new sites, only Â£3,500 of which was spent. When the Department is given a certain amount of money to expend on new sites, Parliament expects that money will be used. In the purchase of sites the wisest plan has not been followed, inasmuch as steps are not taken in time to secure suitable allotments, with the result that larger prices have to be paid than would otherwise be the case. When a man proposes to erect business premises he generally secures a site before he is prepared to build, and the Department, ought to follow the same coutse. Unfortunately, however, it seems to be the business of two or three Departments-certainl y not less than two-to deal with this business of securing sites, and there should be some system initiated by the Department of Home Affairs to secure suitable areas in anticipation. If this suggestion were acted be ^facilitated, and certainly the public convenience would be better served. The next matter I should like to refer to is connected with the postal inspectors and their duties. I notice that no increase of salary for these officers employed in New South Wales is proposed, though their work is certainly most onerous and responsible, and worthy of higher remuneration. In New South Wales, considering the area to be covered, the number of officers is too small, and the result is that many important works are postponed from time to time, until, very often, the year passes without anything being done. These inspectors are not only expected to do what may be regarded as their ordinary work, but are also required to generally supervise ofiicers. The only information that the Public Service Commissioner receives is through these postal inspectors, and that imposes on the latter more responsibility than they should be called upon to bear, and, of course, the efficiency of the service suffers. They are also expected to see that the premises are kept in proper condition, although they are not architects. This is work which, in my opinion, should be undertaken by the Department of Home Affairs, by means of either Commonwealth or State officers. Some of the reports prepared never reach the Department of Home Affairs, though the inspectors do the best they can. Further, I find that, when postmasters look after their premises properly, they get no more than a passing reference, while others, who are not particular in this respect, are allowed to escape without comment. Further, the inspectors are the only men who exercise any supervision over the lines, and",34,Thomas Brown Calare Local Residents

As a. matter of fact, the salary offered is not sufficient to induce men to leave comfortable post-offices in order to undertake the work ; and several postmasters have declined the position. As to semi-official offices, they are created very often in a very back-stairs sort of way. There are a number of official offices which are, perhaps, not so remunerative as we should wish; and the next thing we see, without any notice being given to the member for the district or anybody interested, is a notice in the Gazette reducing them in status. think that, at least, six months' notice ought to be given, and that, after the reduction is made, better remuneration ought to be paid to those in charge, because at present the system is simply a sweating one, considering the responsibility of the work. man in charge of a semi-official office, whose weekly returns show an average of nineteen twenty-one received, 384 letters posted, si\: savings banks transactions, four postal note transactions, twelve mails received ancl despatched daily, with no fewer than 10,722 cross messages in the year.

The question is well worthy of reconsideration by the Government, and now that they have leisure to do so, I hope the Postmaster-General will insist on the Cabinet going into it again.

My contention is that there is no possibility of the worker getting justice unless this Parliament has concurrent industrial powers with the States, and the Minister says that there will be no referendum as we desire it submitted by this Government. the honourable member to quote only half of what I said. saidThe Inter-State Commission Bill is but a sham for the purpose for which it was professedly introduced. I say so still. It is a proposition that would simply embarrass the workers in their desire to get justice. members opposite want it passed? should be passed. I should vote against it, because if there is one way of killing the man who is getting a mere pittance for his toil it is by having five or six Courts intervening between him and justice, and that is the proposal under the InterState Commission Bill. There has to be disagreement between the States; if they cannot come to an agreement, and there is unfair competition, the Inter-State Commission can intervene, and then the question may go to a law Court. There might be five or six interventions before any citizen who was aggrieved could get justice. there are four distinct stages before a worker could get justice under the Government proposal. The present disastrous strike in New South Wales could have been settled had the Commonwealth had concurrent industrial powers with the States. What is it that is hampering the settlement of that dispute, but the mere fact that the Federal Court cannot intervene until the dispute extends beyond the boundaries of one State? settle the Broken Hill strike? the other Courts had absolutely failed, friendly intervention by the President of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court finally and amicably settled the strike. The honourable member's interjection is unfortunate from his point of view. for information. went before that Court by mutual agreement between the parties. The employers at Broken Hill agreed that if the workmen went back to work they would pay the Court award from that time, but as a matter of fact they did not accept the award after it was given. They appealed on a point of law to the High Court, and tried to set the award aside. The High Court varied the award, but did not set it aside. The miners were not satisfied with the judgment, and did not think they got justice. The employers did not think that they had got the judgnient which they ought to have got, but both parties agreed to it. That is not the only case. What about the great shearers and bush workers' case ? Previously there had been constant disputes of a grave character in the pastoral industry through the whole of the bush, but by mutual arrangement both sides were able to take their case to the Federal Court, when Mr Justice O'Connor was President. They obtained an award which has worked exceedingly well and almost without a hitch for nearly four years. dozens of disputes that have been settled by the local Courts? cannot point to a single dispute of any magnitude that has been settled by a local Court. It is not possible. All the larger industries are now federated; in fact, there was a federation of labour long before there was a political federation in Australia. Labour was federated in many industries in 1889 or 1890, and I believe there are now thirteen different industries practically federated in every State. It is unfortunate that the coal-miners were not federated. Had they been they could also have gone to the Federal Arbitration Courti f they did not care for the State Courts. Does the honourable member for Parramatta ask me to believe that it will mean the destruction of Australia if the coal-miners can take their case to a Federal Arbitration Court as well as to a State Court? say a sensible thing.

This Parliament would never attempt to deal with the smaller matters, or in fact with any matter that could be effectively dealt with by the State Courts. Mr J. H . CATTS -Such as early closing. of factories, or other subsidiary matters that could be dealt with effectively and expeditiously in each State. But the National Parliament, representing the whole of the people, should certainly be in possession of such industrial powers as would enable it to do justice to every toiler in Australia. The State of Tasmania is absolutely without industrial Courts. moving now for a Wages Board system. soon for me. I am not reflecting upon' that State, but am using it simply as an illustration. intercourse are absolutely free between the States. If , therefore, we have in one State Wages Boards and Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration, which increase the people, by a referendum, to give this Parwages and improve the conditions of the workers, and that State comes into competition in, trade and commerce with other States which have not those higher wages or improved conditions, the economic effect will undoubtedly be to drag down the higher-paid workmen in the State which gives them protection. It is absolutely impossible to deal equitably with all these classes of labour unless the central power is in a position to enforce an award. Is that a power which any one should hesitate to ask the people to give to this Parliament? Why does the honourable member for Parramatta mistrust this Parliament? aggressive ? the honourable member has for the last two minutes been outlining the very thing that we propose to do, and does not seem to be aware of it. the honourable member seriously. The High Court stated distinctly that the only way by which the Federal Parliament could get that power was by a referendum. The Attorney-General and the Minister of External Affairs know that by no process of manoeuvring with the present powers given to this Parliament under the Constitution can it get direct authority to deal with industrial disputes within a State. That can be done only by obtaining increased powers from the people by means of a referendum. States. ber for Darling Downs prefers to invite six States the question of power. raises the point that if the six States are agreeable to delegate increased powers to this Parliament, this Parliament could accept them under the Constitution. But the whole of the six States would have to be in agreement to make that delegation effective. What does this mean? What is the contention of the Government? They say, ""We will get from the States that which we consider would be wrong if we got it from the people."" Surely that position is Tradeand commerce and illogical and absurd. If the State Governments are willing to give the required power, why do not the Government put their sincerity to the test, and invite the liament the power to do like justice in a ready, efficient, effective, and speedy way? Surely one would expect a Government sympathetic with the workers to take the shortest road to do the right thing. when you. have already got if? power, why do not the Government exercise it ? If they have that power, why do they not bring in effective protection for the workers ? orable member the other night, because of the uncompromising and bitter opposition Does he think it would be of the honourable member's party. to mere assertion.

276,Mr Fisher,"There is a time limitthe States-no t to monopolize or use them all, but to leave the States concurrent powers, ancl to have the larger powers exercised in the Federal Court. I believe the one safe way to industrial and commercial development is to clothe our Conciliation and Arbitration Court with power to do justice to the worker toy providing for cheap and expeditious decision of the cases submitted, so that it may prescribe the conditions of labour and the remuneration that each worker shall receive. Speaking generally, there are two schools of thought on the subject in Australia to-day. One is the very large and intelligent body with which this party is associated, and which says, "" Let us remedy all these difficulties and dangers by law."" The other, amongst the Conservatives and the extreme wing of either party, declares that things are all right, saying, "" Leave them alone. Let the parties fight it out amongst themselves. Let the capitalist and monopolist do as he pleases with his own. Let him shut up his industry, and starve the workers into subjection if he pleases. Do not interfere with capitalists who can continue to live comfortably for a year, even if no work is being done."" In this memorandum it is stated that protection had been provided for manufacturers against the competition of capitalists from other countries. But no provision has been made to protect workmen in their competition with capitalists. Many of the best workers in Australia have not a month's reserve, and most not a week's provision against unemployment. They are unprotected, and the Government proposes to leave them unprotected, because it will not allow the Federal Parliament to obtain the powers necessary to protect them. This is a wrong position. On the 28th October, 1908, a second memorandum was issued by the Government of the day, as an attempt to conciliate those who had voted for Customs duties, and found that protection had not been given to the workers. Paragraph 2 of that memorandum saysThe electors will be invited to empower the Commonwealth to determine the employment and remuneration of labour in protected industries, in view of the protection granted to the manufacturer under the Commonwealth Tariff. In some industries the existing protection may enable the payment of fair and reasonable rates of wages; in other industries, not sufficiently protected to enable the f u l l standard of remuneration to be paid, the payment of at least a minimum wage can be required pending the enactment of effective protection. Unprotected industries will not be affected. I took exception at the time to that statement. vernment go out of office immediately after the memorandum was issued ? there are industries in Australia which cannot pay fair and reasonable wages is one with which I do not agree, and to which no honourable member will on reflection subscribe.

We must continue to have strikes with starvation on the one side and the power of capital on the other, or we must have a law which will enable all the parties to a dispute to go before a Court presided over by a judicial officer capable of investigating the whole of the facts, and of coming to a determination upon them.

That was the intention of the Constitution, but we have departed from that intention, and I do trust that the people will refuse to allow us to do so. I am told that it is easy to unlock the door again, seeing that we have once opened it . Such an assertion only makes me smile. It is very much as if I had a safe with an ordinary lock upon it which I could open at will. If I put on one of those mysterious locks with a number or combination word, and lost the key or forgot the word, I might know that I could open the safe quite well if I could find the word. But what should I do if I could not find it? The position that this Parliament will be in if the country adopts the Premiers' agreement is this : While it was intended that we, as a Parliament, should meet financial and other difficulties, and look after the interests of the States as representing the whole people, and should have the power to legislate at any time according to circumstances, yet, however urgent the necessity, however great the occasion, instead of being able to pass an Act to meet that occasion, we shall have to wait for a referendum. three years unless a special referendum is taken. We know the difficulties about a special referendum, and how hard it is under exciting circumstances to get the people to vote upon an abstract question. If we do take a referendum, and the result is favorable, we can legislate, but to get a favorable'result from that referendum will be about as difficult as to open the lock after having lost the key. To secure a majority of the States and also a majority of the whole of the electors in Australia is, in easily conceivable circumstances, an impossibility. Why should we put ourselves in that position and mix up our finances at this time, which is really the first time that we have been in a position to exercise our powers? Every one felt that until the Braddon section expired it was idle to think of 'exercising those powers. We ought to have been talking the matter over and preparing for it, but the fact remains that until the end of 1910 the Commonwealth was not in a position to exercise the supreme financial powers conferred upon it by the Constitution.

High Court, in which the new Protection legislation was held to be unconstitutional, the Prime Minister saidPersonally I do not apprehend any difficulty whatever in dealing with this as a Federal matter. For the purposes of argument I have been speaking of cases which might arise in a single State. We must remember, however, that all the employers and the employees in this industry throughout the Commonwealth will have a common interest, and the natural and obvious means of protecting that interest will be by joint action all round. That statement was made by the Prime carried on in Australia, believing that we Minister in this House on 21st September, could legislate for it. 1906, about a fortnight after the honourable member for Boothby had succeeded to the honourable member, who is a Protecin carrying an amendment applying the tionist, but to the Free Trade members of principle of the new Protection to those his party. engaged in the harvester industry. I do not propose at this late hour to discuss at members of the honourable member's party length the necessity of giving the workers are Free Traders. some share of the protection that has been granted to the manufacturers, but I unhesitatingly say that the workers in that is quite wrong.

I ask the honourable member for Parkes not to interject continuously. allow me to reply to the interjection made by the honourable member for Parkes, but I say distinctly that members of the Labour party voted for these duties only to establish the industry in Australia, believing that an opportunity would then be afforded them, as promised by the Deakin Government of that day, to see that the workers in the industry received a fair share of that Protection. charge of the Tariff Bill,has stated distinctly that he made that promise and that he intended to carry it out. The Prime Minister has also stated since the decision of the High Court that he intended to carry out the policy of the new Protection, and the right honourable member for East Sydney said that he was heartily in favour of it. Many of the electors who at the last general election were promised that legislation would be passed to provide for the new Protection will require to know why they have been deceived by their representatives, and I admit that I shall do my best to enlighten them. I am confident that if the question were referred to the people a majority in each of the States would declare in favour of the Commonwealth Parliament powers with those of the States to pass industrial legislation. could to shut up the Federal Parliament for ten years. constituents might be inclined to do so, hav-. ing regard to the way in which he has represented them. I trust, however,, that-instead of urging anything of the kind they will try a change in their representation. It is hopeless for the.Government to believe that the people can be fooled any longer. They were promised fhe new Protection on more than one occasion, and they will want to know why that promise has not been carried out. If the question were referred to them to-morrow they would decide by an overwhelming majority in favour of a considerable enlargement of the constitu-tional powers of the Federal Parliament to legislate with respect to industrial matters.
