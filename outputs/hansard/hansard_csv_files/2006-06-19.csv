I am under a time constraint, and I do appreciate being able to juggle the order a little. In the chamber, when the report was being introduced, I spoke about the need to develop an entrepreneurial culture in this country. Innovation, as I see it, is the development of ideas, certainly the transference of technology, through to the commercialisation of the process. Essentially, that is the basis upon which successful countries have been able to articulate their innovation into action and ultimately into the economy. It is a little late in the day to simply sit back and wait for a good idea to materialise, hopefully get a lucky break and crack the market. One thing we found throughout our hearings was that, unfortunately, not all our best ideas made it to the marketplace. One reason why that has occurred is that it is not necessarily just scientific and engineering knowledge that supports a good idea into the marketplace; it is largely the development of the entrepreneurial skills to be able to support innovative content. We should not simply wait until people graduate from university to try and instil that culture. Quite frankly, that should be extended from schooling onwards. Therefore-as you would recall, Mr Deputy Speaker-one of the findings of this committee is that this should be engendered in our society very much from the earliest years, looking to develop innovative content but also with a view to looking at the skills necessary to make something happen; not just to dream something up but to make it happen. Innovation is not entirely based on the ideas, as I say-it must be looked at in relation to its commercial possibilities and its impact on society, business and the economy-but basically it is the transition of good ideas into a commercial process. In its report, the committee looked at the issue of entrepreneurial skills. The committee effectively acknowledged the importance of entrepreneurial skills to innovation, the transfer of technology and the commercialisation process. Evidence to the committee indicates that there has to be a fundamental reform in our thinking in that regard. As I said, it must become very much a cultural shift. Quite frankly, it is stooped in our education system. Therefore, in the opinion of the committee, it requires a whole-of-government approach. Given that there is a very clear link between entrepreneurship and innovation, for this country to match the global efforts of our competitors or at least to maintain our productivity and economic wealth, we need to be out there promoting the development of a cultural shift, and a culture of entrepreneurship must be consistent with all that. We found fostering a culture of entrepreneurship to be a critical step in improving this country’s pathways to innovation. It does not fall to any one group to do that, whether it involves innovative support mechanisms, education systems or business as a whole. Quite frankly, it is probably something that does require a whole-of-government approach in order MAIN COMMITTEE",154,Amendment Bill 2006
217,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Jenkins) Took The Chair At 4.00 Pm.,,157,Committees
218,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (4.00 Pm),"Let me say at the outset that I appreciate the considerato coordinate a policy link to assist in that regard. So formulating a program by which government can assist such a cultural shift and engender a more entrepreneurial culture requires the expertise of all those who assist in the development of our students, not only in schools but also in universities. Throughout this inquiry much was made of the fact that we are simply not encouraging people into sciences or engineering, and that some of the people leaving school do not have the maths ability to be able to cope with those areas. But that comprises only one leg of this argument. Certainly, we do need to encourage our kids into sciences and into engineering, and schools play a significant role in preparing kids for those areas. But if that is all we are going to produce, and we fall short on the issues of commerce and business development skills, I am afraid we are still going to be exporting our most valuable resource-that is, ideas. We do not just need to be able to conceptualise our ideas; we need to be able to shift those ideas into the marketplace. The committee addresses this point in recommendation 5, where it says that a whole-of-government task force should be established to investigate a suite of appropriate policy program measures to foster a natural culture. I think it is important that we do see innovation as more than just hatching a good idea and that we look at the process that is involved. On that theme, one of the things that the committee did notice is that there is certainly a lack of data available for us to be able to assess the level of business skills that we have. Despite the fact that our business skills and our entrepreneurial nature are critical to the development of commercial innovation, we found that there was very scant material available in terms of business and commerce graduates. That type of material does not appear in the Australian science and innovation system annual statistical snapshot put out by the Department of Education, Science and Training. The committee recommends that that be addressed. We think that the department should look very clearly at how we assess business and commerce graduates to make sure that we do have the requisite numbers. Without knowing that sort of data, we are not going to be totally successful in promoting this partnership that we would like to see eventuate between those in engineering and sciences, those who are going to conceptualise ideas, and those who are going to be out there with a view to commercialising those ideas for the benefit of business and of the Australian economy. In recommendation 4, the committee recommends that that data be captured and assessed by the department. Innovation is about growth. It is certainly the basis upon which growth can occur not only in a business but also in the economy. Innovation is therefore more important as we attempt to compete as well as extend our position within our region and within our marketplace. Internationally, innovation policy has become the key element of industry policy and is, surprisingly, seen as the main factor driving productivity and in turn economic growth. The path to international innovation or competitiveness in this country, quite frankly, can only be through those innovation processes. This government has presided over about 49, I think it is, consecutive monthly trade deficits. (Time expired) Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (4.11 pm)-I thank the chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Science and Innovation, the member for Kooyong, for giving me his time here this morning because I am required to speak in the chamber.

AlthoughI did not get MAIN COMMITTEE to as many of the meetings as I would have liked to, I tracked it through Hansard because it is something of critical interest to me in my electorate, particularly the chapter of the report on ‘human capital-knowledge and skills’. I would like to refer to three recommendations, Nos 3, 4 and 5. I would particularly like to emphasise recommendation No. 5: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government establish a dedicated whole-ofgovernment taskforce to develop a series of measures targeting the early development of entrepreneurial skills in the education system (including the early school years) and the broader community. To inform the development of these measures, the Committee recommends that the taskforce draw upon the expertise of educators, researchers and industry specialists. A bit of an indication for me, in coming to that conclusion with the committee, was my work with the Children’s Discovery Museum in Western Sydney. The Children’s Discovery Museum is actually an American concept. It is functioning in most American cities bar Washington, where, on my last study trip, I found that the Children’s Discovery Museum had in fact closed. But there is severe competition in Washington with the Museum of Natural History and the whole mall of incredible educational institutions. But in Sydney, our state capital city, we do not have those same options, and even less so in our other state capital cities around the nation. So how do you capture young people’s imagination and interest in science and encourage them to see that there is a job at the end of it? That is the critical thing, and that is why I have been a big supporter of the Children’s Discovery Museum concept, which initially will target just primary schools so that we are stimulating, capturing and keeping primary school children interested in science so they will then take it on into secondary school. I notice from the submission by the New South Wales Department of Education and Training that they are also interested in this key area and the drop-off in high school of students continuing with science. One of the key ways to address this would be through a science centre like the museum running the curriculum so that the New South Wales education curriculum comes out through the science centre. Science classrooms, which are incredibly dull, have not changed since we were at school, Mr Deputy Speaker-the old Bunsen burner, the picture of anatomy on the wall showing muscles, a few veins and things; it is still exactly the same-whereas most of the other classrooms have really progressed with what I call the ‘Discovery Channel of learning’. Take music: it is so fantastic, with the rock eisteddfods that go on; there is just so much that young kids can do in that line of entertainment. Take sport: my parents were always telling me to get out of sport because there was no future or career in sport. I would never suggest that to a young person. You can certainly have a great a career in sport and afterwards in sports management. But, with science, the children do not see a job at the end of it. We really need to make that connection, that there is a job at the end of it, and you would encourage that with this science centre. You would look at placing it adjacent to research facilities, having universities involved, and then having a clustering of industries around that, piggybacking off the research that is happening. Kids who go there in primary school could look to high school, to university, to clubs and associations, and to social activities and see a career and a future with Merck Sharp and Dohme or a number of the other companies that gave submissions to our committee. MAIN COMMITTEE It is interesting that a lot of companies made comparisons between Australia and other countries and I think it is important to pick up on those. This might sound like a particularly female point of view-and I am glad that the member for Mackellar and a few other women are present in the Main Committee with me-but recently at the Penrith markets I bought some shoes for $12. They are delightful shoes. All of my girlfriends compliment me on them; they are fantastic. But, if the fellow at the markets who sold me those shoes was making a profit, what on earth is China producing these shoes for? I have lost my local television manufacturer. It could not land the cathode ray tube for the television into Australia for the price at which China delivers the whole television set into Australia. I have lost a number of other manufacturing jobs in my electorate. We need to be on this end of things. We have targeted health and health services as particular areas where we would like to see innovation and reward for future jobs, employment and wealth generation in Australia. I was talking to one of my constituents today who is involved with the private health industry. They would like to see trade missions overseas by our health minister saying: ‘Hey, come and have a look at Australia. We’re leading in this area.’ We could target the wealthy area within Asia and say: ‘If you are going to undergo a medical procedure, Australia is the place to have it done. We have this expertise; we have the people who can do it.’ As we lose our manufacturing industry and move to other industries, we can only go ahead with those sorts of sales programs internationally if we have the appropriately skilled people here. Hence, recommendation No. 4 is to get an expanded snapshot of what is happening in our education facilities. How many students being educated and gaining degrees in Australia are going overseas? Foreign students, to start with, were never going to stay here, but how many Australian graduates also leave Australia to work overseas? What are the workforce participation rates of our science, engineering and technology graduates? We need to look at these critical issues to see where they are going. Firstly, we are training fewer of these graduates and, secondly, those we are training are either shooting overseas or not practising in their fields. We have to enhance people’s ability to see job pathways or ways forward to create, through innovation, their own jobs in their own industries. One particular statistic which I love that I often use with my primary school kids is that 60 per cent of them will be working in a job that does not exist yet. After these kids get through high school or university, they will work in a field that does not actually exist yet. That is what this report is all about. How do we find and, I suppose, pick winners in innovation? How do we find areas that will go ahead and then really target the human capital-the knowledge and skills-required to take those areas forward and bring them to fruition in terms of successful companies, whether or not they get listed on the Stock Exchange, that will create jobs in Australia for up and coming young Australians? It was a very important committee process-the public hearings and the report-for me to be a part of, given the work I have done with the Children’s Discovery Museum and the concepts that they have worked through with the New South Wales education department. They are actually looking at moving forward, and the federal government has actually funded a feasibility study for them. They are looking at about three or four sites for the Children’s Discovery Museum. One is the Parramatta Civic Place opposite the Riverside Theatre, a place identified by the Parramatta City Council. This was a very bipartisan committee, and this is a biparMAIN COMMITTEE tisan move by the councillors of Parramatta, the councillors of Penrith, who put forward Penrith Lakes, and the New South Wales government, who put forward the RTA lands at the intersection of the M7 and the M4. So there have been a number of options put forward in a bipartisan manner by the Labor and Liberal proponents of this idea. I think it has tremendous legs. This committee report goes further, saying that it is a very good idea. My Western Sydney colleagues and I will certainly be pursuing with the government some really concrete outcomes from this committee inquiry. Again, my congratulations go to the chair; he did an outstanding job, as always-and I thank him very much for allowing me to now go and do my duty in the other chamber. I commend the report to the House. ticipate in this debate on the report of the Standing Committee on Science and Innovation with the member for Lindsay, the member for Tangney and the member for Werriwa. It was a very bipartisan committee. BeforeI launch into the guts of what I have to say, can I also say, on behalf of the committee: we all send our good wishes to the deputy chairman, Mr Harry Quick, the member for Franklin, who fell ill during the report’s finalisation. I understand he is on the mend, but we do send him our thoughts. Earlier today the Standing Committee on Science and Innovation tabled its report Pathways to technological innovation. This is a significant report in terms of assessing the current support provided across the multitude of pathways leading from innovation to commercialisation. In its call for submissions to the inquiry, the committee defined innovation as: … the path of conceiving, developing and implementing ideas through to the generation of products, process and services. Most importantly, the committee said: It gives economic value to a nation’s knowledge. The end of the 20th century has been characterised by a further opening up of the world economy and the growth of knowledge based economies. In this environment, innovation is critical to enhance productivity, economic growth and global competitiveness. There is an increasing recognition of the importance of innovation to securing Australia’s future economic growth, environmental sustainability and social well-being. In recognition of the importance of supporting innovation, the Australian government has committed substantial sums of money-billions of dollars-under Backing Australia’s Ability, with a notion of enhancing our innovative and commercialising capacity. This has been a major investment. There have been a number of reviews, and the reality is that there is a substantial commitment; nonetheless, given the importance of innovation to Australia’s long-term economic performance, there is always room for improvement. The inquiry identified that there are areas of concern regarding the capacity of Australian business and research agencies to innovate. When the committee undertook to inquire into pathways to technological innovation, it sought to bring together a series of successful innovations and look at the obstacles they faced in commercialising research, with a view to making recommendations to the government. I have to accept responsibility for this approach and I also have to say that it was a little bit simplistic, because life was not like that. From discussions with researchers and entrepreneurs MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Committees
219,Mr Georgiou (Kooyong) (4.20 Pm),"by leave-CanI say what a pleasure it is to parand from the case studies, it became apparent that this attempt would only provide part of the picture. The evidence that came through to the inquiry showed that many successful innovators experienced a smooth pathway to developing their products and finding markets, and these experiences affirm the strength of Australia’s innovation systems. But one of the difficulties that we discerned fairly quickly was that the people who were successful tended not to see the impediments in their path. Having been a state director of a political party, I can say it is a bit like running a successful campaign: you tend to forget all the things that went wrong in the course of it and focus on the bottom line. This came over quite strongly in our discussions with entrepreneurs, innovators and scientists. But the reality is that, in addition to these submissions about positive case studies, the committee did hear a number of stories about innovation that was hampered because of gaps in the innovation support system. The reality that became apparent was that some pathways to innovation are well developed and relatively smooth for the Australian entrepreneur or the innovating business, and other pathways are less well formed. The committee has spoken to government agencies, researchers and businesses about where knowledge is needed, what difficulties are experienced and how support might enhance the pathway to innovation. From this process, Australian innovators themselves identified a number of consensus issues. The report seeks to address these concerns. The key issue for the inquiry was the difficulty of defining and measuring innovation. Once again, the reality is that the complexity of a concept or a process is resolved in the first instance by fairly crude and rigid definitions-or at least clear and rigid definitions. As greater insight is gained into the process, the definitions and concepts become more and more fuzzy rather than more and more clarified. This was an interesting insight into what was happening. Essentially, the notions of innovation and commercialisation have become broader. I think it is important that the system is capable of dealing with a high degree of ambiguity, because the simple truth is that it is a complex process and we do not completely understand it in any template form. In my view and I think the committee’s view, far from being a criticism, the general reluctance to impose an iron cage on the innovation process is a very real tribute to people’s ability to deal with ambiguity and the fact that there are many sources and many processes of innovation. As with the concepts, the notion of metrics in the system is quite complex. Metrics are essentially arbitrary determinants of how you measure innovation. We have had the generation of a significant number of metrics, and all of these are problematic in seeking to establish the level of innovation because, by and large, they all measure correlations rather than causes. They are about inputs rather than outputs. Once again, I have to say it is a complimentpartly because I may be a rigid personality myself-that the system has gained the capacity to say that the indicators are only indicators and we cannot impose them as final arbiters of what we fund and what we measure. Especially when governments are involved, I think the capacity for open-endedness is a tribute rather than a concern. But there are a number of indicators, and we do quite well on some and not so well on others. What came through clearly-and there was no dissension on this-is that there is a need for greater business skills and entrepreneurship in the area of technological innovation. The resolutions that people put forward were, however, quite different. There is the classic probMAIN COMMITTEE lem of making a good researcher into a bad businessman. Once again, here it is important that, while pushing more knowledge into the system, we respect the fact that there are no templates in this. The recommendations of the committee, especially in this area, are in some respects reasonably open textured, which I think they should be. The fact is that, when you are dealing with a complex area, the program structures are necessarily also complex, and complexity means that they are difficult to access. That was one of the problems that we encountered. The recommendations of the report go not so much to making the system rigid but to making it more accessible by providing greater information about it and by providing greater assistance to innovators to access the system. Here, again, there is a recognition of this complexity on the part of departments and, to a degree, they are trying to address it. We just think that there should be a greater focus on this. This was an important and I think complex review. I do not want to pretend that all the recommendations are freestanding and do not require more work, because that would be incorrect, but I think that the committee had the insight to realise where it could make very definite recommendations and where it could say that more work was needed. I commend the report to the House. Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (4.30 pm)-As a scientist in a previous life I was very excited to be involved in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Science and Innovation. I remain excited. It is very important to determine how to successfully transition a good technical or scientific advance to commercialisation. This inquiry into pathways to technological innovation, as the member for Kooyong has said, initially had as its focus the identification of issues that either assisted or inhibited the process of commercialisation. Unfortunately the identification of common issues did not eventuate. Where the commercialisation was successful, often no hurdles were identified, whereas for those that did not succeed it appeared to be all hurdles. As the inquiry had to focus on other issues, I will focus on some of the recommendations made in the report. BeforeI do this I would like to make a general point about science and technology-that is, if we cannot get people to become involved in science and technology there will be no scientific or technological ideas to commercialise in the first place. This is a very important point to realise. A prerequisite to pathways to technological innovation is having innovators in the first place. We have a looming crisis in this regard in that the number of students in science courses is dropping, particularly in some of the basic or what are often called ‘the enabling’ sciences. We need to engage our youth and get them to see the area as exciting and something they wish to pursue. The member for Lindsay spoke of engaging very young children in science. I agree that this is important, but I do not think that this is a critical issue. From my experience, children are actually natural scientists. All of us who have had kids remember the kids in the high chair. They will throw something out of the high chair-‘Oh, it drops. IfI throw it out of the high chair again I wonder if it will drop again.’ There is that scientific process of conducting the experiment and then repeating the experiment to ensure that it is in fact repeatable. Children are engaged in these areas anyway. The problem is that somewhere along the education track we are losing a lot of these students. In my experience the problem is keeping the youth interested and engaged through high school. Things such as the nuclear debate, wherever that may head, are actually engaging our MAIN COMMITTEE youth in thinking about scientific and technological issues. We need to determine how to do these sorts of things on a sustainable basis and do it more consistently and more often. In respect of recommendation 1, entrepreneurs and innovative thinkers are people who do not actually wait around for the right information to just turn up; they tend to aggressively seek it out and if it is not easily found they will go on and forge ahead without it. We saw cases of this during the inquiry. Some people referred to the success they had despite the fact that they did not know where, for example, to access money. This inquiry gave us the opportunity to gauge the use of support agencies. Potential users of the National Innovation Council were having difficulty engaging the assistance that they required when they needed the advice. It is important that access to assistance schemes is easy, streamlined and best suited to the needs of the user and not in some form that is best suited to our view of the way that it should be accessed. If contact is to be made by the user and it is not seen to be helpful or timely, then assistance will no longer be sought. From the National Innovation Council’s perspective, it is imperative to be contacted and to get it right, as it allows them to improve the services provided and builds important linkages. The benefit of this report is that it enables the National Innovation Council to be more proactive in getting to the people who require their assistance to promote their services. Hopefully, it will also provide the intersection between AusIndustry and the National Innovation Council to more effectively assist potential users who have not been aware of the service in the past. Recommendation 10 is that the government provide support to the CSIRO proposal for an Australian growth partnerships program to engage small to medium enterprises in demand driven collaborations with publicly funded research agencies. We believe that this has merit and needs to be actively pursued. The reason is that these collaborations allow small and medium enterprises to have access to a research and development ‘punch’ that would otherwise not be accessible to them and would allow these smaller enterprises effectively to have similar wherewithal to that of larger companies. Recommendation 11 is that the Australian government request the Business Industry Higher Education Collaboration Council to examine and develop the business case for third stream funding to universities. Third stream funding is an area that has been trialled in the UK and found to have significant benefits in terms of research and commercialisation outcomes. This funding makes research and teaching, the core businesses of universities, more relevant to society by funding universities to engage with society. Recommendation 12 is that the Australian government introduce a funded cluster development program to encourage the Australia-wide development of clusters which bring together innovation in research, business and education. In a similar fashion to recommendation 10 on the CSIRO issue, this gives smaller enterprises a bigger bang for the research dollar. In conclusion, this report is a good starting point regarding what we require to successfully commercialise science and technology. Clearly, however, we need to delve deeper into various aspects that have been drawn out in this inquiry. I commend the report to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Danby) adjourned. MAIN COMMITTEE Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee Report Debate resumed. take note of the report titled Improving the superannuation savings of people under 40 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration. At the outset I congratulate the chairman, the member for Cook, the deputy chairman, the member for Rankin, and all members of the committee on their very hard and extensive work on what I thought was a pretty challenging inquiry. In addition, I congratulate all of the members of the secretariat, who, as we all know in this place, do the real grunt work. They not only sit through the hearings but have to read through every submission-probably more extensively than we do, if the truth be known. Also, they have to prepare the draft report and then the final report and, along the way, put up with the idiosyncrasies of each committee member. SoI congratulate Mr Stephen Boyd, Mr Peter Keele, Ms Bev Forbes and their team. Superannuation is an increasingly important issue for the Australian community and the Australian government. The most pressing issue in superannuation today is the question of adequacy of superannuation savings. Since the introduction of the superannuation guarantee, we have had an exponential growth in superannuation savings, but it is well known that, at a rate typically of nine per cent, someone starting work even at a young age is not likely to have retirement savings that are adequate enough at retirement age to make them entirely selfsufficient in retirement. It is a very important challenge for us to ensure that that changes and that young people do recognise that, unless they go beyond what the superannuation guarantee delivers to them, they are going to be relying-at least in part-on a pension. Looking at the figures, I am sure that it would not give them the lifestyle they are looking for. I must say that it was fairly bold of the committee to seek a reference that was restricted to the under-40s. I think it is fair to say that that is where the biggest challenges are. Indeed, from the very beginning of the inquiry, the terms of reference narrowed the opportunities the committee had to make substantial recommendations. That was borne out during the various discussions held by the committee. It seemed that every time someone had a good idea, there were another 10 reasons why we should not embrace that idea. Going back to my thank yous, I acknowledge that I was not as active a participant in this inquiry as most other committee members were. That was simply because my shadow ministerial responsibilities did not allow me to attend all of the hearings or to read through all of the submissions. But I have very great confidence in the members who did sit on the committee. Like most House of Representatives committees-and indeed like most joint committeesthe members worked in a very cooperative way. They put politics aside as they tried to work through these very difficult issues. There are some good recommendations in the report. In particular, I think it is a very good idea to have a benchmark target for young people so that they have, in effect, put in front of their eyes very early in their working life exactly what they will need to gain retirement savings that are adequate to deliver the sort of lifestyle they require. Of course, that will be a general benchmark; it will not apply to everyone equally. It is also true that people can go and MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Committees
220,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (4.38 Pm),"I have great pleasure in speaking to the motion toseek information from a financial adviser if they are so motivated; but the reality is that people at that age tend not to do that. It is probably not until they get past the age of 40-or at least until they start having children and start thinking about retirement and the need to cater for not only themselves but their children-that they really start to focus on that issue. I think that is a very good initiative. I also think that encouraging people to enter into a voluntary scheme of co-contributions is a good idea. Of course, with all of the other pressing needs that arise at that younger age-the family mortgage, the school fees, even just feeding the children and all the things that seem to come at once in one decade-people are not likely to make the additional voluntary contributions unless they are prompted to do so. I think that giving people the opportunity from the very beginning of their working life, and getting them into the habit of making those contributions, is very helpful. I welcome all the initiatives to attempt to align the system for employees with people who are in small business. It is well known in this place that we have a growing number of selfemployed people in this country. As people start to utilise their skills in the area of selfemployment, it is very important that we ensure that that part of the workforce is in the superannuation system as well. Financial literacy is also important, and it goes to many of the things I have been talking about. It is worth noting that the committee struggled with the concept of the bottom threshold for SG contributions. We acknowledge that it seems unfair to those who are moving from job to job, but we realise that it could be a compliance cost nightmare for the small business people who have the paperwork to do and who have the obligation to make SG contributions. I thought it was interesting that, after a lot of debate, we decided in the end that it should probably stay where it is, but we will freeze it so that, over time in real terms, the figure will decrease and more people will come into the net of the SG system. Superannuation savings in this country are now approaching $1 trillion. That is a significant achievement in itself but it is not enough. Whenever we talk about superannuation it is worth reflecting on what the former Hawke and Keating governments did in putting that system in place. It has been an enormous success. It is also interesting to note that this committee report was effectively gazumped by the government’s superannuation announcements on budget night. The committee, of course, looked at the tax on the way in, the tax along the way and the tax on the way out-at all of those things that might impact on adequacy. While there are some very important recommendations, the committee concluded that the system as it stands is pretty right and that it remains highly concessionary. There is a lot of complexity because of the grandfathering of various changes over the last decade or more. As a result of our lack of big recommendations, as important as the recommendations are, I think it is fair to say that the committee concluded that the system, particularly as it applies to under-40s, is pretty right. You then have to ask yourself about the big superannuation changes announced by the government, and you can only conclude that there is some disparity between the thoughts of the committee and the thoughts of the government. I will leave it for others over the course of the next 12 months, as we debate those proposed changes, to conclude who was right and who was wrong. One thing that the government, the committee and all members of this place would agree on is the question of inadequacy. It remains to be seen whether the government’s proposals MAIN COMMITTEE are sufficiently targeted at that adequacy issue. While they are very strongly targeted at those who are exiting the system soon and very heavily targeted at reducing complexity, it remains to be seen whether they do what we hope would be done with respect to adequacy. Various submissions were made to the committee about tax deductibility-for example, on undeducted contributions-and those points were well made. Indeed, I wanted the committee to consider whether there was some merit in allowing people to draw down on undeducted contributions-that is, the contributions of money on which they have already been taxed at the marginal rate. The view is that people voluntarily put money in there and do not enjoy the concessions given to other contributions under SG or otherwise and that they should be able to draw down on that money now. It is an open-ended question. It would not be expensive for the government; it would increase savings at younger ages and would address that adequacy question. The committee, in its wisdom, decided not to further pursue that issue, but I would like to put that out there as a possibility for future thinking. Again, I congratulate the committee and the committee secretariat on their very good work. (Time expired) the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration titled Improving the superannuation savings of people under 40. Until recently, to the best of my knowledge, I was the only member aged under 40 of the committee that looked into this issue with respect to generations X and Y. As a young Australian, I took great pride in the work that the committee undertook on a bipartisan basis with respect to the recommendations that we put forward. I acknowledge the strong and hard work of the chair, Mr Bruce Baird, the member for Cook, as well as other members of the committee. I particularly acknowledge the hard and diligent work of the committee secretariat, who proved once again their incredible worth when it comes to inquiries of this kind. Of particular interest to me was the opportunity to travel and hear from a variety of people in different state capitals and other centres talking about some particular challenges of superannuation. There can be no doubt that, for people of my age demographic or those who are perhaps even younger, the word ‘superannuation’ seems to bear little, if any, relevance to their lives. The eyes of most people, when you talk to them about superannuation and retirement, simply glaze over, and it is pertinent that we should undertake this inquiry-and I am pleased we did-because the findings in some respects would seem to be common sense, but in other respects did draw on some useful analysis that the committee was able to undertake, which I am sure will go a long way towards better informing government with respect to the future development of policy. In particular, we know that Australia does have an ageing population. As the baby boomer age demographic moves through and we see an increasing number of people reaching the age of 65 and over, we will recognise that within Australian society there will be large demographic change. I am reminded of the fact that, 10 years ago or thereabouts, the number of Australians aged 65 and over was in the vicinity of 12 to 14 per cent of the population. We anticipate that over the next couple of decades the number of Australians aged 65 and over will reach close to 30 per cent of the Australian population. From a public policy perspective, this does present a number of unique challenges. At a time when many Australians-due to it largely being a legacy issue-believe that, having MAIN COMMITTEE",165,Committees
221,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (4.48 Pm),"I am pleased to speak to the motion to take note ofworked and paid taxes all their lives, they are entitled to an age pension that will keep them in the manner to which they have become accustomed, it would seem to me a significant policy challenge indeed to try to meet this expectation. This issue has been recognised by governments of both political flavours and, in this respect, I certainly welcomed the introduction of the superannuation guarantee. This committee’s report sought to expand on that superannuation guarantee and assess whether generations X and Y, those who will have had the advantage of the superannuation guarantee throughout the entirety of their working lives, will by the year 2042 have an adequate level of superannuation savings such that they could expect to not be reliant, or only in a very minimal form, upon the age pension. In this regard, I found the report to be particularly interesting. We found, in the main, that there is a great divergence-what we called an expectations gap-for young Australians between the annuity they would expect to flow from their superannuation lump sum, which has been compounding over a period of some 10, 20, 30 or 40 years, and what they thought they would be getting when they reached retirement age. It was very clear to the committee that there was a great gulf between people’s expectations and the reality. Indeed, recognising this gulf has given rise to a number of the recommendations that the committee has made to the government. I must at this point acknowledge the very good announcement made by the federal Treasurer, Peter Costello, in this, the 2006 budget. The degree to which we have simplified superannuation and the ramifications of cutting tax for those annuities or lump sum payments as people exit a taxed fund will make a very material difference to so many people’s lives in the future. It is very important. While I do not wish to understate the significance of this decision from a public policy point of view, the fact remains that we still need to undertake further work and further reform if we are going to ensure that future generations of Australians do enjoy the very best when it comes to their superannuation savings. In this respect, I would like to touch upon a number of the recommendations that the committee made. In particular, there is the recommendation that, as the best starting point, as a default position, Australians in new employment should automatically have three per cent of their salary, on a salary sacrifice basis, put into a default fund which they would have for their superannuation. Experience internationally, in both the United States and the United Kingdom, has demonstrated that there is a high level of disincentive for people to actually cancel that three per cent voluntary contribution, especially when it is in fact a default position. Having this three per cent default position does in fact make a material difference to the ultimate lump sum that is accrued in a superannuation fund by people making this voluntary contribution over and above the superannuation guarantee. That was a recommendation that I certainly wholeheartedly support and endorse because it is very clear that not enough young Australians have a full comprehension of or interest in their superannuation lump sum and what it means for their future. With Australians living longer and longer, it is very clear that people need to understand that having a small superannuation lump sum will simply not provide them with the income that they will need in their retirement. Another key recommendation targeted financial literacy among two key constituencies. The constituency I would like to touch upon is female Australian workers, who often exit the workforce for various reasons, the most common being to raise a family. It is very clear that many women unfortunately do not have adequate time in the workforce to accrue the lump MAIN COMMITTEE sum of superannuation that they need in order to ensure that they have an annuity in their retirement. It is very clear that Australian women face a real challenge in this respect, and I was particularly pleased that in recommendation 3 of the report we talk about what it is that the government can do to help to educate young Australian women about the need to set aside funds in superannuation for their retirement. We have made progress in this respect but still there is certainly much more that needs to be done, and it is high time from the public policy perspective that we continue building on the good work we have undertaken thus far but really start to focus Australian women’s minds on the fact that when they leave the workforce, when they focus on raising a family, there is a cost associated with that with respect to their superannuation and that we should ensure that we do what we can to provide an adequate lump sum for women-be it in the form of some of their maternity payment going into superannuation or be it in the form of other assistance going into superannuation-to assist them in that regard. Similarly, we decided as a committee that it would be worthwhile to develop a benchmark savings target. This would involve an individualised projection demonstrating on an annual basis to fund members what they would need to save, what their target would need to be and what kind of an annuity they could expect flowing from superannuation in order to keep them in the manner in which they would like to live with respect to future annuities. I welcome recommendation 4, which touches upon this particular aspect. Certainly much has been done in recent months as well by the Treasurer, Peter Costello, to ensure that those who are self employed are adequately looked after with respect to superannuation, and I welcome moves in that regard. Recommendations 5 and 6 in the report touch on this. Likewise, recommendation 8 deals with financial literacy for women aged under 40 with respect to superannuation. In summary, it is very important that young Australians recognise that providing for their superannuation, providing for their retirement income, is a key component to ensuring that they have a healthy, long-term ability to draw down funds from their superannuation in the form of an annuity that will ensure that they are not solely reliant on public funding, and that is the age pension. It is clear that there are several components to that. The superannuation guarantee is one component, personal savings are another component and for many Australians the age pension would be a third component. But at a time when Australians are getting older and the demands on the public purse are increasing, it is important that we focus the minds of Australians on their need to make personal contributions over and above the superannuation guarantee, and I welcome that. For hospitality workers on the Gold Coast, those who are transient through a number of jobs, I welcome measures in this report that highlight their need to build a lump sum of superannuation as well over a period of time and I certainly believe that more hospitality workers need to focus in this regard as well. This is a good report. I am pleased the committee worked in a bipartisan spirit to reach the outcomes that were embraced in this report and I commend it to the House. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (4.58 pm)-I too commend the committee’s report Improving the superannuation savings of people under 40. This report was undertaken in the context of an ageing population and obviously the quest for an adequate retirement income, which is essential given that people will be living longer and there is a need to offset the costs of an ageing population. Reducing the age pension costs against increasing costs of home and aged MAIN COMMITTEE care is a challenge, particularly when there will be a reduced workforce supporting an ageing population. It needs to be acknowledged that the Hawke-Keating government’s economic credentials and policies, particularly in introducing compulsory superannuation contributions in lieu of forgone wages, have benefited this nation enormously. In fact the billions of dollars of current super savings have made a major contribution to the economic growth sustained since 1996. This inquiry had a particular focus on young people, and I must acknowledge the excellent contributions many made. It was clear that young people do like having a guaranteed super contribution collected from their income, but they did have the view that superannuation is something you think about when you become much older. When choosing what they should do with any accumulated savings or surplus income, young people were more interested in retiring their HECS debt or acquiring a property rather than sinking money into the less tangible superannuation fund. I remind all young people that currently the interest charged on HECS debts is the lowest in the market and encourage them to pay the minimum. Several submissions were received urging the committee to recommend allowing early access to superannuation savings. This was rightly resisted, in my view. Early access would really just allow people to borrow from themselves, from their future security, taking quite a gamble that they would attain sufficient prosperity to offset this dipping into their superannuation. The facts, of course, do not support this kind of risky speculation. However, the committee, in considering the changed nature of work for young people, with the increased use of casual employment and the tendency towards multiple jobs and careers, did recommend that the income threshold of $450 should be maintained, not increased, and even perhaps lowered. Having watched many young people work in the hospitality industry, I know that many employers seek to dodge the superannuation guarantee levy by maintaining a large casual workforce and making sure that very few of them are given sufficient hours of work per week to guarantee collection of the superannuation contribution. I actually was one of the committee members who supported the abolition of the threshold, but I understand the added risk of this measure encouraging employers to resort to the black economy and paying cash under the lap to avoid compliance obligations. So, with some reluctance, I did agree with the recommendation, but I would like to see a youth employment advocate with real powers to pursue any employers who exploit young people in the workplace. The need for improved financial literacy training was supported by the committee. I must praise the New South Wales government’s initiatives that see young girls in high school being given this sort of training in school hours in special workshops. It is a wonderful idea and I was delighted to share my experiences in this regard with one group of participants from year 10. Our recommendation that all employees be placed in a voluntary scheme with the ability to opt out is quite radical but is worth consideration by the government. A three per cent imposition-as a default voluntary contribution-was suggested, and I look forward to this recommendation being debated. The need for better individualised information from super funds and better regulation and supervision of this information from ASIC would be a welcome improvement on current practice. Realistic savings targets and projections would allow people to make informed choices about their financial future. MAIN COMMITTEE Recommendations that would harmonise the tax treatment of invalidity payments for selfemployed people and bring unincorporated small business into the superannuation guarantee system should also be fully pursued by the government. In fact, I think there has been some espionage going on, because the government moved towards one of those recommendations in the last budget. The recommendation that maternity leave and maternity bonus payments should include the payment of super guarantee contributions is an excellent one, since women clearly are disadvantaged by moving in and out of the workforce because of family commitments. The committee also supports the co-contribution measures now in place and would like to see a concerted campaign to inform a wider audience, particularly young people, of the benefits of this scheme. Co-contributions are also a way for many women to attempt to catch up in establishing an adequate and realistic superannuation savings account. The recommendation of the report to remove the 10 per cent work test regarding eligibility for the co-contribution would help to overcome the current disadvantage to self-employed women and others who have been out of the workforce who are still making superannuation contributions as well as to people returning to study and retraining-a fact of modern life. The latter is imperative, given the skills shortage in this country and the need for continuous learning and up-skilling that characterises modern employment. The recommendation for a single default super fund for casuals and young people is one I would particularly like to see implemented, especially when people are members of so many different funds. I can imagine a government tendering this kind of service as a no-frills, lowcost service that allows people who belong to multiple funds to belong instead to just one fund. It is common practice for many young people to lose track of those multiple funds that they belong to and then, to many of them, those superannuation contributions are lost forever. Our suggestion that this be an opt-out provision, allowing for choice if so desired, is a good one. There was more we could have explored, given time to pursue some issues raised in evidence. For example, one witness told us of the situation for expats when they work overseas for lengthy periods. They may pay or accumulate super in another country, then receive their pay-out when returning and use that for the cost of their return airfare or for their resettlement costs in Australia. But then they discover that they are perpetually behind in accumulating superannuation towards their retirement. In fact, that witness recommended perhaps putting some information on travel documents or passports to explain that. It would also be worth the government exploring bilateral arrangements with some countries to allow the superannuation to stay with the person and the funds to be transferred back to Australia. I have concerns that many young people with multiple accounts have their amounts diminished by multiple fee collection and multiple collection of death and disability payments. However, our recommendation for a default for those in multiple schemes would help to overcome this. I also congratulate the secretariat on their excellent support of this inquiry. Anything we can do in this parliament to assist those under 40 to plan for their financial future is worthy of support. I note the comments by the member for Hunter that the last budget did show the Treasurer’s preference to assist people over 60 and to give some sort of superannuation benefit to them. It is clear from this inquiry that there is a real need to look at getting more people MAIN COMMITTEE into superannuation rather than encouraging bonuses and greater payments when they retire. But I think that is a debate that has to be had. I also recommend this report to the parliament and thank the committee members. It is a committee that, unlike some, worked in a very bipartisan way. Its leadership is excellent and I pay full tribute to the chairman, Mr Baird, and to the secretariat. Debate (on motion by Mr Ticehurst) adjourned. EAST TIMOR Debate resumed from 13 June, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the statements. speak in this chamber about the commitment of Australian troops again to East Timor. WhilstI welcome the commitment by the government-and it is widely supported within the community-I do want to express my concerns about how it might, in the longer term, stretch the capacity of the Army to do its work. I was fortunate to be in Timor-Leste in October-November 1999, just after the Australian troops began their task in that first fateful period after the independence vote when, as a United Nations sanctioned force, they were leading a multinational force of troops which was more than ably led by General Cosgrove. I had the fortune of meeting General Cosgrove and some of his commanders whilst I was there, very early on in their task, and the commitment of those senior soldiers, the officers and General Cosgrove, was then a great tribute to all of us, as I am sure it is now with the current group of senior officers-the commanding officer and his officers-and the soldiers who are present in East Timor. I want to make the observation that, some while ago, I was fortunate enough to visit Australian troops in Iraq at Al Muthanna. We hear now that it is proposed that the Iraqi forces will take over the security task which was then being undertaken by the Australian Army, and I commend the Iraqi armed forces for doing that. Whilst the Australian government has said that it is proposing to maintain the deployment of the current set of troops or those who would be in the next rotation of the same size as the group at Al Muthanna to do other functions, I would like to know what those functions are and just would proffer the question as to whether or not we will be able to maintain that task group when, at the same time, we have committed ourselves-certainly in the short term, and I suspect in the medium to longer term-to a new force in East Timor. I also want to make the observation that it is a grave disappointment that we have been required to go back in force to Timor-Leste. It is a grave disappointment to those of us who were involved prior to supporting the resistance forces in the years after 1975 and subsequently to be in a position where Australian troops are now being recommitted there. I want to express my disappointment at the inability of the Timorese armed forces and the Timorese government to maintain its own security, but I do not put the blame upon them. I suspect it is a lot more appropriate for us to contemplate the position and the decisions taken by the United Nations when it decided to withdraw the United Nations forces, including the Australian forces, previously. WhilstI know there was great debate about whether or not the East Timorese should have a standing army, I do make the observation that I was in New York at the time that representaMAIN COMMITTEE",167,Committees
222,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (5.06 Pm),"Let me first say how pleased I am to be able totions were being made to the United Nations by the Timorese diplomats and by the Timorese foreign minister, Jose Ramos Horta, about prolonging the stay of the United Nations, and there was much debate about how long that stay should be, what sort of force structure it should entail and whether or not we should have armed forces of the type that were there previously continuing on. I know that the Australian government took the position that it was no longer an appropriate thing for us to be doing, that it was their view and the view of the United Nations generally, the Security Council, that it was time to scale down the United Nations occupation. I have to say that I think in hindsight that has proven to be a very poor decision. I would say to the government that they should err on the side of caution when discussing these issues now and in the future in the United Nations and just perhaps reflect that the East Timorese are in a very good position to judge what is in their own interests. If the East Timorese ask for more, I would rather give them more than less, whether that be Australian troops or other foreign troops, or Australian police or other foreign police. As we lead up to the next election in Timor-Leste some time early next year, it is very important that there is a sense of peace and harmony in the community, that we do not have thugs wandering around the streets disturbing the peace or, more importantly, putting lives at risk and killing people. We need to have an election in a peaceful environment. Whilst making that observation, I would also say there has been much comment over the last month or so about Prime Minister Alkatiri and his government. I make no judgment about the capacity of that government, but I do make this observation. You will recall that there was a Fretilin conference at which Prime Minister Alkatiri was reindorsed as president of Fretilin, apparently on a show of hands. However, there was no secret ballot. This, of course, was disparaged by the international media, certainly the Australian media, as a sign that the country and the Fretilin were not committed to democracy. I note that over the weekend this government took great pride in the fact that it subverted an attempt by the Japanese at the International Whaling Commission to have a secret ballot and was able to claim victory as a result of the decisions taken at the International Whaling Commission. I make no observation other than to say that one man’s meat is another man’s poison and, in this case, the government ought to understand that I do not think it does it well for it or some of its officials or, indeed, the media, to make the sorts of observations and judgments that were made in the case of Timor-Leste and not make similar judgments in similar sets of circumstances in other forums. It seems to me it is a contradiction that also shows some sense of hypocrisy. In any event, we have a task ahead of us to secure the community of Timor-Leste to ensure that they have a long and viable future as a stable democracy. We need to do everything we possibly can to assist them. The Australian troops, I know, will do their job well. They are well equipped. We want to make sure that they can maintain their ability to do the task that they have been set. We need to make sure that decisions taken by the Australian government are in accord with what the international community believes is important for us as a community, but also most importantly for the international community, in terms of sustaining this small new democracy into the future. I know that the Australian government at the moment is not thinking about this because it believes that the Australian forces should be based there on a bilateral arrangement with the MAIN COMMITTEE Timor-Leste government-but I wonder whether it would perhaps be more appropriate if they were there under blue berets and that they were not a leader of a coalition of the willing, if you like, but in fact a United Nations sanctioned occupation force under United Nations rules and regulations and under the blue beret, where Australia might be the lead nation. I know that that could well be something of great debate, but I think it is important that we understand our position and realise that in the longer term it probably does not suit us to be seen as an occupying force. It would be far better to be seen as being part of a United Nations sanctioned force rather than just on a bilateral arrangement. I want to complete my contribution by making some observations about a book I recently read about the occupation of East Timor by Australian forces in 1942-the 2nd/2nd commandos. I feel passionately about this issue of Timor-Leste and the importance of us supporting this community into the future-supporting its government and supporting the President with the Prime Minister and the foreign minister. President Gusmao has, I understand, only last week or a week or two ago made Jose Ramos Horta defence minister as well as foreign minister. It is important that we support them in their roles, ensure that they can work together and ensure that we do not do anything to undermine their capacity to govern appropriately. I go back to 1942 and this book which is called All the Bull’s Men. It is about the 2nd/2nd commandos who were in East Timor trying to rebuff the Japanese occupation, working with the Dutch and the Portuguese-the Dutch in West Timor and the Portuguese in East Timor. It is about the trials and tribulations of that force, the support they received from the East Timorese community and the punishment that was meted out to the East Timorese community by the Japanese as a result of their assisting the Australian forces. The Australian troops never forgot that, and I know that some of the most strident supporters of the quest for independence by the East Timorese have been members of the 2nd/2nd Commando Association. I say that because my father was a member of that association-not that he served in East Timor, but he was a member of the 2nd/2nd commandos subsequently. I knew many of those men, many of whom have passed on. What they told me in the time that I knew them was of sacrifices that were made for them by the East Timorese. I think that we, as a nation, can never forget it. Despite the disparaging comments that might be made about certain individuals in East Timor-the Prime Minister in East Timor or whoever-we have an obligation as a community to understand the sacrifices which were made on our behalf by the East Timorese in the Second World War and that saved many Australian lives at great cost to themselves. It is asserted that up to 40,000 East Timorese died during the Japanese occupation. I think the Australian force was somewhat less than about 300. They were able to frustrate the Japanese for 12 months by running a very effective guerrilla war with the support of the East Timorese community. We must never forget that and, when we are contemplating what our role should be-now and into the future of East Timor-we must ensure that whatever happens, whatever the outcome, we sustain the desire for independence, the desire for democracy and that we do everything we possibly can to support them. member for Lingiari in his current role and in his former role as member for the Northern Territory. The member for Lingiari has had probably the most long-standing involvement with the East Timorese community in Australia of any parliamentarian, and he has had a record of MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Committees
223,Mr Kerr (Denison) (5.18 Pm),"This House would do well to heed the remarks of thespeaking about the circumstances of that country-formerly when it was part of Indonesia and as it went through its turmoils-that every other member of this House could learn much from. I think those remarks are ones which we ought to reflect on. I might make my own comments about the deployment of Australian forces in East Timor. The member for Lingiari put his finger on one of the greatest errors that was made in the judgment of the international community but more particularly the Australian foreign affairs establishment when it proposed and then executed a decision to wind down the UN presence after independence. It was a decision taken against the wishes of the government of East Timor, which was concerned about the stability of the new nation and looked to the international community to have an ongoing presence beyond that which was ultimately mandated. I think that the member for Lingiari is too gentle when he reflects on those that participated in the decision, because largely the international community took its lead from the advice tendered by Australia-that is, the United Nations brought its engagement and deployment to an end because the Australian government pressed it to do so. The problem that we face now is similar to the circumstances and lack of foresight that applied in the Solomons. In both instances the Australian government took a short-term decision-in the case of East Timor to wind down a deployment that prevented an escalation of violence and in the case of the Solomons not to involve itself in making any effort to prevent the breakdown of civil order in that country. They were decisions which in the end resulted in Australia having to commit far greater resources of far greater substance at far greater risk than would have been the case had earlier decisions been made on a more sustainable basis. There is an old proverb that we all know and that was drilled into us as kids if we come from an Anglo-Saxon background: a stitch in time saves nine. Two instances have confronted the Australian foreign affairs establishment in our own backyard, in the South Pacific and in our near north, where we have failed, where we have not understood the dynamics of the local community and where we have not applied ourselves intelligently to the security circumstances of those countries. In East Timor after independence we were part of an international force deployed on the ground to assist in the building of a new nation. The nation had been riven by internal conflict in the past, where the actions of elements previously loyal to the Indonesian regime had been in conflict with Fretilin and other forces seeking independence for East Timor. That conflict saw a huge proportion of the population of that now independent nation killed in circumstances which were vividly displayed in a recent fictionalised series that the ABC put to air about those tragic events. When we were pressed by that government in its frailty to continue to have troops and a presence on the ground from the international community, we took a short-term, pennypinching decision: ‘No, let’s go home. It’s time to go home. Leave that country to its own resources. Let’s withdraw.’ The tragedy is that, when we did that and then the tensions that were inherent and under the surface bubbled to the top, we had to come in with a military solution, which was inefficient because it was not effectively a policing solution and which came in after lives had been lost. In the same manner, if we go to the instance of the Solomon Islands, I was part of a joint delegation of this parliament that went to the Solomon Islands. We were confronted with a request from the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands that Australia make available seven MAIN COMMITTEE Australian Federal Police officers to be part of a regional group-that is, from Papua New Guinea, Australia, Vanuatu and perhaps Fiji; I cannot remember the precise break-up that they were speaking off-to assist in law enforcement because they felt that circumstances were becoming so frayed that their country might be on the brink of something quite terrible. What surprised me as we left that meeting with the Prime Minister, and as I turned to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who were hosting us, was that we had gone into that meeting without that important knowledge being made available to us. As parliamentarians we were not supposed to know that the government of the Solomon Islands had made that request. It was an embarrassment to our high commission that the Prime Minister had made that embarrassing request to us. The delegation was not stupid. The delegation had subsequent meetings. We met with the Leader of the Opposition and we said, ‘What do you think about the Prime Minister’s request?’ The Leader of the Opposition said: ‘We support it. This country is facing the possibility of breakdown and whilst we, of course, oppose the government of the day and would like to see ourselves replace it, we recognise that we are on unsound ground and we need some local police to prevent an outbreak of violence in our community.’ Then we went to the chief justice of the Solomon Islands and we asked the same question. The chief justice said, ‘The constitutional position doesn’t leave this in my hands, but my personal view is that our country faces the prospect of disintegration unless we have such assistance.’ On coming back to Australia. I immediately wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs drawing attention to these requests and saying, ‘There was a foreign affairs, but also a national interest, imperative in us responding constructively to those requests.’ Again, sadly, we did not; we did not take the stitch in time. When the country fell into the chaos that it did with loss of lives, with an insurrection, with a coup, we then had to bring in the military and a stabilisation force. We withdrew it and we had to go back again. We have had these patterns of not anticipating, not thinking through the kinds of engagements that we are so vitally involved in in our own backyard. If there is one place where Australian diplomatic intelligence and diplomatic strength on the ground matters, it is in the South Pacific. Here we are the regional superpower. It may be in the order of status within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that a posting to Italy or a posting to Vienna is infinitely more desirable, but in terms of our national interest such postings should be significantly less important in their status and in their resourcing than those in our near neighbourhood, where we actually are the superpower, where what we do matters, where the countries actually request of us assistance and where our decisions either to grant that or to refuse it have the kind of profound implications that they have had in the Solomon Islands and in Timor-Leste, and may have in Papua New Guinea and other countries where the potentiality for discord, and even for breakdown in civil governance, cannot be entirely discounted. That is why I am concerned in this instance to use these reflective moments to, firstly, say we honour those who have responded to the call in our military to go to East Timor. We make no criticism of them, but they have had to come in after the Australian foreign affairs establishment dropped the ball in terms of its decision and got out cheap. In the same way we had a much higher cost in the Solomons, where we did not take advantage of an opportunity before the country descended into chaos to stabilise situations, and we have had two military interMAIN COMMITTEE ventions which have had significant costs to that country and to the relationship generally between the peoples of it. These are important lessons that we need to learn. We need to be ready to anticipate and to act with some understanding of our regional importance. I think that the time has long ceased where we can have an order of priority in terms of our diplomatic establishment that allows our postings to be determined on the old traditional method, where the greatest seniority applied to people holding European and old-world positions. This is our sphere of influence. This is where what Australians do matters. We also have to think carefully about the point that the member for Lingiari spoke about-that is, we have to beware of becoming an army of occupation. If we do go into these countries, we have to carry the international community with us and be blue-hatted where that is possible. We also have to beware that we do not find ourselves in exactly that situation in Iraq, where we are now being invited to reconsider our mission. The Prime Minister of Iraq has said that he expects foreign forces to be out of the country by November 2007, and in all but two provinces he expects foreign troops to be out by the end of this year. Those provinces do not include the provinces in which Australia currently has its troops. A good friend knows when to leave. When a host starts making hints like that, you start making plans to get out. The Australian government has to listen to this; otherwise it will be perceived not only by the extremists in Iraq but also by large sections of the population that Australia is overstaying its welcome. Sadly, Bush and Blair seem to have a tin ear. They have not responded to what is a signal of growing national impatience in Iraq about a perceived foreign occupation of that country. If we do not have a little more sophistication in our response, but simply go along as clones of the Bush-Blair strategy of saying there is an indefinite occupation and an indefinite commitment of our troops-notwithstanding the judgments of the local national governmentthen we will risk being seen as an army of occupation, and not only by the al-Qaeda related people or even the former Saddamist loyalists but also by a widespread group of persons in that country. In the same way, if we do not build a coalition that presents us in Timor under blue helmetsand substantial point, and the dopey minister at the table, who cannot make a connection between two foreign engagements in which Australia faces the same risk, demonstrates the incapacity of this government to be other than politically narrow in the national interests of its community. We do not need that kind of foolishness and short-sightedness. We need a government that focuses on the national interest instead of chiding oppositions by making short sighted points. We need a government that is respectful of our national interests and understands the risks that a foolish ignorance of circumstances may place our troops at.

Prime Minister and Cabinet Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $841,720,000 what I see as a continuing scandal in Public Service employment as it relates to the employment of people with disabilities. The particular responsibility in this area lies with the Public Service Commission, and therefore under the aegis of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The Public Service Commissioner’s own report, the State of the service report 2004-05, statesA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 5.34 pm to 5.51 pm vice Commissioner State of the Service Report 2004-05 makes clear: Over the past decade the data shows a consistent decline in the employment of people reporting a disability as a proportion of APS employees. At June 2005 people with a disability represented 3.8 per cent of ongoing APS employees, down from 3.9 per cent last year and from 5.4 per cent in 1996. If the percentage remained the same, there would be 2,000 more people with disabilities employed in the Australian Public Service. It goes on to say some things about the changing structure of the Public Service, which clearly is part of the explanation, and I accept that. But it says: ... the past 10 years has seen a decline in the representation of people with a disability at all classification levels. It really is a serious indictment. To put the numbers away from percentage terms, there were 7,008 people with a disability in 1996 and 4,642 in 2005. Allowing for a slight drop in the overall size of Public Service employment, the effective difference, if we had maintained the percentage, is that there are 2,000 fewer people with a disability in the Public Service than previously. This is not a one off. Since 1996 the proportion of people with a disability has fallen every year except 2003, when it plateaued-5.4; 5.3; 5.1; 4.8; 4.5; 4.2; then it was 4 per cent for two years; 3.9 and in 2005, 3.8. I say to the government that, if it is genuinely concerned about employment for people with disabilities, start employing some. I notice that the Minister for Employment, who is also the Minister assisting the Prime Minister on Public Service matters, has called a roundtable to encourage employers to take on more people with a disability. I do not have any disagreement with him doing that and I suppose no-one would be rude enough when they turn up to say: ‘We’re all doing better than you, Minister, and it would be good if you showed an example.’ What is happening is a disgrace. It is happening quietly, without any fanfare, without any analysis, without any commentary. It is a disgrace. The government is putting pressure on people with disabilities to go back into the workforce; some of the measures I agree with, some I do not.

227,Mr Mcmullan,"As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, as the Public Serpeople who have disabilities in our community and have the capacity to work to be in employment. The Public Service Commissioner’s statement of Public Service values makes it clear that it wants to recognise and utilise the diversity of the Australian community it serves. It wants to promote equity in employment. It wants to provide opportunity to all eligible members of the community to apply for APS employment. The State of the service report 2003-04 found a similar trend of declining recruitment levels and retention rates for Indigenous employment. The government did respond. At this stage I cannot indicate the success of the response-I am not going there because it is probably too soon to measure-but they did respond with an attempt to institute a centralised strategy to increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employment in the public sector. It is time they did the same for people with a disability. What is happening now is a scandal. It is totally unacceptable. I would like to see by the next budget that the government has initiated, and the Public Service Commission is implementing, a similar centralised strategy to increase disability employment in the Public Service. ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (5.55 pm)-I thank the member for Fraser for raising this matter. I can certainly assure him that the government would take those observations seriously. The interesting thing about all those statistical readouts, whether in a percentage term or an actual term, is that it also relies on people accurately reporting whether or not they see themselves as having a disability. The changing mix of workforce circumstances could have an impact on that. I do not think there is any reason to dispute the ambition, which the member for Fraser has acknowledged, of the government trying to encourage more people who see themselves with disabilities identifying the need to move away from a welfare circumstance into an employment circumstance. I also agree with the member for Fraser that the public sector has an important role to play in providing an example to the private sector about looking at the entire Australian potential workforce, particularly at a time when we are short on people. There is a lot of talk about skills, but we are short on people. The member for Fraser also acknowledged Indigenous workforce matters. In a previous portfolio role I looked very closely at the non-English-speaking background make-up of our public sector. I noted-anecdotally, I will submit-that there were fluctuations, ups and downs, in the number of people from an NESB first and second generation in the statistics collected by the Public Service Commission, mainly because a lot of people who might have been a second-generation Australian did not see themselves as being from a non-English-speaking background. I speak of the very large numbers of post-World War II immigrants from southern Europe-Italy, Greece and so forth. They saw themselves as Australian rather than from a particular ethnic background that was supposedly non-Australian, or however you want to describe it-which, of course, is not a reasonable descriptor at all. It is important that we have positive employment programs that encourage our first Australians, our most recent Australians and indeed those from a disability circumstance to be featured in the public sector. And, of course, we do. We do not have programs that prevent people from being part of the public sector workforce. As I said, I think the public sector has an important role to play in showing the private sector the way forward. MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Appropriation Bill No 1 2006 2007

I can certainly say from the government’s point of view, and as a minister who is looking at initiatives to train up those who have been out of the workforce to reenter the workforce in either the public or private sector, there are enormous amounts of money deliberately set aside. SoI can say to the member for Fraser that there are no impediments to progress. I do not believe there is anything to indicate that there is a will against progress. I thank the member for Fraser for his contribution in this consideration in detail stage because I do not think it hurts to constantly encourage, as this government has done, each of the secretaries of departments to realise that they have a role to advance the cause of our first Australians-or else their own performance based pay arrangements might be affected-so that we do not see accounting methods for disabled Australians, Indigenous Australians and indeed people from a non-English-speaking background simply as an accounting exercise. There needs to be a positive reason for hiring people, and setting out policies that make it very plain that we want to report progress on that. So, I do not mind the member for Fraser’s challenge. I am sure that Dr Shergold, the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, will note those comments very closely, and I look forward to improvements in the following years. we should move on to discuss some other departments as well this evening, I will confine my questions and remarks to two areas of Prime Minister and Cabinet activity. Budget Paper No. 2 says, on page 314: Additional funding will also be provided to support PM&C in providing the secretariat to COAG and its work on the National Water and Living Murray initiatives. The government announced in 2004, in what was described as a first step, that under the Living Murray program some 500 gigalitres in environmental flows would be returned to the Murray River by 2009. My question is: how are we going regarding this target? Is it correct, as has been said to me, that no additional gigalitres have been delivered to the River Murray through the Living Murray program? My follow-up question is: how do you see this target being met? Do you think that the target will be met? In addition, is it the case, as I have also heard, that the government is not planning to buy any water from willing sellers? If you do not intend to buy water from willing sellers, how do you intend to meet the first-step target? That is the first set of questions I wanted to ask. The second set of questions arises from page 312 of Budget Paper No. 2, under ‘Auditing-increased activity’, where it indicates that an additional $3½ million will be provided over four years to enable the Audit Office to, amongst other things, increase auditing of the Department of Defence. My first question is: what is the reason for the increased auditing of the Department of Defence? Behind that, why are the Department of Defence’s audit reports so poor? Further, what is the government doing to implement the Auditor’s recommendations so we do not keep coming back to this situation of poor and unsatisfactory audit reports for Defence? I will confine my remarks to those questions and seek a response to them. MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Appropriation Bill No 1 2006 2007
229,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (6.00 Pm),"Given the shortage of time and the idea thatpm)-I refer to the member for Wills’ questions relating to the Living Murray Initiative. As the honourable member correctly observed, the Living Murray Initiative is an intergovernmental agreement an essential part of which involves the recovery of 500 gigalitres of permanent water for environmental purposes-that is to say, for the purposes of watering six important environmental sites on the river-by 2009. In the intergovernmental agreement, a number of methods of water acquisition or water recovery were covered. They included: funding infrastructure, water savings infrastructure and water efficiency infrastructure, with the water saved being transferred over to the environmental account; purchases on market; purchases by tender; and a number of other methods of acquisition. The relevant governments agreed to proceed initially on the basis of acquiring water through funding infrastructure which would save water through efficiencies. There are a number of these proposed investments, the largest part being from Victoria but with investments coming through from New South Wales and new contributions, as at the last Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council meeting, from South Australia. The best estimate that I could give the honourable member is that around 300 gigalitres is most likely to be recovered by 2009maybe more than that, but it is very unlikely to be less. So concern has been expressed for some time that the 500-gigalitre first-step target will not be met. The Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council recently approved a new policy proposal of the Commonwealth’s to acquire water from willing sellers via a tender, which will be launched shortly. But it is a tender with a twist, because the water that is to be bought must be water that either has been or will be made available through water efficiency measures. ‘Why are we doing that?’ the honourable member may ask. It is because we are seeking to achieve two objectives. We are seeking to recover water for the environment-which, of course, is the objective of the first step under the Living Murray Initiative-but at the same time we are seeking to promote the more efficient use of water in the agricultural sector, which is mostly irrigation in that part of the country. The aim is to ensure that the amount of water actually available, or productively available, for agricultural use will not be diminished. Plainly, if a farmer has the right to extract 100 megalitres but, for reasons of inefficient infrastructure or inefficient practices, only 50 per cent of that is being put to productive use, and if the amount of water that is being lost through inefficiencies can be recovered through more efficient infrastructure and is then acquired for the environment, you have genuinely achieved a win-win situation: some water has been saved for the environment and the infrastructure is more efficient. This is exactly the same philosophy as underpinned the first approach-that is, the direct funding of infrastructure approach-but this measure enables the dollars to get down onto the farm rather than go only to finance large-scale infrastructure. It enables the water efficiency dollars to be accessed by individual farmers often for small-scale measures, nonetheless which in aggregate will prove very important in recovering water for the environment. ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (6.07 pm)-I thought I would take the opportunity to give the member for Wills some response on the matters he raised in his contribution a few minutes ago and to thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister for his detailed response on the National Water Initiative.

231,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton,"Minister for Vocational and Technical Education and MinAustralian Governments’ agenda is enormous. I can say that, in the primary role I have in the government as the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, we are looking forward to the detailed work that is going to come out of this Council of Australian Governments deliberation in the area of occupational licensing and skills matters alone. The matter within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, with an additional vote of resources to handle the coordination of that, therefore, is a substantial and good investment in the way Australia needs to gear itself for the rest of the 21st century. We are undoing, rebadging and indeed reestablishing some 19th century concepts that have worked well through the 20th century but need to work far better when it comes to Australia’s skills base. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet are very much at the heart of those tasks. Equally, on the funding for the task force to deal with the APEC conference, there are certain broad assumptions that have been used in a lot of these items. After all, APEC is going to be the largest meeting of its kind ever to occur in Australia so there are no benchmarks for us to refer to. There was some underspending in the previous year and there has been some refocussing this year. The budget was developed in January last year, ahead of some significant planning for the event. The underspending of $18.8 million was due to difficulties in estimating in advance the expenses required for this project, including the expenses by year. These uncertainties caused the Department of Finance and Administration to provide on a no-win no-loss arrangement for the quadrating of this funding in its provision as it is required. In that regard we have the flexibility to respond to that. From a staffing point of view, the department’s average staff for 2006-07 is expected to increase, by 89, to 564. The increase in staff is in response to supporting the COAG agenda-as I said, substantial and important work for Australia’s future. This government has its eye on where Australian needs to be 20 and 30 years from now. It is not just dealing with where we have been over the last 20 or 30 years. The investment in an additional 30 staff for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is a very good investment indeed. Recruiting for the APEC task force will require some 59 people, and that is continued recruiting that is taking place. With regard to the additional auditing that the member outlined in his earlier question, I am happy to seek some further advice on that. At the end of it, the general principles always stand. The Department of Defence has a massive expenditure of public moneys. It is very much involved in an important task in a lot of different places at the moment. PM&C want to offer additional resources to make certain that the real task of defending and advancing Australia’s interests overseas is the primary work of Defence. At the same time, ensuring that we can report to the people of Australia the correct expenditure of those moneys means that it is not just up to Defence alone; it is up to PM&C to play its central coordinating role. minister for their responses. CanI follow up the issue of the Living Murray Initiative, which the parliamentary secretary responded to. He indicated that around 300 gigalitres-obviously there are some qualifications on the estimate-are likely to be recovered by 2009 through efficiencies and he then spelled out the path that the government is going down and the steps it is taking regarding buying water achieved as a result of efficiencies. My question is: has the government, as part of that exercise, done any estimates about water likely to be recovered through that process? Obviously that is germane to how we are going in relation to the target MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Appropriation Bill No 1 2006 2007
232,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (6.11 Pm),"I thank the parliamentary secretary and theof 500 gigalitres by 2009. I would be interested to know whether the parliamentary secretary is able to provide any information about what kinds of dividends might be achieved as a result of going down the path that he proposes. In the absence of colleagues I will take the opportunity to raise with the minister an additional issue concerning the Australian Public Service Commission. The Australian Public Service Commission is referred to at page 312 of the budget papers. One of the issues that has come to my attention recently is that the Public Service Commission has issued a new circular which relates to the citizenship requirements for Commonwealth public servants. Two sentences which previously made clear that the employment of noncitizens could only be done in exceptional circumstances have been deleted from that circular. One of the sentences is: Preferably, this would only occur on the basis that the person is actively pursuing the acquisition of Australian citizenship. The other sentence which has been deleted is: ... it is expected that a decision to engage a non-citizen would only occur for sound reasons and not as a matter of course. This is clearly a watering down of the requirement for citizenship of employees in the Australian Public Service. My question, having regard to this circular, is: how many noncitizens are presently employed in the Australian Public Service and does the government have any view on or any figure of how many are likely to be employed as a result of the change in guidelines outlined in the circular? pm)-I gather that the honourable member wanted to know if we had an estimate of the amount of water likely to be recovered under the new tender arrangements I just mentioned. The answer is we do not. It is a tender. Tender is a price discovery process. We are not advertising the price which we are prepared to pay, nor are we stipulating the amount of water that we would seek to recover. Plainly, and I have said this publicly in many places, we would not be seeking to acquire more than 200 gigalitres because that is probably about all that we are short as far as we can currently see. But I do not think we are likely to have water in those volumes being tendered in any event. So we do not have an estimate. It will be an informative exercise and we may not acquire any water. I think it is likely that we will acquire some. We are looking at every way in which we can acquire water for the Living Murray Initiative. But our aim is to, as far as we can, always acquire water in a way that ensures that the amount of water available for productive use in agriculture in the southern Murray-Darling Basin is unaffected. In other words, our aim is for a win-win situation where the water that is recovered for the environment is effectively water that was not being productively used. ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (6.16 pm)-I will take a leaf out of the Prime Minister’s book. If the member wants to communicate to me the circular from which he is quoting, I will be happy to have it looked at. I will not take it at face value, even in these in-detail discussions about the expenditure of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

It was one of the things that you could apply for as a citizen. I would be very surprised if there was a watering down of that circumstance.

Treasury Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $3,509,487,000 the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which comes under the Treasury portfolio, and remarks I made in the House before about ABS surveys. I think there might be some media interest in this tonight, not relating to matters I have raised but generally. I wonder if I could ask the parliamentary secretary whether he is aware of the number of surveys the ABS conducts in which participation is compulsory and in which Australian citizens are told they will be fined significant amounts of money if they do not participate. I refer in particular to the Time Use Survey, which people in my electorate have been required to participate in. It is a very onerous survey. They are required to fill in and justify every five minutes of their day for 48 hours. An example is given of a typical ABS return: ‘6.20, toilet; 6.25, had a shower; 6.35, got dressed; 6.40, put on a load of washing; 6.45, made breakfast.’ People are told to fill this out and that if they do not they will be fined, I think, $200. I wonder if the parliamentary secretary could respond as to whether the government is aware of the ABS doing this and whether they endorse this approach. that the ABS do these sorts of surveys. I think they have been doing them for 100 years. I think the Australian Bureau of Statistics do a wonderful job. The government has supported the ABS with increased funding for several years and will continue to do that. say that I found the parliamentary secretary’s response a little disappointing. I recognise that these surveys have been going on for a very long time, and I recognise that they have happened under governments of both persuasions. It is very different from the census. With the census, there is a general level of public understanding and public acceptance that it is an important activity to participate in. There is a general understanding that it is an obligation of citizenship to participate in it. But I do not think it is appropriate for people in my electorate or any other to have somebody knocking on the door and saying, ‘You will account for every five minutes of your day and if you don’t, you will be fined.’ I do not expect the parliamentary secretary to automatically be across these issues, but I wonder if he would be good enough to undertake to investigate and report back as to whether the government does feel this particular survey, amongst others, is appropriate and whether there might be some action taken to remind the ABS that getting people to account for every five minutes of their day for 48 hours is not something which happens in a democracy like Australia. to do that.

238,Mr Pearce (Aston,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (6.20 pm)-I am happycolleagues, but I make the observation that before coming into parliament I ran an industry and tourism regional development board. At times, we had various surveys go to motels, caravan parks and the like. There was a similar reluctance to answer them. They were not about what the manager did in a day but what the various denominators were of price, occupancy and so on. I chastised a number of my members at the time by saying, ‘If you want to have a basis on which to go to government for grants and subsidies and the like, you’ve got to have accurate information coming out of the regions.’ I think most of them saw the logic of it. With a thing like this, you do not know where it might impact. It might impact on child care or any number of other things when this information is fed into the computers. I would be interested to know, Parliamentary Secretary: if someone were to write ‘varies day by day’ on a part that they felt was an intrusion on their privacy or, quite frankly, onerous to complete, would that offend the form? I suspect it would not, and that they would just answer the things that they thought were reasonable in the circumstances. When you provide the answer, I would be interested to know whether there is that sort of latitude within the guidelines. Ms HALL (Shortland) (6.22 pm)-My question also relates to ABS surveys. Is the parliamentary secretary aware that with the ABS survey that looks at work and return to work activities, people over the age of 80 are being randomly selected and required to complete the survey as to whether or not they are looking for work and work activities that they have undertaken in the past month? Has the minister or the government given any thought to providing an exemption to people who are over 80 years of age and find it most distressful that they are forced to either have somebody come into their home or answer the survey over the phone? They feel very intimidated by it, and they cannot see the relevance of this survey to them. I have spoken to the ABS myself and was unable to organise an exemption for a person who was over the age of 80. I was able to organise for that person to answer the questionnaire over the telephone. Alternatively, the ABS were prepared to allow one of the person’s family members to complete the questionnaire on their behalf. I would be most grateful if the parliamentary secretary would make some inquiries and look at taking some action to alleviate this system. It really does seem quite ridiculous when 80-plus-year-old women are being forced to complete this survey and we are unable to organise an exemption for them. member for Shortland for her question. I am very happy to do that; I will have a look at that and come back to you. But I want to make the point-following on from my very distinguished colleague, the member for Hinkler-that it is important for people to understand that the work that the ABS does is critically important to how we move forward in this country. Government decisions at all levels-not just at Commonwealth level but at state and territory levels-use ABS data for almost all their appropriations and a lot of their decisions. Local government rely on ABS statistics. Industry itself relies on ABS statistics to inform it about how it may lobby governments. It is critically important. I think they do a marvellous job.

I might know the answer to this question myself-I think the answer to the question may be the extent to which mining companies, in particular, have been investing happily in new capacity and therefore bringing forward newer and larger deductions-but it is of concern to the opposition that the budget forecast seemed to be largely underpinned by the concept that receipts from company taxes are growing faster than company profits are. I want to put a few questions to the parliamentary secretary. The first is: does he accept that, based on the budget, company tax is growing faster than company profits? From an independent observer’s view, having company taxes increase more rapidly than company profits seems unsustainable. On what basis does the Treasury believe this can be sustained over the forward estimates period? Is it assumed that the average company tax rate will fall again over the forward estimates? The effective company tax rate must be rising if company profits are growing slower than the company tax. For current trends to be sustained, is there not effectively an assumption that the effective company rate is increasing and has been, in recent years, approaching the company tax rate itself? Is this the assumption Treasury is using and, if so, on what basis? And is Treasury assuming that the level of deductibility is very low for the additional component on company taxable income that is a basis of the above trend? member for Hunter for his very long and complex question. I would like to answer it in two parts: firstly, by saying that I will take the questions on board and come back with the information; and, secondly, by saying that he can rest assured that our projections are very reliable, as they have been for the last decade. of public debate in recent times has been on child care-or, more to the point, the unavailability of child care-and, of course, the affordability of child care. I ask the parliamentary secretary what work the government have done on the various options for delivering greater childcare services in this country. Have they, for example, done any work on costing extending the FBT arrangements to small businesses or organisations which do not provide child care inhouse? Have the government done any costing on the possibility of allowing taxpayers to claim child care as a tax deductible expense? member for Hunter for his questions. I will take them on notice. answer. I would like to move to another subject-the changes the government is proposing with respect to superannuation in this country. I know that at this stage it is only a proposal and the information in the budget is only very limited, but various costings have been bandied around with respect to the various initiatives the government has taken in the budget, and I was wondering whether the parliamentary secretary could give the parliament some idea of the basis for those costings. There has been talk of the expense of those proposals blowing out to a considerable percentage of GDP, and I was wondering whether the parliamentary secretary could further enlighten us on the basis of the costings and where the major cost is going to be imposed.

Of course, it is a very important underpinning of our structural economy, particularly as it relates to some of the demographics that we are experiencing, like the ageing of the population. It is very important that wherever we can we incentivise people to save for their retirement. There have been a lot of calls, including calls from all quarters of the community, to simplify superannuation tax, and so we have done that. We have cut through all of that by simply saying that where your funds are in a taxed fund, whether or not you take that as a lump sum or as an allocated pension, there will be no tax at all. This is a very positive initiative. We have embarked upon a consultation period, as the member for Hunter identified, and the government are now going through and will be looking at those submissions, and we will be putting out our position in terms of legislative proposals going forward. liamentary secretary for his insightful answer. CanI move on to what is known as the entrepreneur’s tax offset. This is, of course, a tax rebate given to certain small businesses, particularly those with revenues of less than $50,000 a year, phasing right out I think at $75,000 a year. I could stand corrected, but I believe the cost of that initiative is somewhat in excess of what was originally proposed when it first appeared in the 2005-06 budget. I ask the parliamentary secretary whether he can provide information about where exactly that money is going, maybe giving us a breakdown of the various businesses receiving the benefit of that tax offset and whether he can clarify why the cost of that offset has so significantly blown out. happy to provide the member for Hunter with some of the information he has asked for.

That is something that I will have a look at, but in terms of providing him the information, I would be happy to do that. some questions about the Trade Practices Act, which of course comes under his direct area of responsibility. It is well known and well documented in this country that there is significant concern about the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act and, of course, there are allocations in the budget to the ACCC for the administration of the Trade Practices Act. Those concerns are very well founded. They go to the impact of cases commonly known as Boral and Rural Press and Metway. In particular, many are concerned that it is very difficult these days for the ACCC to establish in a court of law that a company does have the degree of market power necessary to be in breach because of any action under the Trade Practices Act. There is concern also, of course, that the concept of ‘take advantage’ is now a very questionable concept in the eyes of the courts, and these things need clarification. There is also a need for clarification in the area of what we commonly know as predatory pricing, and that is, of course, the MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Appropriation Bill No 1 2006 2007

There has been a very big expectation for a number of years now amongst the smaller and independent sector that the government would address these changes. Certainly there have been two significant reports-the Dawson report and I think a unanimous report of the Senate Economics References Committee which recommended a number of changes to section 46. Indeed, the opposition has been stepping up the ante in recent times because we are very concerned that the repeal of the retail marketing sites act should not be undertaken in the absence of significant reforms to section 46. I was hoping the parliamentary secretary could provide advice on where the government is on section 46. Can we expect to see some proposals coming forward from the government in the not-too-distant future and, if so, how wide-ranging will they be and will they cover what I call the two-threshold test-that is, a clarification of the parliamentary intention on the definitions of market power and of the concept of ‘take advantage’? ber for Hunter is alluding to several cases where certain things have been happening or they have not been happening then, firstly, if he is aware of any of those sorts of cases I hope that he is referring those directly to the ACCC for investigation; I am sure he is. Secondly, to answer his question, the government is always reviewing its legislation in order to ensure that it has the right and appropriate legislation in place. which I have done on a not irregular basis. But the point I make again is that there is a widely held view in the community-and we have plenty of legal opinion and, indeed, an all-party Senate committee to back that view-that the Trade Practices Act is now not sufficient to deal with these cases. The ACCC can take the cases all they like but they cannot get an outcome because of the deficiencies in the Trade Practices Act. That is the issue the government has to fix-not the opposition. But can I take the parliamentary secretary to another issue, and that goes to revenue from fuel taxes. We heard some debate in the House today about various views on the extent to which the government is taking GST revenue compared with the extent to which excise has fallen as a result of the 7c reduction in excise in 2000 and the subsequent freezing of the excise component. The Treasurer bandied some figures around in question time today. Is the parliamentary secretary prepared to table-if not now, at some future time-further detail on the submission that the Treasurer was making in the House? clarification-did the Treasurer table it? I thought you mentionedspeaking, $10 billion raised in GST from fuel taxes since the changes and about $11 billion forgone in excise because of the changes there. It was very short on detail.

I cannot recall the Prime Minister making a statement to the House to that effect, although public statements have certainly been made. SoI was wondering if I could give the minister the opportunity this evening to explain to the chamber the government’s rationale for not proceeding with the sale of the Snowy Hydro. Prospect to the press conference that the Prime Minister and I gave on the Friday morning a couple of weeks ago, whatever date that was, with the detail of the government’s announcement. The federal government, as the member for Prospect may or may not be aware, had a 13 per cent stake in Snowy Hydro. The federal government was not in a position to privatise Snowy Hydro; the only government that was in a position to privatise Snowy Hydro was the New South Wales government. In fact, it was the New South Wales government that made an announcement in December all on its own, without any reference to the federal government or MAIN COMMITTEE",188,Appropriation Bill No 1 2006 2007

260,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro-Special Minister of State) (6.41 pm)-I refer the member for the Victorian government, that it would sell its 58 per cent shareholding and privatise Snowy Hydro. Consequently, a month or two later, the Australian government and the Victorian government agreed that they would sell their shareholdings. I emphasise that the original announcement by the New South Wales government was not conditional upon the sale of the Commonwealth’s 13 per cent and the Victorian government’s 29 per cent; it was a unilateral decision. As a shareholder of only 13 per cent, the Australian government was not running this privatisation. After listening to the Australian electorate, in a very broad sense, the Australian government came to a decision that we would not proceed with the sale of our 13 per cent. So the only decision that the Australian government made was not to sell that 13 per cent. There was no reason for us to assume that New South Wales would do anything other than continue with selling their 58 per cent, given that they had made the announcement unilaterally in the first place and it was not conditional on the sale of other governments’ shareholdings. Strangely, an hour or so before the Australian government’s decision was announced, the New South Wales Premier made a very forceful case on radio that his government would proceed with their majority shareholding; however, within about 15 minutes of the Prime Minister’s announcement, the Premier had changed his mind. People can make what they like of that. I think he said ‘pulling the rug out’ from under the sale about 20 times in the space of a couple of minutes, which was also a perplexing statement, given that the New South Wales government had made the original decision on their own. But this discussion happening in the chamber is with respect to the appropriations bills, which is what I thought we were here for, and I can inform the chamber that there was $13.7 million provided for in 2006-07 to meet the external costs associated with the Australian government’s sale of its 13 per cent shareholding in Snowy Hydro Ltd. With that decision not to proceed with the sale, Finance will return the unspent funds to the budget. ranging questions on matters that appear in the budget papers. I note that the Special Minister of State stated that a very significant factor in the government’s decision was public opposition to the sale of Snowy Hydro and, as he indicated, this was said by both him and the Prime Minister at their press conference. I wonder if the minister could indicate whether the government will be paying as much cognisance to public opposition when it comes to considering and putting through legislation for the sale of Medibank Private and whether they will be reconsidering their decision to privatise all of Telstra, given the massive public opposition to both those sales, which are equal to if not greater than the public opposition across the country to the sale of the Snowy Hydro Scheme. not be changing their position on the further privatisation of Telstra, and we have made announcements in relation to Medibank Private. There are very different circumstances between the three assets-Telstra, Medibank Private and Snowy Hydro-and I think that has been debated quite substantially in the public arena. attention been drawn to comments by Mr Ivor Ries of EL Ballieu, stockbrokers, on Radio National on 2 June, when he referred to the aborted sale of Snowy Hydro?

You know, because the Government can flip-flop around on policy on a day-to-day basis it’ll significantly decrease foreign investor confidence in Government policy here. SoI guess it’s devalued Telstra. Can the minister inform the House whether the Department of Finance and Administration has prepared any projections or estimations as to whether the revenue from the sale of Telstra has been adversely affected by the decision to abort the sale of Snowy Hydro? comments of that one stockbroker on that one radio program. Unfortunately, I do not have the luxury of being able to sit around listening to a lot of Radio National programs. I emphasise that it is obviously the view of one stockbroker. If you ask the opinion of half-a-dozen lawyers, economists or stockbrokers on something, you might get eight or nine different views. That is probably the case in this situation as well. I am not aware of anything being done by the department along the lines mentioned by the member for Prospect, but if there is any further information that I can provide, I will. that he will take that on notice and get back to us if any such projections exist. I turn now to a different matter-that is, the matter of the government members secretariat. I have a series of questions about this and the allocation by the Department of Finance and Administration for it. Firstly, could the minister inform the House of the reasoning for the government members secretariat being located in the office of the Chief Government Whip instead of where it used to be in the ministerial office? that those matters were decisions of the Prime Minister. indicate to the House the reasoning for it being located in the Chief Government Whip’s office? Isn’t he in a position to confirm or deny that it is because the Chief Government Whip is not subject to FOI? that the functions of the government members secretariat fall within the responsibility of the Chief Government Whip, and those administrative arrangements are matters that the Prime Minister determined at the time. form us now, or if not to report back to the House, on the location issues of the government members’ secretariat in sitting weeks and non-sitting weeks and, in particular, whether the department of finance encourages or allows staff members of the government secretariat to work out of government members’ electorate offices in other states in non-sitting weeks and help them in the preparation of public materials, newsletters and such from their electorate offices as opposed to their Parliament House location. involving the day-to-day management of the government members’ secretariat falls under the responsibility of the Chief Government Whip. But if there is any other information that I am able to provide, then I will do so. MAIN COMMITTEE",190,Appropriation Bill No 1 2006 2007

270,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro-Special Minister of State) (6.50 pm)-As I said, the functionknowledge that it does fall under the Chief Government Whip. However, it is an allocation from the department of finance, and I am sure the department of finance would be aware of the location issues of the government members’ secretariat and, given the government’s commitment to public accountability and transparency, I am sure there would be no problem in reporting back to the House. I would like to now move on to the matter of media monitoring. In 2004-05 the bill for media monitoring in ministers’ offices and departments was over $8 million. It is of some considerable concern to me that a lot of these media monitoring costs will be ministers’ offices and departments ordering exactly the same clips or asking to see exactly the same shots of the news. Does the department of finance, as the department responsible for minimising unnecessary government expenditure, have a protocol or a requirement to ensure that unnecessary duplication of media monitoring does not occur? will inquire as to whether there is any particular information I can give in that regard. I would assume that individual departments would work with their relevant minister in relation to media monitoring for the individual departments and ministries and that they would be responsible for the costs and budget allocations et cetera within each individual department. I doubt that it is something that is done right across all ministries but, if there is further information that I can provide, I will. another matter. On 13 June the Australian National Audit Office released a report entitled Internet Security in Australian Government Agencies. Again, the Department of Finance and Public Administration will hopefully play a key role in implementing the recommendations of that report. Is the minister aware of the report and is he aware of what happened to a very similar report which the ANAO released in 2001 which made essentially the same sort of recommendations five years ago that we have seen from the report this week? What steps did the department take to implement the 2001 report, which the ANAO finds largely were not implemented, and what steps will the department take to ensure that the 2006 report is actually implemented so that we cannot expect to see another report in 2011 making the same recommendations that they did 10 years previously? port and have some responsibility in this process because the Australian Government Information Management Office, AGIMO, falls within my direct responsibility as Special Minister of State. SoI am well aware of the report and I could say that some of the findings of that report are a bit disappointing given the recommendations from a few years ago. The whole internet security area is very much a changing area. We know how technology is changing dramatically, almost weekly, and that raises some fairly substantial challenges in esecurity areas. The member for Prospect can be assured that we will be taking up their recommendations. In fact we have already started to work on that. I think the government and the department are much better placed now than they were a few years ago to deal with these matters. AGIMO is already working on these recommendations. The member can be assured that they will be implemented. MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Appropriation Bill No 1 2006 2007

274,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro-Special Minister of State) (6.54 pm)-I am aware of the reernment advertising and the indication in estimates that $250 million has been allocated for government advertising in the financial year 2006-07, a substantial increase from financial year 2005-06. Can the minister indicate whether the government has any forward projections as to the timing of this advertising, particularly in relation to the latter half of 2007? Is it expected that advertising will increase over 2007 and perhaps peak somewhere around October 2007? this is probably a question that should have been asked as part of Prime Minister and Cabinet. I do chair the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications but that falls within the responsibility of Prime Minister and Cabinet. No, I cannot provide the information that he has asked for now and I do not know whether I can. He referred to a particular figure out of Senate estimates. My recollection is that there were some figures thrown around by senators in Senate estimates. I am not sure whether anybody was able to determine where those figures came from. I suspect that they were figures grasped out of the air by opposition senators during that estimates process. Individual departments make decisions about their particular campaigns that they are running, whether it be issues related to health, skin cancer and those sorts of campaigns, which they are doing at any particular time. But the timing is individual within the departments. For instance, people would be aware of the advertisements running at the moment for Welfare to Work. Those were obviously timed quite appropriately to inform people about the changes in legislation that come into effect on 1 July. You do not start doing that six months before, but by the same token you do not start doing it on the day that the changes take place. So that was appropriately timed for very proper reasons-so that people understood that there was a change coming up in legislation and that it would come into effect on 1 July. The timing for each of those particular advertising campaigns is very much a matter for the individual departments. The Minister for Human Services has joined us. He was one of the ministers responsible for that Welfare to Work campaign, to make sure that people are well aware of the legislative changes. So, to further answer the member’s question, individual departments and the particular information they need to provide and the timing of it will be determined by them and not by government in any sort of total sense. The Ministerial Committee on Government Communications responds to individual departments’ requirements for providing that information. Minister for Human Services has arrived. I am sure we do not want to keep him waiting, but I would like to deal with one last matter before we move on. I wish to acknowledge that I am not sure who actually has responsibility for this, but I am interested in the staffing arrangements for parliamentary secretaries. In particular, I am interested in who approves the staffing arrangements for parliamentary secretaries-whether it is the Special Minister of State, the Minister for Finance and Administration or some other minister. To assist the minister, I am particularly interested in the staffing allocation for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and why the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs receives more staff than some government ministers and more staff than anybody on the opposition side other than the Leader of the OpposiMAIN COMMITTEE",192,Appropriation Bill No 1 2006 2007

What process did the parliamentary secretary have to go through to justify his very significant level of staffing, to whom did he have to justify that-whether it was the minister at the table or some other minister-and what was the justification? the member for Prospect to the Hansard of Senate estimates, because I think the member for Prospect is simply trawling over the same things that were trawled through in Senate estimates. I make the point that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has a substantial responsibility and is certainly very different from other parliamentary secretaries in that respect. Ultimately, staff allocations to ministers and to parliamentary secretaries lie with the Prime Minister. going on finance. and Administration guidelines on procurement, specifically as they relate to small business. The department of finance guidelines require all government agencies to pay small businesses their bills within 30 days of receiving a proper invoice and, of course, the goods. The department of finance, as I understand it from answers to me, does not keep those records for itself and certainly does not appear to enforce the keeping of the records or the compliance of other government departments with the policy. I do not expect the minister to be able to answer this immediately, but could he undertake with the department of finance to review the operation of the procurement guidelines and ensure that not only his own department complies with its own guidelines but other government departments comply with them as well? some additional information on procurement. I encourage the member for Prospect to look at the e-procurement guidelines that I announced and the department released just recently so that he can see what we are doing from a procurement point of view to give some guidance to various departments in the way in which they do procurement electronically. With respect to the other matters you raised, I am happy to follow them up. WhatI will find is that this level of government is a hell of a lot better at paying its bills than certain other levels of government. In particular, a state health department was holding out on some of my small business people for 90 days and more. It is just appalling that a state health department would not pay its bills for 90 days or more. We will not be taking any guidelines from state departments, that’s for sure, if we review or do anything at a federal level with respect to paying small businesses.

284,Mr Bowen (Prospect) (7.04 Pm),"I have some questions for the Minister for Humancrash into each other as he was talking and I was listening! I note that the report in the Australian today leads with: A crack team of investigators will spy on divorced dads who cry poor to avoid paying child support ... This is the reporting of it. I want to ask the minister to clarify whether it is also the case that the investigators will look at the finances and the situation of recipients of child support who may be underestimating their own income, not just at the payers or nonpayers. Is it or is it not the case that people who have claimed a certain income and claimed payment from the other party based on that income will also have their situation examined by these investigators? of the cost of raising a child under the existing formula is based on the payer’s income. If there is a default, the default lies with the payer, not the payee. That is because it is the payer who is not meeting their legal obligations, which are based on their income. Of course, from 1 July 2008, the formula will change. This is the fundamental principle. Currently, the formula is based on the payer’s income. From1 July 2008, the formula will be based on the cost of raising the children. This is a substantial change which should address many of the complaints. If people are defrauding the system in relation to a payee’s income, we are happy to look at that, but my understanding is that the formula is based on the payer’s income, the noncustodial parent’s income, and that is the income that we are going to be looking at. minister’s announcement today. Any of us, as members of parliament, would have custodial parents coming through our electorate offices with stories of not being able to receive payments from the non-custodial parent, and I am sure that we have all heard the stories of noncustodial parents pretending to have no income and, frankly, dodging their payments. SoI do think the Minister for Human Services has made a step in the right direction. I wonder if the minister could indicate how many staff in the Child Support Agency are currently dedicated to investigating non-custodial parents who are avoiding their legal obligations and avoiding the payment of child support. I know that the majority of investigations at the moment are deskbound, rather than the staff going out and doing proactive investigations, but I am just interested to know what sort of an increase this is and how big a change this is going to make in tracking down non-paying non-custodial parents. for clarification that I am reminded of the fact that a custodial parent’s income comes into the formula when it hits about $40,000, I think it is. So-in order to provide clarity-we still are not looking at that particular area, because it is not deemed to be the high-risk area at this stage. However, of course there will be another look at the application of the current formula once a custodial parent’s income exceeds $40,000. In relation to the other matter, I would need to get advice. I am happy to provide an answer to the member for Prospect on the current number of CSA staff that focus on enforcement. I will add that we estimate that this year 40,000 non-custodial parents claimed to have no income and receive no welfare. They are the low-hanging fruit, if you like, that represent the people that will be targeted. I estimated on radio today that 90 to 95 per cent of those people were male. In fact, it is 88 or 89 per cent. Overwhelmingly, they are male-although not all are-thus the phrase ‘deadbeat dads’.

287,Mr Hockey (North Sydney,"Minister for Human Services) (7.08 pm)-I should adders and, of the 690,000 payers, the high-risk ones represent between 40,000 and 70,000. The number referred to the Australian Taxation Office this coming year because they have failed to lodge tax returns might get up to about 100,000. That automatically raises a question about whether they are telling the truth about their income. There is no joy in this for the government. I want to emphasise that. I get no great joy out of chasing people to pay their debts to their children. But it is a debt to their children. It is their flesh and blood, and they have an obligation to contribute to the cost of raising their own flesh and blood-their own children. There is nothing nice, successful or enjoyable about the breakdown of a relationship. The entire focus of what we do is on the welfare of the children. That is the clear intention of the child support act. That is the motivation for the activity of the Child Support Agency. It is a very tough issue. But, every time we undertake surveillance and every time we undertake court action, we do it on behalf of the children. We do not do it on behalf of an angry mother. We do not do it on behalf of an angry father. We do it on behalf of the children. That is our clear focus. My advice is that this is the first time we have gone down a path of surveillance. It has been sporadic if it has been undertaken in the past, and this is the first time we have allocated significant resources. We have allocated $143 million over four years to better compliance. It is part of the Parkinson package. There will be arguments from both men and women that the new Parkinson formula either advantages them or disadvantages them. It seems as though this parliament can never get the formula exactly right, because of the over 800,000 cases that the CSA has. Every single case is different. There is different income to the household; there are different relationships, as a mother or a father might be repartnered; there are different custodial arrangements; there are different locations in Australia; and there are different pressure points on the financial arrangements. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to frame a formula that is going to satisfy everyone. It is very difficult. Inevitably, whenever the relationship breaks down, there are incredible emotions involved. Again, I want to emphasise that what we are doing is targeting those people who are clearly trying to hide their income. There are people out there who try and do it, mainly through so called self-employment. There are others who choose-I think rather unwisely-to park assets in the name of a new partner, which is courageous behaviour for individuals. If they are using legal structures to try and disguise assets then we will try to find out whether those legal avenues are in fact robust enough to withstand the scrutiny of the courts. We are also introducing a number of other measures, including a significant increase in the number of people who are stopped at airports from leaving the country if they have a debt to the Child Support Agency. I think that is a very powerful tool. We also have a very powerful tool in our referral of cases to the ATO for further investigation. timated that there are currently approximately 105,000 people who are using self-employment and cash income to understate their income. It is also estimated that an additional 1,800 parents a year will face scrutiny under the minister’s announcement. I am not sure whether that includes the 300 who do at the moment or if it is on top of that number. Regardless, on my calculations, that is a little over one per cent of the people who it is alleged are or who are thought to be understating their income. Could the minister inform the House in general terms what process will be used to determine which of the 105,000 people will face this scrutiny? MAIN COMMITTEE",195,Appropriation Bill No 1 2006 2007
288,Mr Bowen (Prospect) (7.14 Pm),"Minister, if I am reading the figures correctly, it is esWill it be based on complaints from their former partner? Will there be a formula which the CSA will develop to identify those most likely to be identifiable as rorting their payments? Clearly, with 105,000 potential candidates for surveillance and only 1,800 who will be subject to it, there is a large degree of room to move in determining who receives the attention. lance initiative is the one which has attracted the most media attention, not surprisingly. We hope that there will be greater focus on other areas, such as greater collection of information by existing enforcement officers and the fact that we have the power, which I referred to a little bit earlier, in relation to stopping people at airports. I would rather not give the member for Prospect a box and dice description of how we target people for defrauding the system, but it is fair to say there are certain indicators that will become immediately apparent. Data matching plays a significant role in that. Data matching between CSA and Centrelink and between CSA and the tax office provide a significant basis upon which investigations can be undertaken. To give an example, it is highly likely that a non-custodial parent paying only $5 a week to support all of their children-not one child, but all of their children-will be on Newstart. Therefore, if it is reported that they have a lavish lifestyle: perhaps they are driving a Porsche and living in Sandy Bay, Toorak or Mosmanfrom this scrutiny, I can assure you. If they are living a very lavish lifestyle, claiming Centrelink payments and paying only $5 a week to support their children then obviously a flag would be waved that would cause us to undertake further investigations. There will be processes put in place that will reflect current practice to some degree but will also represent new activities. new investigators. The minister has told me before in answers to questions on notice in relation to Centrelink that Centrelink surveillance is primarily contracted out. There are a range of private investigation firms that are used for that purpose. I do not have a problem with that at all, but if I read this announcement correctly-and I have only read the media reports; I am not on the minister’s email list for his press release, if there was one issuedMr Hockey interjectingsurveillance officers will be employed in house rather than be contracted out. That would seem to involve a significant degree of skill, training and equipment. I wonder whether the department or Centrelink has engaged in a cost-benefit analysis of conducting this sort of surveillance in house or of contracting it out to private investigation firms. my head, I could not give an answer to that. Logic suggests that it should be contracted out; it probably will be. I have no desire to set up a government surveillance team or to train people in surveillance. Public servants have other skills and I do not think they are the sorts of skills that we should particularly develop, but I have not gone to that level of detail. ple from going overseas, which again is a welcome initiative.

This matter is of some particular concern in my electorate, where there is a high degree of people from a non-English speaking background. When a relationship or a marriage breaks down, it is not unusual for one parent to return overseas and the children usually remain in Australia-and these issues do arise from time to time. I am interested in knowing how big a problem this is and whether the new initiative announced by the minister will in any way deal with that. Obviously, there are difficulties in conducting surveillance overseas, but does he have any strategies, either in this announcement or separately, to deal with the matter of overseas non-payers; and, if he does, what might they be? detailed question. I stand to be corrected, but I understand that each year 1,800 people with a debt to the Child Support Agency are prevented from leaving the country. We expect that number to increase quite significantly as a result of this new initiative. Do not hold me to the exact figure of 1,800, but it is about that number. As for language barriers, I am sure they would be addressed. Stopping someone from leaving the country is not an easy process, as I am sure the member would be aware, but it is done as a matter of last resort. Obviously, with this new initiative we will expand that program. smartcard. My first question to the minister is whether the cost estimate of $1.1 billion projected to 2010 is still accurate in his mind. reason to change that estimate. could share with the House, in some reasonably but not overly detailed way, how the government projects that the $1.1 billion will be recovered. As I understand it, the government’s position is that the smartcard will be cost neutral and, therefore, that $1.1 billion will be saved through other mechanisms. I wonder whether the minister could share with us exactly how that $1.1 billion is expected to be saved through the operation of the smartcard. weeks I released a summary of the KPMG business case. KPMG estimates that, over 10 years, the savings will be up to $3 billion. The starting point is fraud and overwhelmingly that $3 billion will be in the area of fraud. We do suffer the difficulty that people do attempt to use-obviously sometimes successfully-a number of created identities in order to claim benefits, particularly from Centrelink. We have a challenge based on advice that I have received that the current health care cards and pensioner concession cards are not robust and are very susceptible to fraud. The information I received, for example, is that 80 per cent of the PBS is claimed by people with concession cards and that 25 per cent of all concession cards are cancelled prior to the expiry date on the card. That, in itself, represents a concern that people might be using concession cards even though for various reasons they are no longer entitled to the concession. That is one reason why the access card will replace 17 cards and vouchers, and a number of those cards are conMAIN COMMITTEE",197,Appropriation Bill No 1 2006 2007

300,Mr Hockey (North Sydney,"Minister for Human Services) (7.24 pm)-In the last twocession cards. Currently, the government has no way of immediately and remotely cancelling a concession entitlement when it is claimed by an individual presenting an existing card. I have seen various estimates from a range of sources claiming that the biggest beneficiaries of this will be the states, because they are the ones that give significant concession to individuals on public transport and assistance with rent, electricity, water and in a range of other areas. They base most of that concession entitlement on the Commonwealth cards, and yet they face the same challenge that we do-that is, that those cards are not robust and secure and we do not have the capacity to cancel the entitlement. Let me give you an example. A single parent might be on a single parent’s pension and receive a pensioner concession card. Then, for one reason or another, their assets have increased or their circumstances have changed such that they are no longer entitled to that card. Whilst we can cancel the entitlement from our end, it could be the case that they continue to present the card to get discounts for everything from the PBS to movie tickets. We just do not know. KPMG provided the estimate of up to $3 billion. That is the financial benefit of the card, but it is the convenience benefit that will be most significant for individuals. The fact is, for example, that 600,000 people, according to KPMG, are turned away from Centrelink every year because they bring insufficient proof of identity information when they roll up to Centrelink. I know that Medicare send out 50,000 letters a year to people who have incorrectly filled out their name and address on a Medicare claim form. That, to me, is the icing on the cake. In fact, it is more than that; it is the carrot on the carrot cake. It represents a convenience to individuals that people have been yearning for but have been unable to obtain. I see that as the real and significant benefit of the access card. me in the $3 billion savings is how they are specifically related to the smartcard. Is there not double-counting between the savings that are projected from the smartcard and other general antifraud and compliance measures? I wonder whether the minister can confirm that the $3 billion over 10 years is specifically and directly related to the introduction of the smartcard. help here. Understand that Human Services will deliver $1,000 billion in payments over the next 10 years. Currently we deliver around $92 billion. This year alone our detected fraud will be at around $2 billion. We prosecute around 10 people per day for trying to defraud the health and welfare system. So when KPMG advises us that it is up to $3 billion I personally believe that that is a very conservative figure. I think it will be far greater than that. If we accept the $3 billion figure, that $3 billion represents 0.3 per cent of the money we will distribute over the next 10 years. International benchmarks suggest that fraud is averaging around four to six per cent in health and welfare services. I saw a report I think from Deloittes earlier on that suggested that fraud internationally is around that figure. We are taking very conservative approaches to all these figures. So 0.3 per cent as a saving in relation to the access card I think is quite a conservative figure. report on the smartcard.

But when he released the report not only were certain sections marked ‘commercial-in-confidence’ others were marked ‘cabinet-in-confidence’. I know the minister will not want to go into detail, because if he did he would not have marked it ‘cabinet-in-confidence’, but I wonder whether he could inform the House in a general way why certain parts were marked ‘cabinet-in-confidence’, which is not what the opposition was expecting and certainly not I think what the public would expect for a publicly funded report. a cabinet document. only certain sections were marked ‘cabinet-in-confidence’. Clearly there is a reason why some was released and some was not. for Prospect should be happy that he received some information from a cabinet-in-confidence document. lapsed into Howard government arrogance just then. He has been cooperative, he has been transparent but now the Howard government arrogance pops in: ‘You are lucky you are getting any. The taxpayer has paid for it, but be lucky you are getting any. Be grateful that we are telling you anything. Be grateful that we are telling you just a little bit about what is in this KPMG report.’ Given that he says we are lucky to receive any of the KPMG report, can I ask him when we might be receiving the Clayton Utz privacy impact statement? that the KPMG report-I sigh because this has been going on for a while and it is becoming a little predictable, but we are moving on-was part of the advice the government received together with departmental advice and a range of sources of advice in relation to the decision to move forward. Given the level of expenditure involved, I thought it appropriate to release the basic information out of the business case from KPMG, as you correctly identified. There was information there that is sensitive to the tender process. It is a very significant IT tender process, and I do not think we should be giving any of the tenderers a free kick. In relation to the privacy impact assessment, as I have said, the advice received from Clayton Utz and others was essentially made redundant because the nature of the project changed according to the decision of cabinet. For example, there was a robust public debate about an ID card, and cabinet rejected the proposal for a national ID card. As the Prime Minister said in the press conference the day after ANZAC Day, when we announced the proposal to proceed with the card, we took the view that Australia does not want or need a national identity card. This a very different proposition from a national ID card. Anyone who is familiar with national ID cards around the world would accept that. There was a range of different sources of information-including, I might add, the Privacy Commissioner, who obviously has far more experience and was well across the brief. She helped us to address some of the privacy issues. I might say that the end product, the access card, will have less information in the chip than sits in your wallet today. It will not have as much on it as a drivers licence. Let me give you a real example. My New South Wales drivers MAIN COMMITTEE",199,Appropriation Bill No 1 2006 2007

I know it is going to be difficult for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to grasp the details of this, but there is actually strong demand in the community for this initiative. If she asks why we are going down the route of smart card technology, perhaps she could ask her state Labor counterparts, all of whom are proceeding with smart card technology-some not so spectacularly, I might add, because they are promising projects that are far greater than are actually deliverable. The fact is that the Queensland government is rolling out a smart card drivers licence in 2008.

On the one hand he says that it is redundant; on the other hand he says that there is commercial-in-confidence information in there which we cannot possibly share. Either it is redundant or it is not. If it is redundant, what is the harm in releasing it? If there is commercial-in-confidence information in there, I would submit, with respect, that he could do the same thing he did with the KPMG report: mark certain parts as commercial-in-confidence and release those parts which are not commercial-in-confidence. We have been going for 45 minutes and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education are here. I would like to ask one last question. I think it was on Friday that Professor Fels issued his report and warned: To prevent it becoming a de facto ID card, there should be a prohibition on anyone compelling people to produce it. I wonder whether the minister could indicate whether it is the intention of the government to introduce legislation to prohibit compelling production of the card. As I understand it, the government has indicated that is their position, but it would be helpful if it could be enshrined in law. disappointed that the member for Wills is not here.

316,Mr Hockey,"I have a great deal of respect for Professor Fels, as does the Australianme assure you of this: I did not invite him to take the position of head of the consumer and privacy task force with a flippant disregard for his ability to provide independent, sometimes courageous, advice. We were aware of that. That is because we are taking this issue very seriously. We do not want to see this project derailed by some fringe groups making extravagant claims about the impact on individual privacy. It is just not true. This is not just a rollout of a card; it is a rollout of infrastructure. It is going to be rolled out in a rather unstoppable way by the state governments, by the banking system. Credit card companies already do it with ANZ. They already have a smart card. Let me explain the fundamental principle here. The fundamental principle is that the magnetic strip on the back of your cards is not safe. It is easily skimmed. The information sitting on that magnetic strip is not as robust as a computer chip in a card. It is a simple fact. Computer chips are more robust. We are not suggesting for a moment that it is a honey pot. We are not suggesting for a moment that it should be the all-encompassing identifier. In fact, I would strongly argue against it being treated by people as a 100-point identifier. I do not want that to occur; otherwise it may be argued that it is an ID card. But there will be some people that will want to present it for identification purposes, such as when they are picking up an electronic ticket at an airport. A lot of aged Australians do not have drivers licences and have said they want to be able to present something when they are asked to provide proof of identity at various points. I think the issue raised about this being an alternative form of identification is a reasonable point. Some people might want to use it to make up a certain number of points to be able to open a bank account. I would strongly argue that there is a strong case for us to have legislation that ensures it is certainly not to be the only demanded identifier. That is quite a compelling argument. This is so that, for example, if you want to open a bank account, it cannot be the case that the bank can say, ‘You can either present your access card or you don’t open a bank account.’ I think there is a reasonable point to be made that we could legislate to avoid that occurring. But it could be used as part of the process. The key thing about it is that, for individuals that apply for the card, we will have a biometric identifier in the form of a photo that is more robust than any identifier out there at the moment. Even passport photos can be submitted by individuals rather than having the photo taken in the passport office. This will be a robust identifier for individuals. Identity theft is regarded as the biggest threat to individual liberty at the moment-that is the global consumer reaction, and you will see more information about that in the next few days. I see this as a form of secure identity for individuals-for me or others. The other point to note about this card is that the individual controls the card. If a person wants to put additional information on the card, such as that they have an allergy to penicillin, instead of having a wristband there could be a field that can only be seen by medical practitioners that readily identifies that they have a medical condition. These are the sorts of issues that I want discussed publicly and that is why I have engaged Professor Fels. I am glad that the opposition are engaging in the debate. Proposed expenditure agreed to. MAIN COMMITTEE Education, Science and Training Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $2,794,953,000. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (7.46 pm)-I want to start today with some questions about a matter that the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education made public today-that is, he intends changing the name of the New Apprenticeships scheme to Australian Apprenticeships. I saw reported in the Adelaide Advertiser that the government intends to spend $24 million. I would appreciate it if the minister could tell us if that figure is correct. If it is, has the government decided to spend all of that money in this budget year, 2006-07? If that is the case, where is that identified in the budget papers? ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (7.47 pm)-I am pleased the member for Jagajaga asked about this matter, because we want to create an enormous amount of prestige about the Australian Apprenticeships system. We want to put this very clearly in the minds of parents and those who support young people as they make their choices about the further studies they might undertake and the training they might want to undertake. For most states, year 10 is the year where students make some decisions about taking on Australian school based apprenticeships in years 11 and 12, with employers taking them on as part-time employees and where their academic studies and training matches the overall requirements of advancing in the elementary parts of trades as well as, obviously, completing academic studies. We want to create a very clear impression, particularly in the work that is being done through the Council of Australian Governments, that a credential gained in one state carries a weight of recognition across all states. It has been some 10 years since the government’s New Apprenticeships program was launched. We now know that we can have a truly national training system, given the agreement with the states and territories last year, which was recently re-endorsed just 10 days ago at the Ministerial Council for Vocational and Technical Education. What is in a name? Essentially, the short answer is that the name Australian Apprenticeships says it all. Obviously, our ambition is to get the word out about exactly what that means-to reinforce the decision making that parents and those who support young people help those young people make and to create an air of prestige about it. I saw the figure of $24 million quoted in the paper as well. I am writing to the Prime Minister to put to him very clearly our ambition to spend an appropriate amount of money not just in this year but over the years ahead, so that the resources are there in an advertising sense and to underpin our clear ambition to create this sense of prestige. My point is that there is nothing in the budget that will reflect that $24 million. There is money that is appropriated, as there regularly is, for marketing exercises underpinning all of this department’s programs. I am seeking further assistance from the Prime Minister, which would be the appropriate way for a minister to do it, and I will wait until the Prime Minister writes back with his agreement to that particular request. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (7.50 pm)-So there is no truth to that $24 million. Is that right? If there is no truth to the $24 million-if you will just confirm that briefly-how much is the actual rebranding going to cost, the change of name from New Apprenticeships scheme to Australian Apprenticeships? MAIN COMMITTEE",201,Appropriation Bill No 1 2006 2007
317,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton,"Minister for Vocational and Technical Education and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister) (7.50 pm)-In the interests of accountability, I cannot say what the cost of any rebranding exercise is until we embark upon it. But the coincidence of the new contracts for our Australian apprenticeships service centres-or Australian apprenticeships centres, as they will be known from 1 July-gives us an opportunity to write the contract requirements, which is what we are doing, for the 30 or so new providers around this country. These are the people who tendered under the old New Apprenticeships centres program for the right to run these Australian apprenticeship centres so this gives us a ready opportunity to make certain that, as they gear up for door opening on 1 July, they will be reflecting the new program name. The overall cost would be consistent with the kind of cost that we already see in the expenditure of moneys for marketing. In addition to that, we will obviously look for other ways to further enhance the standing of apprenticeships as a first choice. I simply say to the member for Jagajaga that the full amounts will obviously come out in time, as they would through exposure in Senate estimates and so forth. The money is not appropriated in this matter before us; it is simply a new program proposal put to the Prime Minister, the finance minister and the Treasurer, as is my wont as a minister of state. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (7.52 pm)-So, in other words, the government has no idea how much this rebranding will cost. The second thing that was reported was that this new rebranding was based on research that the government has apparently had done for it. Apparently the research said that the word ‘new’ was considered daggy. Will the minister now make this research available and can he tell us who in fact conducted the research? ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (7.53 pm)-I will seek advice on exactly who conducted the research. At the end of it, the normal approach to these things is to commission some research to set out very plainly where the positioning of items such as selling the prestige of Australian apprenticeships sits in the marketplace. My understanding is that there was some work done over the last couple of months on this. I must say, anecdotally, the state ministers are very happy about seeing the end of the word ‘new’. So, if nothing else, those who are administering apprenticeship programs around this country are quite happy to see the government act on updating the language and, indeed, reinforcing the sense of prestige and national purpose that will come with this new branding of Australian Apprenticeships. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (7.53 pm)-So the question, Minister, is will the research be made available and will you provide that research to the opposition? ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (7.54 pm)-I see no need one way or the other to make it available or not make it available. Is the opposition now proposing to be against the idea of enhancing the standing of apprenticeships? Ms Macklin interjectingto ask a question? Ms Macklin-Yes, I am.

Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (7.58 pm)-Goodness me! AllI asked was, ‘Will the incentive system be changed?’ and I got that diatribe. I take it from that that the incentive system will not be changedchanges to Australian apprenticeships in the coming months, you did not actually mean that there were going to be any. So let us put all that to one side, because plainly the government does not have any plans to make any changes other than changing the name. If we can move to the operation of the technical colleges, first of all I want to ask some questions about some of the stand-alone Australian technical colleges. By that I mean the ones the government intends to set up as independent schools without support from either the state governments or the Catholic system. I will take the example of the proposed technical college to be set up in Townsville next year. I see the member for Herbert has just come in; I am sure he will be interested in the minister’s answers. The minister has announced that the college will commence operations in 2007, but I just want to understand how this college is going to be financed. The current AGSRC secondary school figure is about $9,000 per student. Could the minister just confirm that that is the Australian Government School Recurrent Cost secondary school standard, about $9,000 a student? Of course, as the minister would be aware, this is a cash figure; it does not include liabilities for superannuation and so on. Nevertheless, as the minister would know, it is a conservative figure when we look at the costs of actually running a senior secondary school. We all know that students in years 11 and 12 are likely to be more expensive than that, and I would ask the minister to confirm that that is his expectation. Some people suggest that the estimates could be between 20 and 50 per cent higher than this average provided for secondary school students. So, first of all, I would like to know what cost estimate the government actually has, particularly for these schools that are not going to have the support that will be coming to those technical colleges in cooperation with the state government system or the Catholic system. Could the minister give us an idea of the actual figure he is working to for the cost per student in these colleges, like the one in Townsville? bert, might I remind him that it is Tasmania, the electorate of Denison in particular, that is paradise, rather than the electorate of Herbert! Mr Lindsay interjectingister Assisting the Prime Minister) (8.01 pm)-I fear that the unparliamentary observation by the member for Herbert might in fact be correct-that there could have been a misleading of the chamber! But, either way, I think it is important that each of us comes here with our own little bit of paradise at the back of our minds, even if it satisfies just ourselves!

333,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton,"Minister for Vocational and Technical Education and Minquite worked out, Member for Jagajaga, how this program actually works. Under the process of each of the state governments, there is a requirement for the schools to be registered. Either they are registered as a result of being in a partnership with an existing state owned school or a non-government school, or indeed, as you have suggested in your question, they are registered as a brand new school. All three of those types are in fact part of the network of Australian technical colleges that is being rolled out. But they all have to be registered state by state. As a result of that, they also receive recurrent funding by agreement. Schools that are registered are tied into the school system of that state and have to deliver the curriculum that is required to satisfy whatever the end point of study happens to be in that state-in Tasmania, it is year 10; in most other states it is year 12. At the end of it, they still need to satisfy the state board of studies. They still have to follow the requirements of the state boards as far as the curricula for academic study or indeed technical training are concerned. So the basis of your question is not quite correct-the suggestion that, by some process of osmosis, a school like the one in Townsville, in the member for Herbert’s electorate, might somehow or other be treated differently. I should add that, on top of the continuing commitment of this government, record amounts of money are going to state governments for the use, in a recurrent sense and also in a capital works sense, of schools. There are record amounts of money going into the private school sector from this government for recurrent expenditure as well as capital works. There is also a vote of money that is going to each of the consortia running the Australian technical colleges, money that goes towards both capital works and additional recurrent expenditure. So, to sum up the answer to the member for Jagajaga’s question, there is additional money. There are additional resources-$351 million over the current quadrennium. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (8.04 pm)-I do understand that the independent schools receive money from the Commonwealth, and I am glad that the minister has confirmed that his estimate of the secondary figure is as we expect it to be-that is, about $9,000 per studentand that he also accepts that year 11 and 12 students are more expensive. We could add on to that that VET students are even more expensive again because of the technology and so on that they require. I will run through the figures. If this school in Townsville were to receive the same rate of Commonwealth support as a Catholic systemic school, it would be receiving about $5,200 a student. State recurrent funding would be about $2,000 a student. That gets us up to around $7,000 to $7,500 a student, so we are a bit short. The department has advised the Senate estimates committee that this college will not be charging fees. The answer to the question that we asked in Senate estimates indicates that the fees for this college will be nil. The point of all of this is that, as the minister has confirmed, secondary school students need at least $9,000 a student. For years 11 and 12, they could need an additional $2,000 a student, yet this school, by the government’s own figures, will only be getting $7,500 a student. I would ask how much extra is going to go to this school in Townsville from the Australian technical college fund per student if it is the case that they are paying nil fees. ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (8.07 pm)-In response to that, the figures that the member for Jagajaga has offered are perhaps an indicative example or an example indicative, if you want to look at it another way. At the end of it, the government have made it plain that no adMAIN COMMITTEE",206,Appropriation Bill No 1 2006 2007
334,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton,"Minister for Vocational and Technical Education and Minditional fees will be charged for people to attend an Australian technical college. We understand that there are fee structures already in place in line with the attendance at an existing non-government school. The Australian government has dedicated something in the order of $19 million or $20 million to the Australian technical college in Townsville for its operating and capital works moneys over this current three-year period. On top of that, it has a tremendous amount of support from the Townsville community. The Townsville example is not isolated in this, but I have to say that I have been quite amazed by the strength of support that has come out of the Townsville community in general and, indeed, the Townsville business community towards the Australian technical college of North Queensland. It is quite amazing to think that, some six or seven months before this particular college opens, Townsville business has already committed 100-plus places for school based apprenticeships-Australian school based apprenticeships, as they will be called from 1 July. That is 100-plus employment opportunities to young people attending this school. On top of that, the effect of the strong business contingent involved in the management of this college sees businesses such as Alexander Body Works, which have repainted one of their utilities with ‘Australian Technical College North Queensland’ I am telling everyone all around the country, ‘You should get an Alexander Body Works involved in your consortium.’ They are driving around Townsville and Thuringowa getting the word out. I have a feeling I may have to be literally beating people off with a stick, and they are going to be coming back and asking for even more money because this program is so successful and so well understood in the Townsville region. I was rather delighted that the member for Jagajaga used the Townsville example, but I would be very cautious if I was her in any attacks that she might make on the way that this college is operating or organising itself, because it has an enormous of support in the Townsville and Thuringowa region. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (8.09 pm)-As you yourself would know, Mr Deputy Speaker-and as the minister knows-this is a new school, so I ask him again: is it the case that there will be no fees? It is a new school so the current fees do not apply. Is it true that there will be no fees at this school? That is the first thing. The second is that the minister has just told us that $20 million will be spent on this school. The critical question is how much of the $20 million will be spent in a recurrent way per student and how much is going on buildings? ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (8.10 pm)-I do not have the numbers off the top of my head but I am happy to go and find those in order to account for them. But at the end of it we also believe the consortium is very well equipped, very well supported and very well able to do all that they said that they would do. I make the principal point that there is no additional fee involved in attending an Australian technical college. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (8.10 pm)-So at this school there will be no fees, given there are no fees now because the school in fact does not exist-is that correct?

336,Ms Macklin,"Okay. I will go to some of the other technical colleges. Now that theand he has also told us, in previous announcements, that there will be $20 million spent in the Hunter and $9.6 million in Geelong, could the minister also tell us how much is being spent on the technical colleges that are already open: Gladstone, Port Macquarie, Eastern Melbourne and the Gold Coast? Could the minister tell us how much recurrent money is being spent and how much capital money is being spent? ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (8.11 pm)-The member for Jagajaga might be wise to put these specific questions on the Notice Paper. I am happy to try and furnish her information upon request. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (8.11 pm)-The reason I am asking here, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the minister is that we have asked these questions in Senate estimates and the department refused to answer them. This is an opportunity for the minister to actually give us an answer here tonight and, if he is unable to, can I take it that the commitment he has just given is that we now will have answers to these questions? ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (8.12 pm)-I have just said the member for Jagajaga might want to put the specific questions on the Notice Paper. I am not constantly carrying around with me the expenditure, technical college by technical college. Ms Macklin-Ask your advisers. ther. The member for Jagajaga might be wise to understand that the varying amounts of money reflect the ambitions of each of the local communities. Each community has put a case to us about how they interpret the Australian technical college program. Each brings a different asset base, a different model and a different approach. We have entered into a contractual obligation with each of those communities. There has been a very real effort to allow each of those communities to understand that there is not a standard amount of money that is associated with it. Some simply cost more than others because of the type of programs people have put to us. In Townsville there has been a larger commitment to the physical structures of buildings because we recognise that it is a cyclone rated area that requires quality building. A quality program of construction is underway, to the best of my knowledge. But the day-to-day dealings and all of that information actually rests in the hands of each consortium. The government is always happy to account for what those amounts are. I suspect that, as each of the amounts is expended and as each of those dollar figures is available, if the officials have not provided it at Senate estimates I might see the member for Jagajaga put it on the Notice Paper and ask me a question. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (8.13 pm)-As the minister has just given a commitment to that sort of accountability, we will put it on the Notice Paper. I look forward to a comprehensive answer that sets out the commitment in both recurrent and capital terms. The other questions are related to how many apprentices will actually be enrolled in each of these technical colleges. First of all, with the colleges that have already been opened the department has provided information about how many students are already enrolled at those technical colleges, so I will not ask that again.

Are all the students at the technical college actually enrolled in school based apprenticeships? ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (8.14 pm)-I do not know the exact number of people involved in school based apprenticeships, but I do know that the eastern Melbourne consortium have an obligation, in a contractual form, to ensure that each of the students involved with the Australian Technical College East Melbourne are involved in a school based apprenticeship. They either do that at the beginning of their enrolment or, indeed, once they have achieved some of their prevocational occupational health and safety studies and those sorts of things; it depends on how the school itself is structured. Either way, the students have a commitment. The consortium also has a commitment to have those students not only in a school based apprenticeship but in a certificate III school based apprenticeship-in other words, one that reflects a real trade-based assessment. In anticipation of further questions, the one at Port Macquarie simply cannot do that. If the member for Jagajaga were really committed to this cause, she would get on the phone to the New South Wales Minister for Education and Training-if she would take the call-and demand that she stop playing at shadow boxing on this and deliver Australian school based apprenticeship opportunities to what I would estimate are between 5,000 and 7,000 students in New South Wales. The member for Jagajaga could do that today. But the problem is-and we saw it just the other week with the rollover by the member for Brand on the question of Australian workplace agreements-that John Robertson from Unions New South Wales is running the New South Wales government and not any of the people who sit in the cabinet room. I cannot give you the exact number of people who are involved in whatever trades or apprenticeships. But we do expect each of these consortiums, rightly, to live up to its contractual agreement to provide at least these apprenticeships. In a state like New South Wales that is quite radical. Yet every day in Queensland, the North Queensland technical college is developing itself and already has over 100 bids from employers to take on school based apprentices. I think it is amazing, when you compare that with what is happening in New South Wales. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (8.17 pm)-The minister mentioned Port Macquarie, so I might now ask him a question that I want answered about Port Macquarie. The minister would be aware that St Joseph’s vocational, a school at Port Macquarie, was operating as a vocational college before it became a technical college. I understand that the school at that time had 185 students enrolled already. I ask the minister how many extra apprentices are enrolled at the four technical colleges that are currently operating? He has previously said that just under 300 students are enrolled. But is it the case that, if you remove the 185 who were at Port Macquarie already, the extra number of students in this new technical college is closer to only about 100? ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (8.18 pm)-I am just so glad that the member for Jagajaga did not become the education minister after the last election. If she had, the number of people enrolled in the Australian technical college around Australia would be zero-because there would not be such colleges.

341,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton,"Minister for Vocational and Technical Education and Minin her approach. People in all these different places around Australia are less than impressed by her approach on this. The nonsense she has peddled about Gladstone, for instance, has gone over like a lead weighted battleship in that particular city, which has a great commitment to vocational and technical education that has been enhanced by extra funds from this government. She would not want to show up at Port Macquarie or Taree either, because she would be tarred and feathered because of her churlish and uncharitable comments about the way that St Joseph’s vocational college is enhancing what it has done in the past. Even worse; if there were any commitment by the member opposite to school based apprenticeships, she would be joining with me and demanding that New South Wales in particular, but also Western Australia, get with the program and give the sort of opportunities that are available every day to people in Queensland and that are becoming available every day to people in Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. But these sorts of opportunities seem to be a foreign concept in Western Australia, a state run by the CFMEU-with the CFMEU’s head numbers person being that state’s education minister-and in New South Wales, where Unions New South Wales refuses to allow part-time apprenticeships. Is it any wonder that businesses in New South Wales are leaving the state? I invite the member for Jagajaga to refocus her energy on joining with us on this to try to bring about and broker the change we want. The simple reality is that currently there are over 300 school based apprenticeships, not all operating at the certificate III level because of the New South Wales intransigence and failure to update. The ambition is very clear: with over 20 colleges that should be operating come the 2007 school year, there will be over 2,000 school based apprenticeships. I suspect that by about this time next year we will see something in the order of 2½ thousand school based apprenticeships operating. This government is actually about giving opportunity to young people. We are not about prescribing-as the Labor Party have done state by state around this country-that kids have to remain at school until they finish year 12 or kids have to remain at school until they are 17 or 18, depending on where they are, and yet not providing full range of pathways and opportunities. This government has done more to expand the notion of success that individuals can achieve by taking on the trades than those opposite ever dreamed about. They had this lazy view that training was about burying further the massive levels of unemployment. In 1993, when they trashed the training system with the recession we had to have and 30,000 people left it overnight, we saw a whole series of programs under Working Nation, which was actually all about using training to hide the real level of unemployment in this country. AllI say to the member for Jagajaga is that, if she were genuine in her inquiry this evening, she would be saying to me: ‘Minister, tell me how I can help you succeed? Minister, tell me how I can talk those silly people in state governments in New South Wales and Western Australia into getting with the program? Tell me how I can go to the union movement and say, “Hold on a second; you have no chance of growing your union membership if you don’t have people in the workforce, in the trades”?’ But the member for Jagajaga has shown that she is not genuine in this. This is all about trying to get some fodder for a press release, and I can think of all of her lines now. The sad reality for the member for Jagajaga is that I look forward to this churlish and uncharitable press release that she will put out, because all that it will do is further develop the view amongst the MAIN COMMITTEE state ministers-and indeed amongst the constituency that she is trying to offer some shadow representation to-that in fact she knows nothing about what she is talking about. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (8.22 pm)-I shall take it from all of that that I am correct, that there were about 185 students already enrolled at the Port Macquarie vocational college before it became an ATC and that therefore the extra apprentices enrolled in the four ATCs that are now open are closer to about 100, because you have not corrected it and instead have decided to give us just a whole lot of waffle. Given that he is prepared to take these questions on notice, I will just say this to the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. As he would be aware, he has a piece of legislation in the chamber right at the moment. When we get to the consideration in detail stage of that bill tomorrow or the next day then he may ask his department for answers to the detailed questions that I have put to him tonight, because I intend to ask them again. I will move on to another area of training policy, particularly the future of the industry skills councils. I ask the minister whether or not a review of the industry skills councils is currently under way, or has that review already been completed? I ask the minister: who was responsible for conducting the review? If it was external to the department, who conducted it and how much did the review cost? ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (8.24 pm)-The member for Jagajaga has damned herself on two fronts with the comments she has just made. The piece of legislation that she has forecast to come before the chamber again this week is an example of how successful the Australian technical colleges program has been, because it brings forward expenditure from the out years into the current year. It shows the great lie that she is trying to tell around Australia about this program. It is actually bringing money from the out years into the earlier years. It is creating the necessary financing and the flexibility in the financing that is necessary to meet the expectations of the communities that have taken up the challenge for the technical colleges. The member for Jagajaga can try to use this forum to verbal me as much as she likes, but she knows very plainly that I have made itMs Macklin-Answer the question. minute speeches. You should understand the rules of engagement. WhatI am prepared to do is to engage on the point that it is not reasonable to suggest that I have not answered any of your questions and inquiries. In fact, I have, but the member for Jagajaga chooses not to want to listen to the responses, because it does not suit her predetermined purpose. With regard to the industry skills councils, this also makes my earlier point very plainthat is, obviously none of the state ministers is talking to her. At the recent Ministerial Council for Vocational and Technical Education this subject was raised by state ministers, and they asked to be involved in the process, which, at an earlier ministerial council meeting, they had charged me to execute. Under the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Agreement, the national training agreement, there was consideration that all elements of the training system would be subject to review, including the industry skills council.

343,Mr Hardgrave,"This is not a question and answer period; this is a series of fivecation and training to seek their views. State ministers will be further consulted on the matter and will make some decisions later in the year. Frankly, at the end of it-and I think that one of the ministers made this point-we have to be sure that all elements of the national training system are contributing to the way the system operates. One way or another, whether or not the industry skills councils are performing their tasks is something we will make a decision on as is appropriate and that will be decided by state ministers and me. It simply proves yet again that the state ministers will not talk to the member for Jagajaga. She has no research potential other than to ask these questions. It really is quite sad how disconnected she is from the national debate on training. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (8.27 pm)-I will finish on a couple of indexation issues. It is disappointing that the Minister for Education, Science and Training is not here; I cannot see the point of going into any great detail on schools’ issues. But the minister may be aware that Minister Bishop has issued a number of media releases claiming that the indexation of schools recurrent programs is an average of 6.4 per cent. I ask that the minister at the table confirm that the indexation is an average of 6.4 per cent. I also ask the minister how, if that is the case, he can justify an indexation arrangement of about two per cent for vocational and technical education. Why has he been able to deliver only two per cent to vocational and technical education if schools are getting an average of 6.4 per cent? ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (8.28 pm)-I am happy to take the substantial basis of that question and report back to the member for Jagajaga in due course. At the end of it, this government, this budget and the documents before us have voted almost an extra $1 billion towards the task of higher education in schools, science and training. This is a government that has had a record level of commitment now, over the 10 years it has been in office, to a massive spending spree on education. There has never been a government like this when it comes to education, science and training as far as the level of expenditure is concerned-expenditure that is well targeted and trusts local communities. One billion dollars is to be invested in the Investing in Our Schools program, delivering to both the state school sector and the nongovernment sector and to the parents in those sectors a chance to invest directly in their schools. I suspect that no matter what the member for Jagajaga might like to ask, the answer is not going to satisfy her. The government have increased expenditure in this portfolio to record numbers. We have, I think, taken upon ourselves very plainly a sense of national cooperation and national leadership. What is important from our point of view is that the states keep up, and whether the states are able to keep up with our leadership on this is an issue for individual states. It is understood that the overall partnership in training and in schools is a partnership with the state governments-constitutionally, they have direct responsibility for it. We are a part player in it but we are a part player in the sense that we can provide national leadership that can fashion national outcomes on a state-by-state basis. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (8.30 pm)-Given that vocational and technical education and universities are getting indexation of two per cent it does not say much about higher education under this government. Given that the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education is going to get back to me about that, I will leave that issue. I have a couple of other issues. The minister may have seen the state Liberal spokesperson from New South Wales, Mr Brad HazMAIN COMMITTEE",212,Appropriation Bill No 1 2006 2007
344,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton,"Minister for Vocational and Technical Education and Minzard, saying that if the Liberal-National coalition won the next election in New South WalesA to E reporting would not be used to report on children up to year 3 and that local communities would choose how to report on students in years 4 to 6. The spokesperson has come out and said that he will not do what the federal government has required the states to do. Would such a decision by a New South Wales state Liberal government-obviously a big assumption about whether or not they will win the state election-mean that the federal minister would withhold funding from New South Wales public schools? If that is the case, what is the total value of grants to New South Wales public schools that would be put at risk if the A to E reporting requirement was not met, as was suggested by the Liberal spokesperson in New South Wales? ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (8.31 pm)-I thought that this was the Parliament of Australia and not fantasy land in the sense that we are dealing with a hypothetical here. If there is a change of government in New South Wales-and I hope there is-the point would be made very plain to the incoming education minister that the government stands on the side of parents. Parents need to have a good understanding about how their child is performing, not just simply something saying that they exist and that they are actually in the classroom. We want a clear reporting process. We want something that is very easily understood. We think it is reasonable that parents know how their child is performing in comparison not only with other people in the state but also with other people in the classroom. The only people who have something to fear out of this are mediocre teachers. We think that the best teachers are going to welcome the chance to have parents know that their students are achieving an A outcome, a B outcome, a C outcome or whatever. No-one has anything to fear. We stand for excellence in education on this side. We have put it very plainly to the states. My understanding is that Minister Bishop is expecting some responses back from the states by the end of July. I guess we will deal with the detail of those responses then. It is really important that the member for Jagajaga does not do herself a disservice by standing for mediocrity. The Labor Party are all about rewarding mediocrity. Members of the Labor Party are constantly looking for examples to satisfy the case put to them by the Australian Education Union or the New South Wales Teachers Federation that mediocrity is okay. We have a view that we want to achieve excellence from our students. Earlier reforms from this government dealt with literacy and numeracy benchmarking. The way in which those opposite rallied against that because somehow it was going to expose teachers did them no service at all. Without wanting to embarrass my poor son, but I am about to, if it had not been for Dr David Kemp’s reforms earlier in the life of this government revealing literacy traps, which then enabled my son to find out that he was not reading and writing properly, he might not be as good a student as he is today. I am quite proud about the fact that this government has stood for encouraging excellence and exposing where excellence is not being achieved. Whether it is the New South Wales Liberal Party, the New South Wales Labor Party or whoever it happens to be, it is an example that the member for Jagajaga will go and grab for, because she stands for mediocrity while we on this side stand for excellence.

Another issue I want to get the minister’s response on is also in this year’s budget. The government has decided to continue its tutorial voucher initiative. I understand there has been an evaluation done of the pilot tutorial voucher initiative. There is an executive summary of this evaluation that is available on the DEST website.

So in due course it will be made available. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (9.00 pm)-I would appreciate it if the minister could also let us know how much the evaluation cost. Obviously, the material that is available on the website about the success or otherwise of the tutorial voucher initiative is important, given that the government has decided to continue with this initiative. In the interests of being able to assess whether or not the first round of the pilot was successful, it is important that the evaluation be made available as quickly as possible. And could the minister also let me know how much the evaluation actually cost? ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (9.01 pm)-I understand that the member for Jagajaga has placed a pretty extensive FOI request with the department seeking documents relating to this pilot tutorial voucher initiative and the evaluation of the pilot. The first response was provided on 13 March and the next on 8 May. Remaining documents were to be provided in two stages; I think some were provided on 22 May and the final stage will be made available as soon as practical. I am sure that the matter of cost and all those other matters can be handled in that FOI request, or in whatever other form suits the member for Jagajaga. The government has not made it a practice to not make information available following reasonable requests. I do not see us changing our approach in this particular matter. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (9.02 pm)-Finally, I want to ask the minister about the federal government’s Global Nuclear Energy Partnership interdepartmental committee.

Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (9.04 pm)-There is another matter that I would like the minister’s advice on. For some time now, the non-government school sector has been expecting to hear about a review to be undertaken, as they understand it, by the department-an internal review looking at the way in which the government intends to fund non-government schools into the next quadrennium. It is obviously a very important matter for the non-government school sector. SoI ask the minister if he could let us know where this review is up to, when it will be announced, who will be conducting it and when he expects it to be completed. ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (9.05 pm)-I am happy to say that the review will be conducted in the course of this year. It is being conducted within the department, but obviously it will seek advice from the non-government schools so they have full input into the process.

Trans Fatty Acids (Question No. 3000) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 7 February 2006: (1) Is he aware of the health concerns about consuming foods containing large amounts of trans fatty acids (TFAs). (2) What steps is he taking to reduce the consumption of foods containing large amounts of TFAs. (3) Does the Government intend to follow the lead of Canada, the United States and some European countries in requiring mandatory labelling of the TFA content in food. (1) Yes. (2) Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) is currently investigating Australians’ dietary intake of TFAs to determine whether such intakes constitute a public health risk that should be managed, for example, by limits on TFA content in foods, mandatory labelling, or public health messages. the levels of TFA in Australian food. FSANZ will use this and other information to estimate current levels of dietary intake, which will assist in determining the public health risk. Australian TFA intakes were last estimated in the 1990s. When compared with other countries at that time, Australian consumption was lower.",218,Questions In Writing
356,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Currently, TFA content must be declared when claims in relation to the cholesterol content or types of fat such as ‘polyunsaturated’ in a food are made. Australian manufacturers may also voluntarily declare the TFA content of their products. Many table-spread manufacturers have chosen to do this after finding ways to virtually eliminate TFAs from their products. (3) The Australian Government maintains contact with authorities in the US and Canada to follow the public health, industry and consumer impacts of introduction of mandatory labelling of TFA. This information will be considered when responding to the assessment of public health risks from current intakes of TFA. Australia’s TFA intake has been estimated to be lower than US and Canada.

360,Mr Hockey,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Taxation (Question No. 3116) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 27 February 2006: (1) Has the Australian Taxation Office ATO begun implementing improvements to its systems to better match the risk issues associated with paying GST refunds. (2) Is there a conflict between paying GST refunds in a timely manner and preventing fraudulent or incorrect refunds; if so, how does he intend to resolve it. (3) What proportion of GST refunds were not issued within 14 days in (a) 2003-2004, (b) 2004-2005, and (c) 2005-2006 to date. (4) Is it common for a company to have its GST refund manually checked every time it lodges a claim. (5) Does the ATO notify a business if its refund has been delayed.

(7) In respect of the 205,000 individuals and businesses which were overcharged penalty interest arising from audits before 2000, (a) have they been contacted, (b) what sum was mistakenly collected, (c) have the taxpayers been repaid or compensated, (d) has any individual or business become insolvent as a consequence of being overcharged, (e) since the mistake was discovered, has consideration been given to having the ATO’s formulae independently verified, and (f) before the mistake was discovered did any of the taxpayers contest their liability for penalty interest in the courts. (8) What systems are in place to ensure taxpayers are not overcharged in the future. (1) Yes. As part of its risk management approach, the ATO has established processes to risk assess certain categories of GST refunds. (2) The ATO continues to balance the need to verify activity statement refunds prior to issue, with the need to meet community and Government expectations that appropriate refunds are issued to the right person in a timely manner. Strategies have been developed (and are continuously reviewed) to address this balance. (3) Activity statement refunds not issued within 14 days (against a benchmark of 92% issued) were: 2003-04 5.6% 2004-05 7.9% 2005-06 (at 3/3/06) 7.18% (4) As part of its risk management strategy, the ATO risk assesses certain categories of taxpayers based on their tax history. Where this history includes regular refund claims that are in line with the client’s historic refund pattern, the ATO will not hold up a current refund for verification purposes.",221,Questions In Writing
361,Mr Dutton,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) Yes. The ATO notifies large enterprise taxpayers by email where their activity statement refund is delayed for verification, this email includes the name and contact details of the taxpayer’s key client manager. For all other taxpayers, the ATO notifies them by telephone that their activity statement refund will be subject to verification; the benchmark for this contact is within 48 hours of the intervention. (6) The ATO activity statement processes are aimed at minimising the potential of adverse cash flow or funding impacts. (7) (a) The ATO issued a press release on 15 December 2005 and has started to correct the accounts of those affected. Explanatory correspondence will be sent to taxpayers along with any appropriate amended assessments as accounts are corrected. (b) Based on its work to date, the ATO estimates the revenue impact as being between $150 – 180 million. (c) The ATO is in the process of correcting accounts of affected taxpayers and expects to complete the process by 30 September 2006. All affected taxpayers will be entitled to a credit for the amount of overcharged interest. For taxpayers who have paid the incorrectly charged interest, compensation will also be paid at prevailing base interest rates for the affected periods. (d) The ATO is not aware of any taxpayer who has been made insolvent solely due to the over charged interest. (e) The ATO is subject of external scrutiny through the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) program of audits. The ATO has involved the ANAO in its strategy and processes for rectifying the error. (f) Other than the case which highlighted the error, the ATO is unaware of any cases of disputed liability to penalty interest being pursued in the courts. (8) Corrections have been made to ATO computer systems; any cases amended from 24 September 2005 have had the interest correctly calculated. Diabetes (Question No. 3195) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 27 March 2006: (1) Will he explain why Lantus, intended for use by type 1 diabetes sufferers, is not currently listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). (2) Is it the case that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) has refused to list Lantus on grounds of its uncertain overall benefit and its high cost-effectiveness ratio; if not, on what grounds has the PBAC refused to list it. (3) What is the Government’s response to the view of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation that Lantus has been demonstrably effective at reducing the incidence of hypoglycaemic attacks. (4) What is the Government’s response to the view of Dr Warren Kidson, a visiting endocrinologist at Sydney’s Prince of Wales Hospital and Children’s Hospital, that Lantus has been far superior to standard insulin for many of his patients with unstable type 1 diabetes. (5) How does the Government reconcile the apparent conflict between the advice of practising specialists and the findings of the PBAC. (6) Will he act to ensure that diabetes sufferers have timely and affordable access to Lantus; if so, how; if not, why not. (1) Insulin glargine (Lantus®) could not be considered for listing on the PBS until PBAC made a recommendation that it be listed. This occurred on 21 April 2006 at an out of session meeting of PBAC. LANTUS® has been recommended by PBAC as both clinically effective and cost effective compared with other available treatments. There are other processes that need to be completed, such as pricing negotiations, before listing can be implemented. These are being progressed now. (2) At an extraordinary meeting in late March, PBAC recommended the listing of LANTUS® as an unrestricted benefit on the PBS. PBAC acknowledged the clinical need for an insulin product that reduces hypoglycaemic events without compromising long-term diabetic control. The cost effectiveness of LANTUS® was accepted at the new price proposed. (3) Studies on the efficacy of drugs are taken into consideration by PBAC. (4) As above. (5) There is no conflict. (6) LANTUS® has been evaluated using the same criteria as all drugs evaluated by PBAC. Although other processes required for listing will be progressed as quickly as possible, it is not possible at present to say when they might be completed. Media Training (Question No. 3346) Mr Bowen asked the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 29 March 2006: (1) Did the Department or any agency under the Minister’s portfolio engage the services of a media training company in 2005; if so, how many individuals in the department and each agency received media training. (2) For 2005, what sum was spent on media training by the department and each agency in the Minister’s portfolio. (1) Yes. In 2005, 629 individuals in Defence received some form of media training. (2) The cost of media training delivered within Defence in 2005 can be divided into two categories: Direct contracts with Defence: $278,009 (inc GST). Contracts in which media training is a sub-contracted component: $68,000 (inc GST).

(2) What is the estimated total value of the accumulated tax losses of these firms. (3) How many of these firms have turnover under $100m. (1) to (3) In order to minimise costs of compliance, and given that losses that are ineligible for recoupment do not pose a significant risk, companies are not required to provide details to the Tax Office of losses that fail to meet the requirements of both the Continuity of Ownership Test and the Same Business Test. This situation applies both before and after the amendment of the legislation by Schedule1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (Loss Recoupment Rules and Other Measures) Act 2005.

(4) Does he intend to provide any ongoing funding for Macarthur Youth Commitment to continue a project that is cutting truancy rates; if not, why not.",224,Questions In Writing
365,Mr Dutton,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Centrelink is not part of the taskforce mentioned in the article. Centrelink’s understanding is that there are two attendance strategies currently running in Sydney’s South West region. One is a Centrelink initiative called the Positive Attendance Strategy for Students (PASS). PASS involves secondary schools supplying Centrelink with attendance information that identifies students at risk of incurring a Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY debt. The other is the Transition Broker Project, which is an initiative of the Macarthur Youth Commitment. To prepare this answer it has taken approximately 8 hours and 2 minutes at an estimated cost of $372. Medicare (Question No. 3429) (1) What was the (a) scheduled fee and (b) Medicare rebate payable for the two most commonly used podiatry services on 1 January (i) 1995, (ii) 2000, and (iii) 2006. (2) From1 January 1995 and 1 January 2006, was the increase in the gap between the scheduled fee and the Medicare rebate for the two most commonly used podiatry services proportionally more than the increase in the Medicare rebate; if so, will he explain why this has occurred. (1) (a) and (b) (2) Podiatry services were not eligible for a rebate under Medicare until 1 July 2004, when rebates were introduced for a range of allied health services under the Medicare Allied Health and Dental Care Initiative. In January 2006, the schedule fee for podiatry services under this initiative was $53.90. The Medicare rebate was $45.85.

369,Mr Dutton,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) Will he, or will he ask the Treasurer to, refer allegations of abuse of market power by Camden Airport Limited to the ACCC for investigation. (6) Does he share the concern of tenants at Camden Airport that the long term viability of the Australian aviation industry will be affected by the increased rent charged at Camden Airport; if not, why. (1) Yes. (2) I met with Mr Kim Ellis, CEO of Bankstown Airport Limited and Camden Airport Limited, on 4 April 2006 and one of the issues discussed was rental increases. (3) Rent reviews are a commercial matter between the Airport Lessee Company (ALC) and their tenants and are conducted in accordance with the terms and conditions set in the lease. It is appropriate that tenants negotiate directly with the ALC to agree on fair and reasonable rental rates having regard to the market reviews that have been conducted in accordance with each lease. (4) I am advised that many of the lease agreements contain provisions that allow for the rent increase to apply from the date that the review is carried out. The negotiation of lease agreements is a commercial matter between the ALC and their tenants. (5) I am advised that if a proposed increase is disputed, most leases contain additional rent review clauses that provide for the appointment of an independent third party valuer to reassess the market rental rate. Given its responsibility for investigating pricing complaints under the Trade Practices Act 1974, any complaints about the level of charges would be a matter for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). Those tenants who remain concerned about rents and other pricing matters at the Airport may therefore wish to raise this matter with the ACCC directly. (6) Camden Airport Limited has advised that their vision is for Camden Airport to be the premier sport and recreation airport in Australia. The Camden Airport sale agreement provides that Camden Airport will have due regard to the existing sport and recreation aviation facilities and operations in developing the master plan. The final master plan for Camden Airport indicates a commitment by the airport to continue to develop the airport and includes provisions for additional hangars, the construction of additional engine-run-up bays and an extended taxiway network. Parkinson’s Disease (Question No. 3461) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 9 May 2006: (1) Is he aware that the drug Sifrol is an effective treatment for Parkinson’s Disease that is widely available throughout Europe. (2) Is Sifrol being considered for importation and listing on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS); if so, when does he expect it will be available on the PBS; if not, will he act to make the drug available for the treatment of Parkinson’s Disease and other diseases for which it is a suitable treatment. (1) Yes. SIFROL® (pramipexole hydrochloride) was registered in Australia on 20 April 1999. It is approved for use in the treatment of signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease. (2) As SIFROL® is registered in Australia, the sponsor of SIFROL®, Boehringer Ingelheim, is legally allowed to market the product in Australia if it chooses to do so. The company manufacturing SIFROL® has chosen not to market the drug in Australia. It is the manufacturer’s prerogative as to whether to market a product in Australia and the government cannot compel a manufacturer to market a product. Similarly, the decision to apply for PBS listing of a drug is one that only the manufacturer of the medicine can make. To date, the manufacturer has not",226,Questions In Writing

Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 3463) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 9 May 2006: (1) What are the details of the work required at Sydney Airport to prepare it for the introduction of the Airbus A380, eg, parallel runway works, taxi ways etc. (2) Is this work dependent upon settled weather conditions in order to be completed by a particular date; if so, (a) by what date is or was the work to be completed and (b) have weather conditions delayed work; if so, what are the details. (3) Has the work affected the use of the operating modes that use the east-west runway; if so, what are the details. (4) Will the Airbus A380 be able to use the east-west runway at Sydney Airport; if not, why not. (5) Does the work impact on Airservices Australia’s capacity to achieve its LTOP aircraft movement targets and, in particular, the targets relating to areas north of Sydney Airport; if so, what are the details. (1) Sydney Airport Corporation Limited (SACL) is responsible for works at Sydney Airport to prepare it for the introduction of the Airbus A380. SACL has advised that the A380 airfield works include the provision and strengthening of runway shoulders for runways 16L/34R and runway 07/25, the construction of additional taxiway fillets and the realignment of taxiway Golf at the eastern end of runway 07/25. Additionally, to facilitate aircraft parking six A380 parking positions are being constructed with an additional two positions in future as A380 movements increase. (2) SACL has advised that all work is dependent upon settled weather conditions however the project plan has considered the prevalence of poor weather at the planning stage: (a) The date for the practical completion of the straightening of taxiway Golf which is the last major airfield works is 1 August 2006. (b) Weather conditions have not delayed this work. (3) Airservices Australia has advised that the work has not affected the nomination of the operating modes that use the east west runway. A small number of aircraft have not been able to depart from the east west runway, reportedly because they did not have the aircraft performance data required for departure from an intermediate taxiway. SACL has advised that the A380 works have been planned taking into consideration the maintenance of LTOP and, apart from the notification of a 10 day period in early April, has not impacted on the utilisation of runway 07/25. During this 10 day period the use of the east west runway was limited to arrivals on runway 25 (from the east) and departures on runway 07 (to the east). For2 days during this period, as a result of weather conditions (wind) the east west runway was fully reinstated and operated exclusively. Additionally, it will be necessary to impose a minor restriction at the eastern end of taxiway Golf for varying periods until the completion of works at the end of July. (4) SACL has advised that the A380 aircraft will be able to operate on the east west runway. (5) Airservices Australia has advised that the work has had no impact on Airservices’ ability to nominate an LTOP mode.
