Yes, I am aware that some years ago Lloyd's asked the Fremantle Harbor Trust whether the question of establishing wireless telegraphy at Rottnest was likely to engage the attention of the trustees, and stated that, if so, Lloyd's Committee would be pleased to render assistance in carrying out such an installation. 2. Parliament, in the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905, has given the Postmaster-General the exclusive privilege of establishing, erecting, maintaining, and using wireless telegraphy stations. 3. I do not think either the trade or the prestige of the Commonwealth is suffering so severely as suggested. So far as I am aware, only a few of the first-class boats trading to Australia are now equipped with wireless telegraph installations. 4. No avoidable delay will take place in dealing with the question of the installation of wireless telegraphy in the Commonwealth, as soon as the New Works Appropriation B ill , providing £10,000 for the purpose becomes law.

23,", Mr Joseph Cook","My reply to theIn Committee of Supply: Consideration resumed from 25th August (vide page 2587), That the item ""The President, £1,100,"" be agreed to. [2.40] I wish to know from the Treasurer, before continuing my remarks, whether, if we allow the Budget debate to end, the Government will be able to borrow £1,200,000 without first getting parliamentary authority? the honourable member for Parkes declared that borrowing is a good thing. When I was in America, a debt was regarded as a liability, but if , on the contrary, it is an asset, we ' ought all to get into debt to become rich. Treasurer regard a debt as an asset? I have always said that the Treasurer when in office in Western Australia was a careful man. I watched him closely over there. He looked to his sinking funds and saw that they were behind all his borrowing. Treasurer think that when the Premiers entered into that bargain with the Commonwealth this Budget should have been at once withdrawn, and a new Budget brought down containing the Conference contract ? After all, this is not a complete passed the proposal to initiate a borrowing Budget, as it does not contain that contract, which will form the basis on which the whole of the Commonwealth finances must rest. whether we shall have as broad a scope on the Premiers' contract as we have on this Budget, to discuss the whole question ? honourable member had better go on with Can we go into anything and everything connected with the finances? I see tremendous economic waste here in Australia. I notice, when I want to send a telegram away, that a lot of men are employed, they have to keep a list of the despatches, and yet I have to buy stamps, and then a man must lick the stamps and put them on the telegram. I never saw that until I came to Australia. A list of the telegrams is kept, and yet the State has to print those stamps af enormous expense. That seems a great economic waste, and I do not wonder when I hear men complaining about Socialism, for there is no doubt that so far as the States are concerned there is great waste in Australia. Another thing I notice about the Post Office is that, instead of having a circular box, with the names of the suburbs on it, turning round so that each person could drop his letters in according to the suburb to which they are addressed, the Government have to employ sorters to sort the letters. Can we de.U with all those things when discussing the Premiers' contract? If the Treasurer says we can, I do not want to talk today. If the Treasurer cannot say, can the Chairman give me an answer? The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN make any promise on a general question of that sort. deal with every issue, because I confess that this is now the turning of the tide of finance in Australia. This is one of the important Budgets. We have no organized credit system here. Organized credit is Does the the greatest economic force in the world, and unorganized credit the greatest economic waste. revenues of the Commonwealth and the whole of the revenues of the States and their relations to one another will be under Does not thc debate. What opportunity can the honourable member want wider than that? conditions I should be prepared to postpone my remarks until then, but I do not want it to be said that this Parliament policy without a fight. It is proposed in the Budget that the Treasurer shall meet his deficit of £1,200,000 by Treasury Can the Treasurer state bills. bring in a Bill before we do that. The his speech. doubt that the big fight will be over this contract with the Premiers, which locks to me very dangerous. on the naval business. that amount is also something awful. When we begin to look at the prospects of expenditure on militarism and navalism, when we contemplate the plunge which we are asked to take, we should be appalled. I confess that there is a scare on, but I assure the Committee that if ever Great Britain falls it will, be from causes not outside, but inside. There is no danger from outside.

35,Mr King O'malley,"Of coursedanger arises from the industrial conditions which stunt and stifle the life of the people of Great Britain and make them unfit to fight for their nationhood. I have looked into this question carefully, because I recognise that Great Britain with her outside States, and the United Slates of America, are the onlytwo free countries in the world-countrie s where you can say and do what you like so long as you do not break the law. l t is a pity for us to begin to spend such an enormous sum on ships that will be on the scrap heap in nine years. row the monev. cide to undertake that tremendous expenditure we shall have to borrow. will be no other way to meet it, unless we r organize our credit. If , however, we utilize the credit of. the Commonwealth for the benefit of the people there will be no necessity for us to be in the markets borrowing in competition like tradespeople. The first thing we want to do is to organize the credit of the Commonwealth, and get the benefit of that credit for ourselves, by establishing a national postal banking system for the Commonwealth. The Treasurer, when he desires to raise £1,200,000, would not then have to go cap in hand to a banking institution, in which, perhaps, many of us are shareholders, and mortgage the credit of the Commonwealth. I shall deal with the whole question when the agreement arrived at with the Premiers of the States is submitted for our consideration. A sum of £500,000 per annum will be necessary for the upkeep and interest of the proposed Australian Navy. Do honourable members imagine that a fleet of warships could be successfully repulsed by a few torpedo boats and torpedo-boat destroyers ? If one torpedo boat was in Fremantle, and another in Port Darwin, would the Prime Minister, in the event of an attack being made on Melbourne, telegraph to their commanders to come round and fight the enemy? It has been suggested that a cruiser which had been detached from an enemy's, fleet and given a roving commission might destroy practically all our shipping ; but there is not a warship capable of carrying sufficient coal to enable her to steam from Europe to Australia. Naval bases in the Pacific would be necessary to enable such a vessel to obtain the requisite supplies. In France, the other day, a most successful display of aeroplanes was made. One aeronaut made a flight of over 100 miles in the course of a few hours; and it is not long since another crossed the English Channel. An expenditure of £500,000 would enable us to purchase a fleet of air-ships capable of adequately defending Australiabeen proved. of the electric telegraph occupied ten years in inducing the Congress of the United States of America to vote £8,000 to enable him to construct a telegraph line from Baltimore to Washington, and not one of the representatives of farming constituencies who voted for that grant was re-elected, because the people considered There they had thrown away money on what they described as a ""mad machine."" Would any one say to-day that the electric telegraph is a ""mad system""? Every invention must pass through an experimental stage, and every new idea is always condemned. And so with air-ships; but I contend that they have passed the experimental stage. Would it not be well for the Treasurer to inquire into the advisableness of our acquiring a fleet of these vessels? He ought certainly to look into the matter. Until lately, the great Thomas Edison did not think it possible to invent a navigable aerial machine, but he has had to say, '' I surrender; the air-ship is no longer an experiment."" The honourable member for Parkes spoke strongly yesterday in favour of a borrowing policy. venue-producing works. turn showing that £60,000,000 of the debts of the States are not earning interest, and that, of that sum, £17,000,000 ha.s been swallowed up in brokerage and other expenses.

72,Mr Bruce Smith,"It is not a questionrendered to us. They have given up certain powers to the Federation under a national contract. human rights, and there are State rights; and human rights rise above State rights as the mountains rise above the valleys. the people, after all. The honourable member is a financial man, and I ask him whether, if a corporation, with all its property mortgaged at fifty per cent, on a first mortgage, came to him and asked for a second mortgage, he, as a trustee for large estates or for widows and orphans, would have the same confidence in the"" security as he would if he had the whole business? second mortgage. able member is absolutely honest, and every one in the House trusts his word. But, under the circumstances I have indicated, how can' the second transaction be anything else but a second mortgage? Many years ago, when Canada used tc float loans just because the whole of the debts had been taken over,-the debts were mostly floated in London, but often in New York-financia l men talked about responsibility, powers of taxation, and ability to meet obligations. One may appeal to the man who holds the first mortgage, to have it increased, but-he could not go to another lender, and negotiate a second mortgage. There is a vast difference between the Commonwealth contracting an expanding mortgage, which will increase as population grows, and taking over the debts of the States, and creating a sinking fund to liquidate them in a certain number of years. scheme is adopted, the Commonwealth will have only a second mortgage to offer as security when it washes to borrow, and while the State bonds may be at, or above, par. its bonds, though tearing as high a rate of interest, will be below par. Nothing is so sensitive as the money market, especially concerning securities in which the trust moneys of widows and orphansare invested. I have had enough experience in big cities to know that you cannot borrow a dollar unless those representing big insurance concerns or other financial institutions are prepared to support the flotation. I feel strongly that the Commonwealth should not be hobbled. What is proposed amounts to a constitutional collar of torture. In a few years the Commonwealth will have to borrow millions. We have not provided for a national postal banking system, nor organized our credit, and yet it is proposed to enter into a perpetual mortgage, under which our liability will continually expand. Our fiscal policyis Protection, and. I hope that the great barriers which now prevent the poverty of other countries from sending its products here, to be consumed at the expense of our work-people, will never be removed. Protection means diversity of industry, from which follows the health, wealth, and prosperity of a country. The United States raises only ,£1 9s. 6d. per head of population from Customs and Excise revenue, and as things are going, we shall have to subnever lend on a stitute for our existing duties a revenue Tariff. No doubt the Treasurer would not object to that. But with revenue duties our industries cannot have the protection which they now enjoy. No State can be strong or powerful without the organization of its credit. The destruction of a country's credit means the stifling,of its progress, and the crippling of its potentialities. I trust that the Treasurer may, even at this last moment, repent of his scheme. When a great national newspaper like the Age. putation. a great fighter for the rights of the people of Australia, and has done great work for Victoria. This State would still be a sheep walk.but for its efforts. That newspaper has supported the Government, but, in view of the articles which have recently appeared in it regarding the agreement with the Premiers, Ministers should feel that If the Government something is wrong. I know of no country, whether it be Canada, Mexico, the United States, Peru, Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chili, Honduras, or Brazil, in which the central power, has surrendered its rights to subordinate powers. In giving up our financial advantages we weaken the central Government, and aid decentralization, creating a confederacy instead of a federation. I would rather accept the schemes of the honourable members for Mernda, Kooyong, or North Sydney than vote for that proposed by the Government. The esti-' mated receipts of .the Commonwealth for 1909-10 are £ 4>555>7<S5; the estimated T expenditure £7,867,621, and, under the Braddon provision, £7,891,481 must be",18,Smith Wha T Has The And That All That Money Could Be Saved I F

79,Mr King O'malley,"It has beenpaid to the States. duced statements showing the gain to the Commonwealth, but, in my opinion, the Commonwealth will not gam anything; she will really lose. In a year's time the Commonwealth Parliament will be able to deal with Customs and Excise revenue as it pleases, and surely it may be trusted to. do absolute justice to the States. The honourable members for Fawkner, Mernda, Balaclava, and other Victorian Federal constituencies repreafraid of the referendum, but as I said sent and are concerned with Victorian inteat the Brisbane Conference, I believe in rests as much as are members of the State Parliament. secret meeting of Premiers. In my opinion the secrecy which was observed was like a dagger used for the assassination of the Commonwealth. ThoughI object to the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda, so far as one point is concerned, I would accept it in preference to the Government scheme. Let the Commonwealth handle the debts of the States, and go into the money market, if necessary, with its credit untramelled. The estimated deficit is £1,200,000, and the works proposed by the present Government to be executed by this Parliament, but not provided for on the Estimates, except as to the sum of £5,000 for the Federal Capital, amount to £3,932,000, so that we must meet at the end of the present year a total liability of £5,132,000 more than the Estimates provide for. Does any one believe that only ,£5,000 will be spent on the Federal Capita! ? If the Government mean business they must spend £50,000 this year on it. The sum of £2,000,000 will be required for a Dreadnought or its equivalent, ,£1,000,000 for the Post Office -and that will not be enough-,£250,000 for invalid pensions; £250,000 beyond the £^300,000 for the annual deficit on theNorthern Territory, £50,000 for the Federal Capital, ,£60,000 for lighthouses, beacons and buoys. £10,000 for a High Commissioner-and nothing for such a purpose-£5,000 an Agricultural Bureau, ,£5,000 for the Inter-State Commission, and £2,000 for the State Debts Inquiry 'Commission, making a total, as I said, for works proposed, but not provided for on the Estimates, of £3,933,000 With regard to the Inter-State Commission, I would point -out that we are appointing too many Commissions, and that that body will be only another institution, and an expensive one, Mr King The Treasurer profor destroying the power of the Commonwealth. Further, what will be the use of having a State Debts Inquiry Commission if we are going to put in the Constitution for ever and ever a provision that the States shall receive 25s -per cafita? Why is the honourable member afraid of the referendum? proper finance, and I like a solid foundaThere was no need for a tion. If it.is right to do it, let us do it right, for no question is ever settled on other than right lines. The probable future obligations involved in the Government policy include £5,000,000 for the development of the Northern Territory, £5,000,000 for the Northern Territory railway, £5,000,000 for the Western Australian railway, £1,000,000 for Postal Department extensions, £50,000 for an immigration policy, ^£20,000 for the High 'Commissioner, and £1,000,000 for old-age pensions, or a total of .£17,072,000. Yet not a word is .said by the Treasurer about providing that money. The sum of £1,000,000 will be necessary for old-age pensions after this year, as only a sum of £850,000 will be provided this year, £650,000 being available from the trust fund. However we look at those figures, we must recognise that we are drifting. The Government are preparing for a terrific plunge, .and yet they are mortgaging their only asset, because they are settled in their opposition to the imposition of direct taxation. The State of Victoria has now brought in its own unimproved land tax, Tasmania has a land tax, and other estimate for old-age pensions, States must follow, so that I cannot see how the present Federal Government can propose land taxation. If that is so, and there is no doubt it is, there is nothing left for the Federal Government but to that is practically float enormous loans, and to float them, for on a second mortgage. This is, therefore, a most serious question. What now, were my proposals? When I put forward the inauguration of a national postal banking system, I went carefully into the matter, and found that the States receive £85,088 per year from the duty on the note circulation.

That means £17,550 a year for interest, but I do not think there is an honourable member who will object to that. scheme, we take over £174,000,000 of the State debts, which is the amount that each State's three-fourths of the revenue will purchase, and create a sinking fund of £870,000 a year to pay that debt off in sixty years at 3^ per cent. Taking an annual payment of £870,000 in halfyearly instalments 'into a sinking fund bearing interest at 3^ per cent, per annum, convertible half-yearly, the first halfyearly instalment being paid on 31st December, 1908, the amount to which the fund would accumulate at various dates is as follows :Date.

On the assumption that the organization of credit would have enabled the States of Australia to obtain prices for their securities exceeding those actually received by £ 7 per £100 of stock, the public debt of Australia would be about £17,000,000 lower than at present, assuming the same amount of loan expenditure to have been incurred. I would point out to the honourable member for Parkes that the amount which we have paid in brokerage under par and in various other losses for want of an organized credit is £17,000,000. The annual interest on £17,000,000 at 3J per cent, is £595,000. That is the sum which the States are paying yearly for money which they have never handled, in the shape of brokerage, underwriting, and bank and other commissions, which they could want 30s. per save if they had a financial institution cf their own.

Deducting from that surplus the sum of £6,970,000, which, under my scheme, would be returned to the States, we should have a Accumulated Sinking credit balance of £1,000,471.

There would be 12,000 shares, half of which would be held by the Commonwealth, and the remaining half by the States.

I have stated only the estimated profits ; but think of the purchasing power ! In 1857 the Bank of England and all its branches had a gold reserve of only £358,208;. and that meant the total aggregate reserve of all the English banks, because these are kept at the Bank of England. An Act passed by Sir Robert Peel in 1844 required the Bank of England to hold' a certain reserve against its note issue, and compelled not only that bank, but all banks, to stop discounting and loaning the moment that reserve had been reached. In obedience to the law, the Bank of England, when the reserve limit was reached, O'Malley. discontinued discounting and loaning, and",21,Smith Wha T Has The And That All That Money Could Be Saved I F

88,Mr King O'malley,"A comparastopped all overdrafts and renewals; and there was caused one of the greatest financial cataclysms in the history of England. On the 12th November, 1857, in consequence of the crisis, the Government ordered the banks to violate the law; and the Bank of England immediately commenced discounting, loaning, and purchasing commercial paper. In the sixteen days from 12th November to ist December, 1857, the Bank of England, with a gold reserve £8,000,000; that is, the Bank of England extended its credit to that amount, besides its renewals. bank increased its reserves day by day, while, on the other hand, the reserves had day by day been reduced when they refused to do such business. prove that the restrictive policy of banking is a curse to the community, and that an expansive policy is the only one that can save the country ? bring on crises. crisis in America, that has not been produced by the banks; and it was so with the Australian crisis in 1893. If the Bank of England was able to stop a great crisisto relieve the people of England, and start the whole industrial world-by lending £8,000,000 on a gold reserve of £358,208, does it not show that gold plays no part in the great trade and commerce of the world ? Yet honourable members are always talking about gold, gold, gold ! If the whole of the gold of the Commonwealth were to be dropped into the sea to-night, would that stop the trade and commerce of the Commonwealth ? No. merce of the Commonwealth depends on credit, and credit is founded on confidence, which is the great economic Rock of Gibraltar, upon which rests the mighty commercial and financial interests of the world. The Commercial Bank, with which the honourable member for Mernda is connected, has in its employ a number of men of great ability, who could manage such an institution as I am advocating. Do not let any one imagine that I propose that the Nationa! Bank should be conducted by untrained men, because mv idea is that we should have the best men in the business The institution would not be run by politicians; indeed, I have a horror of political financiers. I desire this bank to be a Department of the Commonwealth, and to have at its head an absolute despota real Scotchman, because we know that Scotchmen are the kings of finance in America. In any case, the Commonwealth cannot go on with the present unorganized financial system. Indeed, there is no banking system in Australia. What is a system ? It is a whole plan or scheme, consisting of many parts, so constructed, that each part is of mutual assistance to the whole, and the whole is of mutual assistance to each part. In the Australian crisis of 1893 did any"" of the sound banks come to the of only ' £358,208, lent rescue of the banks which had to close their doors? If those other banks had been partners, or had come to the In doing this the rescue, there would have been no necessity to close the doors. But for the action of Sir George Dibbs, Premier of New South Wales, in making notes legal tenDoes that not der, and thus enabling gold to be withdrawn from New South Wales; not one of the institutions would have crossed the Jordan and seen the promised land. TheI t is the banks that banks are sound, healthv and vigorous; There never has been a and I do not desire to interfere with them; but I do desire to see established some system which will regulate the movement of the money volume for the banks. There should be a credit-producing institution, which will maintain the volume of credit and a certain gold reserve to meet it, though gold, in my estimation, is not of much account. In real banks gold plays no part except in foreign exchange. Banks are only clearing-houses for producers and traders, and they clear the business by off-setting indebtedness, using very little money. We used to do The trade and combusiness to the value of millions sterling in New York, and, virtually speaking, never paid any gold out. A bank is not a financial institution in the sense of being a money repository, but is simplv a trader in debts; and it exchanges its fortified credits for the fructified indebtedness of producers and traders, in the form of mortgages, bonds, and promissory notes. When we see in the newspapers that the bank deposits have increased by so many millions, it is folly to talk about those millions being wealth. I heard one honourable member talk about the deposits in the banks representing so many sovereigns; but I tell him that there are only 24,000,000 sovereigns in Australia. Such news as I have just mentioned; simply means that the producers and traders have enlarged their indebtedness, which indebtedness has been exchanged for fortified bank credits, thus increasing the indebtedness of the banks. Every bank is in debt, and nearly everybody is in debt to the banks. All I desire is an institution where the small producer or tradesman, for instance, with his little farm or establishment, can raise credit without having to pay 8 per cent, or io per cent, in interest. No tradesman or producer, unless he has an immense business, can pay such rates, which cripple the producers and traders of Australia. cent, doubles itself in twenty-four years, at 4 per cent, in eighteen years, at 5 per cent, in fourteen years, at 6 per cent, in twelve years, at 7 per cent, in ten years, at 8 per cent, in nine years, and at 9 per cent, in eight years. A man with a little business ought to be able to raise £ 1 0 0 or £200 by overdraft, so long as he has the margin of security to make the transaction safe, without being called upon to pay exorbitant interest. do with a national question? able member does not understand these questions-the y are beyond him. for Indi has no sympathy with 'the small man ! to hear that, because I thought the honourable member for Indi was sympathetic. counts there are more small men than will be found on the list of accounts of the honourable member for Darwin. anything that is important to the progress of Australia, it is a financial institution to help the small man. the business; I cannot afford to talk. honourable member does not know anything to talk about. Is the Budget not before the 'Committee, and have we not a right to dtecuss it?

If the honourable member is not capable of discussing the Budget, he should not interfere with those who are,: though, of course, the post-offices; an institution for the small one cannot learn much about finance in the district from which he hails. present time, the poor who wish to borrow must go to the pawnshops and usurers, and pay high rates of interest. Australia owes a debt of gratitude to Sir Thomas Bent, because he had the courage to do something to prevent usury. Yet, every day unfortunates come before the Courts, asking to be relieved from the exactions, of usurers. A man may have security on which he wishes to borrow, and yet be unable to get an advance on it. There should be in Australia impartial financial institutions, prepared to advance on security, Yet money at 3 per no matter who theholder of it may be. In Tasmania, at the present time, the farmers on the north-west coast have their potatoes slightly touched with Irish blight, and this will cause the ruin of hundreds of them; because the banks will not carry them through until next year. When I last visited the district men came to me almost with tears in their eyes. The land is as productive as ever, and next year will yield good crops; but the farmers cannot get advances to tide them over until then. member think that the State could advance more 011 land than private banking companies can advance? State bank would not worry those who were unfortunate; it would wait until the next harvest. I do not know if the Minister, when in trouble, has ever been before a banker. I have, and I do not wish to repeat the experience. A few years ago, had it not been for the honourable member for Balaclava. I should not have saved my estate, though I had plenty of assets. It is because I have gone through the fire of financial damnation that I wish to arrange a scheme for the salvation of others. No man who has security should be deprived of advances when he needs money, merely because those who have money to lend do not like him. He ought to be able to say, "" There is my security,"" and to get an advance on it. I have known men who have had to sell properties for a few thousand pounds because they could not raise money on them, and others wanted them. honourable member suggest to the present system of credit? ment of a national postal banking system, which would be run by bankers through men, not for big men like the honourable At the member. a small man",22,Smith Wha T Has The And That All That Money Could Be Saved I F

At the present time, the currency in circulation in Australia amounts to about £10,500,000, of which about £3,500,000 represents the note circulation, while there is about £6,000,000 in gold, and about £1,000,000 in silver coins. Fifty men, by withdrawing £2,000,000, and putting the money into their vaults for a month, could ruin half those in business here; beciuse, by reducing the circulating medium by £2,000,000 they would cause £2,000,000 worth of debts to remain unpaid. does not take into account the gold reserves, which are the basis of the. credit of the banks. of the banks is founded on the good will of the people of Australia, who could carry on their business if there' were no gold in circulation.

The banks here have £18,000,000 of paid-up capital, and about £24,000,000 in gold, while their deposits amount to £161,000,000, leaving £137,000,000, for which there is only paper to show. dence. people of Australia would have as much confidence in a national bank as in the private institutions. They had not much faith in our banks in 1893. A national bank would never put up the sign, "" Payment suspended during reconstruction."" Surely the Prime Minister does not think that we could not find a man who could make a national bank pay. Although Great Britain is the creditor nation of the world, in 1905 the paid-up capital of the Bank of England, and of the joint stock banks of England, Scotland, and Wales, was only £70,000,000. The Bank of England is managed and controlled under as strict a sense of responsibility and patriotism as if it were a national bank. Its employees take as much pride in it as if it were a Government institution, with the King at the head of it. But, although the paid-up capital of the English banks is only £^70,000,000, they, through the leadership of the Bank of England, issue a medium of exchange equivalent to £800,000.000. The American national banks, with a paid-up capital of £i3o,ooo',ooo, issued in the same year a medium of exchange equivalent to only £530,000,000. That shows the value of organization. Give me the organization, and I shall do as much. organization would not be that of the Bank of England. cannot get any one to do it. plan is different from the plan of the Bank of England. simply to make the Commonwealth Bank the bank of banks in Australia. I want it to hold the gold reserves of the various States and the present banks. orable member wants a Bank of Australia to be in Australia what the Bank of England is in England. that, and I shall be satisfied; but I have talked to people, and I cannot get here a bank like the Bank of England, with its traditions, its honour, its responsibilities, and its love and pride of country. The American banks all look to the Bank of England as a leader. England is the creditor nation of the world, and London is the chief exchange citv of the world, through the leadership of the Bank of Epgland. Why is England the banker of the world, and why does every nation on earth pay tribute to England in the way of interest? What constitutes England the creditor nation?

126,Mr King O'malley,"No doubt;perience here in 1893. I know men who thought they were independent for life, who expected to live in the sunshine of prosperity for the remainder of their existence, but who were ruined when the private banking institutions fell from 1889 to 1893. Those banks closed up on the sum of £61,500,000 here, and they took over £17,000,000 of English money. That is what lost us our' credit in England for years. I want to introduce another system, in which the people will have absolute confidence. When a great financial crisis occurs in Australia, people distrust the great private banking corporations, because they know that certain big men in the cities must be carried. Sir JOHN honourable member's supporters? listened to me at Brisbane, they would not have put forward a per capita scheme at their Conference, and the Treasurer would not have had any fun on them now. ber advise them against a per capita scheme ? did. Under my scheme I want our financial power to be held in the Commonwealth, but the States rights men got into that Conference, and ran everything. I am afraid of eloquent men, for they can do anything. I wish to say, in conclusion, that honest finance is the life blood of a Commonwealth. An honest ballot is the breath of life of a Commonwealth, and human rights rise above State rights. States, after all, are only political conveniences. I want to give the States a good innings. ber an anti-State man? States rights man. I am a Commonwealth man. My first love is to the Commonwealth, the paramount power, and my subordinate allegiance is to the State of Tasmania. great central power. We must take no power away from it.

If we do that, we shall do what is right to all, and no wrong to anvbody. were told that this was to be a session of ['°3] finance, and the time is certainly rapidly approaching when big changes in connection with the finances of the Commonwealth will be inevitable. 'The fusion of parties was brought about, we were assured, to carry out high ideals, and I think we are justified in looking to the Government for a lead in regard to the financial question. The country expects from them a statement of their financial proposals. We were promised that some light would be thrown upon them when the Budget was presented, but I think honourable members are unanimously of opinion that the Budget was a mere interim statement which, save for the announcement that the Government propose nothing of importance. Judging by this debate the onlyfinanciersin the House are to. be found on the Opposition benches. The supporters of the Government have evidenced a disinclination to take part in the discussion, and are apparently waiting for the Government themselves to take the lead. The honourable member for Darwin has just made a most interesting contribution to the debate, and his speech will be well worthy of the attention of students of the financial question. We have good reason to complain of the Government's inaction. The Prime Minister with two of his colleagues met the Premiers of the States in a secret caucus, but we have been left in the dark as to whether or not the representatives of the Commonwealth, presented at that Conference a. full statement as to our financial outlook. The Budget is noteworthy for its omissions rather than for any statement of importance embodied in it. The situatin is so serious that I am astonished at the off-hand way in which it.is being dealt with by the Ministerial supporters. There is nothing to show that the Government have realized, much less risen to, the situation.

A hint has been given that the States are going to help the Government to finance the present year without the issue of Treasury bills by contributing £600,000 towards the cost of old-age pensions, but as yet we have had no definite assurance on the point. It is estimated that the revenue for the year will amount to £14,557,765, ancl the expenditure to £7,867,621, so that as we shall return to the States £7,691,481, there will be a deficit of £1,200,000.

132,Mr Spence (Darling) [4.40],"W ewould remind the Committee that the Government's programme includes many proposals which must involve an expenditure in the immediate future, for which the Budget does not provide. The Treasurer says that the Budget provides for the requirements of the present year; but that is not sumcient. will be put before the people at the next general election will be that of finance, and the electors will look to the Government as well as to the Opposition for statements as to how the demands on the Commonwealth can best be met. quorum. [Quorum formed.] rather under-stated than over-stated, of undertakings which must be carried out in the near future, and for which the Government have made no provision. There is first of all an expenditure of £2,000,000 on the equivalent of the offer of a Dreadnought, and that amount will not be sufficient for what must be provided under the new naval scheme. ral agreement that an expenditure of £1,000,000, in addition to thc amount that has already been provided, will be necessary to put the Postmaster-General's Department in a state of efficiency, and that we must provide £250,000 for the payment of invalid pensions. Northern Territory Acceptance Bill be agreed to, we shall have to provide for an annual deficit of £300,000 in connection with the Territory, and it is not too much to say that if the work of establishing the Federal Capital is to be pushed ahead, we shall need, in the near future, to spend £50,000 in that direction. Then again, the taking over of lighthouses will involve an expenditure of £[60,000; the appointment of a High Commissioner, £10,000; the Agricultural Bureau, £ 5 , 0 0 0; the Inter-State Commission, £5,000; and the Roval Commission to inquire into the transfer of the State debts, £2,000. total £3,932,000, which, added to the deficit of £1,200,000, gives-us a grand total of £5,132,000. That represents an immediate expenditure for which the Government have not said how they are going to provide. There are a number of other large items of expenditure in the more distant future, which will also have to be faced, more especially if we take over the Northern Territory. There will be the cost of constructing the Northern Territory railway, and the Western Australian railway, as well as the cost of postal extensions, the immigration policy, and the High Commissioner's office, and an increased provision for old-age pensions over and above what is provided in the 'reserve fund. In this way we arrive The great question that at a total expenditure of about £17,000,000, which, although not immediate, will have to be faced by the Commonwealth. The Government display extraordinary reticence in regard to their financial proposals, and when an honourable member on this side of the House dares to speak, supporters of the Ministry suggest, that he is delaying business. Since the Government themselves will not give us any information, I think it well for the Opposition to call attention to their deficiencies. I shall not deal at length with the agreement arrived at with the Premiers at the recent Conference; but there are several features of the financial problem which we shall not be able ta discuss when that agreement is before us, Then there is a geneand I therefore propose now to touch upon them. The question of the transfer of the State debts has been discussed in this Parliament over and over again. Financial schemes have been propounded by the Treasurer, the honourable member for Hume, the honourable member for Mernda, If the the honourable member for Kooyong, and the honourable member for Darwin; but no definite action has been taken. One of -the arguments advanced to induce the people of the States to adopt the Constitution BiU was that the Federation would take over the debts of the States, and, by pooling them, would effect great savings. Nothing, however, has yet been done to bring about the transfer. We do not know what took place at the Premiers' Conference. That Conference sat in secret, with the doors barred, and guards on duty outside. Even the blotting pads used by the members of the Conference, we are told, were burnt. that. the right honourable member's assurance, for I fail to understand why it should have been thought necessary to resort to such a secret method of dealing with public business. At .that Conference 'the Commonwealth Government made no arrangement for the transfer of the State debts, but on the other hand agreed to tie up the Commonwealth for 'all time.",27,Forrest Wher E Are The To Initiate A Policy Of Borrowing Contained

For the purposes ot revenue, 1 prefer direct taxation: be a quorum. [Quorum formed.] duties on narcotics and stimulants, but we ought not to depend for revenue on duties levied on goods which we are forced to import. lines the Tarirf is now practically prohibitive. I know a case in which a manufacturer from abroad found that an increase of rate from 25 to 30 per cent, had absolutely shut him out of this market, and this has occurred in other businesses, and will extend, if there is an adjustment of duties on what some honourable members opposite have termed scientific lines. Great things are expected from this Fusion Government, although we, on this side, think that its efforts will end in failure and disaster. Ministers should tell the people how they propose to obtain revenue. Do they intend to tax tea, kerosene, cotton goods, and other necessaries of the poor, or will they impose direct taxation on the big land-holders, and thus break up monopolies? A policy of drift will not inspire confidence. Perhaps they think that they can keep quiet until the new Parliament, when they expect to have a large majority, though in that they may be disappointed. But such action on their part will be inexcusable. They have conferred with the Premiers of the States, and have agreed with them to give away the powers of this Parliament, -leg-roping the Constitution. Therefore, they are bound to tell us, before the debate closes, how they intend to face the various problems which demand settlement. and our expenditure increasing. ferred Departments, like that of the Postmaster-General, and the Customs Department, are revenue-producing, but many of the other Departments which we have taken over are wholly a cause of expense, producing no revenue. By taking them over -e have increased the Commonwealth liability, and proportionately reduced that of the States. Yet the cost of government by the States has enormously increased since 1900. This condition of affairs cannot be permitted to continue, as 'it will if we agree to give to the States annuaiiv. for all time, a certain amount per head of population. Already the State Treasurers are boasting that they have got the better of the Commonwealth. I do not object to a division of the revenue on a per capita basis until the separation of thefinancesin the way to which I have referred; but, if the Government proposal is adopted, and the State Governments are successful in inducing large numbers of immigrants to come here, the Commonwealth will have to tax the people unnecessarily, to meet its In a number of obligations under this, agreement. The cost of government does not increase in ratio with the increase of population. Twenty years hence, the population of Australia will probably be much greater than it is' now. Before then a Labour Government will be in power, and in three years will do so much to make the country prosperous that plenty of people will come here. party provide for public works? while honourable members opposite do not. The Treasurer's only idea is to borrow; but no one becomes better off by going into debt. I am tired of the cry, "" Borrow to spend on reproductive works."" That policy only makes the various public services dearer. the Labour parties in the State Parliaments have always supported borrowing. may have done so, but the declared policy of the party now is averse to borrowing, except for the reduction of interest by means of conversions.

148,Mr Spence,"Money is obtainabletime, foolishly, and wrongly, returning £7,000,000 to the States, which, had there been in power any financier with a proper outlook, would have established an old age pensions fund, and provided for public works. When money is borrowed for the construction of so-called reproductive works, such as railways, the people have to pay high freights and fares to provide the necessary interest, whereas it would probably be more beneficial to them to be taxed to provide capital for construction, thus being saved borrowing charges. If there were no interest to pay, our public services could be carried on at less cost to those who use them. The Treasurer will at least admit that that would be a good thing. If it were possible to do it, the Treasurer would say it was desirable. WhatI am combating is the attitude of the Treasurer and the honourable member for Echuca, who tell us that the way to get on is to keep on borrowing money. Their idea, of success in life is to get into debt. That is a new theory to me, and we used at one time to hear a great deal of talk from honourable members like the honourable member for Echuca about exercising thrift in order to succeed. Now, apparently, they argue that the further you get into debt the better off you will be. Tbat policy, carried to its logical conclusion, would mean that Australia would get so far into debt that it would take the whole of the energies of the people, and all the revenue of the Commonwealth, to pay interest to those over the water from whom we borrowed money. I am altogether opposed to that doctrine. I do not overlook the fact that there is an exception to every rule, and that at times it may pay one to borrow and provide a sinking fund to get over a temporary difficulty. If we had our own Commonwealth, bank, and controlled our own finances, the situation would be vastly dilTerent. What any individual or community is forced to do under existing conditions would not have the same effect if circumstances were altered, in a way that they could be altered, and probably will have to be altered in the future. I object to advocating the doctrine of borrowing because it is an easy thing. There is a strong feeling in the Commonwealth in favour of putting out defenceson the very best footing; but expenditure on defence is necessarily wasteful, in the sense that there is no return from it, although we may be forced to .undertake it in order to protect our lives and liberties. We are spending an increasing amount on defence, and I believe the Australian people are willing that that should be so; but surely no one would propose to provide for defence, which cannot be called a reproductive work, out of loan money. Such a policy would be madness. What sort of a position shall we be inif we borrow the £17,000,000 that I have indicated as_ being required for works which the Government have foreshadowed, in addition to the other £5,000,000? What will happen if we keep on in the way the States are going, and if the Commonwealth also becomes a borrower as indicated, I will admit not by the Government, but certainly by the Treasurer as his own personal view_, although he did speak for the. Cabinet when he proposed to issue Treasury bills for £1,200,000? Australia is drifting into a most dangerous financial system by this doctrine of being able to get millions easily by floating loans. It has already led to extravagance and waste, and if we are so unfortunate as to be involved in war, where shall we find ourselves? We should drift into such a state of insolvency as to be absolutely financially ruined. War now is a matter of finance, and the nation with the money is the nation that wins. Where shall we get the money to pay for war if we go on pledging our credit for everyday works? The Treasurer asks how we are to build railways without borrowing, but we are not bound to build railways at the rate that the States have been doing. I admit that in Western Australia, in exceptional circumstances, such as the necessities of the people on the big gold-fields, it was essen-' tial to build railways; but will any one say that this small garden State of Victoria had to build railways at such a rate and pull the rails up afterwards'? One has only to walk around the suburbs of Melbourne to see lines of railway rusting and rotting. Would all those railways have been built if the State Government had had to .tax the people to find the money for them? No less than £3,500,000 was spent to build a railway that does not pay, in the Western District through the land of forty private owners, at the expense of the rest of the community. The rest of the people have to provide interest on the' money sunk in that undertaking. Is that good business ? Yet that is. the sort of thing that has been done in Australia with' borrowed money. The system of borrowing easily .means inefficient and bad government. It means incompetence in government, and has imposed an enormous so ,far-the n the payment of 125s. per burden on the people of Australia. Whilst head of the population to the States will the railways of Australia as a whole are simply mean taxing the people unnecesyielding a return of over 4 per cent., that sarily, and must lead to extravagance. does not necessarily prove that it is wise to borrow money to build railways. It is far have something to say. to it? wiser to build them without borrowing if you can do so.

Certain States may see a possible benefit ahead for themselves, and so be induced to vote from a narrow provincial stand-point for something that may be against the future welfare of the Commonwealth, and that probably will necessitate a big constitutional fight in the future to have it altered. I did not want to deal with the question of the Premiers' Conference agreement at any length at this stage, but it is so involved with the finances that we are entitled to a plain statement from the Government of their own views with regard to the matters that we have brought forward. I see no necessity for an amendment of the Constitution. This Parliament has power to do what is necessary by a simple measure. So far as I can judge fhe feeling of honourable members, I believe there would be no difficulty in securing parliamentary sanction to a vote to the States, say, on the basis arrived at at the Premiers' Conference, which is very similar to what was discussed at the Brisbane Labour Conference. But in passing a Bill of that sort, we would not, and could not, pledge the next Parliament. Sir member's leader said the amount which we propose to pay to the States is too much. the Customs, and Excise revenue is decreasing, and the Treasurer, in those circumstances, should pay a decreasing, and not an increasing amount to the States. Whenever the Labour party have raised the question of direct taxation they have always been told that it must be left tb the States. That was the advice tendered to us by Sir Edmund Barton when he was Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, and it was endorsed by the present Prime Minister. We were told that we should leave direct taxation to the States, and that the Commonwealth should retain its control of the Customs and Excise Departments. If there is anything in the contention, there can be no justification for fixing an amount to be returned to the States for all time. Treasurer needs only to be able to forecast his revenue for three years, or, in other words, for the life of the Parliament. Each of the Parliaments of the Commonwealth could fix the amount to be returned to the States during its life. That would be a more flexible arrangement, and would be more in the interests of the States than any hard and fast agreement. whole financial question open. monwealth has treated the States very liberally, and I regret that the right honourable member for East Sydney, in a letter which he addressed to the President of the Conference, chose to speak of the Commonwealth as if it were an opponent of the States. Every member of this Parliament is pledged to study the interests of the Commonwealth, and we must have regard to the well being of the people of all the States. I disapprove of a scheme that would involve unnecessary taxation, so far as the Commonwealth itself is concernedtaxation which must either be direct or imposed on necessaries of life which we do not, and are not,' likely to produce foi some time. I shall not deal at this stage, with the question of industrial legislation; I have touched only upon those questions which, in my opinion, demand attention in connection with the financial situation. The situation is not an easy one for any Treasurer to face, but 1 should like more evidence than we have that the Government, JOHN FORREST -The honourable and particularly the Treasurer, have realized the tremendous responsibilities which they have undertaken. I am heartily in favour of the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth, but that. transfer will involve very considerable expenditure. If the Government propose to finance their undertakings by resorting to borrowing we shall have a seventh Australian borrower entering the money market, and the long promised transfer of the debts to the States \>ill be practically set aside. These are important phases of the question which must be faced, and the people ought not to be left in the dark in regard to them until the next general election. It. is not creditable to the Government 'that they have failed to take steps to secure the transfer of the debts of the States, and I should like to know why they have not done so, more especially as it would pave the way to the policy of borrowing, of which, apparently, they are At the most, a State in favour. The adoption of such a policy will influence the votes of some honourable members in regard to the transfer of certain services from the States to the Commonwealth. I , for one, strongly object to a system under which the Commonwealth Parliament is placed in the unpleasant",32,Forrest Wher E Are The To Initiate A Policy Of Borrowing Contained

163,Mr Spence,"I think not. The Composition of having to impose taxation, while the States have the satisfaction of spending a large proportion of the revenue so obtained. In many cases they have been guilty of extravagance, and have not attempted to do away with services that are admittedly unnecessary. done so. generally speaking, all the States have neglected to curtail their expenditure. Thc present Government have in their hands the key to the situation. As long as we retained control of the finances, the States Governments would be forced to curtail expenditure, and that would be a good thing for the people. The workers and producers have to bear the chief burden of taxation whether it be imposed by the Commonwealth or the States, and we have no right to part with a' lever that we can use to force on the States better management of Public Departments. Our Public Departments are as well managed as we can insure, and no money is wasted in connection with them. We should force the States to give up the extravagances of which some, at least, of them are guilty. I am strongly opposed to an extension of the present binding contract; but 1 have nothing to say as to the amount proposed to be returned to the States, pending a general settlement of the financial problem, including, I hope, that of the transfer of the debts. I trust that the Government will note our request and make a frank and full statement of their view of the financial stances. The Department was one to which outlook. knowledge that we shall have an opportunity later to discuss the general questions offinance,which the Budget involves, has, no doubt, led to the curtailment of the present debate, for honourable members recognise the inadvisableness of having two debates on the same subject. I agree with the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, that the Budget is a fair one, having regard to the peculiar circumstances in which the Government are placed. The Treasurer acted wisely in proposing that, failing an arrangement with the States, the Government should be enabled, by the issue of short-dated Treasury bills, to meet their obligations in respect to old-age pensions, and other expenditure, without raising the general question of borthose sources in this State, was carefully rowing. The right honourable gentleman is practically in the position of a man who, having a large sum of money, falling due two years hence, and desiring to use portion of it at the present time, borrows from his bankers what he needs until his own money comes in. Unless some arrangement be made with the States, the Treasurer will be in a position in 1911 to pay back the money he has borrowed to provide for the services of the current year Budget as it stands, and in it the Treasurer has not raised any question of taxation. He has simply said, in effect, that, pending an arrangement with the States, he proposes to issue short-dated Treasury bills. The inference is that he will meet those bills out of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue at present returnable to the States, unless a definite agreement be arrived at with them. My main object in rising, however, was to deaf with one Department, which opens up questions of general finance that can best be discussed during the consideration of the Budget. I refer to the Telephone Branch of the Postmaster-General's Department. We are all agreed that it is not in a satisfactory condition. We have been told that it does not pay; but we have always experienced difficulty in ascertaining whether or not that is so. Large increases in rates have been proposed by different Ministers, but they have been framed on the basis, not of cost, but of the charges in N;ew York, Vienna, Paris, or some other city, without reference to our particular circumI gave considerable attention when I wab. a member of the Parliament of Victoria. For years I agitated that a statement of the income and expenditure of each branch should be prepared in order that we might know at once whether any. service was or was not paying. I urged that the expenditure of the Department should not be so wrapped up as to make it impossible for any one to say whether any of the branches of the Department are in a non-payable condition. As the result, partly of my efforts in the last years of the control of the Department by the States, certain returns were furnished in Victoria. I have looked up a statement for the three years 1898, 1899, and 1900, in which the expenditure on telephones, telegraph and post offices, as well as the income derived from set out. I brought it under the attention of the Postmaster-General, and inquired",33,Forrest Wher E Are The To Initiate A Policy Of Borrowing Contained

168,Mr Harper,"I am dealing with thewhether the Department had continued to keep this account. The honourable gentleman made inquiries, and found that such an account was still kept, and covered the period from 1887 to the present time. For the first three years the report was printed; but, since then, it has not been available in the public papers; but through the courtesy of the Postmaster-General, I have received a copy, which shows results truly remarkable. Since the year 1887, when the Victorian Government took over the telephones from a private company, the receipts have been £1,276,634, and the total expenditure, including cost of operation, maintenance, establishment, new works and appliances, has been £1,458,875, showing that, for the twenty-two years, the gross expenditure has exceeded the gross receipts by only £182,241. The total expenditure on telephone exchanges, works, and trunk linesthat is, the creation of the plant-ha s been £871,191, of which £361,540 has been expended during the last three or four years on extensive tunnels that are, of course, of a permanent character. Even in the face of that expenditure, the total the Treasury is out of pocket over the twenty-two years, is only £[182,241. clude the purchase money ? £[40,000 paid to the private company, the only asset of which really was a station in Wills-street, worth about £7,000. The money paid over to the company was practically for good-will, seeing that the plant and telephones were mostly worn out or obsolete, and that the first work of the Victorian Government was to reinstate the whole. When the Committee on the transferred properties inquired into the value of this plant in 1901, they placed it at £""83,751, which I regard as very low. There was not included, in that valuation buildings, stores, tools, and so forth, worth about £36,249; so,that, in 1901, the undertaking, with the buildings, was worth £120,000. At the present time, the plant is worth £500,000; so that the working of the Department over this period shows practically that the system paid from the start; that it has been created out of its own funds, and, taking the value of the plant into consideration, is £330,000 to the good, after deducting £391,000 for depreciation. I suppose that, under our parliamentary system, it is necessary that each Department should pay all its income into the Treasury, and then draw all its expenditure out of the Treasury. tem. a bad system; but it requires 10 be supplemented by another, under, which the money each year ought to be allocated, so much for current expenditure, so much for plant, and so forth. There ought to be a plant account in each Department, and additions made and depreciations written off year by year, as part of the expenditure. . In that way, people and Parliament would know whether a Department was being administered at a loss or a profit. It is no reflection on the present Postmaster-General, who has ;iust come into office, that I should call attention to these matters, although they show clearly that the Department is not in the position it ought to be in. A trading Department of this kind, which has made a clear profit of £14,000 a year over the period I have mentioned, ought not to be hampered; and, notwithstanding what has been said to-night in regard to a loan policy, I point out that, if this undertaking were in the hands of a company, or of a private individual, and extensions were required, there would not be the slightest hesitation in borrowing £300,000 or £500,000 to complete the plant, so that the business might l^e conducted in the proper way, arrangements being made, by means of a sinking fund, to repay the whole out of the current expenditure in twentyyears. That would be a sound principle, and sound business; because, if we undertake to do certain service for the public, and to charge them for it, the equipment must be complete and up-to-date. If such accounts as I have dealt with are kept in Victoria, are they kept in the other States? If not, why should not instant orders be given to have them kept ? One of the great causes of failure in our present system is the absence of clear-headed accountancy, which would lay down principles on which a proper analysis of the transactions of every post-office throughout Australia could be systematized, so as to make it possible to show so closely as to amount to actuality, which is paying and which is not. This great public service has to be extended almost indefinitely in order to follow population ; and if we found that we were halfa-million short, Parliament, and the whole of the taxpayers, would know that it had been spent for the benefit of the",34,Forrest Wher E Are The To Initiate A Policy Of Borrowing Contained

172,Mr Harper,"I do not say that it iscommunity. It is not fair, in the case of the telephones, for instance, to raise the rates charged to the public by 150 per cent., on the ground that the Department is not paying, though the fault does not lie with the telephones, but with other arrangements which are necessary in connection with the administration. This is a matter of first class importance, and I understand that the Government have appointed accountants to make inquiries. tants ? been appointed, is a public accountant. There must be men in the Department, if they are encouraged, and the business is systematized, to enable all that is necessary to be done so as to secure future satisfactory management. I think it desirable to make these remarks, because they apply to nearly every Department, whether State or Commonwealth. If a system of accountancy were introduced, and made to work in with the parliamentary system,, as could easily be done, the Department ought to be able to place on the table a balance sheet showing the money received and expended, the assets, and so forth. I thank the Postmaster-General, for his courtesy in forwarding me the information I have used, and I trust that what I have said will not be misunderstood by him. I.f these matters receive immediate attention, they will dispose of the outcry made at the instance of some of the technical men of the Department, who, instead of looking into the matter and seeing really what the telephone system costs, propose to add enormously to the burden of those who use the service. sire to make a protest, rather than a speech. I do not think that the Government are treating us quite fairly in endeavouring to force a discussion of the Budget while other highly important, perhaps more important, matters, vitally affecting the convernment proposes to commence de novo, by sideration of the Budget, are kept in abeyance. I fail to see why we. cannot have the results of the Premiers' Conference placed before us, so that we may, to some extent, modify, or strengthen our attitude towards the Budget. The borrowing proposals are, to my mind, the chief obstacle now in the discussion of the Budget. As I understand, if we accept the Budget as it stands, we virtually, endorse the Treasurer's intention to borrow, whereas, if the arrangement with the States is carried out, there will be no need to borrow; and I desire to know exactly the position. I realize that there must be borrowing sooner or later; I amnot one who thinks that we can go on for ever without borrowing for reproductive works. But there is no need to borrow until we have assumed our national responsibilities. Until we know the result of the Premiers' Conference, we shall not know what responsibilities we are being asked .to assume. I suggest to the Treasurer that it would be advisable to postpone the further consideration of the item now before the Committee, and to proceed with the following items. first item before going further. course. We have not been able to discuss the Budget as we should discuss it, because it was delivered prior to the Premiers' Conference, which has altered the whole position. the Estimates have ever been proceeded with before the first item was passed.

I accept the assurance of the Prime Minister that the Bill dealing with the ""finance agreement will be introduced next week, but would point out to him that it will be for the Speaker to decide what matters may, and what may not, be discussed in connection with it. In dealing with a Bill, it is not permissible to go beyond the order of leave, and I cannot conceive of a measure in connection with which we could discuss all the matters which are now open for discussion. The introduction of the Estimates provides the great annual opportunity for the discussion of Government policy and administration in all its phases. We should be only too ready to discontinue this discussion now with a view to its resumption when the Bill came before us, if we knew that the Speaker would cive us the opportunity then to discuss all those matters that can be discussed in the Budget debate.

What, then, is to be gained by postponing it? carry out the agreement entered into before the dinner adjournment by the Prime Minister and the-acting Leader of the Opposition, and to proceed with the Estimates for the House of Representatives on the understanding that after they are passed we shall proceed with other business. As there was a disinclination on the part of honourable members to continue the discussion of the Budget, under the changed conditions which have arisen since the Premiers' Conference agreement, it was suggested by me before the dinner adjournment that that discussion should be postponed. The Prime Minister and Treasurer at first would not agree to that; but the Prime Minister afterwards did agree. No useful purpose can be served by obiecting to it now. I take it that the Committee is Ml powerful, and may do what it pleases in the matter providing that no honourable member objects to .'the proposal.

I object to the Treasurer's proposal to obtain £1,200,000 by the issue of short-dated Treasury bills, and am strongly opposed to voting for any item until we know how it is to be provided for.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE out to the Treasurer that we did not attempt to deal with tlie Estimates last year until the Tariff had been disposed of. We passed the Works and Buildings Estimates, but the general Estimates remained untouched for many months. On that occasion, we did what was required under the Constitution, and did not, as. the Government now propose, violate all rules of procedure by inviting the Committee to vote blindly before the question of Ways and Means had been discussed. to pass any item of the Estimates until we know how the Government intend to provide for it. one of the daily newspapers, the Prime Minister refused vesterdav to say definitely whether or not the proposed issue of Treasury bills would be proceeded with. the circumstances, therefore, it would seem almost certain that the Government will persist in that proposal, despite the arrangement that has been made with the Premiers of the States. I do not raise this objection in a captious spirit, but I really have I would not not had time to examine the whole of the Estimates. It seems to me that the Treasurer should either remodel his Budget, or submit a new statement clearly intimating the intentions of the Government. Various statements have been made as to the agreement arrived at with the Premiers of the States, but we have no definite information on the subject.

243,Sir William Lyne,"Should I not?an opportunity will not be presented. I may say, however, that there are some totals in the Budget that fairly astonish me; but, without the help of the Treasury officials, it is difficult for a layman to pick up the various points as presented in the Budget papers. I sball now leave the matter in the hands of the Leader of the Opposition or his deputy, contenting myself with the protest I have uttered. If it be desired lo pass these items, all I can do in the future is to refer to what I have said tc -night, feeling confident that the time will come when I shall be proved to te right. rise, not to discuss the Budget at length, but to express my profound regret that my Chesterfieldian friend, the ex-Minister for manners and customs, should have at last, after all the weeks of discussion, sought to prevent the Government doing the very -thing they have teen implored to do-pro ceed beyond the Budget, and undertake what has been called ""something serious"" in the conduct of the country's business. financial proposals? are the proposals tofinancethe great public Departments so as to carry on the services of the country. All that the Committee are asked to do to-night, and all that the Leader of the Opposition-wh o is the leader of the honourable member for Hume -ha s agreed to do is to proceed at once with 'the. Estimates, and so try to deal with that side, at any rate, of the public finances. But the honourable member for Hume has raised a protest; and, as in all his actions, he has conferred an obligation on the Committee. For even the honourable gentleman has shown that he realizes that some form of borrowing may on occasions of urgency te desirable; though personally I sincerely hope it will be a ""long time before it is necessary for the Commonwealth to resort to such a policy. Nobody could have surprised this Committee more. I think, than the honourable member for Hume, when he told us that, while he is against borrowing-whic h is a frank way of taking money one has to repay-h e was in favour of an overdraft, which, I presume, as contrasted with the ordinary .borrowing process, means a loan that he never intended to rfeDay. I am surprised that the honourable member for Hume shouid desire to borrow, because he apparently wishes to pose before the people as a new tribune, standing between the extremists of the direct Opposition, and those who, he says, are to be found on the Government side, the defender of the liberties, and the executor of the common sense, of the community! Having entered what he calls his protest, I hope he will permit the consideration of the Estimates to be proceeded with. The Government has undertaken to allow the Budget discussion to be continued on a future day, when it can be resumed with a knowledge of the arrangements entered into with the Premiers. It would be useless to have two Budget discussions. Government is happy in not being faced with an Opposition like that which for years sat on these benches, which would never have accepted so unprecedented a proposal as that now before us. What is behind this movement? Is some game afoot? What reason is thsre for this desire to run the Estimates through? Is there no other business whicb could be proceeded with? What about the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill? Does the Government intend to dispose of the Estimates, apply the cloture to the measure ratifying the agreement with the Premiers, and then prorogue Parliament? From all parts of the Chamber have come protests against proceeding further with the Budget discussion until the arrangements with the Premiers have been made known. The Budget discussion should, in the first instance, have been postponed until the Government was ready to give honourable members an opportunity to discuss those arrangements. I am prepared to carry out the agreement made with the Government by the honourable member for West Sydney, but I would point out to the honourable member for Wentworth, who spoke of the honourable member for Hume as following his leader, that it was this honourable member who objected to the first item being taken. It is remarkable that no one from the Government side of the Chamber has yet spoken on the Budget. The Ministerial supporters seem to be afraid to say anything lest they may display their opposition to the Treasurer's proposals.

It is most extraordinary that a Treasurer of the Commonwealth should practically try to bludgeon the Committee into agreeing with his methods. The Government first bring down a piecemeal Budget, submitting half and half proposals, and then, before we have got over our surprise, they adjourn Parliament, ""and attend a Premiers' Conference. A deliberate change of policy is agreed upon there, but when we come back to the House, and demand that that change of ""policy shall be submitted to us before we shoulder the responsibility of passing the Estimates, we are met by an absolute refusal on the part of the Treasurer to give us any information regarding the Government's change of front.

Motion agreed to; division postponed. Division2 (House of Representatives), notice that these Estimates perpetuate thc practice to which attention was called by me some years ago-namely , the payment to Mr Speaker of his salary as Speaker after the dissolution of Parliament. In again directing attention to the matter, it may be necessary to add that I do so without any personal feeling towards the occupant of the Chair. This item raises a constitutional issue which should be considered and dealt with apart from individuals. The Committee scarcely realizes, apparently, what is being done in this instance. Authority is given for the payment to the Speaker of his salary when he is no longer Speaker of this House, nor even a member of it. I refer honourable members to the Estimates, where they will see this famous footnote If returned again to Parliament the salary before he has been elected to that office.

Now, Possibly the Committee should refuse to vote away money by these ingenious innovations of footnotes. The object of all this is to place the Speaker, as regards salary, in the same position as the President of the Senate. But as we are unable to give ordinary members of this House the advantage which senators possess in continuity of salarv over a dissolution, we have no right to put the Speaker in a better position than any other member. apply to the Chairman of Committees ?

However, the increments have been fixed by the President and Speaker, and have not been challenged. The Serjeant-atArms reaches his maximum salary this year, and can receive no further increments; and the other officers' increments will go on until they reach the maximum of their class, just as if they were members of the general service. to show in the Estimates the class and the maximum salary of each officer, as in the case of other public servants? given only in some cases. mendation for the increments? case of the Senate, and the Speaker here, and both in the case of joint officers. looks at the Estimates, he will see that the grade is shown of every officer in the general service. cases. The officers here are not classified in fhe same manner, because, I presume, the. classes would be too small, consisting of only two or three persons. connection I should like to ask a question regarding the most important of the staffs of the House, namely, the Hansard staff, who make our speeches for us. An extra allowance is given to the Serjeant-at-Arms in the case of Committees or Commissions, and I understand that the members of the Hansard staff, in addition to their onerous and responsible duties in the chamber, are also employed in the reporting of Commissions and Select Committees, and. if bonuses and increments are given to those in the clerical branch of our establishment, the reporters should be similarly treated. The eight parliamentary reporters have not received an increment since the staff was formed, though, undoubtedly, they have more to do than the Serjeant-at-Arms, notwithstanding that he performs his work well, and has other duties besides attending in this Chamber while the House is sitting. If the control of these Departments is wholly in the hands of the President and Mr Speaker, we should know on what principles they act. Parliament, in passing the Public Service Act, was strongly of the opinion that it should retain control of its officers and servants. I should like to know how Mr Speaker has acted in regard to the granting of bonuses and increments to the officers of the clerical staff; whether he has been guided by reports and recommendations, or has made grants in the exercise of his own sweet will. Some time ago a report was obtained from an expert connected with the Fire Brigades Department, as to the best means of preventing an outbreak of fire in this building, but it has not been acted on. The late Speaker frequently slept on the premises, and had a fire broken out in any of the rooms connected with the Library, his escape would have been impossible. The fire brigade received a call to this building a few days ago, and it was with the greatest difficulty that the caretaker was found. The extinguishing appliances on the premises are never inspected, and the arrangements for preventing fire are not what they should be. I strongly recommend that more attention be paid to the matter. of £ 1 15 is provided this year to pay the expenses of witnesses and the travelling expenses of clerks and shorthand writers connected with Select Committees. I thought that these expenses were paid out of thc vote for Royal Commissions. Commissions are paid out of the vote to which the honourable member refers.

Whatever may be the arrangements as to increments applying to the parliamentary Departments, they do not seem to work"" equally as they affect the clerical and reporting staffs, and we should be told definitely what they are. I wish to know whether any of the eight parliamentary reporters have reached the maximum salary of their class ? If not, why is there no recommendation as to increments? The giving of increments should be automatic in this, as it appears to be in other parliamentary Departments, and should not depend oh the action of any officer, unless in conformity with some rule or regulation. ister) [9.34] -The officers referred to were appointed at fixed salaries. Last year, the Principal Parliamentary Reporter was given an increase of £ 5 0 , and the Second Reporter an increase of £ 2 5 . The late Speaker thought that the timehad arrived when the salaries of the eight reporters should also be reviewed, and he left certain recommendations, which are being considered. The Parliamentary Reporting Staff serves the Senate and House of Representatives, and is, therefore, under the joint control of the President and Mr they have gained in working in the DeSpeaker. officers have recommended increases. so, but the recommendation has not yet reached me. tion has been made, can effect be given to it this vear? Mr 'DEAKIN -That can easily be arranged. A number of sessional typists are employed at £4. ios. a week; but I understand that the President and the late Speaker were in consultation as to the advisability of making the appointments permanent. The present arrangement is unsatisfactory. It is imperative that men of first-class abilities shall be engaged for the work, and those who are employed improve by their acquaintance with the needs of the reporters, and the forms of the House. To turn them off at the end of each session is to treat them unfairly, because, while employed here, they lose the run of outside work. If all of them found engagements with private firms, and a wholly new staff had to be engaged at the beginning of any session, the reporting staff would be seriously inconvenienced. Whether the remuneration for permanent employment should be smaller than that now given is a matter for consideration, but undoubtedly the typists are as much entitled to permanent employment as is the reporting staff. I understand that the late Speaker recommended their permanent employment, and that all that remained .to be undertaken was the settlement of some details. The Committee should be told what has been arranged. ter) [9.38] -No definite recommendation has been made. . Whenever possible, the sessional typists, during recess, should be given priority of employment in the Departments of the Public Service and in connection with the work of Royal Commissions. No permanent arrangement has been come to, because of the difficulty of finding occupation for them during the sometimes long periods when Parliament is not meeting. The remuneration paid to the sessional typists has been fixed at a rather high rate, in recognition of the fact that the employment, is only sessional; but it is admitted that they are at a disadvantage, and that the proficiency which partment makes them more valuable than new appointees would be. There is every desire to make these appointments permament, but the difficulty is to find occupation for the men during recess.

So far as I am aware, Mr Petherick has placed the whole of his collection absolutely at the disposal of the Commonwealth. If that is so, this would seem to be a suitable opportunity for having the facts set out in an authoritative way, so that both parties shall understand the terms of the bargain. I am glad that the Government or the Library Committee have taken action to secure this collection. We should haye suffered an incalculable loss had that collection been allowed to bz dissipated or to get into the hands of a private individual, and on that account there is reason for a good deal of congratulation to the Committee and the Parliament on having secured it.

I shall be glad if the Prime Minister will tell us exactly, what the terms of the arrangement are. ister) [9.42] -This is one of the melancholy reminders of the devoted manner in which the late Speaker interested himself in everything that concerned the Library. The negotiations for the acquisition of the collection, which had gone on for four or five years, and in which a number of us took part, were finally brought to a successful issue by the persistence^ with which the late Sir Frederick Holder devoted himself to the matter. This Government during its recess took the responsibility of making the necessary advances to enable this very valuable heritage to be secured. are now being engrossed, and the document will be seen during the next two or three days. Petherick as a gift to this Parliament the whole of his collection. The salary which appears opposite to his nams is not a return for that gift, but a recompense for his services. I concur with the honourable member's expression of appreciation of the value of the acquisition, and share his desire that it may be the nucleus of what I hope will be the best collection of the memorials of early Australia to be found anywhere. If the Library Committee could see their way to choose some suitable man to be properly trained in this particular branch, it would be a judicious step to take, and I ' shall have pleasure in bringingthat recommendation before them. In a few days the House will be able to see the deed of gift and all its terms.

The Committee is alive to the desire of honourable members that the Petherick collection should be placed where it can be seen, and the basement is being fitted up for its reception. Owing to many of the books in that collection being very rare and exceedingly valuable, they must not be put where any one can handle them. I have only to add that the price which book-sellers ask for the supply of 6s. novels on loan to the Library would astonish honourable members; and that we think we should not be justified in paying it. pleased to hear from the honourable member for Darling, who is the only member of the Library Committee on this side of the House, and he is the only member of that Committee present, that it is intended to place the Petherick collection where it may be seen. It would be well if it could be arranged to display at least a portion of the collection in the Queen's Hall. They would be safer there than in the basement, where proper supervision cannot be exercised over them. One may wander practically all over the basement without meeting with an officer of the House. There are many rare and valuable works in the Library, such as Gould's Birds of Australia, which I do not think 5 per cent, of the visitors to the Library ever see. They are locked up in a case, and all that the average visitor sees is an excelnot available elsewhere. lent specimen of bookbinding. Unless an honourable member takes the trouble to secure the key of the bookcase from the officer in charge, those whom he is showing over the Library have no opportunity to examine them. there should be free access to them. able member, but at the same time think that such works should be reasonably accessible. I met an honourable member showing some relatives over the House who did not know that Gould's works were in the Library, until I brought them under his notice, and it is quite possible that many other honourable members have never seen them. These and other rare works have 1 been acquired for the use of the people, and arrangements should be made for them to be on view in the Queen's Hall. Yarra ought to be thoroughly, discussed. member cannot help snarling as soon as one rises to speak. member is insulting as usual. Chairman, that you would remind <the Minister of Defence that it is disorderly to interject. It is certainly time that he realized the position that he holds. I have heard for the first time to-night an explanation of the reason why the novels obtainable in the Library are for the most part worthless. I have-taken book after book from the fiction table, and, although I .enjoy a good novel, have been unable in most cases to read more than half-a-dozen pages. There are people who will read novels, and if they cannot get good ones will read bad ones. The present system of obtaining books for the fiction table ought to be abolished. I do not agree with the honor-, able member for Y'arra that rare and valuable works, which cannot be replaced, should not be kept under lock and key. they should be more accessible than they are at present. Many of them are stowed away in the vaults. greatest pleasures to take visitors to see these magnificent works, because they are I am satisfied with the explanation that the novels are bad because they are cheap, and, therefore, they had better' be done away with. raise my voice against making some of the treasures we have in the Library, and of which we are proud, too easily accessible to the general public. I do not desire that they should be confined to a few people, or locked up; but if we make them too public, some of them may be destroyed, and there are amongst them documents and literary treasures which it would be absolutely impossible to replace. I am glad, for instance, that Gould's Birds of Australia, is kept under lock and key,",52,Estimates

400,Mr Bowden (Nepean) [10.10],"Ibecause such works should be only made available on the authority of honourable members to persons who are interested. I congratulate the Government on having secured the Petherick collection, for which not only we. but those who come after us, will feel a great debt of gratitude. The Library Committee are doing good work in collecting this Australiana, and, if it is to be open to the public, we ought, in all cases possible, to secure duplicates. Indeed, one of the reasons I am glad we have secured this collection is that it gives us duplicates of many works already in the Library, so that one set may be kept on record, while the other is open to inspection. I suggest that we might secure more duplicates from the New South Wales Government, who, owing to the presentation of the Mitchell library, might be willing to dispose of copies already in their possession. The Mitchell library, under the terms of the gift, must be kept intact; but I think that, if my suggestion were acted upon, we might add very considerably to the value of bur present collection from those of the New South Wales Government. I am not in favour of abolishing fiction from the Library, because I have, and always have had, a very lively faith in light literature. I have good ground for that faith, because I find'that in the case of ninety-nine out of a hundred readers, light fiction is their only literature. At any rate, I know that I read nine novels _ for any other book I even look . at. I emphatically protest, however, against the abominable rubbish that is placed on the table, though I decline to admit that all novels should be banned because some are unreadable. There are some people incapable of reading anything beyond literature of the Tit Bits variety; but, for persons who are capable of being interested in a novel, and whose brains get normal exercise in more serious pursuits, the lighter form of recreation may be taken with ad: vantage; and I offer a humble plea for decent fiction. But we get fiction in the Library that is simply unendurable. It is the absolute refuse of light literature, or, perhaps, I might more correctlv say, light not-literature. This perhaps is because the Librarian is a man who regards light literature with a certain amount of loftv contempt, and to whom all novels are sealed books. Anything more trifling than a treatise on metaphysics or the higher mathematics or some profound effort in philosophy, he despises; but for us poor grovelling creatures, ' .who are unable to feed or fatten on such diet, there must be something lighter. I cheerfully support the honourable member for Hindmarsh in his proposal to abolish all fiction if we cannot get any better than at present. I am sure, however, that we can get better books; and I hope the Library Committee will take some action. The arrangement with Mullen's is quite unsatisfactory; I feel sure that the firm unload those books on the Librarian in exactly the same way as it would be perfectly safe to unload scientific works on some honourable members. The difficulty has arisen largely because the conductors of the circulating library, from which we get our books of fiction really do not know what we require. ways discover rubbish to send? amount of rubbish written; and I am sure honourable members would find it very hard to get through one volume out of ten of current fiction. I suggest that the Library Committee might appoint sub-committees to select books. For light reading for ourselves in the train, when we are trying to get away from the cares of public life and the worries of economics, nothing is, some may think, better than a sporting novel; and if the honourable member for Maribyrnong were appointed to select the books, we might be sure of getting something readable and authoritative. In the same way, if we desire books on current philosophy-book s of fiction, certainly-who m better could we choose to select our books than the honourable member for Hume. [10.25] -Both the honourable member for West Sydney and the honourable member for Wentworth seem to be under a misapprehension as to my attitude in regard to novels-. As I said before, I am very fond of a good novel; and it is to the class of books which are obtained that I objectThose honourable members, too, are not exactly fair to the contractors. As the honourable member for Darling pointed out, we do not get the best books, because we do not pay the best price, and it is only possible to send us the rubbish. If we cannot get good books, do not let us waste the money oh bad ones.",53,Estimates

One can readily understand that the foreman gardener and his staff are not of the type that pester Committees, or even venture to approach them, but I hope that they are not to be overlooked on that account, and I would suggest to the Committee that something be done for them. [10.42] I mentioned the question of the salary of the head gardener before. I think he is badly treated, for I understand that since he has been under the Commonwealth he has actually had his annual holidays curtailed as compared with what he used to get under the State Government. He should not be in any worse position under the Commonwealth. I understand that he is one of the State officers temporarily lent to the Commonwealth. He seems to be a great enthusiast in his work, and after the years that he has served here he ought to have got more consideration. We ought to treat these men more fairly, especially if we can afford to give increments to higher officers. I notice that when officers receiving large salaries are called upon to do extra work in connection with Royal Commissions, they also get honorariums, but there are no honorariums for other officers doing similar work, or for the poor gardeners. I have no objection to those officers getting honorariums for extra work, but we should have a little more consideration for those lower down in the salary list. gardeners time after time. I do not think there are sufficient men there to keep the gardens in proper order. fixed by the agreement with the State, bulbs in the beds that do not flower, because they have not been lifted for the last six or seven years. There is no time for the men to do the work. Apparently it is never the turn of these gardeners to get increments.

I certainly think that consideration should be given to them in the matter of increments. I make no special claim on behalf of the head gardener, but am decidedly of opinion that the three gardeners are entitled to more consideration than they receive. The condition of the gardens reflects the greatest (Hindmarsh) credit on the officers engaged there; although the sum provided for contingencies, £50, is wholly insufficient. Not many novelties in the gardening line could be purchased fox that sum. I doubt whether any new varieties of roses or bulbs have been purchased for the gardens during the past ten years.

I remind the House that a very important gathering takes place in Melbourne to-morrow. custom for this House to adjourn on account of the Royal Agricultural Society's Show; but, although it is true that many honourable members can make arrangements to be present, it has to be remembered that the officers of the House and the members of the press are unable to attend if the House sits as usual. Hundreds of thousands of people from all parts of this State will attend the show .tomorrow. to ask that the House shall not meet until after the usual evening refreshment hour. I am sure that if we were sitting in Sydney, and an equally important function was being held there, no objection would be made to such a course being pursued. If we did not meet until 7.45 p.m. to-morrow honourable members would return to their parliamentary duties better informed, and in an improved spirit, and I am satisfied that we should do much more work than if we sat during the afternoon. -Honorabl e members opposite havefrequently complained about wasting time, but we are now asked by a supporter of the Government to waste a portion of to-morrow's sitting. tant functions that takes place in South Australia is occurring to-day, yet every single South Australian representative is present here attending to his duties -ference. able member does not place the Eight Hours Demonstration in Adelaide in the same category with our show ?
