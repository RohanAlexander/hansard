The provision to utilise both the physical and the regrettable fact today is that it is not there. human resources available in that particular unit. What is worse, it is going fast. The real issue is somewhat more fundamental One of the reasons why the Army Reserve than that because there is a real weakness in has fallen on such hard days in recent years is this Government's proposal. The weakness lies the nonsensical and narrow minded approach in the fact that the Government seems to ignore taken by the Government on the question of the current reorganisation of both the Regular taxing the very minimal incomes of men and Army and the Reserve Army-a reorganisation women who are prepared to give significant which has as its very base the need to include in periods of their time in the service of the defence Regular Army units a significant component of of Australia. Fortunately, late last year the Govour Army Reserve. That means simply that, if ernment retracted its earlier decision and reservwe are talking about the Regular Army field ists are now once again entitled to tax free force component in a time of war or in a time salaries. But, in many ways the damage has been of national emergency, this provision does not done. The Government has broken what tradipermit the field force to be able to call on that tionally has been an umbilical cord between this element of the Reserve in its service. In the Parliament and all parties in it and the need to circumstances where this amendment does persustain at all times a viable Reserve component mit units of the Reserve to be used, it opens up upon which the Regular Army could depend at a very fundamental question which, regrettably, times of national emergency, whether they be neither the Minister for Defence( Mr Beazley) short of war or in times of war. nor any other member of the Government bothers to answer in this debate. The question which I wonder how many members of this House arises is simply this: How can one effectively call are aware of the condition of the Regular Army up part of the Army Reserve? That question and the Reserve at this time. For example, we goes to the very heart of what the Army Reserve have Norforce, based in Darwin. It is essentially is meant to be. It also draws into question the a reserve unit and a very competent one. The other difficulty that in both the First World War Government is creating a new similar regiment and the Second World War the whole issue of in northern Queensland. It is integrating the call-up became a major national debate. In both Seventh Brigade in Brisbane with the First Dicases, as I recall, the issue was never really vision. The First Division is a regular division, satisfactorily settled in favour of a national callthe Seventh Brigade is a reserve brigade. The up in the armed forces, certainly at a time when First Division comprises three regular brigades, they may have to serve overseas. but only the ODF in Townsville is up to strength and available for operations at seven days' notice. The order of battle of the Australian Army as it is now developed requires the utilisation of significant elements of the Army Reserve battalThere are two other regular brigades in the ions throughout Australia for the fundamental Australian Army.

A There is this fundamental folly that goes right new brigade headquarters is also intended for through the entire approach, and it is simply North Queensland. And so it goes on. this: For the Army to rely on a partial call-out as part of its battle plan is a strategic absurdity. The Minister for Defence has now joined us. It is one which has not been brought forward in I hope that in his summing up he will say how this House until now, and one which the Ministhis proposal which is a very important and ter has totally ignored in his second reading significant proposal, will effect the capacity of speech. If we are going to allow this proposal to the Reserve to back up and fill up the number erode the mobilisation base of the Army Reof units of the Regular Army which are so serve, we will create another set of problems. As significantly under strength at this stage.
