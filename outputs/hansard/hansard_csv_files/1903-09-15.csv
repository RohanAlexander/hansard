Primo Minister I F His Attention Has Been Drawn To The Following Paragraph, Which Appears In To","day's ArgusMr Harvey Patterson, chairman of the Mungana (Chillagoe) Mining Company, North Queensland, echoed the general feeling when he stated at the meeting of shareholders to-day that little progress had been mode in developing the different lodes on the property. But Mr Patterson's hearers were not prepared to find him casting the blame for this on the workers on the field, or to bring up the white labour question. However, this is what he did in the following words:-"" I do not say there ore not good workers on the field, but, afc the same time, there is a large percentage of bad ; and until these are superseded no alteration of oxisting circumstances can accrue. There is no doubt the climate is against the white workerwho is simply a piece of languid animation under tropical sun and beat-and probably be cannot be blamed for being unable to bear the intense heat also in the underground workings, owing to the decomposition of the sulphide matter in the lodes. This portion of Australia could never have heen intended for the European, else the climate would have been more suitable and moderate, wad while the nonsensical idea of keeping tiie whole continent of Australia for the white man alone is maintained, this portion, which contains vast wealth in mineral andagricultural lands, will continue to a great extent to waste ' its sweetness on the desert air.' Had we the same conditions as apply to mining in South Africa with regard to labour, I venture to aay a great success would soon be made of our undertaking.""

General, upon noticeIn view of the following facts :(a) The new South Australian telegraph line (Adelaide to Eucla) is reported to be working good qnadruplex daily ; (6) The Eucla-Coolgardie line works good quadruplex daily; (c) Tliere is a wire from Perth to Coolgardie which is used to connect with the Coolgardie-Euela quadruplex, and is worked to advantage daily as a direct Perth to Eucla circuit ; (d) In a recent issue of the Telegraph Age, a paper printed for and circulating almost exclusively amongst American telegraph operators, the following appears :"" New York to San Francisco is 3,400 miles. Some dozens of direct circuits are worked quadruplex between the two places. On some new specially prepared wires (.thick copper) there are four sets of automatic repeaters. On wires of the ordinary sort there are six sets of these repeaters, and it is no uncommon-thing for a New York merchant to receive a reply to a telegram to San Francisco within fourteen minutes"".1. What is the hindrance to direct working between Coolgardie or Kalgoorlie or Perth and Adelaide, or even Melbourne, with automatic repeating stations between Adelaide and Perth at Yardea, Eucla, Balladonia, and Kalgoorlie or Coolgai-die, the same number as between New York and San Francisco (four stations) ? 2. Whether Australian instruments are not exactly the same as those used in America? 3. Whether direct working would not be productive of accuracy and a great saving in the time of transit of telegraphic messages between Western Australia and the eastern States of the Commonwealth, and also a considerable reduction of tbe present expenditure?

The names of the four candidates appointed are-Hooper, George Patrick; Orton, Arthur; Muir, Frank Patterson; MeCahon, Albert T., who occupied first, third, seventh and thirteenth, places respectively on the list of successful candidates.

13,The Chairman,"The Budget discusTHE In Committee: Division1 (Senate), £5,682. ask the Treasurer why increases of salary are proposed for several officers of the Senate? Are the increases simply mechanix cal ? I see that the Clerk of Papers, Shorthand-writer and Typist, the Housekeeper, and Doorkeeper, and the President's Messenger are to have increases, and, as they have occupied their present positions only for a year .or two, I do not see any reason, on the face of it , why their salaries should be increased.

I do not know that that is a very Public Service Act, Mr President has the strong reason for these increases; but in appointment of his own officers in the same order to avoid friction I waived my way that Mr Speaker has the appointment objections. Although some of the mesof his. sengers of the Senate have not been in the service so long as have some of our Regarding the wisdom, or otherwise, of inmessengers, it has been thought wise to put creasing the emoluments of officers of Parliathem on a similar footing. These were the ment, I would point out that in Queensland reasons which induced me, after conferring during the past two or three years, the with the Prime Minister, to provide for the whole of the civil servants have not only increases. I hope that no objection will be been denied increments, but have actually raised, because the amounts are not large, suffered a reduction of salary I do not and if the increases are not granted some think it would be fair to the public servants friction may arise. that is quite fair that officers who have been this year.

WhilstI do not object to the increases as such, I think that some better reason tlian that mentioned by the Treasurer should be given. proposed increases for very much the same reasons as those mentioned by the honourable member for Yarra. The President's messenger had increases on two prior occasions, and his salary now stands at £188. It is now proposed to increase it to £204. My idea is that a messenger should be paid to some extent in accordance with his length of service. I understand that the President's messenger has been in tbe service for only three years. He was formerly a temporary messenger in South Australia. I take the same view as the honourable member for Yarra with regard to the salaries to be paid to junior messengers who fill vacancies caused by the retirement of senior messengers. , of that State that we should increase tlie",14,Budget 1903 4

That the item, "" Clerk of the Papers and Accountant, It seems to me that the idea that officers of the two Houses of the Legislature should necessarily be placed upon the same footing has very little to recommend it . In the Senate the work can scarcely be as heavy as it is in this Chamber. The other branch of the legislature does not sit the same number of hours that this House does, and for reasons which we can quite understand. The fact that it contains fewer members necessarily means that there is not the same volume of work to be performed that there is in this House, even if the hours which the two Chambers sat were similar. Most of the salaries paid are upon a fairly reasonable scale, considering that when ParUament is in recess-as we hope it will be more regularly in the future-the officers in question can be granted extended holidays by permission of Mr President and Mr Speaker. I certainly object to any increments being granted at the present time. In these Estimates I find that the .salaries of messengers, typists, &c. are being increased, whilst others who perform more responsible duties and who occasionally are compelled to work overtime, are given no encouragement whatever in that direction. If we cannot find funds to mete out fairer treatment to those who are charged with responsibility, we should not fritter away money in attempting to bring about a parity between the salaries of officers in the other Chamber and those in this. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I think there is a very great deal to be said in opposition to the increase from £ 3 8 0 to £420, which is proposed in this instance. Certainly, the Committee ought to be given more information in respect of tbe length of service of the officer who performs the duties of Clerk of the Papers and Accountant. of any better reason than tliat which has been advanced by the Treasurer, I am of opinion that the increase should not be granted.

Division2 (House of Representatives)£8,267. the Treasurer the reason for the inclusion of the last item in subdivision No. 1, "" To provide for increments and adjustment of salaries, £ 6 0 . "" to ask the Treasurer the reason for the proposal to increase the housekeeper's salary from £ 2 2 5 to £235. avoid granting this increase. The housekeeper was appointed on the-1st January, ,1902, at a salary of £225 per annum, "" with yearly increments of £ 1 0 , "" to be proposed to Parliament, up to £250, with quarters, fuel, light, and water. His predecessor's salary amounted to £ 2 7 5 per annum, with anallowanceof £ 2 5 per annum with quarters, fuel, light and water. This increase was one of the conditions of the housekeeper's appointment. As to the point mentioned by the honourable member for Yarra, it will be found that throughout the Estimates I have allowed for increments in the lowest classes, which will practically be given as a matter of course. Increments to officers in other classes in the service must be dealt with by the Commissioner. That officer has to inquire whether any of them should receive increments, and under the Public ServiceA ct they become entitled to them upon receipt of his certificate. I -have, therefore, provided throughout the Estimates sums estimated to be sufficient to cover such increments as the Public Service Commissioner may think fit to grant. Under the Public Service Act, an officer in the higher classes does not become entitled to I have already an increment until he obtains the certificate of the Commissioner, and no increase can be granted without that certificate. vice Commissioner has power to grant increments to any of the officers mentioned in this Estimate. Are not all these officers under tbe Commissioner 1 I notice, for example, that provision is made for an increase of £ 1 0 increases per annum in the salary of a junior clerk. As far as I am aware the whole of the other salaries are fixed, and I can therefore see no necessity for this item. I do not think it will be spent while the present Treasurer If that be so, I have remains in office. other officers may be increased under the classification of the Commissioner, and this item is to meet such a contingency. rule laid down by tbe Committee in dealing with officers of the Senate, it seems to me that no increase should be granted in this division to other than junior officers. I notice that provision is made for increasing the salary of a junior clerk from £ 7 0 to £80. That is a very proper proposal; but all the other officers are receiving fair salaries, and I do not think there is any necessity to provide for this item of £60. Service Act, tbe officers have to be classified by the Commissioner. That rule applies throughout the service. If oflicers in the higher classes are dealt with in that way by the Public Service Commissioner, they will become entitled to increments. the money. It seems to me that we need not pass this item until we see whether there is any necessity for it . I could well understand a proposal to increase the t salaries of clerks after they had been five or six years in the service of the Commonwealth, and had doii'e good work ; but I fail to see any necessity for automatic increases after two or three years' service.

Honourable members have considered that the reasons given for the increases proposed have not been sufficiently strong. In this case wearedealing with anentirelydifferentmatter. We are here proposing to establish a precedent, and it is on that account that I have had a footnote introduced to direct thespecial attention of honourable members to the fact. What the practice in other States has been I do not know, but I am informed that it has been usual to allow the salary to continue if the Speaker is re-elected. I recollect that that was done in my time in Victoria on one occasion when the Speaker was returned and re-elected to his office. He was allowed salary for the period during which the House was not in session. work done during the interval between the dissolution and the election of the new Parliament, whether he is re-elected as Speaker or not? should be adopted. for consideration. We think it is not desirable that invidious distinctions should be drawn between the presiding officers of the two Chambers. As Ministers continue to draw their salaries it seems only fair that the Speaker should be entitled to draw his salary during a dissolution when he has to do the work of his office. The additional point taken that whether he is re-elected or not he ought to be paid if he does the work is a good one, and is deserving of consideration. I ma)' say that I hope that aspect of the case will not come before us. agree with the Treasurer that we are here establishing a precedent, and we are free to deal with the matter without being bound b} any previous custom, as are the States r Parliaments. They have established precedents in the past, but we are quite free to deal with this matter without any previous custom binding us to adopt a certain course. Whether the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, is or is not right as to the constitutional aspect of the question, it would be an undesirable precedent to set up that we should make a continuance of the salary of the Speaker dependent upon his re-election to Parliament and to the office of Speaker. salary to a man who was not a Member of Speaker depends on his being a Member of Parliament, and it is here proposed to pay him a salary when he is actually not a Member of Parliament at all. That is something to which, I think, we should take objection. It is not a personal matter with any of us. We have no objection to the Speaker receiving the salary stated; but it is a question whether he should receive it when he ceases to be a Member of Parliament. I do not think we have been furnished with any good reason why he should. As regards the comparison between the Senate and the House of Representatives it might as well be said that as honourable senators will be receiving salary although the Senate will not W h y not pay him for the be sitting, whilst members of the House of Representatives, when standing for re-election, will not receive salary MrV . L. SOLOMON -They will be sacrificing, in this instance, four or five months' salary, to which they are entitled under the Constitution. House ought to be placed upon the same footing as members of the Senate. I think it is undesirable in this case that the continuance of the salary should depend upon whether a member of the House is re-elected to the House or to the Speakership ; and it is also undesirable that the Speaker, who cannot be Speaker unless he is a Member of Parliament, should .be recognised as entitled to receive salary during the period when he is not a Member of Parliament. W i th every good wish for the present Speaker, I oppose the provision now sought to be made. I think we should establish another, and a much better precedent, than we shall have established if we adopt the terms of the footnote to this vote. posedThat the footnote to the item, "" Mr Speaker, £1,100.""

I would suggest, however, that we ought to make a record of this kind in the case of every Governor General, and that we should not miss the present opportunity to obtain a presentation of Lord Hopetoun's lineaments which, so far as my judgment goes, is a faithfu l and true one, for which the price asked is not extraordinary. not oppose the item. I rise to point out that we are labouring under a mistake when we describe Lord Hopetoun as the first Governor General. would draw the attention of the Committee to the following extract from a book compiled for presentation to the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York, entitled Twentieth Century Impressions of Western Ausbralia:When the Australian Government Act was passed by the Imperial Parliament in 1850, the idea of an ultimate Federation was even then engaging the attention of British statesmen, and particularly those responsible for the control of the Queensland Colonial Office. At that time, of course, we had no separate polibical existence, and the detachment of Victoria from New South Wales was not completed till the following year, although South Australia had, under charter, attained the dignity of a separate province some fifteen years previously. Western Australia was, geographically, too remote to be specially included in the Imperial plans, but provision was nevertheless made by the Australian Government Act for the establishment of thab colony on the same footing as her sisters, whenever the proper time should arrive for bhe carrying out of that project. In furtherance of the Imperial idea of Federation, Sir Charles A. Fitzroy, Governor of New Soubh Wales, received a commission as Governor General of Ausbralia, the Governors of the other colonies all holding bhe official rank of Lieutenant Governor. Any Lieutenanb-Governor was to be superseded in his office during tbe bemporary residence in his colony of the Governor General. Ib was, however, objected by the residents of Melbourne and Adelaide bhab bheir distance from the Federal capital (Sydney) was boo greab to make bhe Imperial proposals accepbable. The matter was, therefore, not$ pressed; and, on the retirement of Sir Charles A. Fitzroy in 1855, bhe bible of Governor was bestowed upon He» Majesty's representative in each of the other colonies. And though the distinction of Governor General was retained by bhe Governor of New South Wales until 1861 bhe bitle carried no real power. So complete indeed has been bhe effacement of this incident from recollection that to-day Lord Hopetoun is generally described as the first Governor General of Australia ; whereas, in fact, two of his It is an Australian propredecessors held that title in succession over forty years ago. liam Denison held the title of Governor General, but Lord Hopetoun was the first Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia. If honourable members wish it , I will move the insertion of those words in the item. tion is placed upon the bust, it should be a correct one. That bhe item ""For the purchase of a bust of tbe first Governor General, £200,"" be omitted. reputation enough to make his memory In this connection I live? left behind is not sufficient to keep his memory green, I do not think that a bust will do so. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I hope that the Committee will strike out the item. Thef actfchatsome artist asked Lord Hopetoun to sit for him while he fashioned a model of his bust, and thafc Lord Hopetoun said fchat the bust when made was a faithfu l one, is, to my mind, no reason why we should buy it , although the artist who executed the work deserves every credit for the talent which he has displayed. the bonorable member has mentioned do not in themselves constitute a sufficient reason why Parliament should buy the bust. My main argument was that we should have some record of each Governor-Geueral. MrM c DONALD I think that we have a very good record of Lord Hopetoun, because he cost the Commonwealth £40,000 during the eighteen months he was here. If that is not an impression which will live long in the memory of the people, I do nofc know what more lasting one they want. If the bust is such a faithful representation of Lord Hopetoun, I think he might do us the honour to present it to us, in whicb case we might use it to adorn Parliament House in the Federal Capital.' If , on the other hand, the people of Australia, are anxious to have a memorial of Lord Hopetoun, why should there not be a national, testimonial, and a full-sized statue subscribed for?

Sir EDMUNDBARTON were of apersonal character, I would willingly accept the honourable member's advice in regard to it , rather than have any dispute about it . But there is something approaching a principle involved in it, and thafc is that as a people we should be mindf u l that we are makers of history. The early days of the Commonwealth will be the subject of historical examination and research, and records should be kept of the main events of our history, and fche actors connected with them. That being so, it is for honourable members to consider whether we should, on the very threshold of that history, deny that there is any advantage to be gained in keeping, either upon canvas or in marble, a record of each of the distinguished men who come here. subscribe. Sir EDMUNDBARTON I could understand that we should not make a record of distinguished men if we had come to the conclusion that we ought notfcohave them, but as we have not comefcothafc conclusion, and as the Constitution provides for successive representatives of theKing, it seems to me that, while we should do no harm or spite to any Governor General by refusing this memorial, we should do ourselves despite if we refused to obtain a record which it is of advantage to the Commonwealth to have. ter has tried to raise an ideal in regard to this matter, but while I think that the Commonwealth at times needs ideals, I do not think that his proposal is a good one. If we are to have an historical record of our Governors-General which will be something like Madam Tussaud's exhibition, it may happen that interim Governor-Generals or -their friends will want to have their features preserved there; but the right honourable gentleman has made mention of no such proposal. It seems to me that if records such as he speaks of are to be kept, names like those of Sir Henry Parkes and the late Honourable James Service, which stand out pre-eminently in connection with the historical side of Federation, should be commemorated in marble or on canvas. But, so far, no such proposal has been made. AlthoughI appreciate high ideals, and love the artistic side of life, I think that the Australian public are too utilitarian to spend money in the manner proposed. If it is intended to If the item preserve the bust of every Governor General, the proposal now before us is no great compliment to Lord Hopetoun. To use the vernacular, in our expenditure upon his account we have already had a sufficient bust. I shall oppose the item. MrL . E. GROOM (Darling Downs) It is my intention fco vote for fche item.

MrL . E. GROOM Hansard is intended for something more than a record for the information of the present generation. We have taken very great care that everything done by Parliament shall be faithfully and honestly placed on record, and I am in sympathy with any movement having that object. I think we should also have some portraiture of the first Governor General of tbe Commonwealth as an historical record. This Parliament has functions to perform beyond those relating to purely utilitarian matters. Surely, at the outset of our career as a nation we should take some interest in science, literature and art, and show that, as a people, we have some appreciation of all that is noblest and best in life. hind the proposed purchase. MrL . E. GROOM -The Prime Minister describes the bust as a work of art, and as a correct delineation of the features of the late Governor General; and I think that he has enunciated a sound principle in connection witli this matter. When we establish the Federal capital we shall have to do something to beautify it. Do honourable members propose that we, as a Parliament, should confine our attention to purely utilitarian matters ? A bust of the Governor General should be included amongst the works of art used, not only to beautify the Federal capital, but to remind the people of the makers of the Commonwealth, and of those associated with them. subscription for the purpose 1 MrL . E. GROOM A sufficient sum for the purpose might be raised by public subscription ; but, apart from that, surely we have our duty as ,a Parliament to discharge. Governor General very well for what he did. Mr L\ E. GROOM -Honorabl e members participated in the benefits arising from the expenditure incurred by the late Governor General in celebrations worthy of the occasion, and we know that nofc one penny of the money voted by this Parliament went into Lord Hopetoun's pocket. that is quite apart from tbe question now before us. The Prime Minister very properly urges that we should preserve as a matter of historical record a representation of our first Governor General, and in this regard we cannot escape our responsibility to tliose who may come after us. The people of other nations would have been glad if their predecessors had taken care to preserve the records of their time by means of statues and other representations of the great characters who have taken a leading part in making history. If that had been done, a benefit would have been conferred, not only upon the nation itself, but upon the whole civilized world. History ought to be our guide, and the Prime Minister was perfectly right when he emphasised the need which we as the first Australian Parliament should supply. I have great pleasure in supporting the proposal. the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs was somewhat mixed, because he confused the subject of the encouragement of art with the present proposal. I should be quite prepared to vote more than £ 2 0 0 for the encouragement of art, and I hope veiy liberal provision will be made in that direction when we have our own art gallery. A t the same time, I fail to see why we should spend £ 2 00 upou a bust of the late Governor General, and I admire the courage of the Government in making the proposal in the face of fche Kyabram cry for economy. Our system of government does not afford any opportunity for the exercise of special capabilities by the gentleman who may hold the position ofGovernor-General, if we arranged to have busts of all our Governor General, some phrenologist of the future might, on examining the outlines of their heads, say, "" Tliere is the head of a wonderfully brainy man. He ought to have figured prominently in the history of the Commonwealth."" The phrenologist, bowever, on searching the records, would find that that brainy man had done nothing, for I think we paid the late the simple reason _ that he had had no opportunity. We do not want our Governor General to do anything beyond making himself genial and presiding over society functions. There is no room for a strong man in thafc position, because we look after the government of the Commonwealth for ourselves.

Division 11 (Administrative)-£8,820 . Sir EDMUNDBART ON (Hunter Minister for External Affairs*) I desire to make a short explanation in reference to this division. Upon looking at the Estimates honourable members will see that the salary of the Chief Clerk in"" this Department has been saved. Reference to the item relating to the clerks, however, will show that the first clerk, Mr Lewis, who was at Government House uncier the previous official Secretary, and who received a salary of ±'325, is -now to receive £350. Seeing that he has been removed to a position of very much greater responsibility, aud will be called upon to do increased work, the addition to his salary of £ 2 5 per annum is a small one. On the other hand,"" whereas Mr Lewis formerly received £325 as clerk to the official Secretary at Government House, we have now appointed in his place a clerk at £ 1 2 0 per annum, thus effecting a saving of £ 2 0 5. The salary of the Secretary to the Federal Executive Council remains the same, namely, £ 6 0 0 ; but the duties of Secretary to the Federal Executive Council and official Secretary to the Governor General are now being discharged under the one heading and title. Therefore the saving, which has been effected in that respect-if I may refer to division 12 -is £ 2 0 5 as against an increase of £ 2 5 in Mr Lewis' salary upon his transfer. Sir EDMUNDBARTON A t the bottom of that list honourable members will find that provision is made for one clerk at £100 per annum, and another at £ 4 0 . These amounts, which will now be paid out of the salary vote, were previously paid out of the vote for. temporary assistance. If honourable members will refer to item 11, ""contingencies,"" they will see that whereas the amount thus spent last year was £240, it has been reduced this year to £ 1 0 0 . The increases relating to the remaining salaries between the first and the two last mentioned in this think that item are the ordinary annual increments granted under the Public Service Act. But for any item which I may have overlooked, I have explained the whole of these alterations. A t a later stage I shall move to reduce the item, "" Travelling expenses, £400,"" by £120, as I find that the amount may be reduced to that extent. the item "" Grant to Jenner Institute, £ 3 3 5 ,"" relate? paid last year. not voted last year. believe, relates to some anti-plague serum, which the individual States would otherwise have bad to purchase.

The possibility of 200 or 300 reputable men being, first of all, deprived of a certain sum of money, and then stranded in a distant country is so serious that the Prime Minister should cause inquiry to be made into the matter. Sir member mentioned -this matteito me this afternoon, and I have given instructions for a cable to be sent to the Governor of Cape Colony, with a view to ascertain whether the advertiser is authorized to engage these men.

If the honourable member looks at the items under the heading-of "" Federal Executive Council"" he will find that last year a sum of £ 1 2 0 was voted for tem_ porary assistance. That amount, plus a sum of £ 2 0 , which fche oflicer seems to have well earned, is now applied fco tbe salary of a clerk in the Public Service, acting as type writer and messenger. under fche notice of the Prime Minister a question rslating to the Philippines, which is already beginning to affect Australian trade. The right honourable gentleman is perhaps unaware of the fact thafc Australian manufacturers of reaper and binder twine, and various other classes of cordage, find it absolutely necessary to import a certain class of Manilla twine. As the result of the establishment of this industiy in Australia the price of reaper and binder twine has been materially reduced; but, owing to certain action taken by the United States authorities, the manufacturers are now placed at a serious disadvantage. When the Philippines were taken over by the United States of America, a promise I did not say that was made that in accordance with an arrangement which the Spanisli Government had previously carried out, the best favoured nation treatment should be extended to the British Government. But the United States of America authorities at the Philippines now impose an export duty of £ 1 10s. per ton on Manilla twine exported to countries other than the United States.",29,South African Railways Goo D Positions

188,Mr Kirwan (Kalgoorlie),"PerhapsThere were thirty-three votes in favour of that amendment and only nineteen against it. Six other votes were accounted for by pairs, three on each side, making fifty-eight votes out of a total house of seventy-five. -Chairman of Committees, neither of whom voted, there were only fifteen votes unaccounted for. I have spoken to several of those honourable members wbo did not vote, and know that some of them were in favour of the amendment for the non-ulienation of land in New Guinea. That shows that there is a clear majority of the .seventy-five members of the House who are in favour of the land of New Guinea being retained by the Crown. Under those circumstances I wish to ask the Prime Minister what the intentions of the Government may be concerning the band of New -Guinea pending the election of a new Parliament. As the opinion of this House has been very clearly expressed, I wish to ask whether, until the next Parliament is elected, and has an opportunity of expressing its views upon the subject the Prime Minister will give us an assurance that land will not be alienated ? The Government should recognise the opinions of the majority of honourable members, as so -clearly expressed, and should do nothing in opposition to those views until the new Parliament has an opportunity of expressing itself. Sir EDMUNDBARTON It will be within the recollection of honourable members that I have stated that I propose, before proceeding further with the Papua (British New Guinea)-Bill fco make some inquiries. I am row taking steps to fchat end. My object will be to inquire into several matters affecting British New Guinea upon which further information would be desirable. include in those inquiries both the question -of land alienation fco which fche honourable member for Kalgoorlie has referred, and the question of the liquor traffic; as to both of which I desire to obtain further facts before -comingfcoa decision. I may tell the honourable member that nothing that I am doing now will involve my pledging the responsibility -of the Government to the alienation of masses of land. I do not propose to settle that question without further consultation with Parliament. will be no alienation of land in the meantime 1 Sir EDMUNDBARTON I am answering the question of the honourable member for' Kalgoorlie with that object. It may be very undesirable to stay altogether any settlement in New Guinea. WhatI will do Allowing for Mr Speaker and the is this : I will take care that no large blocks are alienated-that no alienations take place except of small areas adapted for agricultural settlement, so that the soil of British New Guinea will not be permanently affected by any disposals made in the meantime, except to an infinitesimal extent. ment? Sir EDMUNDBARTON I shall communicate with the Acting-Administrator of Britisb New Guinea to endeavour to see that any land alienated is alienated for the purpose of occupation and for the purpose of use, not for the purpose of being held up, so to say. no sympathy whatever with any landgrab alienation, but I think that in the case of settlers wanting to go to British New Guinea to obtain small areas, permission may be granted to them to select, in order that we may not cause stagnation. In the meantime, my mind will be perfectly open to be influenced by the result of the inquiries which I shall make. able gentleman call small areas 1 Sir EDMUNDBARTON In a place like New Guinea, something not exceeding 640 acres. the statement of the Prime Minister is unsatisfactory.

198,Mr Fisher,"I venture to say thafcby the people of Australia, and it emphatically stated that no further alienations should take place. But because the Prime Minister does not agree with the action of the majority of this House he says that he is going to hang up the Bill until he obtains further information. There has been grave, and I venture to say well-founded complaint, against government by Cabinet. Here we have a clear declaration by the representatives of the people, who are responsible to their constituents, of what they wish, and the Government take an action that is diametrically opposed to the wish of the majority. I venture to say that the action of the Government is quite unsound. The right honourable gentleman also wishes to make inquiries regarding the sale of liquor. It seems that he is ready to put on one side the wishes of the majority of the House on the point iu consequence of predilections of his owu. If these matters were, in the opinion of the Prime Minister, vital to the Papua Bill, he should have said so at the time the measure was in Committee. That was the time for him to make a declaration, and not after the people, by their associations and representative men, have endorsed our action, and have forwarded petitions thanking the House for what they have done. It is not at all satisfactory that the Government should drop the Bill at this stage, and I submit respectfully that their action is unsatisfactory. I shall watch with a great deal of interest the position assumed by the right honourable gentleman when he is before the people appealing for support in his references to this particular subject. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I think that this matter is very serious. The position taken up by the Government with regard to the Papua (British New Guinea) Bill is not only unsound, but is based upon a frivolous objection. The right honourable gentleman told us when he inbroduced the Bill that ib was so necessary to have it passed that it should be taken through Committee at the earliest possible moment. But because cerbain amendments were made in ib the right honourable gentleman quietly drops the measure. It had been passed through should have informed the Committee Committee, and remained for a considerable time awaiting its third reading. What are the intentions of the Government 1 If the Prime Minister returns, after the general elections, with a majority at his back-and it is very problematical whether he will do so-h e will, I presume, test the feeling of the House again with regard to the nonalienation of land and the liquor traffic in British New Guinea. He is treating Parliament with contempt. Heknows that owing to the unsatisfactory state of the electoral rolls, and the position we are in with regard to the elections, no one will take any action to turn his Governmenb oub of office at the present time. He is merely relying upon that. Practically, he is insulting the wishes of the House on every possible occasion. The right honourable gentleman himself urged thab there was a great necessity for the passage of the Bill, but he has dropped it merely because two amendments were put in with which he does not agree. Who are the people who have come,to the right honourable gentleman and urged him to obtain further information 1 They are the representatives of one of the biggest firms connecbed with the trade of Britisli New Guinea-the firm that is likely to do the biggest trade there in the future. I allude to Burns, Philp and Co. They are the people who waited on the right honourable gentleman, in the form of a deputation, to urge upon him what action he should take. Because these people have' interviewed him, the desires of Parliament are practically placed on one side and its wishes are disregarded. member is quite under a mistake. . An y conclusion that I have come to was arrived at before any deputation waited upon me; and those upon the deputation who spoke were not bhe representatives of Burns, Philp and Co., but were gentlemen from New Guinea. how the deputation was worked up. Even suppose that certain members of it did come fiom New Guinea that is no reason why the wishes of this House should be placed on one side. If the Prime Minister made ib a vital principle of his Bill, and a vital plank in the policy of his Government, that amendments prohibiting the alienation of land and the introduction of liquor should nob be made in bhe Bill, be to that effect. But the right honourable gentleman did not do so. I feel sure that had it not been for bhe peculiar position we are placed in owing to the coming elections, the right honourable gentleman would not have taken the course bhat he has done.",32,Edmund Babton Am I To Under Not Solely To Legal Practitioners But Generally

213,Mr Page (Maranoa),"I am sure that I know of one or two who are very anxious to get rid of the land they hold. They must continue to hold it under the terms of their agreement. There is not very much in the Prime Minister's assurance with respect to the liquor traffic, that no more licences will be issued. Fi'om what I know of New Guinea, Burns, Philp, and Company have the whole of the liquor traffic in their own hands. Sir that, but would the honourable member desire me to say that no more licences should be issued because Burns, Philp, and Company have control of the traffic 1 House has said that liquor should be prohibited in New Guinea, and as a good democrat I bow to the will of the majority. I voted with the Government on that question because I know that a drop of grog has saved the lives of many men in the Territory. If settlers tbere are to be forbidden the use of a drop of whisky, brandy or rum, many of them may be driven to commit suicide. I point out that the assurance of the Prime Minister that no more licences for the sale of liquor will be granted goes for nothing wben it is remembered that one firm has control of the whole of the liquor traffic in the Territory. If the trade warranted it I have no doubt that other firms would have cut into it long ago. No doubt some did cut in and failed, and they have left the field to Burns, Philp and Company. In connection with the administration of New GuineaI saw it stated in a newspaper a few days ago thafc the Prime Minister had some idea of arranging for mail communication with New Guinea, and I should like to know if there is any truth in that statement. The establishment of steam communication with New Guinea would be one of the best ways of settling the Territory. Many people from Queensland would go there, and particularly from the portion of Queensland I represent, if there were ready means of communication provided. I hope the statement to which I have referred is true, because a few thousands spent in improving the means of communication between the mainland and of the Prime Minister to the questions New Guinea would be money well spent. with other honourable members in expressing only principle involved. We have also to regret thafcfcheMinistry have not been guided consider whether the voice of the majority the decision of a considerable majority in in this House, formally expressed by reso this House as to the non-alienation of land lution, is not to be given effect to. The in New Guinea. If the Bill had been considered by the Senate, and honourable senators had taken a different view, I could understand the desirability of our waiting for some little time in expectation'of both Houses coming fco some agreement upon points in difference. But the Bill has not been gone on with in the Senate, and it is an extraordinary course for the Ministry to take on their own responsibility, to absolutely nullify the effective voice of this House. The Prime Minister has said that there will be no alienation of land in larger areas than 640 acres ; but I do not think this a sufficient assurance for honourable members. The evil of alienation is being I do not say that. This continued, and there is nothing to prevent a man securing any area of land by dummying. I think there should be some conditional grant system instituted until the next Parliament deals with the question. There should be some provision, for instance, that any grant in fee-simple should be subject to tbe legislation that may be passed next year, . so that, if the principle of alienation is destroyed, there will be a right of resumption given in respect of any land alienated in the meantime. There should certainly be some provision against dummying. There is nothing to prevent a man getting -640 acres, and inducing fifty other persons to do the same thing. What is to prevent him purchasing from those persons subsequently? If there is to be no provision against that kind of thing the promise of the Prime Minister, fchat there will be.no alienation of land to any one person of an area greater than 640 acres, amounts to nothing. We know that, in the past, dummying has often frustrated the best intentions of land reform. Stringent provisions have been incorporated in the Land Acts of the States to prevent it, and unless we have something more than a mere promise that there will be no alienation in areas greater than 640 acres, I am afraid that, by the time the Papua (New Guinea) Bill is passed, a very large area of the best agricultural land will have been finally disposed of in fee simple. which I put to him is very disappointing indeed.

I am aware bhab several honourable members who did nob vote were strongly in favour of the principle of my amendment upon clause 19.

This addition to the clause was agreed to by the majority I have mentionedProvided that no grant of Crown land shall be made for uny freehold estate. That clearly expressed the wish of the this Bill has not been given. majority of honourable members, and I am sorry to learn that ib is the intention of the Prime Minister to act contrary to that expressed wish.

It was to this effectThe rent of any leasehold land shall be apto another place.

They have gone, I think, as far as honourable members of this House could expect them to go in limiting to a square mile the area to be alienated to any one person. That, I tliink, is a very great concession indeed to the wish of tlie majority in this House. The final decision of Parliament has not been given upon this measure, and, until it has, blie Government are justified in taking the stand tliey have taken.

Notwithstanding that various Governors and Lieutenant-Governors of New Guinea have advocated the alienation of land to syndicates and private persons, this House, with its eyes open and by an absolute majority, declared against such a policy. to know the conditions of the leases. light as possible thrown on the question. The Government have nothing to offer in support of their action, exceptthat they introduced a measure before they were possessed of sufficient information to enable them to lay all the facts before the House. The Government are now asking for time. are granting almost everything which the honourable member asks. Government are granting something; but they are granting it on lines which tend to the destruction of government by representative Ministers, and to the substitution of Cabinet government. If ' the Cabinet cannot flout the House by threatening to resign, they can lay this important measure on one side, and carry on the administration in a manner adverse to the wishes of the majority of honourable members ; and that is not sound government.

I appeal to the Prime Minister, who will probably issue a I quite think that the Government manifesto to the electors, to put this matter in such a way that there shall be no mistaking the issue. a question of great importance, which the Senate ought to have an opportunity of considering. In many of the States the law is that only a certain area of land shall be granted to one individual; but we know that, as a matter of fact, owing to a vast system of dummying, hundreds of thousands of acres have, in cases, been handed over to But we should like companies. Sir EDMUNDBARTON In order to prevent any misapprehension, it is just as well that I should inform tlie House what course it is intended to pursue. I propose to send to New Guinea some properly-qualified person to make the inquiries whicli I have previously indicated. To assist him there will be appointed the Chief Justice, who is now the Acting Administrator, and a magistrate of experience in New Guinea. I shall not attempt to influence the inquiry in any way, and I shall be largely guided by the I do not deny that the result. In themeantirae, the limitation which I have put, or which I hope to put, on the alienation, is the best course I can think of as compatible with any progress in the community, and with the desire and satisfaction of those who desire to take up land. Under the present regulations land on lease Gan be obtained ; if it could not, I should make provision in that direction. In the meantime no harm can be done, whatever system is adopted, because the 97,000 square miles of New Guinea cannot be affected by the disposal of a few acres. As regards the sale of liquor a similar course of inquiry will be adopted, and if the result be a recommendation to apply something like the Gothenburg system, of which I have read somethiug, and of which we have heard a good deal, I shall not hesitate to put it in force. If there be a recommendation by such a. commission as I shall appoint, in favour of leasing the land, that system ought, at any rate, to be tried. sion report in favour of prohibition ?

MrM c DONALD bad motives, but I say that the manner in which the Government have treated the Bill is a deliberate insult to honourable members. Althoughi t was carried by a large majority, the Government have thrown it on one side, and now we are told that if certain amendments had not been made it would have been proceeded with, although the information which the Prime Minister says he desires is not available. He has not told us the nature of the proposed inquiry. In iny opinion, we have been shamefully treated, and those who desire that the dignity and the honour of the House shall be maintained, should make the strongest protest against the action of the Government. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I gather from the speech of the honourable meinber for Kennedy that he blames the Government because, through their delay in connection with the Papua Bill, numbers of men may go to New Guinea and take up large areas of land there, between now and the making of the inquiry which is promised. I think that I can show him that his fears are groundless. I am one of those unfortunate individuals who are connected with the Hall Sound Company. Although we have spent a considerable amount of money upon the laud which we have acquired in NewG uinea, the company is at present in liquidation. We have land there which we should be only too pleased to let people have at even more reasonable rates than the Government are asking. them have it at the rates which they paid for it less than those rates, and be glad to get rid of it: If the honourable member thinks that vent liquor from being given to tbe natives;. other men will be as big fools as we were, he is mistaken.

We do not know yet what promises have been given in regard to the mission stationsin New Guinea. Ifc has hitherto been thecustom to grant the mission authorities small areas of land upon which to build their mission houses. Are we going to put an end to that in New Guinea, and require that the houses shall be built on leased land? In my opinion such an arrangement would be an extremely unfair one. I think that the Government are taking the right step. my mind the position of the Prime Minister' is inexplicable. He tells us thafc he is going to appoint a Commission, and that if it reports in one way he will act, while if it reports in another way he will merely "" consider."" I would point out to the honorable member for Kalgoorlie that the amendment carried in Committee in regard to the liquor traffic in New Guinea was not a "" 66 Bourke street affair,"" but was carried by a largemajority.

246,Mr Mccay (Corinella),"When duringlate. I recognise the right of every Government to act as it chooses in regard to important legislation of which it has charge, and, ;if necessary, to drop it if amendments of which it does not approve are carried. T h a t was the course they took the other day in regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. But they accepted without demur the amendments carried against them in the Papua Bill, and allowed the Bil l to be reported from Committee. I was under -the impression that the third reading was not proceeded with, merely because of the -ordinary causes which create delay. I do not know that at the time the amendments were carried tbe Government had any intention to drop the Bill. There was a great -deal of discussion last week as to whether ""the Government gave fair notice to honourable members as to what would happen if the -amendment proposed in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and afterwards agreed to, were carried. Personally, I foresaw the probable fate of the Billi f the amendments were carried, and I consider that I had ample warning of the intentions of the Government regarding it . Buti t is one thing to treat honourable members as they were treated in regard to this Bill, and another thing to treat them as they have been treated in regard to the Papua Bill. The' .argument of the Prime Ministeri n regard to the land alienation question is one which may be applied against him. He says that no harm can be done by not carrying into' law the anti-alienation provisions in the Bill, because no alienation is going on. But the fact is an equally good reason for enacting those provisions, because they can do no harm if no alienation is taking place. W it h -regard to the inquiries of the Commission, whose recommendations are to be adopted if tbe Prime Minister likes them, and to Toe"" considered "" if he does not, surely it is more proper that the House should decide upon such an important question than that it should be left to the Prime Minister. It may be asked"" Why do not those who disapprove ol the action of the Ministry in this matter take steps to make them feel their responsibility?"" I do not believe in -cutting off a man's head to cure the toothache. The Papua Bill is not one of those measures in which the fate of a Ministry is usually involved, and under the circumstances we .are practically helpless. I regret that the Ministry have taken a course which is opposed to the principles of responsible government. If the Government had told the Committee that if the amendments to which they objected were carried they would not proceed with the Bill, they would have been justified in the course which they have since taken. Buti t was not proper or courteous to allow the amendments to be carried, and then, when no one was looking, to take the Bill out of the back-door and drop it on the dust heap. Such an action is not calculated to endear any Government even to its well-wishers. in regard to the Papua Bill is, to say the least of it , a very peculiar one. It must be assumed that the Government before framing the Bill had before them all the information available regarding the situation of affairs in Papua, and, therefore, I fail to see what more information they wish to ask for. We have not been told what information they seek to get. TheB ill having been altered in Committee, the Government hung it up upon the excuse that they desire further information. What information do they desire? There has not been much said in regard to the liquor question, and I do not know what information they can get in regard to it . We are told fchat prohibition exists already so far as the natives are concerned, and we are perfectly capable of judging as to the effects of extending that principle to the white population. Therefore no Commission could afford us any additional information. It seems extraordinary also to send to Papua for special information with regard to the adaptability of the selling or leasing system to the lands of the Possession. Only a few white people live in Papua, but perhaps the Government intend to ascertain the views of the natives as to the respective merits offcheselling and leasing systems. It is just possible that they may know of some system better than any within our knowledge, despite our boasted civilization. The Government are perfectly entitled to drop a Bill if they do not approve of some of the principles insisted upon by honourable members; but, at fche same time, we are justified in asking for information regarding the system of administration to be followed in the absence of legislation on the subject. The Bill would have given the people of New Guinea a Constitution which would have enabled them fco manage their own affairs to a very large extent; but now",39,Edmund Barton Th E Honourable The Territory Since I F Thafc Legislation Is
247,Mr Spence (Darling),"The situationthe sole control will rest in the hands of the Prime Minister. The right honourable gentleman has indicated that he is prepared to alienate land, and if he does so he will act in direct opposition to the wish expressed by a majority of honourable members. He has not even told us whether he will administer the affairs of the Territory under the regulations or ordinances already in force, or according to his own sweet will. We are entitled to a distinct assurance that it is not intended to alienate any land iu the Possession. Attempts have previously been made to obtain control of large areas, aud, although I have, no doubt that the Prime Minister will exercise great care, I think he should make his intentions clear. We should also be informed whether the administration is to carried on in Papua, or whether the Prime Minister will exercise sole control over the land. Honourable members have every reason to be dissatisfied with the statement which has been made. I should not complain of delay if we could rest assured that nothing would be done contrary to the expressed wishes of honourable members. stated that no larger area than 640 acres will be .alienated, and that the land administration will be carried on under existing ordinances. for land, and each applicant were granted 640 acres, the whole of the area available for settlement would soon be absorbed. every care to safeguard the interests of the Commonwealth in that respect. been said to the contrary, we are justified in assuming that a country which is capable of supporting such a large native population embraces a large area of valuable land. A great deal of land has been practically given away in the past, but when better means of communication are provided a sudden rush may take place, and the Minister may be called upon to discharge a very heavy responsibility. Honourable members are entitled to a clear and definite statement as to the Minister's intentions. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). -When the Bill was under discussion, I spoke at some length with regard to the absurdity of prohibiting the sale of liquor, and of declining to sell land in Papua. I am glad that the Prime Minister had the good sense to seek for further information, with regard to both matters, before proceedingfurther with the Bill. If honourable members imagine that when a B ill has been read a second time it virtually becomes law, they make a great mistake. The third readingof the PapuaB ill has not yet been passed.. If honourable members think that the Government have acted in an unconstitutional or improper manner in holding back, the measure, they have a remedy ready to their hands. Surely the other branch of the Legislature, whose special function it is to protect the States rights, will havesomething to say with regard to proposals which would have the effect of absolutely putting a stop to settlement. It is all very well for honourable members who have had little or no experience of tropical countries, and of the difficulties of settlement in. such countries, to pass experimental legislation. If honourable members knew of the difficulties of settlement in tropical countries arising from their distance from the markets, and other circumstances, they would hesitate to agree to such stringent, provisions as those now contained in thePapua Bill. We are aware of the difficultiesexperienced in connection with the settlement of the Northern Territory of South Australia and of Northern Queensland. Is the land in Papua so much richer than thatto be found in those portions of the continent, because it lies sixty or seventy miles distant from our coast ? Distant fields were ever thegreenest. Many men have gone from; the Northern Territory to New Guinea, and very few have returned. The majority of those who came back died soon afterwards, owing to the mischief which malarial feverhad worked upon them. the early days of Northern Queensland t MrV . L . SOLOMON -Not to anythinglike the same extent as in the case of Papua; otherwise that Territory, which I believe to be rich in gold and other minerals, would have been settled years ago. Ample opportunities have been afforded to take up land in the Possession, and yet the whole of the revenue from land and everything else last year amounted to only £ 6 0 0 or £700.

The Queensland Government would have welcomed settlement in Papua. I am familiar with the conditions, very similar to those prevailing in New Guinea, under which Melville. Island was settled in the first instance, and I know also of the difficulties whioh were experienced in establishing the first settlement at Port Essinprton. A t the present time those who desire to take up land can pick and choose for themselves in -the Northern Territory, which has a climate very similar to that of Papua. The annual -rainfall there amounts to fifty or sixty inches, which is ample for the purpose of agriculture, .and there are plenty of magnificent blocks of land along the rivers fit for almost any purpose, although they are somewhat distant from the markets. That land can be taken up without survey for ls. 3d. per acre, five years being allowed for completion of . tlie purchase. Yet, notwithstanding these liberal conditions, not one pound's worth .of land has been sold there during the last ten years. Papua reeks with tropical diseases, -and it is far distant from the 'ordinary markets; and if it is decreed that the land there shall not be alienated, and that the liquor traffic shall be prohibited, we cannot .Tiope that settlement will progress. Isi t not sufficient to prohibit the liquor traffic with the natives, as in the case of the Northern Territory, or do teetotal faddists desire to make an experiment? If the Billwere passed in its present form, it would perpetuate the liability of the States to contribute towards the cost of administration.

I merely rise to suggest that in view of the insertion in the Bill of these two absurd provisions the Government are perfectly right in staying their hands for a little time with a view to making further inquiries. If tlie Ministry desired to wreck the measure, I would recommend them to adopt one course only. I would advise them to put it through its third reading with these and as many more absurd provisions included in it. as the various sections of this House who are possessed of particular fads chose to insert.

260,Mr Mahon (Coolgardie),"Whilst Iscarcely blame the Ministry for dropping the Papua Bill, seeing that it contains an absolutely impracticable provision, one which if it could be carried out, would inflict the grossest injustice upon the worthiest class in any new country-the pioneers. In a new territory like New Guineai t is nothing short of an outrage to prevent a man from having access to that which many find to be a preventive against disease. If there were nothing else enact a law which will allow people to take any poison they choose? the honourable member along all the by-paths over which he is disposed to roam. WheneverI find a man who is possessed by a fad -whethe r it be that of temperance or anything else a certain amount of indulgence in whisky. I object to any person who allows his intemperance upon the matter of temperance to run aVay with his discretion. I do not blame the Government for having dropped a Bill which contained a provision of that kind. I hold that it would not work satisfactorily in any new country. In this connection I could quote the testimony of a man who has lived for many years in New GuineaI think he is a clergyman-whos e remarks recently appeared in the Melboune press. In that interview he pointed out that there had been no abuse of liquor whatever in New Guinea, and that it had never been accessible to 'the natives. He declared that no damage had been done; and that, so far as he could judge, there was no justification whatever for this attempted prohibition. HadI thought that this matter would have been raised again during the present session, I should have kept the extract; but any honourable member who cares to look up the files of the Age newspaper during the past three or four weeks will find the interview to which I refer. That is all that I care to say in regard to the action of the Government. A few days ago I noticed in the press a statement to the effect that the magistrates of New Guinea, who are Imperial officers, are indisposed to continue in their present positions, and to come under the Commonwealth, fearing that by so doing they may lose their rights to Imperial promotion and pensions. that there were any rights to Imperial pensions in New Guinea, so that they cannot have been actuated by that consideration. One officer asked me for a pension, and I referred him to the Imperial Government. present Imperial officers, and as such would be open to promotion. If they are not prepared to come under tlie Commonwealth, I should be the last to force them to do so. I believe that in Australia we have bushmen who are quite capable of performing the duties of magistrates in New Guinea-no t one, but hundreds of them-me n who areI do not intend to follow well fitted for the work, who understand thenative races, and who are well qualified to withstand the climate and administer thelaw. Consequently, I hope the Government. ' will not hesitate to accept the resignationsof these gentlemen, and to appoint othersfrom Australia in their stead. the honourable member for South Australia, MrV . L . Solomon, would have been fittinghad the third reading of the Papna Bill been under consideration. However, we are notdealing with that question. The members of the Committee have merely asked the Prime Minister for an assurance that the decision of this Chamber, that the sale of intoxicating liquor in New Guinea shall be prohibited, and that the lands of the Territory shall not be alienated, will be respected. We simply ask that, until, the new Parliament has had an opportunity of expressing its opinion upon the matter, and until, according to the honourable member for South Australia, MrV . L . Solomon, all the faddists have been removed from this Chamber, there shall be no alienation of land and no deluge of liquor in New Guinea. rity does the honourable member say that there ever was a deluge of liquor in Now Guinea? have been advanced by the honourable member for South Australia, MrV .

J wish to know what kind of questions the Prime Minister is going to submit to tbe omcers ? It would not be very difficult to put such questions as would almost compel the officers answering them to support the views of the questioner. I hope that the right honourable gentleman will lay upon the table the terms of the minute to be submitted to the officers. That is only a fair thing. Within a few months we shall all be before our constituents, and we should be able to explain to them fully what our views are. It is also mandatory upon the Government that they should show whafc their position is regarding this question. terjection made by the honourable member for Melbourne just now, might lead people to think that the development of the Darling Downs, and of other parts of Queensland, had been affected by the alienation of land. I take the opposite view. I contend fchat settlement on those rich plains has been retarded by the alienation of land. In the first place, those who occupied lands on the Darling Downs leased them from the New South Wales Government-Queenslan d being then known as the Moreton Bay District of New South Wales. In order to keep settlers from going to those districts, it was industriously stated that it was of no use for a small man fco try to make a living there. The Darling Downs, which has now become the garden of Australia, was described as a place where it was impossible to grow a cabbage. But we had an example of what that country can produce the other day in the form of tlie produce exhibited afc the Victorian Royal Agricultural Show. What bas been the result of bhe alienation of land there? When the Queensland Government wanted to cut up the large properties thafc were held in pastoral leases, and passed an Act-calculated to have the effect of cutting them up, and' of settling yeomanry on the land, there was wholesale dummying, as a result of which the large estates were still held together. The consequence of sucli aggregations of land is seen in Yictoria as well as in Queensland. What is being done to-day 1 The Governments of those States are purchasing large estates for the purpose of settling the population and making the railways pay. The problem that is before the Railways Commissioners in Victoria, and in all the other States, is to make the railways pay. That can only be done by settling the people on the laud, so fchat they may have produce to send over the lines. Land that was dummied in some instances at 2s. 6d. an acre is now being purchased by the Governments of the States at £ 4 or £ 5 per acre. My memory carries me back to the early days of settlement in Queensland, before separation from New South Wales, and I am able to speak wibh a certain amount of knowledge. I repeat thafc the problem that now faces the States, particularly in connection with their railways, has been rendered acute by the alienation of land which has not always been acquired honestly. I do not knowfchafcwe can expect thafc a different state of things will obtain in New Guinea than has obtained in the States, if we adhere to the old policy. This House, by a wise decision, has declared itself averse to the alienation of land infcheTerritory. A reasonable request has been made to the Government fco postpone the alienation of public land until, at any rate, after the elections. In deference to the wishes of the House that request should be acceded to. The condition of things prevailing throughout Australia, as exhibited in the late railway strike in Victoria, in the raising of freights and in the cutting down of wages, can be traced to the aggregation pf lands in the bands of a few, and to the construction of railway lines by political influence, often for the benefit of estates held by particular individuals. Those estates are only used as cattle runs and sheep walks, instead of being occupied by prosperous farming communities, who, by providing traffic for the railways, would make them pay. In my opinion no matter what expert management may be imported from abroad, or trained in Australia, that problem cannot be solved until the people are settled on the l a n d ; and while large estates areheldforspeculativepurposes, as they are being held in many places, it will be impossible to obtain that settlement which is needed to make Australia, what we hope she will become in the futurea happy, prosperous, and progressive nation. One of the wisest Acts passed by the late Government in Queensland was that for the repurchase of estates. But look at the price that had to be paid for them. I recollect the first settlement in the Moreton Bay district. I know of estates that were then alienated, and which, if tbe Government required them would have to be repurchased",46,Edmund Barton Th E Honourable The Territory Since I F Thafc Legislation Is
313,Mr Wilkinson (Moreton),"An inat one hundred times the price for which they were originally sold. Many of these estates have been lying idle ever since. properties sold for £ 2 5 an allotment are now worth on the unimproved value £25,000 per allotment. Some may say that this enhanced value is due to the prudence and foresight of those who purchased the land in the first instance. But we know that it is due to the aggregation of population, and to the improvements effected by the construction of harbors, the improvement of rivers, the building of railways, the erection of telegraph lines, and other developments. A t the beginning of our national life as a Commonwealth I do not think we should be afraid to step out of the groove. No one will be harmed by our declaring that the lands in New Guinea which are under our administration shall be held by the Crown for all time. Let those who want to use them pay a rent for them. There will thus be a revenue derived from them, and they will not be held for speculative purposes. I also want to say a word or two about the erroneous idea that seems to be industriously promulgated aboutfcheunhealfchiness of thenorthern portions of Queensland. If honourable members look at the vital statistics they will find that the death rate among the alien population of Queensland is at least three times as great as the death rate amongst fche white population. are even worse. exaggerate, but I desire fco emphasize the fact that in calculating the death rate of tbe white population the infantile population is taken into account. But the aliens who come into Queensland-particularl y the Kanakas-ar e adults. When the blackbirders go to the South Sea Islands they do not bring back weaklings, but full blooded, strong men. These people die like rotten sheep from malaria. I have known malariafcobe as bad round about Moreton Bay as it is now in the northern districts of Queensland. Indeed,, malaria is invariably bad in any new country, when virgin soil is being opened up, in the neighbourhood of the Tropics. Honourable members can still see the graves of the navvies who first cut their way through the scrub in the western plains, engaged in. railway construction work. A little while ago, when'we were discussing the question of the prohibition of the sale of intoxicants in New Guinea, there were those who urged that without rum and Some quinine it was impossible for white men to in Brisbane that were live in such countries. I know better. I know that the men who abstained from the use of rum when the works to which I have alluded were being constructed, were those who came through best. In tlie early days of settlement, men who did not drink rum, and sleep under a bullock dray, were considered to have no chance of life. But, as a matter of fact, those who abstained were able to endure hardships far better than those who took intoxicants. totallers there now, I suppose. but I dare say that in the early days of Western Australia fche rigbfc honourable gentleman saw some pretty hard drinking, just as I saw it in the early days in Queensland. Very often when bullock drays laden with rum were sent up country, the casks when opened were found to contain something else than that tbey started with. The vital statistics of Queensland prove thafc white men are able to work in that part of the country quite as well as any alien people can do. Only a little while ago I was looking over a newspaper that is by no means democratic in its sympathies, and I found there a statement thafc the men in the cane-fields were cutting cane, and doing it more satisfactorily than it was done in the past by Kanakas. I do not want to I think that any loyal Australian should take these reflections upon the unhealthiness of any part of our territory, when they are known to be untrue, as a libel upon our country. I have travelled pretty well all over the north, and there is no part of Australia, so far as I have seen it,, which cannot be inhabited by white people. I cannot speak of the Northern Territory. The honourable member for Soutli Australia, Mr V. L . Solomon, knows more about ifc than I do. But I can speak confidently of Queensland, and I say that tbere is no part of it where the white man cannot work i h comparative comfort if he has fche proper opportunities. I have no desire to give a vote adverse to the Government on this matter, and I shall therefore not support any reduction of this item, but I do think that the Government should take notice of the opinions expressed here, and should hold their hands until after",47,Edmund Barton Th E Honourable The Territory Since I F Thafc Legislation Is

We understand that the elections are to take place some time in December, and as the polling places have to be declared before the issue -of the writs, there remain only seven or eight weeks in which to make the necessary arrangements. I urge the Minister to take immediate steps to have the polling places declared, especially in States like Queensland and Western Australia. When the polling places have been settled by the Governor General in Council, distant States have to be notified ; and it is only on the publication of that notification that it can be seen whether any centres have been overlooked.

When the Electoral B ill was before the House this point was very fully discussed; but it is really a matter of administration. In ' one State electorate, such as Wide Bay, there may be three populous centres, such as Gympie, Bundaberg, and Maryborough, where the voting-papers ought to be counted. by the honourable member for Wide Bay and the honourable aud learned member for Darling Downs has already been considered, and when the detailed information is given, I think honourable* members will see that the Government are doing what is desired. The idea is that there shall be a returning officer for each division, and at each populous place in such division there shall be an iissistant returning oflicer, with as many presiding officers as are necessary. The presiding officers will send the ballot-boxes to a returning oflicer, or an assistant returning officer ; and the assistant returning officer will count thevotes and send the numbers to the returning officer, who will declare the result. mixed before they are counted 1 Sir JOHN "" FORREST -The assistant returning officer will mix the voting-papers before he counts the votes. I thoroughly understand the point raised. The desire In Queensland and other places the is, first, to maintain the secrecy of the ballot, and, secondly, to have as much expedition as possible. We do not wish to have all the boxes sent to one centre, because that would take up too much time. We had a law to that effect in Western Australia, and the result was that sometimes a month elapsed, and we had forgotten all about the election before we knew the result. The Government will be able to do exactly what honourable members desire, namely, to maintain the secrecy of the ballot, and have assistant returning officers at the various important centres, where the voting-papers will be mixed, before they are counted. the proper administration of the Electoral Act that thereshall be an earlynotification of the proposed polling places.

363,Mr Brow N (Canobolas),"It is vital toare different in regard to the State Legislatures, inasmuch as under the Electoral Act, every elector has to bo registered on the roll with respect to a polling place where he is supposed to record his vote. I know there is a provision enabling an elector to record his vote elsewhere, but there will be some difficulty in doing so, seeing that he will have to provide himself with a form of declaration. polling places. to sign a declaration; and experience in New South Wales has shown that, in many cases, such a formality acts as a deterrent. There is no need to withhold the publication of the polling places. If the lists are completed the notification can be issued at a moment's notice, thus enabling the electors to kno%v whether any important centres have been overlooked. Sir will be notified as soon as possible. In Vicbuti t differs very largely from .the States-, toria they have been notified already. fication in respect to New South Wales, so far as I know. ing difficulty, but we are getting over it . which I wish to impress upon the Minister, and that is that it would be wise, so far as New South Wales at least is concerned, to adopt the polling places used for elections of members of the Legislative Assembly. A t some of these places only a small number of votes is recorded, and tbere may be a disposition on the part of the Federal Government to abolish them to save expense, particularly since under the Commonwealth Electoral Act provision is made for voting by post. I would point out, however, that these places are a convenience to persons living in isolated parts of the country whose access to larger centres is very difficult, and been accustomed to go. great injustice will be done to them if the polling booths to which they have been accustomed to go are not provided. The exercise of the postal vote is surrounded by a good many difficulties which will tend towards the disfranchisement of persons living in isolated places, and therefore I strongly urge the Minister to have tlie list of polling places printed as speedily as possible, so that the necessary corrections can be made before the elections are held. Another suggestion I have to make is that electors be supplied with in formation in regard to the main provisions of the Act. There are a number of provisions in our electoral law which do not find a place in the State electoral law, and for . the smooth working of the Act, and for the information of those who will be selected to administer it , the Minister should have a short synopsis of its. provisions compiled. This synopsis should be printed in a. handy form, and while I do not think it possible to distribute it to every elector, copies might be hung up outside polling booths, post-offices, and other places of public resort where they will be readily accessible to the public, who can thus make themselves thoroughly acquainted with the law. If this is not done many mistakes will be made, and informal votes will be cast. MrM c C AY (Corinella) -The Commonwealth electoral law is probably more like the South Australian electoral law than ib JOHN EORREST -The polling places is like the electoral law of any other State; laws generally In all the States the electors have become accustomed to certainpolling booths, and I do not want what T regard as unwise economy to be practised 7 by the abolition of any of them. Although such a step would, by lessening the number of officers required, effect a certain saving, the economy would be dearly bought, inasmuch as it would prevent a considerablenumber of electors from voting.

They might even send round little circulars. sary printing and the hire of halls .will so greatly reduce the amount which the candidate is allowed to spend that there will be very little left for other purposes-in deed a candidate who is anxious not-to contravene the law must watch the expenditure of every penny. But as the Act will introduce a great many changes, and consequently create a certain amount of confusion and difficulty, we should see that that is not increased by the abolition, of polling booths to which electors have been accustomed to go. It must be remembered that the public have now only a couple of months in which to assimilate the provisions of the Act. I suggest that the Minister should cause to be prepared a short statement of its provisions, not so much for the guidance of officials as in order that electors may know what to do to comply with its requirements. It should not be an elaborate statement, dealing in full with the various exceptions, but one setting forth shortly the duties of the elector, such as that he should ascertain the polliug place for which he is enrolled ; and giving him information as to the booths at which he. can vote, what he should do at' the polling booth to which he goes, how he can arrange to vote outside his division, and how he can obtain permission to vote by post. I do not suggest that this statement should be published in the Government Gazette, because that publication is very little read, b u t l have no doubt that the newspapers would be glad to print it for the information of the public, and that it would do much to prevent mistakes. and learned member for Corinella has practically told the Committee that, although it is now more than a year since the Act was passed, the electors will not know how to vote under it . the kind. and learned member will do what he can to instruct the electors of the Corinella division. The electors of Victoria are not less .intelligent than those of Queensland. I am glad thafc the Minister has assured the Committee that Commonwealth officials are, as far as possible, to be employed in administering the Act. That announcementwill be hailed in Queensland with delight. During the last month we have heard a. great deal here about gerrymandering; but if honourable members had sat in opposition to .the Queensland Government which has. just gone to its doom and unsung."" opposition to that Government, they would know what political jobbery means. The members of that Government have done some of the most diabolical things that it is possible to do in connection with elections. There is a polling place named Bonna Vanna, out near Cunnamulla, 100 miles from the nearest railway station, which was frequently not appointed a polling place until ifc wasseen that the Government candidate was getting behind. In one instance they put off the ejection for a month, and rounded-up voters from Victoria, Tasmania, and New Zealand. I believe thafc they even cabled to the old country for two or three voters who were there. After gathering together as many voters as they could, they conveyed them out to the voting place by special coaches, and defeated the opposition candidate by about ten votes. Some honorable members of the Opposition in this Chamberhave complained about jobbery and gerrymandering in connection with the electoral divisions ; but they would have had greatercause for complaint if they had been in Queensland. Under the Commonwealth. Electoral Act the voters will have a fair and square deal for the first time. We are told by the Minister for ICome Affairs that iu the first place the assisting returningofficer will open the ballot-boxes in the presence of the scrutineers and count theballot-papers without opening them. Theboxes will then be forwarded to the Returning Officer for the division, and the whole of the ballot-papers received by him from thevarious polling booths will be mixed before the count takes place. That will secure an I did not say anything of absolutely secret ballot, and will enable a man to vote according to his conscience, in stead of at the dictation of his employer. I am acquainted with every dodge in connection with electioneering matters, and if I had been able to exercise the same poweras the Premier of Queensland, I should have brought about an ' alteration in tlie results of the last State election.

Therefore, I do not propose that a change should be made at present. I should like to know whether Mr Lewis has been permanently appointed as Chief Electoral Officer?

I wish to ask the Minister for Home Affairs wliether any provision has been made for the appointment of State electoral officers, other than in the case of Tasmania. Apparently provision has been made upon the Estimates for the payment of any such officers. Unfortunately, the Electoral Act of the Commonwealth differs from those of the States, except, perhaps, in the case of South Australia. The returning officers are to be practically permanent officials of the Government. In New South Wales, and.in most of the other States, the returning officers are appointed merely for the purposes of an election, and all the work connected with the registration of voters, and I do not consider that keeping the rolls clear is done by public servants, who act as electoral officers and registrars, and also in many cases perform other public duties. Under the Commonwealth Electoral Act the returning officers must be public servants, because tbey will have to perform work in connection with the purging of the rolls, which will keep them occupied' all the year round. I am not speaking of the State electoral officers, but of the returning officers, who are responsible for the state of the rolls, and who alone are authorized to issue certificates for voting by post. Therefore, an immense amount of work is placed upon the shoulders of the returning officers in each of the divisions, and apparently no amount is set down for their payment. I do not know whether the Minister expects men to do this work for nothing. It will be impossible to secure efficiency for nothing, and it will be difficult, if not impossible, to get Commonwealth officers to perform the duties of which I have been speaking, in addition to those I think it is too much with which they are now occupied. who have been doing work in connection vision is made.",54,Department Of Homeaffairs

The present Estimates, however, show a total expenditure of £3,882, as compared with the appropriation of £3,594 made last year. If these expenses are to go on increasing year after year, fche Department will provefcobe one of fche most expensive in the Commonwealth. We find some very heavy items. We have for examplePostage and telegrams, £800 ; office requisites, exclusiveofwritingpaperandenvelopes,£100; writing paper and envelopes, including cost of printing and embossing thereon, £100; account, record, ana otlier books, including cost of material, printing, and expenses, £1,500; temporary assistance, £500 ;. expensesCourts of Inquiry, £250 ; expenses Boards of Appeal, £500; expenses of holding examinations, including advertising, £.1,000; other advertising, £150; incidental and petty cash expenditure, £500; expenses, election divisional representatives, £50. be disThe expenses of this Department are like a youngster; they keep on growing, and swelling in importance. Although the present Minister for Trade and Customs told us last year that we should not require to expend a very large sum in connection with this Department, I ' f e l t satisfied that the expense would go on increasing, and the impression which I then formed has been .fully justified.

He succeeded very well in keeping down the expenditure of the Defence Department, and I trust that he will show the same zeal in administering the Department for Home Affairs. not know that the criticism of this Department by the honourable member for Maranoa is altogether a fair one. A great many of these items of expenditure have been incurred as the result of the measure which we passed. the Public Service Act. provisions in the Bill as originally introduced, and others were inserted by us, which involved considerable expenditure, and if there is any blame in which the expenditure of tbe Department isincreasing.

475,Mr Mahon (Coolgardie),"I do riotthe Public ServiceA c t justified the Commissioner in establishing two scales of allowances. We are referred in the regulations themselves to section 78 and paragraph g of section 80. Section 78 bears in a veryremote way upon the matter. It merely declares that salaries shall not exceed the amount appropriated by Parliament, and so -forth ; but the provision on which the Commissioner apparently relies is to be found in paragraph g of section 80. The section provides thatThe Governor General may make filter or repeal regulations for the carrying out of any of the provisions of this Act, and in particular for jtll or any of the following purposes, namely(g) For regulating and determining the scale or amount Not the scales or amounts, but the "" scale or amount"" to be paid to officers for transfer or travelling allowances or expenses, or for living in localities -where the climatic conditions are severe ; and so on. In these regulations we have not one scale as provided for in the Act, but two different scales. We have one scale for officers with certain salaries. They are paid so much as daily allowances, and so much after one week's residence in .each place. That scale is about 50 per cent, higher than the scale for officers of the Post and Telegraph Department. All the officers of the service are graded, ^and the allowances are based upon salaries. In actual effect it comes to this-that an. officer in the Customs Department, the Treasury, or the Attorney-General's Department who is receiving over £ 3 0 0 per annum would receive an allowance of 10s. a day after he had been one week in a place and so long as he remained in that place; whilst an officer in the Post and Telegraph Department, whose annual salary was the same, would only receive 30s. a week That is to say, an officer of the favoured Department would receive £ 3 10s. a week, whilst officers of the Post and Telegraph Department receiving the same salaries and occupying the same grade in the service would receive only 30s. a week. I think that the Minister might fairly look into this matter. to what -has been said concerning the high qualifications of the Public Service Commissioner, I desire to remark that that officer did good and honourable service in New -South Wales He has had to undertake a gigantic task in connection with the Commonwealth Public Service, and it is very much to his credit that he has carried ifc through with the success that has attached to his labours. In passing the Public Service Act we had to deal with States where varying customs and legislation prevailed.' Our knowledge was not sufficient to enable us to do f u l l justice to the subject at that time, and the Commissioner is considerably hampered by the legislation which we passed. Probably the Minister may see the need of introducing some amending legislation, so as to do away with many of the difficulties that have been encountered. There is one matter as to which I should like to have some information from the Minister. Every now and again a notice appeal's in the Federal Government Gazette which reads very like a ""lost, stolen, or strayed "" advertisement, intimatingfcosome officer in a remote place that a Commission has been appointed to investigate charges against him. He is called upon to present himself before the Commission at a certain time on a certain day. The notice is so worded as to give the impression to the reader that action of this kind has to be taken because officers have disappeared. It seems to me to be ridiculous to send such a Commission composed of three officers to investigate a case when it appears that the officer affected will not present himself. sort happened ? I have nofc heard anything about it . so, because the notices are worded in the Government Gazettei n such a way as to lead fco that inference. 'affected reads the notice and understands it. in connection with the examination which is necessary before officers can receive increments. I understand that a number of officers in the Postal Department have been waiting for a long time for some notice as to when, according to the regulations, examinations will be held. fche Post and Telegraph Department. It is from thafc source thafc information has come to me. I have been led to believe that officers in the clerical branch have been waiting for some time for these examinations to be fixed, so that they may know whether they are to receive increments.",60,George Turner N O With The Approximate Information Long Ago Here

558,Mr Glynn (South Australia),"I dothat if a post-office is erected, the amount is debited to the State, and the percentage charged by the State for carrying out the work is added to the capital amount. When the properties have to be paid for, they will be treated in the same way as the old buildings ; in other words, the States will get credit for the capital expended, and also the amount paid as percentage. The States have to pay the money now, and hereafter they will be credited with it . It does not matter what amount we pay now, inasmuch as the States have to pay and hereafter will be credited with the amount when we are paying for the properties transferred. quite agree that it does not matter to our finances what' we pay to the States at the present moment, because what is paid is debited to the States. same time, my objection is that the amount we are paying for the services of the States officers is increasing, wbile the expenditure on our own Department is also increasing. The Minister stated that last year £6S,548 was expended on repairs and maintenance, and £44,329 on additions and buildings, making a total of £112,000. eluded otber items, such as rents, electric lights, and telephones. Affairs said that on that expenditure 6 percent, was paid, and when I asked if none of the work was done by. our own officers, he answered"" Very little."" expenditure were really £44,000 each, so that the total is £88,000. diture afc thafc figure. That would represent £5,280 paid to the States for the services of their officers, whereas the amount set down here as being paid is practically only £3,000. Therefore the Minister's explanation does not explain the matter at all. Commission at the rate of 6 per cent, upon the amount estimated to be expended next year£217,000-woul d amount to about £13,000. cluded otlieritems.
