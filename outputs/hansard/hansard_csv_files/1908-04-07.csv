THE Honorable MEMBER FOR FLINDERS The Federal Capital -AVAILABL E LAND COMMONWEALT H Victoria is considered one of the best and most up-to-d'ate Premiers which this State has had, I wish to-direct the attention of the Prime Minister to the following quotation, appearing in a leading article in yesterday's Age, of remarks made by him on the subject of immigrationWe must provide homes for those we bring here, and we must find land for our own people firs'.. There are 200 applicants for every piece of land we have to offer. Before we ask people from England to take up land, we must provide land for the sons of our own pioneers, who are leaving us because they cannot find suitable homes amongst us. My. impression is that I have heard similar remarks from the lips of the Prime Minister, and I desire to ask him if he is in unison -with the Premier of Victoria on this subject ? the Premier of Victoria has recently favoured me, he enters into the question with great fulness, explaining his attitude more clearly than in the expressions just read, with which, so far as they go, I concur. migration proposals made last week by the honourable member for Flinders, who, I understand, ingenuously offered to allow the Government to make use of his new ideas-which , by the way, are very difficult to discoverI desire to know whether the Prime Minister will, cause the honourable I stated last week member's proposals to be printed, with the new ideas appearing in block type. again before us, I can avail myself of the opportunity to consult with my honourable W h y not? friend the honourable member for Flinders.

As I have already said, it seems to me an extraordinary way' of probing these matters, to appoint, as a Committee, three members of the Cabinet, who connot be expected, in the course of human nature-withou t any imputation against their integrity-to investigate in the same fearless way that some disinterested person would be able to do. The Postmaster General is just as much involved in this inquiry as any officer in the Department. .He is the head-centre of the whole; and his conduct is just as much a subject of inquiry as is the conduct of the humblest officer. What would be said, for instance, if any member of the Committee were in close relationship to the Secretary to the Department? We find, however, that the highest officer of all, on whom the whole burden of responsibility rests, is to be judged in a sort of Cabinet council by his own coilleagues. The very Minister .who is at the head of the Department, and whose'conduct must be the subject of inquiry, is one of. the persons'chosen to make the investigation; and in that respect we have a comicality that we should not expect to find outside the pages of Gilbert and Sullivan. There are complaints about the management of the Postmaster-General; and yet that honourable gentleman is deputed to inquire into the complaints; the personi who is himself accused of mismanagement-nothin g worse than errors of judgment, or, perhaps, want of capacityis to be one of the judges; and how can we expect the public to be satisfied with such an inquiry? I cannot, a,t the present stage, refer to the Additional Estimates in detail; but everything that has -been said about sweating in the Departtnent, and about tbe miserable salaries paid, is justified by these Estimates. An enormous number of new officers are found to be necessary. we are taking the first step to reform? officers of the Department have been sweated in the past? And, further, in spite of the fact that this large number of I have no desire.to impute new officers are to be appointed, thousands of pounds are placed on the Additional Estimates to provide temporary assistance. What does that mean ? It means that the Department is escaping the necessity of properly manning and equipping the branches, by engaging a number' of employees who are not on the regular staff. ney staff are working from six in the morning until ten at night. tails, I may point out that there is a sum of ^20,000 on the Additional Estimates for further assistance in the case of New South Wales. This sum is in addition to the annual Estimates, and can only refer to. the three months of April, May, and June of this year. up for what was struck off' the main Estimates. any votes were struck off the main Estimates ; the fact that the money is provided on the Additional Estimates shows that it has to be spent in the three months. If we multiply this ,£20,000 by four,, we have ,£80,000 which ought to have been spent in New South Wales alone in carrying on this service in a state of efficiency without overworking the men or cutting down salaries. This proposed vote is in itself a revelation, and the most damning proof of all that has been said about the disorganization in the Department. Can we expect Ministers to conduct a fearless inquiry into their own conduct and their own responsibilities? Personally, I have no such expectation. Just consider the magnitude of the responsibility that rests on the Postmaster-General. In my opinion, that Minister has greater pressure on him, in the wayof actual work and responsibility, than any other member of the Government. Of course, when a Tariff is under consideration, the Minister of Trade and Customs has to bear an enormous strain; but that can be regarded as a mere passing emergency.

The Government themselves have done this. They have themselves considered it necessary to institute some authoritative inquiry. I say that if the Government came to the conclusion that an inquiry was necessary-that there were things that required to be probed and examined and reported upon-the next duty of the Ministry was to appoint some competent, disinterested, and impartial body to inquire into those matters, and to report upon them. But instead of the legitimate demands of the public being satisfied, instead of this House being guided in the way that it wanted guiding in dealing with these matters, we have had a Committee appointed which is bound to f a i l , because there is not the root idea of confidence and impartiality in the tribunal before whom the men upon whose testimony we rely will appear. of these officers who appears, voicing the dissatisfaction and discontent of the Service, complaining of injustice, complaining of wrong, complaining of neglect, complaining of miserable administration in this business of the Post Office, .will be himself sat in' judgment upon by the Minister who conducts that Department.

Committee which will destroy the possibility of our obtaining the testimony we wish to obtain. fear of anv such thing happening. region in which my honourable friend lives, it is impossible for any man to get a drink ! But. unfortunately, heavenly as are his ideas, men have some experience of public affairs.

In fact, it was so soft that. I could not stick to it ; I had to leave it. WhatI say about bringing members of the Public Service before a Committee such as this is, that if they are expected to make the freest, and fullest exposure of any irregularities in their Department, and of any shortcomings in their superiors, the Ministry should have had to examine them a Commission which would protect them in every possible way. They should not be called upon to criticise the man who sits in judg ment upon them. That is a monstrous position to put any public servant in. But that is the position these public servants will occupy. I do not expect a frank and fearless disclosure before such a Committee. It is no reflection on these public servants at all to say that one of the drawbacks to life in a business like theirs is this: I do not care how honourable you are, I do not care how fearless you are, and I do not care how able you are Every one -yo u have always a row of men above you who have a tremendous influence over your future career. It is one of the painf u l incidents of the Public Service that the members of it have joined themselves to an occupation, during the whole course of which they must be under some oneundjj'r a number of superiors-prdbabl y each one of whom can have an unfavorable influence upon their career and advancement. That is in itself a sufficiently hard position for these officers of all ranks to be put in. I enter my emphatic protest against the nature of this Committee, and I wish to say that whatever they may do, .1 am satisfied that the inquiry cannot be a thorough and fearless one. Mr W. H .

If I am wrong no doubt the honourable gentleman will set me right, but to put the matter shortly, what I find is that the revenue this year is estimated to have been increased by £ 1 7 8 , 0 0 0 , which represents an increase of 5.6 per cent. that is so, the expenditure of this Department as shown by the general Estimates, and without taking into account the Additional Estimates at all Sir with the Additional' Estimates until we come to them.

Mr W. H . IRVINE -Yes. nearly double that increase. I find, also, that the number of officers employed in the Post and Telegraph Department will have been increased by over 1,500 in number, or by 14.4 per cent., in the one year. Sir. WILLIAM LYNE I do not wish to interrupt the honourable member, but, if his speech is to go without challenge, there must be a general debate at this stage on the Additional Estimates.

88,Mr Fisher,A sinking fund for money,23,William Lyne W E Cannot Deal Additional Estimates
89,Mr Fisher,"I was questioning the inhonorable member's argument, but I do not agree with the necessity for a sinking fund for money which is paid out of revenue. Mr W. H . IRVINE member is quite right in the abstract, but although you may not have a sinking fund, you ought to debit expenditure of that kind to capital. This year a sum of £ 4 3 4 , 0 0 0 is paid out of the revenue of this year towards this expenditure of the Department. The House has declared that it should be paid out of revenue, and I think I should be quite justified in asserting that the House, in saying that it ought to be debited to the annual expenditure, has also expressed the opinion that it ought to be paid out of the annual revenue, but I do not think it would be quite fair to do so in dealing with the accounts of the Post Office as a business concern, because a good deal of the money which is expended out of revenue is expenditure which is ordinarily met by payment out of moneys borrowed. We never did such a thing in Western Auscommencing with a moderate sum in 1901-2, tralia. Mr W. H .

Mr W. H . IRVINE whether it has in fact been paid out of borrowed money or not is not) the question of that, but it entirely bears out the view to which I am asking the attention of the I have taken. If then we ought to place Committee. house out of revenue, or sets up machinery penditure of this year of a comparatively enduring character, it would not be proper to debit that as part Additional Estimates. of the ordinary annual expenditure. ought to be spread over a number of years. has forgotten that if this vear has to bear I am making this allowance, which diminonly one-tenth of its own expenditpre, it ishes the strength of my case, but I think must bear also one-tenth of each of the exit is a fair one to make. the Exchequer at Home makesloans to the stalments over ten years, then every year Post Office, which are so paid back.

I agree wholly with the Mr W. H . IRVINE I am making this calculation in the absence of any authoritative exposition from the responsible Minister and his officers. We ought to have an The honourable authoritative statement from him, with the assistance of his officers, of what ought to be taken as the period over which these expenditures are supposed to be serviceable. the annual report, which has been promised now for five years. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Yes. I think I am making a very liberal allowance indeed when, instead of attributing the whole of t n e £434JOOO to this year, I attribute only one-tenth of it to this year. Mr W. H . IRVINE 1 am glad that the Minister agrees with that statement. There will be found on page 45 of the Budget papers what is called a comparison of the years 1901 to 1908, and under the head of Postmaster-General appear on that page the various sums which in each of those years was expended out of revenue towards "" New Works and Additions,"" and reaching a very large amount this year.

99,Mr Mauger,"Every year would varyMr W. H . IRVINE given the Minister the benefit of the smaller expenditures in previous years, and instead of taking the average of the last three or four years, have gone back to the beginning, taking the weak as well as the strong years. Upon that basis, and assuming that we are justified in saying that these expenditures are of a kind that ought to be spread over ten years, the expenditure this year, instead of being ,£434,000, comes to ,£134,000I arrive at that sum by adding up all those expenditures and taking one-tenth of them-and not ,£52,000 as suggested by the Minister. If that is not a fair mode of trying to reduce this to a business proposition, I should like to have some other suggestion from those who are responsible for carrying on the Department. I am glad that the Minister agrees with me in the. estimate which 1, quite independently, arrived at, of what ought to be attributed to each year. Mr VV. H . IRVINE it as a very feeble combination if I had not the Minister's concurrence. amount has then to be added to the expenditure of this year. In order to make a fair comparison you must also add to the expenditure of last year itsproper share of the additions which had been paid for in that year and in the preceding years, and so on back to the beginning. By so doing, you will arrive at a proper account. Without wearying honourable members by going into the actual calculation, which every one can make for himself from pages 44 and 45 of the Budget papers, I find the result to be as I have stated-that the expenditure has been increased by ,£219.000 this year. Last year's expenditure, as appears from page 44 of the Budget papers, was .£2,689,000. I have to add to that year its tenth of the various payments for preceding years. cause a portion of the tenth is payinji-off the principal, and it would be reduced. Mr W. H . IRVINE one-tenth, which ought to be attributed to expenditure each year includes the tenth of each preceding year. I have added up the various tenths which ought to have been attributed to last year-the figures are all to be found in the Budgetpapers -and I find that they amount to ,£91,000. £ 2 , 6 8 9 , 0 0 0 , would produce ,£2,780,000. During the present financial year, adding the ,£134,000-whic h represents its proT r u e . I have portion-to the £ 2 , 8 6 5 , 0 0 0 , gives us a total of ,£2,999,000. I find, therefore, that these Estimates-withou t touching the Additional Estimates at all-represen t an increased expenditure of £^219,000, which is equal to 7.8 per cent. So that in respect of these Estimates alone, without taking into account one penny of the £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 additional which is being expended, we find that whilst the revenue has increased by only 5.6, the expenditure has increased by 7.8 per cent. last year? Mr W. H . IRVINE Of course. It is a fair thing to assume that the expenditure will increase in a growing concern ratio. Mr W. H . IRVINE No t in anything like the same ratio. It ought to increase at a less ratio than that at which the revenue increases. I should regard sents accumulated arrears. Mr W. H . IRVINE I must confess That that if one wishes to ascertain anything from the Budget papers-and the same remark is applicable to all Budget papers able member himself. Mr W. H .

Tvlr. W. H . IRVINE I never brought it about intentionally, but I will not answer for other Ministers. Of course, the Postmaster-General may have a complete reply to my remarks will make the position quite clear directly. Mr W. H . IRVINE No doubt. The amount of When we come to the Additional Estimates, we find that they provide for an increase in the ordinary expenditure of the Department of ,£107,000, in addition to an expenditure of £ 6 3 , 0 0 0 upon new works, without one single farthing being added to the revenue.

At the end of the present financial year the difference between the increase of expenditure and the increase of receipts will be £364,804,. not including interest on buildings, that is to say, the expenditure has increased by £532,730 in .1907-8,' while the receipts have increased by only ,£167,926, the difference being £[364,804. not propose to reduce the revenue by the adoption of penny postage? Sir WILLIA M LYNE I am not going to deal with that matter now. gentleman state what profits were made by the Department under State control ? Sir WILLIA M LYNE -That information has been given previously, and I do not wish to overweight this statement. The increase in the number of persons employed ""in the Department of the Postmaster-General is most serious. This increase in employees is necessary; but the only reason that can justify it is that previously, as the Postmaster-General says, the Department was starved. been starving it. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -In the year 1900-1 the number of. permanent employees was 9,930. Ih 1901-2 the number on the Estimates was 10,132; in 1902-3, 10,259; in 1903-4, 10,498; in 1904-5, 10,772; in 1905-6, 10,759; in 1906-7, 10,932; and in 1907-8, 12,506; an increase in one year of 1,574; whereas the previous average annual increase has been 168. The average salary was, in .1902-3, £[121, and in I 9°7-8, £[127, though in the two previous years it stood at .£133. The appointments made recently, however, have been chiefly to the lower grades of the service. When making my Budget statement, I said that I had been asked to sanction the appointment of 1,000 new hands, to which I demurred ; but I found myself compelled to make provision for the appointment of 669, apportioned among the States as follows: -Ne w South Wales, 267; Victoria, 222; Queensland, 103; South Australia, 17 ; Western Australia, 25; and Tasmania, 35. During the year, I have been repeatedly applied to by the Postal Department to sanction further expenditure, and the advances which I made over and above the provision on the Estimates practically exhausted my account. But the applications to me were so repeated and so forcible that I was bound to do the best I could. The number of temporary hands actually employed on the 31st December last was 1,908, of whom 883 were being employed in New South Wales, 300 in Victoria, 220 in Queensland, 95 in South Australia, 321 in Western Australia, and 89 in Tasmania. nent hands will take the place of temporary hands'? Sir WILLIA M LYNE -The Postmaster-General will be able to supply those details. I asked the Public Service Commissioner to inquire into the ground for every recommendation made to me, and allowed provision to 'be made only on his certificate; but I found the money for every appointment which he certified to be necessary. I therefore provided for 183 new officers out of the Treasurer's Advance. The Additional Estimates provide for 905 officers, including the 183. These offi-cers are distributed among the States as follows :-In New South Wales, 480; in Victoria, 315; in Queensland, 40; in South Australia, 43; in Western Australia, 5; and in Tasmania, 22. Adding these to the number provided in the Estimates-inChief, provision in the total Estimates for the current year has been made for 1,574 new permanent appointments. Of these, New South Wales has 747, Victoria 537, Queensland 143, South Australia 60, Western Australia 30, and Tasmania 57. Other appointments to the service do not exceed 60. Mr W. H . IRVINE I was right in saying that the increase in the Postal Department is equal to about 15 per cent. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is another matter. The Committee expects an explanation from the Postmaster-General. It is not getting one from the Treasurer. draft Additional Estimates were sent to me from the Department, although the Postmaster-General was very desirous of obtaining additional expenditure, I found it necessary to reduce his estimates by £[73,000. I did that, making what I deemed to be a safe calculation as to the revenue which I should receive, and the amount I should have to expend out of the Commonwealth one-fourth. I gave the Postmaster-General credit for £17,000 in connection with transfers from London, which he has paid into the revenue, though I declined to do so at first.",28,Williamlyne I Merely £ 2 6 9 9 6 6 7 In 1905 6 £2 784 664 I N

I do not wish it to be possible for the right honourable member for East Sydney, or any other honourable member, five or six years If that haphence, if I live so long, to point to me as the Treasurer who was responsible for this increase of expenditure. I have known such a thing done; and, therefore, I protect myself on this occasion. I think it is quite true that the employment of so many temporary hands is not conducive to economical working. Permanent hands doubtless work better; and, if they do not fully know their duties at first, they very soon learn them, and in many respects are preferable to temporary officers: Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is a very good justification for substituting permanent men for temporary men. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I am advised that, as occasion presents itself, the number of temporary hands will be reduced very considerably, and that that is the justification for the increase in the number of permanent hands. ment of the Minister apply to the increase in the number of permanent hands, to which he says he objects? ject; I am merely giving the information as to the number required, and a warning that the matter must be carefully looked into. crease in the number of temporary employees ? may say that, as Treasurer, I have had to find, I think, £[25,000 more than was voted on that scqre. When I asked Why the increased number was necessary, I was told, in addition to the reasons I have already given, that the volume of business was so great as to necessitate the, appointments; and, as I could not provide for tlie full increase of permanent employee's, meantime. My contention is that, after the number of permanent employees appointed, the number of temporary employees ought to be reduced very considerably. It must not be forgotten that the last year or two have been boom years, and, if bad seasons come, a large army of permanent employees may prove embarrassing.'

I have been blamed for doing this by those who did not know the financial position of the Commonwealth, It is very hard, indeed, to meet such a large increase of expenditure in one year, unless there is a very elastic revenue; and had it .not been for the elastic revenue obtained since the imposition of the present so-called terrible Tariff, I do not know how we -should have dealt with the expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department.

That is where the trouble has arisen.

We intend to try to do it, but the figures will be only approximate. telephone work is combined with the telegraph work. ficulty arises. it is quite possible to separate telephones and telegraphs from the purely postal work. easily accomplished., but even a statement on those lines would beapproximate. I mav add that in the last report of the Post and Telegraph Department of the United States, it is pointed out that, although the Department has been in existence for over 100 years, they are only now taking the initial steps to do the very thing that my friend, the honourable member for Flinders, asks us to do. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Does the Minister mean that we are to wait 100 years for a proper balance-sheet? remembered that we have had to amalgamate the post and telegraph affairs of six States, and that we. have had to do our work in the face of shortage of money, whilst we have paid for the whole of our new works out of revenue. That is a very great accomplishment in itself, and could not be done without very great difficulty. But I fully agree with the business priivciples laid down by the honourable member for Flinders. Already we have taken steps to take a tally during the coming year of the work done by the officers of the various branches, and to debit each Department with the cost of the work done for it. another 10,000 officers to do all that. to arrive at an approximate estimate unless it'is done. into too many details of that kind. arrive at an estimate unless we determine the basis upon which it is to be built. carry it too far, but the estimate of the cost of branches must be reasonably approximate to be of any value whatever. mates are considered in the light of the observations of the honourable member for Flinders, it will be found that this excess revenue-,£272,113-wil l practically, allow of the payment of 3 per cent, interest on transferred properties, .taking the value thereof at ,£6,000,000, and yield a balance of ,£92,113 to be brought forward.

I feel sure that most of them will scorn' it. I believe that the public officers, as a body, will act fearlessly, but proper, thorough, and independent inquiry. I do ask, "" What is there between them and this Minister; what is there between them and this Government, if their evidence, being fearless, exposes incapacity and bad administration?"" It is a thankless task. To go to the highest stagesof the Department, I will just conceive the Secretary to the Post Office taking Mr Mr .CHANTER (Riverina) [5.43] A Mauger, the Minister, to task, and saying, "" Look ljere, Mr Mauger, you have invited me to express my opinions on this Department. In my opinion, you have managed it in the most shocking way. You have no capacity for your office. In this particular case you acted foolishly. In that particular case you acted still more foolishly, and the whole of the blame for this state of things rests with you."" I should like to see where the gentleman would be who said that. I believe it would not be true, to begin with. the report. be drawn up by the Postmaster-General. Having plenty of time on his hands, he will, of course, take full notes of all the evidence, and draw up the report, which will, at least, show one fact: that since the Honourable Samuel Mauger became Postmaster-General, the Department has entered upon a new and majestic phase of improvement and development. It is sure to show that. that, what is the good of it? good of it? Fancy the honourable member reporting of the Honourable Samuel Mauger, Postmaster-General, that he has been a rank failure in his office ! Imagine the absurdity of such a report! be a failure if he did that. because, like every other man who is worth anything, he believes in himself-woul d naturally say, "" This evidence discloses a giant conspiracy to discredit me. These are all free-traders, or men who do not beminent legal and medical men in Victoria. lieve in teetotalism. My views on the liquor, traffic and on protection have poisoned the minds of the public servants who have spoken in this way of me."" That would be my honourable friend's view upon are all matters of conjecture. WhatI do emphasize is that if Ministers choose to have an inquiry, they ought to make it a This is not that. I think they will find, before the matter is done with, that they have made a great mistake, and that instead of bringing peace, contentment, and efficiency to the Department, they have made, and will make, things worse than they were. good deal has been charged against the Minister during this debate, to a great extent, on account of the want of revenue. I propose to point to one case' where the Minister has deliberately thrown away revenue without sufficient justification for his action. I approach this matter with great regret.

I hold that I was perfectly within my rights and privileges, and that there is no standing order to prevent me from reading the extract in question. statement which appears in the honorable member's written dissent from my ruling as correctly setting out the grounds on which I held that he would not be in order in reading the extract in ques-. tion. The ruling which he attributes to me is his, not mine. In this connection I am practically the sole judge of relevancy. Honourable members have abways possessed the right to discuss grievances, and are entitled to avail themselves to the fullest extent of'their privileges in that regard. The position I have taken up is that, whilst the honourable member would be in order in discussing in a general way the attitude of the Minister, he would not be in order in going into the full details of the case which he was discussing, KI were to allow the honourable member to go into minute details as to the decisions of the High Court, and in regard to various proceedings prior to the action taken by the Postmaster-General tion. the honourable member to do that, other honourable members would be entitled to claim a like privilege, with the result that we should have a debate bearing solely upon the treatment of the persons to whom the honourable member has referred, and the Estimates themselves would be entirely lost sight of. There is already in existence aii Act of Parliament which gives the P.ostmaster-General the power to take certain action, and my opinion is that,' if the Minpoint out that there is a principle involved, ister has exceeded his powers under that Act-if , as the honourable member suggests, he has been guilty of maladministrationhe is deserving of censure, and that the question should not merely be brought forward in connection with the Estimates of his Department. When the Estimates are under consideration, a discussion may take place regarding the general administration of the Department to which they relate, but an honourable member is not in order in discussing some general grievance, as the honourable member has been endeavouring to do. If I were to allow such a procedure, we should have an almost endless discussion on manv matters that could not be legitimately classed as coming within the Estimates. I have allowed the honourable member ample latitude to ventilate his grievance, but it would appear that he now desires to obtain further information beyond that for which I think he is entitled to ask while these Estimates are under consideration. The honourable member is quite in order in disagreeing with my ruling, but not on the grounds which he has stated. apprehension. I was not disputing your ruling, Mr Chairman, nor was I going into the merits or demerits of the case. The article which I wish to read does not do that, as you would have seen had I been allowed to continue. irrelevant. opinion upon the merits or demerits of the case; it draws attention to the position brought about by the High Court's decision; and points out what citizens must do if they wish to obtain redress. I took exception to your ruling because you held that I could not continue to read the article, being, doubtless, of the opinion that it dealt with the merits or demerits of the case, when I knew to the contrary. I give you my assurance that no part ' of the article does that. However, if you say that you have not ruled that, I will withdraw my motion. I merely wish to put the case before the Committee, so that justice may be done. be guided by rules which have no reference to the merits of the subject under consideration.

We must be careful not to allow our rules to be influenced by such considerations; because the ruling ofto-day is the law of to-morrow. A ' large number of honourable members may be absolutely out of sympathy with the honourable member for Riverina; but in these cases we must be most zealous in safeguarding the rights of the individual. A majority has always power to enforce its own rights; but one of the glories of our parliamentary institutions has been that a member can assert his rights against the whole House. One of our most important rights is the right to discuss the actions of Ministers in regard to their Departments, and who is to place a limit on the length of such criticism, or say in what manner it shall be made ? How is it possible to criticise the -actions of a Minister without going into the merits of the case concerned? It is -contrary to reason to assert that an honourable member can criticise the action of a Minister in regard to a particular transaction, if he has not the right to explain why, in his opinion, the Minister has acted improperly, and that he cannot do without going into the merits of the case. If the merits of the case are with the M mister, instead of being open to censure he may be entitled to the support and confidence of other honourable members. I suggest, Mr come to Parliament for redress. McDonald, that the honourable member should be allowed to go into the merits of the case. His whole address must be idle if he is not allowed to do so. the merits of the case! He has been talking two or three hours. Surely it is time that he got to them. . honourable member for Riverina, but of the rights of individual members. If one honourable member talks too .long, is that a reason why the rights of all others should be limited for all .time by a ruling of the Chair? My honourable friend or myself may to-morrow be the victims of this ruling, by being prevented from giving reasons for what we are doing, when we are basing, on the soundest ground, a protest against Ministerial action. that, when in trouble, I have received much sympathy from honourable members opposite. for Riverina would be one of the first to apply the gag to this side. to guard the rights of honourable members. I , therefore, suggest to you, Mr Chairman, that if the honourable member for Riverina is in order in canvassing the conduct of the Minister, he cannot be precluded from discussing the merits of the case. If he has a right to do that, no one can shut his mouth; if he has not, his mouth should have been closed long ago. that I am not going into the merits of the case. I wish to place the Committee in possession of information as to what the Minister .had done, and what the opinion about his action outside is. That opens up a case for inquiry. I wish to act in compliance with your ruling, and, in proposing to read the newspaper article in question, I was not transgressing it. might withdraw his motion of dissent.

I am sure he will withdraw his statement when I tell him that I never approached him in any shape or form, by word or letter, in any case with which this firm was connected in New South Wales. Parramatta referred to Tattersall's. in Tattersall's case. I am not declaiming against the Minister's opinion that a wrong is being done in regard to betting or gambling, or the publication of these matters. WhatI am declaiming against is that any Minister should take action against one firm and leave dozens of others in the same line of business untouched. The Minister cannot denv that that is the case. Does he think he has stopped gambling by prohibiting Tattersall's sweep correspondence? Is there not any amount of gambling going on in this city ? Why does not the Minister go to the Stock Exchange and the various clubs and touch them? He picks out one. There is no justice in his action. tleman is continuing the prohibition against Tattersall's, and has been worrying one or two banks who have received letters. He may to a certain extent control things that he considers improper, but he will never stop gambling by legislation, because it is a weakness of human nature that will go on for ever. Mr. KELLY -I s that any reason why he should not try to stop it? to stop it altogether. He should not pick out one case only. Within 200' or 300 yards of this building, one can see glaring instances. If the Minister has time to attend to his DepartmentI doubt if he has, because his time is apparently taken up in attending to the morals of the community-h e can find plenty of scope for the exercise of his powers. He thinks he has stopped indecent literature from going through the post, but I , and several other honourable members, recently saw passing through the post, two post-cards that would not be allowed in any decent household. I do not know how the honourable member came to overlook them. I do not pretend to be a great purist, but I can place my three score years of life against those of' most ordinary men, and thank God that I do not feel ashamed of any act of mine during that time. If a man is going to use a Department like this in order to establish himself as' the censor of everything, he should clean out the whole stable, and not one little corner of it. Is the honourable member afraid to do it? Are there influences behind that personally or politically he fears? Why is he not courageous enough, if he takes action in one case, to take it in others? Why does he not prove himself right in this case by granting some' form of inquiry by which fair play will be given? the big daily papers? left out quite a number of advertisements. Library at any time paper after paper * with that sort of advertisement in it. I feel strongly upon this matter. An absolute outrage has been perpetrated by the Minister., and his conduct now is not conducive to good government.

747,Mr Thomas Brown (Calare;,"justify him in dealing with them at considerable length. The first one relates to the question of the retirement of public seivants upon attaining a certain age, namely, from sixty to sixty-five years. The Commissioner deals with this question on pages 12 and 13 of his report. He points out that during 1906 some 35 officers were obliged to retire on account of having attained the age limit, and that during 1907-8 181 officers will be due to retire. He also directs attention to. the particular action of the Postal Department in retaining the services of an officer who has passed themaximum '.age limit, namely, sixty-five years.. He regards this matter as of so. much importance-so far as it affects the efficiency of the service-that he has forwarded a long communication to the Department in regard to it. He points out the evil of allowing officers-n o matter how efficient or how expert they may have been -to occupy an important position in the service, after attaining the age limit, and the reasons which actuated Parliament in fixing that limit. Just .one quotation from his letter will set out his position. He writes. If the promotion of officers to the highest positions is delayed until they are Hearing the statutory age, no marked improvement can be expected in the Service. When they get to the highest positio-is they have only a few years to serve, and naturally make little effort to effect reforms or improve things, their main object being, with few exceptions, to make matters comfortable for themselves for the few years they have to remain. This must be bad for the public interest: but if officers go to "" the top"" in the earlier years of .their lives, they naturally has pointed out He says that the state set out lo improve matters, and so build up an official reputation. That is the effect which it has upon the rank and file. But the effect, which it has upon the officer primarily concerned, and upon the service through him, is set out in the following paragraphIn a Service where officers are kept on beyond the term of sixty-five years, it must inevitably follow that their successors are likely to be has taken this matter in hand, and promen who liavebeen accustomed to an antiquated rigime, especially when the head posir tions have been filled for a series of years by men nearing the retiring age, because when an officer is approaching the time for his severance from the Service, he makes little effort to change things; his mind, as a rule, is not so receptive as a younger man's, and, as a consequence, his conservatism becomes accentuated. Those are the positions which the Commislaw on the subject, it ought to apply unisioner sets out. He lays down very clearly versally. what will be the effect upon the service if there is any departure from the law, and' I am contending for. Mr Thomas Brown. he draws special attention to the case of a leading officer in the Postmaster-General's Department being retained over the age limit, and the demoralizing effect which it has upon the whole service. Take the cases of men, some of whom do not hold very high positions or receive large salaries, out of which they can provide for their old age, and whose superannuation allowance, if any, is very small. As soon as these men reach the age limit, they are required to go. Their cases cannot be given special consideration. They are told, ""That is the law and the policy of the Commonwealth,"" . and their appeals are passed over without result. In this particular case, however, the Postmaster General makes a departure in favour of his right-hand mana gentleman against whom I am not prepared to say a ""word; who has administered the Department with very considerable capacity, and who has command of his faculties despite his increasing years. It is not from the point of the individual, as the Commissioner points out, that this matter has to be looked at; we have to consider the effect which it will have on the whole Department. If the Minister can make a departure from the practice on behalf of his leading officer, where is the line to be drawn ? Why not allow the humble man in the back country, who is,perhaps, supervising the construction of telegraphs or telephones, or any man in the lower.grades of the service, the same privilege as is . extended to this leading officer? If that were permitted, it would produce the effect which the Commissioner of affairs under the Commonwealth would drift back to what it was under the States, and that for years officers would be kept out. of their well'-earned promotion. It must be borne in mind that the legitimate expectations of all the younger officers is a matter of nO less consideration than the pecuniary circumstances of officers who have reached the retiring age. I understand that .the honourable member for Kalgoorlie poses to test the feeling of the Committee on the policy which .the Postmaster-General has initiated of practically breaking down the spirit of the ""law in the interests of a particular officer in his Department.",60,Brown W E Thought We Can See His Way Clear Eve N At This Late Hour

749,Mr Thomas Brown,"That is what'of the ladder has to go out when he reaches the age limit, a man at the top ought to go out also. the Commissioner is contending for. In his report, he says that the law should be honorably observed, and applied not merely to the officers in the lower grades, but right through the service I can well understand the demoralizing effect which this departure will have. devoted their lives to the Public Service, just as completely as this particular officer has done, and given the country the benefit of their abilities, are informed, When they reach the age of sixty-five years, that they must retire in the terms of the Act. They naturally say, "" If we were only placed alongside the Ministerial chair; if we were fortunate enough to hold the position which his leading officer occupies, how different would our treatment be."" on the part of the Postmaster-General is not justified, and must tend to. restore the state of affairs which obtained in the preFederal days, and which the House set out 1 to reform when it framed the Public Service Act. I think that this initial move of the Postmaster-General should not be allowed to pass by without a Protest, and certainly the Public .Service Commissioner has done his duty to the Public Service and to this House in calling attention' to a breach of the spirit of the law by the Postmaster-General. Another matter is dealt with by the Commissioner on page 23 of his report. Under the head of "" Evasions of the L a w , "" , he deals with the case of another officer in the Postmaster-General's Department. A very able and courteous officer, who ranks ' next to the Secretary, is suddenly promoted from the clerical to the administrative staff, and we have, as the Commissioner points out, the anomaly of two administrators in one Department. trators in the Department of Trade and Customs? missioner points out that that case is provided for, but that this one is not.

I do not desire to weary the Committee by reading the whole of the correspondence about this case, as it is in print. I believe that if honourable members will peruse it carefully they will see that there has been a very sharp conflict between the Commissioner and the head' of. this Department. with respect to this appointment, and that an officer, without his duties having been increased, has been raised from the clerical to the administrative staff, and thus given an increased salary which the Act does hot allow to him as a clerical officer. sioner very .properly asks, if the Postmaster-General wishes to give to this officer an increased salary for the services that he renders, why not raise the salaries of all clerical officers who are performing equally important work? sioner explain why he raised a man's salary above the amount fixed in the Act for the clerical division? aware that he did. of ,£650 for an officer. bility is that an explanation will be forth' coming. challenged about the matter and made no reply. very strong stand which the Commissioner has taken in this case, I feel, very sure that there is a reply to that challenge; and that it can be obtained by the honourable member if he sO desires. sioner claims that this action on the part of the Post and Telegraph Department is a direct evasion of the law, and that instead of adding strength it introduces weakness in that it has created two administrative heads. If the Minisnot say anything about the way in which the Commissioner evades the law in the case of the lower officers, particularly in regard to the Boards of Inquiry. sioner has to work according to the Act, and I believe that no one would welcome more cordially a thorough investigation of, or a means of investigating, these matters than he would. It seems to me, from his attitude, that the whole desire of the Postmaster-General' is to magnify the central bureau.and make it practically a supervising department for the whole Commonwealth. be? reason that in point of territory this is a very big Commonwealth, and that it is impossible to administer Post and Telegraph affairs effectively from a central office.

If honourable members wish to find out how much the working of the Department is clogged by the system of centralization, they have only to' look up the Commissioner's report. He shows the need for greater decentralization, and quotes a pertinent paragraph from the report of a Commission .which recently investigated the tendency to centralization in Great Britain.

Offi-; cars in the lower branches-of the service when approaching the age of sixty-five years, are treated with contemptible meanness. Instead of being allowed to remain until that age is reached, and then being given the six months' leave to which they are entitled, they are made to retire at the age of .sixty-four and a-halt years, no matter how capable they may be. I protested against the retention of Sir Charles Todd, as a bad precedent. Under the present system, officers who have been at the head of Departments have ex-Ministers pleading for them, as has happened tonight. I remember when the honourable member for Coolgardie protested against the retention of the services of Sir Charles Officers who Todd. turned out of the service before they have reached the age of sixty-five, the rights which are supposed to be preserved to them by the Constitution are violated.

But what do we find? In the Post and Telegraph Department, men who have for years applied themselves faithfull y to the performance of their duties, times without number find officers appointed over their heads, and they have no redress. I am reminded by the position of the head of a Department of the story that a little boy once asked his father, What is a great man ? and the father said, "" A great man, my son, is. a man who has a lot of assistants around him, whotake the blame for all his mistakes, whilst he takes credit for all their good ideas."" The heads of Departments occupy just that position. Men below them get credit for nothing. Unfortunately, it happens in a great number of cases that if a man is a horticulturist, and makes presents of nice^ flowers occasionally, or of a pet bull dog, or, in other words, if he is lickspittle, it is possible for him to secure promotion over men who would not stoop to that sort of thing. It is possible in these Departments for a man to have an officer put over his head who is by many years his junior, and he is unable, to prevent it . ber think that if we reverted to political and discontent which is being causeci in influence that would be prevented? to show how it might be prevented. not blaming the Public Service Commisshould not obtain. sioner for what occurs. He can only make use of the machinery with which he is provided. heads of Departments, who, being human, to count before seniority. are influenced by ""human likes and dislikes, and as a result the most capable man does foolish to promote a numskull just benot always secure promotion. We are told cause he is the senior, but, fitness being that he is the best judge. in our Public Service instead of an appointto get the chance, and, if it is not offered ment being made before a man who is ento him, he should have an opportunity of titled to look for it becomes aware of what proving his fitness. . is being done, every appointment should be made as from some future date. man who feels aggrieved should be able to that his junior is more fit? : That is riot asking too much. Our public servants the man knows of it is when the appointment is gazetted. I knew a case in the Melbourne General Post Office, where a man of exceptional ability was overlooked. Another man was placed over his head, and he knew nothing of it until the appointment was gazetted. He complained to the Commissioner, who admitted that he believed that he had not been fairly dealt with, but added that the appointment had been made, and that there could be no redress. That sort of thing is not fair, and men treated in that way cannot be expected to apply themselves to their work with the same zeal as before. AgainI say I do not blame the Commissioner. He may make mistakes, and in any case he could not please everybody. But I blame the present system. The law should be altered so that a man who feels aggrieved might be allowed to prove .his fitness for the position beforehand. His claim could be. easily tested by examination. If he does prove his fitness, and is the senior, he should undoubtedly get the reward of his seniority and fitness. I believe that, under the present system, this sort of injustice is more rampant in the Post and Telegraph Department than in any other, and that is why I am applying myself so strongly to it now. The Minister must have had cases of the sort brought under his notice. Undoubtedly, the Commissioner has, and somethe Department by the influence which is No , but I propose retarding the promotion of some men, and I am selecting others to fill posts which they He has to take his advice from seniority ought to count; but fitness ought But I say that anything like equal, the senior man ought The the senior officer if his superior officer says",68,Brown W E Thought We Can See His Way Clear Eve N At This Late Hour

The first letter, dated 31st October, 1906, embodies a suggestion from Mr Scott that the position of Assistant Secretary should be created in order to relieve him of duties that could not otherwise be transferred, and a recommendation that Mr Oxenham be appointed to the position, that Mr Templetoh be appointed senior clerk, and that another accountant should be appointed.

HadI been here I should have challenged the remark instantly. I venture to say that the deputies are striving their very utmost to do their duty, and so far as-my knowledge of them goes, they have any thing but a rosy time of it. I know an officer in Sydney who acted as temporary . Deputy months. He is a man of ability and loyalty, as the Minister knows. When a selection had to be made of a Deputy Postmaster-General for that State this man would not put in an application for the position. He had had quite enough of it. He was only there sixmonths and did not want to occupy the position any longer. When 'we see this kind of thing going on through all the ranks of the service from the bottom to the top we must recognise that there is a want of tone and effective control.

If honourable members will think over that for a moment they will see that the beginning of the trouble is undue centralization.

Compulsory retirement of an officer after he has reached a certain age is a very good provision as a general rule, and I snould like to see its application extended even to the High Court; but where there are special reasons for retaining the services of a particular officer, the Minister should have the power to retain them. have said that I am glad that Mr Scott's services have been retained,. heard from the honourable member for Parramatta a strong defence of the Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales, and of the staff generally in the head-office at Sydney. We have heard that they are unduly interfered with by the Central Office of the Department. I have only to say that since I became a member of the Federal Parliament, and even before that, I have not been very favourably impressed by the way in which the authorities of the head-office in Sydney treated the constituency I represent, which is as much a part of New South Wales as is Parramatta, or any other constituency in that State. Since the establishment of the Federal Parliament, and after bringing grievances existing in my constituency under the notice of I the Central Office, I have been blocked in my efforts-to obtain justice and fair play. I might instance a number of cases, but I shall mention one in particular. It has been said that the Central Office of the Department deals unfairly with the staff at the head-office in Svdney; but this is the way in which the head-office in Sydney treats subordinates in the back-blocks of New,South Wales: Some time since, a young fellow was engaged as a temporary hand at BrokenH ill , and was paid 25s. a week. He was entitled, after a time, to a. holiday of four weeks. He went up for . his examination, asked for four weeks' holiday, and obI take it that the motained it. Whilst OIT holiday lie discovered that he had failed in the examination, and consequently was unable to go on to the permanent staff. But in the midst of his holiday' he was asked by then Department to go into the office and do certain work. He did so, and when he found that he could, not 'become a permanent hand, and his time was up, he asked to be paid for the time that he had put in at the request of the Department during his holidays. That seemed to be a fair and just demand. The postmaster at BrokenH ill sent the claim on, but the I am unable to say, as Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney refused to pay the lad for the two or three weeks for which he had worked during the holiday to which he was entitled. I brought the case before the Central Office in Melbourne, and Mr Scott said he'must have a report, although from the way in which I put it he admitted that it appeared unjust that the lad should not be I paid. He added,, however, that ""there were always two sides to a question,and We have he must hear the other side. I am. glad to know that the boy was eventually treated justly, and received the amount that he claimed. ' That case does not show any very great fair play on the part of the head .office in Sydney towards those in subordinate positions.

I believe I was the first in this House to advocate the toll system. I have always believed in it. One argument which had great weight with me was that the people with large businesses received under the flat rate a great deal more service from the Department than they were paying for. The very fact that a I the toll system confers added benefits on those who remain under the flat rate.

Complaints are repeatedly made regarding delays in connection with the trunk line between West Maitland, Newcastle, and Sydney. An expensive line has been constructed, as I have mentioned, between Melbourne and Sydney, but although the charge in respect of the West MaitlandNewcastle-Sydney trunk line is nearly the same, subscribers have often to wait for hours to get connected. I appeal to the Postmaster-General to give special attention to this complaint. He has promised that the service will be improved, but his promises so far have not been fulfilled. I agree with the remarks made by the honourable member for Barrier regarding the postal inspectors. tricts, we have two inspectors, where there should probably be six, and consequently 1 they have so much travelling to do that their duties cannot be satisfactorily carried out. has no more money. the necessary funds, but to my mind they are badly distributed.

Year after year, in connection with the consideration of the Estimates, I have had promises made to me; but have not been able to obtain their fulfilment. As the Treasurer appears to be in a yielding mood, I think rt' desirable, however, to again bring forward certain grievances, although my experience is that very little is gained by discussing the Estimates. It is true that the Post and Teflegraph Department' does not deal hurriedly with any question that comes within its purview. If the Ministry imagine that the discontent in the service will be allayed, or the demand for an investigation removed, by the appointment of the Cabinet Committee of Inquiry, 'they are making a huge mistake.

Of course nothing can be done except by the An extra inspector is prowill of Parliament, but at present the Queensland State Government are paying better. Any one examining the matter free from prejudice must, see that it is fair that the Commonwealth Government should pay, for the obvious reason that every State should have a share in the mail service, and that the service which is being carried on in the interval has all the restrictions contained in the new contract. I hope that the Postmaster-General and the Treasurer will consider this matter before the final set of In regard to stamps, Estimates is dealt with. I regret very much the answer given by the Postmaster-General regarding the installation of the telephone toll system. It seems to me, from his answer, that he has not yet discussed whether any step in that direction is to be taken. It practically means that nothing has been done in the Department, and that its policy is to allow things to drift. I did not expect him to say tonight that he intended to introduce the toll system to-morrow. But I certainly expected him to say whether it was intended to take any step in that direction. it will come to the toll system. idea as fo the time when it will be established? For instance, will it be done in six months, or twelve years, or fifty years? Perhaps he will tell us that it cannot be done until the expiration of the Braddon section. I do not intend to support the proposal before the. Committee; but had the salary of the Minister been under review, the probability is that I should have been prepared fo vote for a reduction of it, because I feel that the matter of the toll system has not been discussed by him.",85,William Lyne Th E Honourable Estimates

A little time ago I , ' as leader of the Labour Party, was waited upon by a number of men who had been employed by the Department in dressing telegraph poles, and who, by some act of the Department, or the Public Service Commissioner, had been deprived of work to which they considered they were entitled. I think that they mentioned that, owing to some act of the Minister, they could no longer be employed in that way. I have already mentioned the matter to the honourable gentleman. If I remember aright all these men were tradesmen, who were employed at 10s. a day, until it was discovered by the Commissioner or the Department that they could C/;t ' younger persons to do the work at a cheaper rate. I should like the Minister to state whether there is any likelihood of these elderly persons being employed again on the work. master-General) [12.56 a.m.] -The men to whom the honourable member has alluded were temporary employees 'in the pole-yard. After representations were made to various Ministers, that they, ought to be paid the rate of skilled labour, namely, 10s. a day, I made a minute in regard to their payment, and also, the payment of temporary telephone fitters. I directed that the ruling rate outside should be paid inside the Department to temporary labourers over whom I had control. That was the order. I issued, after the men had importuned me quite a number of times, not. because I felt that their request was a right one. Afterwards I had a conversa* tion with the Commissioner, who is strongly of opinion that the work is classified too highly at 10s. a day. His officers agree with him that 8s. or 8s. 6d. a day is enough. He is doing what-he has the right to do under the Public Service Act. He is appointing permanent officers to perform the work at the rate which he has fixed,. and over which I have. no control. He considers that the public will be better served by permanent employees, that the rate which he has adopted is ample, and that the people who have been receiving temporary employment have been well treated.
