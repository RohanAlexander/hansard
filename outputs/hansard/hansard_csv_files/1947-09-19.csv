How many valuers have accepted retainers for the purpose, and why has this anticipatory action been taken? usually well informed ' about these matters, I . have not heard of the one which tlie honourable member mentioned. to. you, Mr Speaker, as the custodian of the' forms and privileges of this House. A report in to-day's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald states that Mr A. J. Dalziel, private secretary to the Attorney-General, alleges that a check, made of a petition presented to the Attorney-General's Department opposing the Government's banking proposals discloses some disconcerting features. The petition purports to have been signed hy some 4,082 voters in the Attorney-General's electorate of Barton, and the report statesThe check reveals that, there arc 2,397 sigpresents a petition which he has received natures without addresses; 301 of those who is a matter that is left -entirely to his have signed give addresses which are not in the discretion. electorate of-Barton; 53 persons signed the. petition and then crossed their names out. Of the telegrams of protests received, it is noted that batches of them have the same office of origin and have been lodged at tlie name time. Some of the telegrams give incorrect addresses, while other names and addresses cannot be traced in the electoral roll. As petitions are being presented to this House, will yon, sir, state what is their standing, and what is the position generally in relation to them? Is it necessary that they shall conform to accuracy? Should those who sign them be enrolled for the electorates in which they purport to originate? ""What other relevant circumstances are there in connection with the presentation of petitions to this honourable House? MT."" SPEAKER -The normal course is that an honourable member who presents a petition assures the House that it is respectfully worded, concludes with a prayer, and is otherwise' in conformity with the rules and orders of the House. My personal belief is that some degree of responsibility devolves upon a member to ensure, to the best of his ability, that those who sign a petition are, as they purport to be, electors of the division mentioned in it, and that their addresses are accurately stated. All petitions stress that the signatories to them are electors of the divisions mentioned in them, and it . is the duty of honourable members, when presenting them, to inform the House of any knowledge they may havf to the contrary. many Labour members on the Government side of the House have received from their electors petitions objecting to. the proposed banking legislation, and have failed in their duty to present them to the House, will you, Mr Speaker, state what procedure should be adopted by such petitioners to ensure thattheir petitions will be presented to this House, through you? ber is quite wrong, in stating that the duty devolves upon a member to present' a petition to this House. No such duty is imposed on him, ""Whether or not he Minister and Treasurer) I desire to inform honourable members that, during the absence abroad of the Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt), the Minister for Health and Minister for Social Services (Senator McKenna) will act as Attorney-General and I shall act as Minister for External Affairs.

I understand that he proposes to introduce the budget today, but that the general debate on it will not be resumed before the expiry of a week from its introduction. Presumably, that will mean that on Wednesday next, some other business will be brought before the House. Can the right honourable gentleman say what that business will be? proposed to sit regularly four days a week from the week after next until the end of the sessional periods, or is it intended that the House shall sit four days only in the week after next? Minister and Treasurer) [10.37] -in reply-Next week the motion by the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) that certain papers relating to international affairs be printed will be discussed, and, following that discussion, it is proposed to consider the motion to extend to the relatives of personnel lost of the Minister for Defence( Mr and missing, and to injured personnel Dedman) relating to post-war defence. In reply to the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) I have to say that, unless some change of circumstances arises it is the intention of the Government that the House shall sit four days a week until the end of the present period of the session. The budget debate will commence on a date to be arranged with the Leaders of the Opposition parties. T understand that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) desire a week in which to consider the budget statement before discussing it.

Question resolved in the affirmative. HMAS. WARRNAMBOOL. Loss INMINE SWEEPING OPERATIONS. Minister for the Navy inform the House of the circumstances associated with the loss of HMAS . Warrnambool during 1 mine-sweeping operations off the coast of Queensland, and can he say whether danger money for mine sweeping is being paid to personnel so engaged? regret that I inform the House of the loss of the mine sweeper HMAS. Warrnambool on Saturday, the 13th September, while engaged on mine-sweeping operations. Unfortunately, the loss of the ship was accompanied by loss of life, and also resulted in injuries to personnel, including the commanding officer. All the men of the ship have been accounted for with the exception of one who is missing, and, I fear, lost. Three have died. Of those injured, three at present remain on the critically injured list, five on the dangerously injured list, eight on the seriously injured list, two on the slightly injured list, one on the general improvement list, and eleven have gone on leave. I take this opportunity and their relatives, the deep sympathy of the Government. I earnestly hope for a speedy recovery of all the injured. Warrnambool struck a moored mine in an Allied mine-field while engaged on mine-sweeping operations north of Cockburn Reef, which is approximately 12 miles north of Cape Grenville. H.M.A. ships Swan, Warrnambool, Mildura and Katoomba, together with two harbour defence motor launches, were employed on that operation. At the time of the accident, Warrnambool was second sweeper in line stationed on Swan's quarter. Swan's sweep fouled an obstruction and parted just before crossing the line of mines. Warrnambool altered course away from the line of mines to move into safe water and struck a mine as she did so. Efforts were made to tow Warrnambool clear of the mine-field by a harbour defence motor launch, but owing to the strong tidal stream Warrnambool drifted back towards the line of mines and was finally abandoned after an hour. Later, the vessel sank.",13,Special Adjournment

India is sold by the Australian Wheat Board at prices determined by that board. In recent negotiations with the representative of the Indian Government we assured him that any wheat sold to India would be landed in that country, subject to supplies of jute being made available to Australia. The Indian representative explained that his Government issued licences for the export of jute, but it had no power to compel exporters to ship the complete quota for which licences had been issued.

When I was in Britain1 discussed, with leading members of the British Civil Service the reduction of postal rates on parcels, and I found that the British Ministry of Food is strongly opposed to any such reduction. Therefore, the responsibility for maintaining the existing rates does not rest on the Australian Government at all. a reduction of the rates? I have informed the House that the Commonwealth Government has offered no objection to a reduction. It has consulted with the United Kingdom Government as one of the. parties to the agreement, but that Government has refused to agree to any reduction. In the circumstances, no purpose would be served by pursuing the matter further. My efforts while abroad were directed to persuading the United Kingdom Government to agree to an alteration of the agreement. occasion I made representations to the Treasurer for the payment of compensation to the Townsville City Council for. damage done to its roads by heavy military traffic during the war. The result was that the council was paid an amount of about £3,000. Howeverj the Cairns City Council,, and, I believe, the Charters Towers City Council, were each paid £7.000 for war damage to roads. The Treasurer obtained particulars of this matter when he visited Queensland recently. Can he now inform me whether further consideration has been given to the Townsville City Council's application for compensation ? circumstances mentioned by the honourable member. The Ministerrepresenting the Acting Attorney-General informs me that a report on this matter will be available soon. I hone to be able to answer the question within the next week or two.

Will he also state the number of. electorates in respect of which compensation has been paid, and the principles on. which the compensation has been determined? lection of any statement having been published in regard to this matter. It is true that where cases are proved of unusual damage or unusual wear occasioned by Army vehicles, recompense is made to the local governing body concerned. However, no figures have been prepared showing the total amount which has been paid to local governing bodies, but I shall obtain a statement of the amounts paid and, if possible, furnish details of some cases.

The honourable member's statement regarding declining production demands some explanation. He has apparently misconstrued facts and figures. I read a few days ago in the Sydney Morning Herald that, since 1939, the milk consumption of Sydney and Newcastle had increased by 26,000,000 gallons a year, which, according to a rough calculation, represents about 7,000 tons of butter a year. The fact that a reduced quantity of butter is. available for export to Great Britain at certain periods is due to the fact that, under the regime of this Government, there has been full employment, higher purchasing power, and consequently a greater opportunity for workers to buy milk. ing been a factor? ber for Eichmond is well aware that whole milk is not rationed, and if unrestricted supplies of milk as such are provided for human consumption reduced quantities will be available for the manufacture of butter. The substantial increase of consumption is due to ful l employment, higher purchasing power and the greater measure of prosperity under this Government. have suggested to me that the grievous lack of shipping to Western Australia can be remedied if overseas ships were permitted to pick up goods available in the eastern States and transport them to Western Australian ports.

That application, like other applications from sporting parties, was refused. Because of the difficulty experienced in the purchase of petrol from abroad the policy of the department has been to refuse all applications for special trips other than those required to provide essential services. That policy has been applied to any applications made by both Australian National Airways and Trans-Australia Airlines, but in one instance in which Australian National Airways had made prior application for a special trip to Newcastle from Melbourne permission was granted under certain conditions. The special arrangement was that the service would carry a team to Sydney on its ordinary daily service, and that it would be permitted to operate an additional aircraft to Newcastle and return to Sydney. I assure the honourable member that no unfair discrimination has been made in the treatment accorded to the different airlines.

In Committee of Supply: Minister and Treasurer) [11.45] I move That tlie first item in the Estimates under Division No. 1-The Senate-namely , "" Salaries and Allowances, £9,900 "", be agreedto. I desire to explain to the committee the estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 1947-48, and to expenditure in 1946-47. It is most satisfactory to record that during the financial year just closed employment in Australia rose to levels never before reached in peace-time. At the end of June this year the number of people in civilian work was 3,212,000. This was 200,000 above June, 1946, and and higher prices, especially for wool and wheat, led to an increase during the year in the incomes of primary producers, output rose in most of the basic secondary industries and there was a marked expansion of new manufacturing enterprises. Housing made substantial progress, though hampered by shortages of labour and material's. Estimates of national income and expenditure in 1946-47. are contained in a separate paper which, is being circulated with the budget papers. Mainly because of these conditions, actual revenue in 1946-47 was £412,000,000 as against the estimate of November. The largest increases were £5.000.000 and customs and excise duties £13,00.0,0.00,",23,Dutch Aircraft

The budget estimate was £147,000,000. charges, on the other hand, involved an expenditure of £161,000,000 compared with an estimate of £131,000,000. Expenditure on this item, however, included the g if t of £25,000,000 to the United Kingdom, for which provision had not been made in the budget. Credits against defence and post-war charges were £58,000,000 compared with a budget estimate of £57,000,000. Net expenditure on defence and post-war charges was, therefore, £232,000,000, this being £11,000,000 above the estimate. Other expenditure was £218,000,000 which was £5,000,000 below estimates. Total expenditure in 1946-47 therefore was £450,000,000 as compared with the budget estimate of £444,000,000 and the gap between revenue and' expenditure, which was financed from loan moneys, was £38,000,000 aga inst a budget estimate, of £59,000,000. Details of revenue and expenditure for 1946-47 compared with the budget estimates are given in statement No. 1. In addition the main heads of aggregate war expenditure to 30th June, 1947, are set out in statement No. 5 and details regarding loan transactions and tbe public debt in statement No . 6. In the course of my speech I shall refer to a number of statements have been prepared and which more detailed information on the matters to which reference is made. concurrence of the HouseI shall incorporate these statements in Hansard. As honourable members know, our objective to live for the time being reserves of international currency in w it h in our external income and, if creased considerably during the war necessary, to restrict imports from all period and the greater part of these sources and so avoid the need to call upon reserves are held in London. A number of factors contributed this increase. Our export income during t r y to balance our trade exactly month by the war was fairly well maintained and month, for that would have been impracimports of non-essentials were restricted. made of war supplies but a considerable in adverse circumstances turn downwards part of these was made available under so far that it would be inadequate to pay lend lease and mutual aid This gain was offset by the reciprocal Should such an emergency arise the whole Mr Chifley. aid extended to the United States forces which had the effect of reducing export Post-war income. But the cash expenditure of American troops resulted in the accrual of very large sums in dollars which were sold to the United Kingdom against payment in sterling. Other countries also accumulated sterling balances, some to a much greater extent than Australia, and since these balances amounting in all to more than £3,500,000,000 sterling were demand liabilities, the United Kingdom had perforce to seek arrangements w it h the holders as to what would be done with them. Under the financial agreement with the United States, the United Kingdom Government did in fact state its intention to make such arrangements. The Commonwealth Government recognized how vital this problem was to the United Kingdom and gave much thought as to how Aitstralia could best assist. A g if t of £25,000,000 made during the last sessional period as a contribution towards war costs incurred by the United Kingdomi n the Pacific zone acted to reduce our sterling balances, and discussions were entered upon with the United Kingdom authorities in relation to the remaining balances. I myself talked the matter over in a general way with the Chancellor of the Exchequer when I was in London last year. Subsequently I arranged for the Secretary to which the Treasury, Mr S. G. McFarlane, to contain proceed to Londonf or the purpose of further discussions. With the As a result of these discussions the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr Atlee, suggested to me that Australia could, help them most in their present difficulties if we would take it as a broad our accumulated London funds.

The essence of the United Kingdom proposal was rather that while doing our utmost to increase exports both to the United Kingdom and elsewhere we would over a period endeavour to keep imports within the limit of what we could pay for from our current overseas earnings. Taking all factors into account the Commonwealth Government thought that this would be a reasonable arrangement. Indeed with our knowledge of how the United Kingdom stands and our desire to help it by every means possible it is the kind of thing we would have tried to do in any case because every day makes more evident the urgent nature of its ueeds. Accordingly I have personally conveyed to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on behalf of the Commonwealth Government the assurance that Australia will do its utmost to assist negotiated it was expected it would last Hi em in the ways they have suggested 10 UB. THE DOLLAR SCARCITY PROBLEM. I now turn to the dollar problem with which we are faced irrespective of the main factors which worked against the size of our total export income and the amount of our sterling balances. Ausprices in the United States, the delay in tralia, and the sterling area as a whole, is not able to earn sufficient dollars to cover the imports which it is desired to in Europe and the Far East, the severe obtain from the United States or from Canada. ""While this situation continues into United States dollars after the 15th rationing of dollars is unavoidable no matter what happens to our sterling balances. The United States and Canada escaped ing currently earned sterling into other war devastation and quickly regained currencies for current transactions. their peace-time production. On the other hand, many countries, particularly the war devastated countries of Europe, faced pedients to build up sterling for the enormous difficulties in reconversion and purpose of conversion into dollars. This still have a long way to go. As a result the United States has been dollar loan .in July and August.

Later, of course, when the matter has been fully discussed, I shall make further public statements upon it.

106,Mr Chifley,"An examination ofco-operate with the United Kingdom in making economies in dollar expenditures. The Government proposes to continue this co-operation in the fullest degree and in order to assist the United Kingdom in its present dollar crisis has decided on drastic measures to reduce imports involving dollar expenditure. Details of these measures have already been announced. The Government is keeping the position under constant review and further measures will he taken as necessary. Apart from a limited range of less £33,500,000 to research and development essential goods all imports from the and £17,500,000 to the Departments of United Kingdom and other parts of the Munitions and Supply and Shipping. sterling area are at present admitted without restriction. It is desired to avoid, if possible, any new restrictions on sterlfor service and production departments ing imports. However, it should be made this year relates to war-time commitments clear that if our export prospects and includes £5,000,000 for deferred pay deteriorate it may be necessary to impose and £7,000,000 for the cost of certain over-all import cuts in order to carry out Army and Navy equipment supplied onr undertaking to the United Kingdom during the war. The maintenance of our that we shall do our utmost to avoid forces in Japan is also covered. drawing on our accumulated sterling balances. 1947-48. Met expenditure on defence and postwar charges in 1947-48 is estimated tc be £168,000,000 as compared with £232,000,000 in 1946-47 and £378,000,000 in 1945-46. Of this £168,000,000, expenditure overseas is expected to account for £18,000,000. Last year overseas war expenditure was £77,000,000. Provision is sought for gross expenditure on defence and allied services this year of £80,000,000 against £129,000,000 last year and for post-war charges this year of £120,000,000 against expenditure last year of £161,000,000. Credits for 1947-418 are estimated at £32,000,000 as compared with £58,000,000 in 1946-47. Full details of defence and post-war charges are given in Statement No. 4. Defence and AlUed Services. An amount of £75.000,000 is provided this year for expenditure by service and of po;t-war charges. Expenditure of prodnctaon departments whereas actual £161,000,000 during 1946-47 on this item expenditure last year was £121,000,000.. included non-recurring items such as the Of this £75,000,000 it is estimated that £40,000,000 will be spent under the postwar defence plan, details of which were given to the House, during the last sessional period. It will be recalled that this plan provided for the development of a comprehensive system of modern defences which would be commensurate with the new strategic responsibilities of Australia in the SouthWestern Pacific zoue. It envisaged the expenditure over five years of £250,000,000 of which £200,000,000 is to be allocated to the three . services, The balance of £35,000,000 provided Payments of war gratuity are estimated at £5,000,000 this financial year a against £3,000,000 last year. Thus, while expenditure on defence and allied services includes some commitments carried over from the war effort of 1939-45,. a very substantial part represents the cost of peace-time defence measures. Australia at the present time is taking a major share in the responsibilities of British Commonwealth countries for the occupation of Japan. We are also in the process of creating a strong nuclear defence force comprising naval, military and air elements and at the same time we are pushing ahead with fundamental research into some of the most advanced problems of modern scientific defence.' The amount of the provision made in this budget should emphasize how largely defence must bulk from a financial standpoint, especially if compared with levels of defence expenditure in pre-war years. Post-war Charges. Similar considerations apply in respect United Kingdom grant of £25,000,000 and the lend-lease £S,000,000. ' Moreover, of Australia's contribution of £24,000,000 to Unrra only £4,000,000 remains to be met this financial year. Our contribution of £4,000,000*to Post-Unrra relief was met out of last year's accounts. Notwithstanding these reductions, total expenditure on post-war charges in 1947-48 is estimated at £120,000,000. This includes expenditure on. re-establishtax-compare d with £65,000,000 last ment and repatriation of £39,000,000, an increase of £10,000,000, due mainly to a larger intake of ex-service trainees by technical colleges and universities. The estimate for such training this year is £15,300,000 against expenditure last year of £9,400,000. Expenditure on war service land settlement is estimated at £4,000,000, an increase on last year of £2,000,000, and re-establishment loans for agricultural purposes at £3,400,000, an increase of £800,000. Public debt charges in respect of war the pension as from the 1st July, 1947, borrowings are estimated at £48,000,000 and partly because of the increase in the this year, compared with £46,000,000 in number of pensioners..

S and 9. showing revenue obtained from disposals sales? "" statement, but if the honourable member enough to let us have it. wants detailed information it will be supplied. Total expenditure other than defence and post-war charges in 1947-4S is estimated at £259,000,000 which represents an increase of £41,000,000 over last year. The main increases are £4,000,000 in payments to the National Welfare Fund, £15,000,000 on new works, £4,000,000 on postal services, £4,000,000 in payments to States and £11,000,000 on administrative votes. Some comment on each of these items is given. In most of them the effect of rising wages and other costs Mr Chifley. is reflected although it should be noted settlement of that in these estimates of expenditure allowance has not been made for the operation as from the 1st January, 1948, of the 40-hour week. Social Services. Statutory payments to the National Welfare Fund are estimated at. £69,000,000-£54,000,00 0 social services contribution and £15,000,000 pay-roll year. Actual cash expenditure on social services in 1947 48 is, however, expected : to amount to £77,000,000-a n increase of £15,000,000 on expenditure of £62,000,000 in 1946-47-'and this will necessitate drawing on the balance in the National Welfare Fund to an amount of £8,000,000. The main increase in social services expenditure is in respect of age and invalid pensions which are expected to cost £10,000,000 more than last, year, partly because of the increase of 5s. per week in National Welfare Fund arc shown in number of pensioners set. out in any of New Works. An amount of £33,000,000 is provided in the Estimates to cover expenditure on Commonwealth works undertakings excluding defence services. Of this amount, £7,300,000 is included for postal and telegraph equipment, £7,100,000 for war service homes, and £2,400,000 for shipbuilding. The balance of the provision is mainly for engineering works and buildings. The Commonwealth Government has at present a very large programme of works, particularly on postal and civil aviation activities. Because of shortages of labour and",27,Austkadian Trajde Policy

Postal Services. Expenditure during 1947-48 on the postal services, apart from capital expen£1,400,000 for 1947-48 which were diture included under New Works, is estimated at £30,304,000 compared with £26,756,000 in 1946-47. The increase is attributable mainly to the arrears of maintenance which accumulated during the war and to increased salaries and wages and higher costs of stores and equipment. Payments to States. Provision has been made for payments toStates of £65,000,000, which is £4,000,000 above the amount paid last year. It will be recalled that last year the tax reimbursement grants payable to the States were increased to £40,000,000 as compared with £34,255,000 under the war-time basis of reimbursement. To assist the Statesi n meeting additional expenditures which are largely due to rising costs and prices, the Government has decided to make additional payments to the States, the effect of which will be to increase the tax reimbursement grants this year to £45,000,000-a n increase of nearly £11,000,000 as compared with the war-time basis. Details of the new arrangements are given in Statement No. 10. It is expected that the Commonwealth penditure in 1947-48 is estimated at Aid Roads and Works Grant at £427,000,000 against £450,000,000 in £6,000,000 will be £1,200,000 greater than 1946-47. Defence and posWar charges last year. The report of the Commonwealth and other .expenditure to increase by Grants Commission has not yet been re£41,000,000 so that the total expenditure ceived but a tentative amount of is estimated to be £23,000,000 less this £5,042,000 has been included in the year than last year. Estimates to provide for the payment of special grants to the three less populous expenditure from revenue are contained States. Other Civil Departments. Expenditure on other civil departments this year is estimated at £26,700,000, which is £11,200,000 above expenditure in 1946-47. Of this increase, however, £4,400,000 is due to the fact that expenditures of the Department of .Supply and Shipping not now associated with defence are excluded from defence and post-war charges. The Department of Civil Aviation shows an increase of £2,500,000. This is mainly because payments by the Postal Department for the conveyance of air mails estimated at formerly applied in reduction of expenditure will this year be credited to civil aviation revenue. Other reasons are the expansion of overseas air services and a rise in maintenance costs because of the provision of additional aerodromes and more efficient technical equipment. The provision for immigration is also increased by £1,600,000. Expenditure by these departments will also he affected by increased wage and salary costs. A complete review of all Commonwealth departments, including the business undertakings, is being carried out with the object of achieving the highest standards of economy and efficiency in administration on a peacetime basis. The Public Service Board has been re-constituted for this purpose and some progress has been made. The administrative organization which is to handle new and difficult functions of government must keep pace with its responsibilities, but the Government is determined that expenditures in all fields shall be kept under the closest scrutiny to ensure that the community obtains full value and efficient service.

114,Mr Chifley,"There is no necessityWith the rates of taxation now in force it is estimated that revenue in 1947-48 would be £404,000,000 compared with actual revenue in 1946-47 of £412,000,000, a decrease of £8,000,000. After taking account of proposed tax concessions, details of which will be given presently, revenue for the current year is estimated to be £397,000,000, a fall of £15,000,000 on last year. Income tax and social services contributionis expected to show a fall of £12,000,000 and sales tax a fall of £7,000,000. Revenue from customs and excise duties is estimated to be approximately the same as last year because while imports have been increasing during recent months, the restrictions on imports which have been recently imposed and which may have to be intensified are likely to check this development. Otlier items including pay-roll tax and postal revenue show increases amounting to £4,000,000. Further details of estimated revenue are given in Statement No. 2. The budget position for this year, 10 per cent, on high incomes. compared with last year, may be summarked as follows:1046-47 Actual. Estimate, £m. fm. ExpenditureDefence and post-war charges Other expenditure 450 .. 427 RevenueTaxation 374 356 Other revenue 412 Gap-to be financed loan fund 38 30 Certain self-balancing items of revenue and' expenditure connected with primary production, for instance the wheat export charge and wool contributory charge, have not been included in these figures. Public Borrowing 1947-48. In addition to the budget gap of £30.000,000 requiring loan finance, there Mr Chifley. are the Loan Council borrowing programmes aggregating £63,000,000 to cover expenditures by State governments on public works and housing. The Loan Council has also approved a total borrowing programme of £20,000,000 for semi governmental and local authorities. Hence, the total estimated public borrowing during 1947-4S will be. £113,000,000. During the last sessional period a series of important tax reductions were brought forward by the Government and operated from 1st July, 1947, so that they will be ' effective for the whole of this financial year. v\s regards income tax and social services contribution substantial reductions in rates were made and an increase was granted in the amounts upon which rebates for dependants are calculated. The value to taxpayers of these and certain other concessions in respect of income taxation was estimated at £34,000,000 per year. Persons maintaining dependants were afforded the greatest relief, the reductions ranging from 100 per cent, on the lowest incomes to approximately The annual value to taxpayers of 1947-48. reductions made since the cessation of hostilities in taxes upon individual incomes has now reached a total of more than £70,000,000 and the great majority .. . . 232 . . 108 of taxpayers are now paying half, and in . . 218 . . 259 many cases less than half,, the tax payable at war-time rates. On many incomes less tax is payable to-day than in the year 1938-39. For .. 38 .,. 41 .example, a man with a dependent wife and two children in the State having the .. 397 lowest rates of tax in 1938-39 who was earning £6 per week would have paid from approximately £4 tax for that year. Today he would pay no tax. In the State which imposed the highest rates of tax in 1938-39 he may now earn up to £8 a week and still pay less tax than he would then have paid at eomhined Commonwealth and State rates. The cost to revenue of concessions given in respect of income tax will to some extent be offset this year by increased collection of taxation arrears. War-time (Company) Tax. The Government proposes to abolish tlie war-time (company) tax which was imposed during the war period as a levy upon the exceptionally high profits made by some public companies Tinder war conditions. Since this purpose has been fulfilled it is considered that the tax should no longer be continued. It will therefore cease to operate as from and including the present financial year, which means that company profits of the year ended the 30th June, 1946. or the accounting period substituted for that year, will be the last year's profits subject to the tax. The cost to revenue of removing the tax has granted. The Government is taking is estimated at £3,500,000. Sales Tax. Concessions are proposed in respect of cumstances and leave nothing undone that sales tax which are estimated to reduce will contribute to the central objective revenue from this source by £3,500,000 of keeping all available labour steadily in a. full year and £2,800,000 in this at work. This means amongst other financial year. Mainly these concessions things unremitting efforts to achieve will take the form of transferring items greater production. It also requires a from the maximum rate schedule of 25 continuance of measures to prevent unper cent, to the standard rate of 10 per warrantable increases in costs and prices. cent.

On the present state themselves, by overtaking the warrate of production, the estimated cost to time lag in industrial equipment, by revenue will be £350,000 in this extending our social service benefits and financial year and £550,000 in a full by maintaining a post-war defence plan year.

The vesources. terms of admission were on the same basis as those available to original members of the fund and bank. Two years of post-war experience have shown that full employment holds the key to many of the greatest economic problems of our community. Without full employment the financial burdens left by the war could not have been reduced so far; nor could we stand so well the present costs of defence and social services. Because of full employment, again a notable expansion of industry has been made possible and we are able to adopt such progressive measures as the fortyhour week, which the Arbitration Courl no credit for .that. If conditions overseas deteriorate we will have to adapt ourselves to the cirin the darkest days of the war, for all Australians to give of their best.

WOOL FOR HOME CONSUMPTION.

COAL. No change has taken place in the basis of paying the subsidy to maintain the ceiling price of coal, but increased costs mainly due to variations of wages and conditions of employment, have resulted in an increased liabil it y to pay subsidy.

WOOL. Disposals under the Wool Realization Aci are proceeding. The average reserve price ot 18.15 pence per lb. of raw wool determined contributory charge of 5 per cent, which operated in respect of last season was' reduced Prior to November, 1945, the Government was subsidizing production to give the farmer an average return at the factory, equivalent to approximately Is. 7.31d. per lb. commercial butter. The Government accepted, as from the 1st November, 1945, the following additional items of cost for the purposes of subsidy( i ) Increase of .25d. per lb. in manufacturing costs; and ( i i ) .19d. per lb. being a capital value adjustment for live-stock. To these increases of .44d. per lb. affording the producer an average return of Is.' 7-}d. per lb. at the factory a, further i d . per lb. representing the overall equivalent of the increased price received from the. United Kingdom as from the 1st July, 1946, has been added. This ensures to the producer an average overall return, at the factory, equivalent to Is. Sd. per lb. commercial butter. On the estimated production for 1947-48 an aiuuunt of £4,000,000 will be required for subsidy payments and it is anticipated that during the financial year a refund of subsidy to the extent of £500,000 will be received from the British Ministry of Food in connection with exports prior to June, 1940, leaving £3,500,000 to be provided from revenue. It is expected that the sum of £230,000 will be required to meet the probable deficiency on the operations of the Apple and Pear Acquisition Scheme in Western Australia and Tasmania, including £200,000 for the previous season. The crops in those States are expected to amount to 7,360,000 bushels of apples and pears this season. Early this year arrangements were made for the disposal of 2,000,000 cases of apples to the British Ministry of Food. However, on account of the United Kingdom's food crisis, it was found necessary to conserve refrigerated ipate for more urgently needed foodstuffs and as a result only 250,000 cases have so far been shipped'. The price of feed wheat was raised to 4s. II d . per bushel (bulk basis) f.o.r. ports for the 1940-47 season, which is in line with the home-consumption price for wheat for all other purposes. It is estimated that an amount of £100,000 will be required during the financial year 1947-48 to meet the cost of certain freight concessions on feed wheat and other feed grains. JUTE SUBSIDY. To cover substantial increases in the landed price of a l l jute products, the wholesale price of cornsacks was raised from 28s. to 28s. 6d. per dozen as from the 20th May, 1947, thus eliminating the need for the payment of any subsidy. MENT GRANTS TO THE STATES. Under the war-time uniform tux scheme that the present basis of tax reimbursement which operated until the 30th. June; 1946, the grants should not be revised hut that increased tax reimbursement grants paid each year to the financial assistance to the States should be States vacating the fields of income taxation provided by means of an additional tax reimand entertainments taxation amounted tobursement gTant. £34,255,000. At a Premiers conference in January, 1946, reimbursement grant of £5,000,000 be paid to the Commonwealth Government indicated that the States in the current financial year (1947it had decided to continue uniform taxation indefinitely. maintaining uniform taxation, agreed upon a revised basis reimbursement grant as determined by the 194C on which future reimbursement grants should be paid to the.

This act provides that the aggregate of the grants shall be £40,000,000 in each of the years 1940-47 and 1947-48. In each subsequent year the aggregate grant of £40,000,000 will be varied in proportion to variations in the States' populations and the resultant amount increased by half the percentage increase ( if any) in the level of average wages per person employed over the level in 1946-47. The manner of distribution of the aggregate grant of £40,000,000 among the States in the years 1940-47 and 1947-48 is set out in the tabW below. In years subsequent to 1947-48 the aggregate grant is to be distributed in accordance with a. formula which takes account of the respective populations of the States after adjustments have been made to those populations for relative sparsity of population and the number of children aged five to fifteen years inclusive in each State. The effect of this formula is such that by 1957-58 the aggregate grant w ill be distributed solely in proportion to the adjusted populations of the States. It was also agreed with the Premiers and provided in the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Act 194C that & revip-w of the basis of tax reimbursement grants might be made in the following circumstances:(a) At any time after the 30th June, 1953; or (6) Before that date, but after there ha? been or is proposed to be, a major change in the relations between the Commonwealth and any State or States, having an effect on the finances of tliat State or States, whether by reason of a substantial alteration in the powers, functions or responsibilities of the Commonwealth or of any State or States or otherwise. A t a Premiers conference held in August. 1947, the Premiers indicated that State expenditures were rising sharply principally because of increasing prices and costs, and that some increase in the tax reimbursement grants (which aggregate £40.000,000 in 1947-48) would bo necessary if the State govermnents were to avoid serious financial The Commonwealth Government has decided It has been decided that an additional tax income 48) and that in respect of each subsequent The Premiers, whilst financial year an additional grant he paid to in principle their opposition to cover any deficiency between theaggregate tax Act and the sum of £45,000,000.

In assessing the increases which it proposes to make the Government has taken into consideration-(a ) the long period during which there has been no upward adjustment of the basis of remuneration ; '(&) the 1 general trend of salaries for professional and high executive positions in Australia: and (c) the rates of remuneration of similar offices in the United Kingdom and other countries. The salaries of justiceships of the High Court were fixed by the Parliament in 1903, and have not been altered since. The salaries of the other judicial offices included in this bill were fixed subsequently, but strictly in relation to the salaries attaching to High Court justiceships. These salaries no longer bear the relationship originally ex'sting to the earnings of the leaders of the profession at the bar, and the increases now proposed are in the direction of rectifying the position. I need scarcely emphasize how essential it is to the maintenance of the high tradition of the judiciary that the salaries should be sufficient to enable outstanding legal men to relinquish their professional practices and become available for service in responsible judicial office..

It is provided in the bill that the amended terms of the item shall be -effective on and from the date of commencement of the exemption of paint, namely, the 15th November, 1946. As I indicated earlier, the bill contains generally. -one provision which is not of a concessionary character. Since the 13th September, 1945, the law has provided for the exemption of "" aids to manufacture "" in the form of machinery, implements and apparatus. The object of this concession was to obviate double taxation such as had previously occurred by virtue of taxing the cost of these "" aids to manufacture"" as well as the value of the manufactured goods which are produced with their aid. The value of the manufactured goods would normally take into account the cost of the "" aids "". Among the goods covered by the exemption of "" aids to manufacture"" are master cuttings and matrices for use in the production of gramophone or broadcast records. Where a person contracts to make a record for another it is first necessary for him to obtain or make a master cutting and a matrix, and the cost of these articles is far greater than the cost of producing the finished records therefrom. It is a trade custom that the master cutting and matrix are handed over with the finished records to the customer for whom they are made, and it is contended that there is a sale of the master cutting and matrix. Some manufacturers adopted the practice of separately invoicing the master cuttings and matrices and the records, and of paying tax only on that part of the charge which is attributed to the records. In this manner, tax would be paid in respect of the records upon a value of a few shillings only, whereas the actual cost of production of the records would be several pounds. The existing law is open to similar cruelty, slavery, oppression and death was loss of revenue in respect of blocks for use clearly delineated in Hitler's Mein in the production of taxable printed Kampf, so also, if we will take the trouble matter.

As the result of observations made and information gleaned during my recent tour abroad, I desire to make some comments on the present state of world affairs. It seems to me that historically we have entered upon a second era of appeasement. This time, however, the power being appeased is not Germany, but Soviet Russia. Already we have progressed a long way along the road of appeasement, and my very real fear is that unless we retrace our steps the world will be engulfed in a disaster greater even than that which followed the first era of appeasement, namely 1933 to 1938; and millions upon millions of people will again be destroyed or enslaved.

Soviet Russia, including Poles, Germans, Austrians, Hungarians, Rumanians; Bulgarians, Czechs, Chinese, Koreans, and Manr-hurians. Those unfortunate millions are being subjected, to a reign of terror which is certainly as terrible as any in modern history. The Communists, as the ruling class in Russia,, have killed or exiled or driven into concentration camps millions upon millions of unfortunate people, and are pursuing without let or hindrance their ruthless programme, and by the same methods as. did Hitler. They are following a course almost exactly identical with that taken by Hitler from 1.932 to 1939. Their cruelty is not confined to alien peoples; they have treated millions of Russian peoples with unspeakable cruelty. In the countries into which they have penetrated their treatment of the occupants has been equally barbarous. They are and have been tearing families asunder, dragging wife from husband, and mother from child. created, under conditions which belong to the age of barbarism, slave camps of their own people containing, it is estimated, upwards of 14,000,000 people, whose only sin is that they are opposed to the Communist party, or are not deemed sufficiently co-operative. Such is the Government of Soviet Russia, of whose evil nature the peoples of free countries are so abysmally ignorant. Such is the government which refuses co-operation with the rest of the world except on its own terms. Such, is the government which grows hungrier and. hungrier for power despite concession upon, concession. We are witnessing Munich in reverse: Our policy of appeasement will result, if action is not taken now, in a. calamity at least as dire as that which engulfed the world in 1939. The only apparent difference between the methods employed hy Hitler and those which are being so consistently pursued by Russia is. that while the Germans sought to advance from west toeast, the Russiansare seekdoes not survive we. in Australia have only ing to expand from east to west, and into the south and the far east. We are witnessing a desperate bid hy the Communist party of Russia, as distinct from the RusUnited States of America as a world sian people, to obtain world dominionMr Spen&er. a bid which will inevitably succeed unles.* met the challenge of Hitler between 1933 and 1939. Maybe within this generation, it wiH.find its resolution inanother titanic struggle from which no part of the 1 world can escape,, in which western civilization,, of which we are a part, may well be obliterated forever, or result without conflict in the complete subjugation of all parts of the world to the Asiatic slave society which the Communists have evolved. I do not, I think,, exaggerate the dangers of the situation.; but, on a matter of: such importance, I believeit to be my duty to speak what I . believe, without the slightest reservation. The complete refusal: of Soviet Russia to cooperate in the administration off ""Germany, except on its own terms, is a good illustration of its policy. In the other European countries into which Russia has penetrated it has so reduced the status of formerly independent nations that to-day they are no longer separate national entities. Russia's real intention and policy They have are clearly delineated by its actions in Asia, as well as in Europe, and they are obviously a development of the pattern outlined in the Soviet writings which I mentioned earlier. The aim of the ruling class of Russia -which , incidentally, when it speaks in its favourite jargon of the "" dictatorship of the proletariat"" means the "" dictatorship of"" the Communist party in Russia"" -ma y be stated in simple language. There are-to-day only three powers which can control within the lifetime of this generation the future of the millions of people who inhabit the earth; the United States of America, Soviet Russia and the British Commonwealth of Nations. The Russian Communistsbelieve that the United States of America is their most formidable antagonist, and that the futureof theBritishpeoples depends -upon the survivalof the United States of America. On reflection there is a great measure of truth in this thesis, because if the United States of America to ask ourselves what our chances of survival would be. The Communists of Russia are determined to destroy the power,, either by external, action or internal penetration, or by a combination of those methods. Of course, I do not intend to convey that such a thing may be accomplished in a short period; we know from our knowledge of world affairs that such a process requires time.. But it is perfectly clear that that is Russia's ultimate objective. Because it does not yet possess the secret of the atomic bomb, or if it does, the ability to manufacture it, it is content to play for time. It requires rime, first, to rehabilitate its war-time losses; secondly, to build up its industrial potential, and, thirdly, it hopesa hope it will do all in its power to bring to passthat the passage of time may precipitate the democracies of the world into another depression. I believe (hat its immediate purpose is a two-fold one, the first of which is to extend its domination over an ever-increasing portion of the world's surface. It already dominates the greater portion of Asia and Europe; and by its well-known technique of mass intimidation, pressure and terrorism, exercises influence over an even greater area. The area it dominates, for example, the Russian zone of control in Germany, over which there is an impenetrable cloud of secrecy, and the other countries which lie to the east of that aone, which at present are under its domination, it will never relinquish unless it is forced to do so; it is there to stay. Coincident with the first objective, it is adopting fifth-column methods, through tbe agency of the Communist party, in the democratic countries-for example, Canada, the United States of America, England and Australia-the purpose being to white-ant and to weaken those countries. It is infiltrating their economic, social and political structure by false propaganda, by fomenting strikes, by stirring up discontent, by setting class against class, by creating doubt and insecurity in the minds of their people, and by discrediting the democratic institutions under whicli they dwell, thus making the way easy for their final subjection to Communist rule; It is my conclusion that only a fool would deny that those are the twin objectives, in the immediate' future, of the Communist party of Russia. In. my judgment, there is no difference in principle between the purposes 1-933 to. 1939, and Communist Soviet Russia, to-day. Even their methods are strikingly similar-in the mechanics of their organization, and in the ruthlessness, dishonesty,, intolerance and cruelty with which their methods are applied. Just as war finally resulted from the threat to the world that was inherent in the fascist doctrine, so may war well result, perhaps in the lifetime of this generation, unless the policy of appeasing Russia, which up to recent days we have so consistently followed, is forthwith discarded, and its place taken by a resolute determination, made plain to Russia's ruling class,to resist the Communist domination of the world, by force if every other means should fail, since that is the only language which Russia seems to understand. For Australia, there are four cardinal points of foreign policy which the facts damand. The first is to join with other countries in resisting Communist encroachment and domination throughout the world. I say that with this qualification only: We have endeavoured for the last two years, as every -man in this chamber knows-and be it said that the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) has done his utmost along these lines-to find methods'of cooperation with the Russian Communist party. So have the United States of America and Great Britain; and so, 1 suggest, have most of the other nations of the world which are not directly under Russia's control. It must be recognized fearlessly that our efforts in that direction have failed to achieve the desired results. It must also be recognized that peace cannot come to the world unless Russia is prepared to co-operate. If it does not co-operate, these cardinal points of policy must be pursued. The second is to cement, in the most powerful edifice possible, the British Commonwealth, in terms of economic and strategic strength.. Thirdly, we must achieve, with the United States of America, the highest degree of community of strategic understanding, and must foster the closest ties of friendship, interest; goodwill and understanding with that country. Only by taking up' a strong line shall we ultimately bring sense to those who are controlling Russian policy of Fascist Germany of at themoment. It must be made plain to Russia that we have no quarrel with the Russian people, hut that we are determined, so far as lies within our power, to prevent further Communist penetration and destruction of the systems of free people, and to restore to those who have had their liberties filched from them the right to live again under their own institutions, free from fear. I sometimes throw my mind back, as though -the ideals inherent in the United must many other members of this chamNations Charter are, unquestionably it. ber, to the magnificent speech about the would be plain stupidity to believe that four freedoms that was made by Mr the United Nations at present possesses, Roosevelt in the dark days before or is likely to possess within the vital the United States of America came period that lies immediately ahead, any into the war, when we were fighting machinery for ensuring peace. The alone. None of us, looking at the Charter is based on the assumption that world, can now be satisfied that there all nations are equal. In ray judgment, is any immediate prospect of at least that is just as meaningless as is the profreedom from fear throughout the position that all men are equal. Peace world. Whose fault principally can that can be obtained only through power. be said to be ? I do not believe in keeping Where power does not reside, there is no -quiet merely because another power is home for security. Whatever one may involved; we must speak plainly in say hither and thither, the hard, cold, regard to it, because only by doing so unalterable fact is that power to-day, can we make clear that we understand apart from that of the British Commonwhat is the present aim of the ruling wealth, which is not sufficient of olique of Russia and only in that itself, to ensure peace, resides in way will it ultimately to achieve any . collaboration, with of the United States of America and them. Just how is Australia making out Soviet Russia. To talk of equality of all in terms of the conduct of its foreign nations is, in my judgment, nothing short policy? So much has been said by the of juridical nonsense, and the sooner that, appropriate Government spokesmen on fact becomes embedded in our minds the these issues, that a few words on our better will it be for all of us. At least, foreign policy, if any consistent one is I believe that it will more clearly set the really discernible, are justified. first observation that I want to make is that Australia is much less secure to-day than it was immediately after hostilities believe that Russia's purpose at the ceased. I do not think that any one can moment is to engage in war; quite the dispute that. An inference is to be drawn contrary. But everyone knows that when from the trend of world events from that the world is split more and more between time, and if that trend be not arrested, two massive ideologies and groupings, and disaster may well overtake us again. when they extend their domination or Since the war ended, the Government has their influence more and more over the pursued a path which, in all its twistings world's surface, ultimately some small and windings, would not be unfairly incident may prove to be the detonator to described as tortuous.

In short, I believe that control of foreign policy. The best that it has been playing a colossal game of can be said of it' is that, generally, it has bluff. In my opinion, the iron curtain supported the principles underlying the which supposedly has been screening United Nations, principles in which, I Russia's preparations against the rest of Mr Spender. have said more than once, I strongly believe. I have also said in this chamber, not only in recent days, but also for the last two or three years, that I do not believe that the nations of the world have yet progressed far enough along the road of civilization to be able to embody those principles in an organization that will be capable in the foreseeable future of ensuring the peace of the world. Great be possible two great aggregations of people, those The course which we should sail. I want to make it clear that I do not the world has been used just as much, perhaps more, to screen its internal weaknesses, brought about very largely by the system which it has been imposing upon its 200,000,000 people. I confess that while 1 was overseas I was unable to discern what Australia's foreign policy is. What is our There have been many splendid statements in this Parliament in terms of ideology and international philosophy, but they do not bear on the realities existaction. A glance at the way in which ing in the world to-day. That is the burden of my song. I have been forced to the conclusion-and I find that my opinions are shared by many others-that we have been engaged, within the general limits set by the United Nations, in a pretty but, frqm the Australian point of view, a futile game of what can best be described as "" prestige politics "". Ever since the pattern was set at the San Francisco conference there has been too much banging of the conference table, too much ""talking b i g "" conduct that deceives nobody, and which, despite what so-called foreign correspondents may say, usually succeeds in making us appear a little silly. ""Prestige politics"" does not increase the stature of a nation. It is calculated rather to inflate artificially the organize together for the peace of the personality of individuals. One day we attack Russia; another day we side with Russia against the United States of America or the United Kingdom. short, no one knows from one day to another where we are or where we are going. The only nation that is happy about it all is Soviet Russia, whose every action in the Security Council reveals with what contempt it regards the deliberations, except as a forum for the advancement of its own propaganda. We concern ourselves with forms rather than with the realities of power. There is more rejoicing in the appointment of an Australian as the head or as a member of this or that committee than there is in tbe achievement of any solid advance of the cause of world security. We reveal a strange fascination for documents, which can of themselves neither create nor solve anything, and for which Russia shows the most profound disregard. We talk roughly and, then smoothly to General Macarthur; we alienate sympathy in quarters where we need it most. The net result of all these "" strong-hand "" methods is exactly nothing, except, of course, in term of "" prestige politics"", in the advancement of which there is always available some convenient spokesman who will dish out the usual sop of "" prestige"". So far as the world can determine-to the limited degree to which policy for world security? the world is at all interested-o n the various questions which have arisen for deliberation in the Security Council, Australia has revealed no consistent line of Australia has voted, or abstained from voting, on the issues which have from time to time come before UN.O. should be sufficient to establish that fact. The only consistency Australia has revealed is in its objection to the veto, concerning which the Minister for External Affairs and Australia's representatives overseas have at all times been so vocal. I agree that there are philosophical objections to the veto, but to pursue those objections to the degree of directing attention to them at every opportunity gets us nowhere unless Russia is prepared to sacrifice its right of veto. We are reaching the stage where, unless Russia is prepared to do that, the other nations of the world will have to world. In use a veto some day, should Russia interfere in Papua or some other territory which vitally affects Australia. Most of this talk about the veto is on a philosophical plane and has little to do with the realities of world politics. If there were any sense of realism at all in our foreign policy, it ought to have been realized that to exclude the veto and still expect Russia to remain, with the United Nations was about as effective as a dog's howling at the moon. On the one matter which is essential, namely, that of meeting the threat of Communist domination, Australia has done next to nothing; and what it has done, or has permitted others, such as the Communist controlled Waterside Workers Federation, to do in the name of Australia in relation to issues, of which the Indonesian",42,Evatt

It is time that we awakened to our peril. Solely as a result of Soviet policy, another war is in the making. The sooner it is understood that the British peoples and those of the United States of America have one common fate the better. Unless they survive the bid for world domination that the Communist party of Russia clearly is making, they will become the victims of the Asiatic cruelty which has been the lot of all people who have fallen under the "" dictatorship of the proletariat"", the cover-up phrase for ""tyranny of the Communists"". realized the sooner may we hope for some evidence of a positive policy from Australia to meet that challenge. Russia's policy has been brought home to many people for whom we went to war. I refer particularly to the people of Czechoslovakia and Poland who are now under the complete domination of this so-called democratic power. By cruel means, as well as by ideological teaching, Russia is seeking to weaken the democratic nations. That brings me to the danger to Australia from Russia's policy includes the undermining of all other countries not now within its orbit of domination through the highly organized and well-known techniques of industrial disorganization, penetration, disruption and spying propaganda with which informed people arealready unhappily so familiar. What does the Government intend to do about this menace, this cancer in our midst? I was Minister for the Army in the period before Russia entered the war and I say that in 1941 there were numerous files, which are still available, containing evistill fighting as our ally, a vast secret dence of the activities of the -Communist party in Australia which show that it was the direct agent of Soviet Russia. nal Affairs is reeking with Communists now. existed whose acknowledged function was to direct from Moscow the fifth-column activities of the Communist party in every country throughout the world, always, of course, in the interests of Soviet Russia. No one with any knowledge of the history of the world before 1943 can deny that the Comintern was an instrument of Russian foreign policy. There was a direct connection, as was shown in the evidence tendered before the royal commission in Canada, with Communist cells and parties all over the world. It was not any wonder that the Communist party in Australia opposed the death struggle in which Australia was engaged in 1940-41 as an ""imperialistic war "" and did its utmost to sabotage the war effort in exactly the same way, and in almost exactly the same terms, as it did in Canada, India, Burma, Ceylon, The sooner this is .Egypt and Palestine, and, indeed, in every part of the British Empire where there was a Communist party or celland they were everywhere. Those activities ceased when Soviet Russia came into the war, but not the world-wide activities of the comintern. The party's line was varied. .Soviet Russia, which was fighting with us against fascist Germany, engaged then in one of the cruellest pieces of deception any ally could be guilty of. It announced to the world in 1943, with appropriate propaganda and Communist activity. Soviet fanfare, that the comintern had been dissolved. This was deliberately intended to fool its allies. Actually, it continued to exist and function in secret. Documents produced before the royal commission in Canada, which was inquiring into the spy activities of Soviet agents in that country, established this fact beyond the faintest shadow of doubt. It continues to direct from its head-quarters in Moscow the activities of all Communist parties throughout the world. Thus we find on proven evidence that it was operating in Canada and .the United Kingdom while network of espionage whilst, since the cessation of hostilities, the Communist parties in every country, whether their members know it or not, are .being used as the direct instrument of Soviet foreign policy. Isi t to be assumed that the Communist party in Australia is any different from those operating in Canada, the United States of America, the United",46,Evatt
128,Mr Blair,The Department of Exter,47,Evatt
129,Mr Spender,"The Comintern thenKingdom, and in every otlier part of the world ? The Labour Government possesses information on its files to give substantial cate the achievement of such a change support to my allegations. The comintern head-quarters, operating from Moscow, have files on every leading Communist party member in Australia. That much may be deduced from the information which came to light during the inquiry into Communist activities in Canada. Foreign policy cannot avoid dealing with the activities of a foreign power in Australia through the Communist party. Yet what has been the record of the Labour Government to date on this score? It legalised the Communistcratic government, and every schoolchild party in 1942, an act for which the Minister for External Affairs was' largely responsible, thus giving it a status which has permitted it to extend its activities widely, and with apparent impunity. It has refused to hold an inquiry into the activities of the Communist party as was done in Canada. If we have any regard for the future welfare of this country and for its democratic institutionsin which most members of the Commonwealth Parliament believe or Communist party cannot be allowed to function any longer in Australia. It9 activities must be stamped out as quickly and ruthlessly as possible. We know that any attempt to do this will be met by the Communists-wh o use the forms of democracy to cover their activity -wit h charges of "" fascist"" and "" undemocratic "". They will describe any attack on their party as an attack on the freedom of political organization and the freedom of speech, and in this they will receive the support of fellow travellers, some Labour politicians, and some woollyminded intellectuals. Of course, it would be nothing of the sort. There is no such thing as freedom to say or do anything you wish irrespective of its effects upon the institutions of government, or irrespective of what it is that you say or do. Under our Constitution, a man is free to hold and advocate any political opinion he wishes, even the opinion that Communism is the best form of political organization for the people of any country; but he has no such freedom to advocate the bringing about, or to do anything to bring ahout Communism in [5] a country by revolution. [Extension of time granted.'] He has no right to advoby the forcible destruction of democratic institutions of government. Neither has he the right to belong to an organization, which, whether he knows it or not, is "" an instrument in the hands of the Soviet Government for creating unrest, provocation, &c"", as it was described in evidence by Groshenko, the Russian cypher officer, who gave evidence before the royal commission in Canada. The right of freedom of speech and freedom of organization presupposes the existence of a demoknows that no such freedoms exist in Russia. No one, under the cover of such freedom, can be allowed to work to destroy democratic institutions, and certainly not by unconstitutional and revolutionary means. Yet that is precisely what the Communist party does. Moreover, no democratic, or other, government, can permit any organization or group of persons to function, knowingly or unknowingly, as the agents of or in carrying out the policy of, a foreign government. Yet that is precisely what the Commuought to believe, . the nist party is doing. The other objection which will be raised-on e cunningly cultivated by the Communists themselves is that if you declare the Communist party illegal, you will drive its members underground, so making it more difficult to watch their activities. This has as 1 much sense as to argue that if ""Murder Incorporated"", a .body which actually existed in the United States of America, were found to he functioning in Australia, it ought not to be attacked as an organization, otherwise you might drive its members underground. Such an argument is just plain nonsense. Since the Labour Government gave to the Communist party in this country legal prestige and status its power has increased enormously. Its legality, created by the Labour Government, provides what the Communist himself calls a "" roof "", which is a legal front for illegal activities. If the suppression of the Communist party results in driving its members underground-thei r operations are underground now-the n the further underground they are forced the better for democracy in this country. The only other so-called argument against the course I suggest is that the Communists are of little significance, as evidenced by the small support they obtain at elections, and that it would be inexpedient to waste ammunition on such a negligible force in the community for, by so doing, you would increase their importance. Perhaps the Prime Minister thinks like that because not long ago I remember hearing him say that in his opinion the influence of the Communists was overrated, and that he thought of them only as the boys who, at union meetings, proposed long-worded resolutions he could not understand. Yet who can deny that the Communists are now penetrating deeper and deeper into the life of the community? Therefore, the Communist party must be suppressed as an illegal organization-completely thoroughly. I am aware that my views are not shared by some members on this side of the House, but I am expressing my profound conviction. Membership of this organization, or any substitute front under which it may continue in any way to operate, should disqualify a person from holding any position in the Public Service of this country our fifth week of gas rationing. That or from being a member of any registered trade union. Will the Labour party, or the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), who also has the direction of this country's foreign policy, do anything in this matter before it is too late? Judging from the Government's past record we shall, no doubt, have plenty of high-sounding words, but precious little action on its part, to combat this most serious challenge from within to our democratic institutions and our democratic way of life. am not by any means convinced that that The Government must face up to this threat. this moment any suggestion as to what the Government All honourable members.

Therefore, we must meet the challenge implicit in that policy both within and without Australia. I draw the attention of the Government to this menace, which I believe to be a serious ill in this country and a challenge to our democratic way of life; and I want to hear in this debate from spokesmen for the Government what it proposes to do about the matter. adjourned. COAL SUPPLIES. Tliat the House do now adjourn. Mi-. HOLT (Fawkner) [2.57] I am and glad that the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) is at the table, because being the Minister primarily responsible for the success of the post-war conduct of the industries of the Commonwealth and a fellow Victorian he will, himself, no doubt, be concerned over what is happening in Victoria at present. In that State we are in matter is serious enough in itself, when one has regard to the serious inconvenience caused, to the public, and particularly to the housewives of Victoria, who necessarily make considerable use of gas for domestic purposes; but it is having a wider effect in the restrictions which are being placed upon so many Victorian industries. There may be factors operating which make a shortage of coal in Australia at present inevitable. I is so; but I am prepared to accept the I refrain from making at fact that this Government is not capable of immediately overcoming the shortage should do. of coal throughout the Commonwealth. However, the burden of my criticism toWe wealth should not be called upon to carry a very much greater proportion of that restriction than are the other States. To the best of my knowledge norestriction is placed upon the use of gas in New South Wales, which is also an important industrial State; and, perhaps, that observation applies also to other States. There is a responsibility upon the Government, particularly upon the Minister",47,Evatt

131,Motion (By Mr Dedman,") proposedfor Post-war Reconstruction, to ensure an equitable distribution of such coal as is available. I have raised this issue on previous occasions in this House. I do not believe that a f a i r distribution is being made, particularly for industrial purposes, from the limited stocks of coal available; and I am not satisfied that this state of affairs is due to shipping difficulties or to hold-ups on the waterfront. The Minister should take up this matter with the Commonwealth Coal Controller and urge that Victoria is entitled to a very much better deal than it is now receiving. I do not raise this matter in any parochial spirit, because any restriction of industry in Victoria adversely affects many industries throughout the Commonwealth which are dependent for their materials upon production in Victoria. I shall welcome any information which the Minister may be in a position to give, but if he cannot now reJune, 1941, and at the 20th May, 1947, of the assure us on this point I ask him to state clearly that the Government w ill investiCravenA ) , (6) tobacco (Log Cabin), (c) gate the position immediately with a view to improving the supply of coal for domestic and industrial purposes in Victoria.

The plans include the provision of telephone facilities on a large scale, the installation of > modern switching equipment, the establishment of many new exchanges, the remodelling of existing premises, the erection of many additional trunk line channels and the installation of a large number of public telephones. The Government is fully behind the proposal to meet the serious position which exists, and has appointed a Cabinet sub-committee to control the programme. It is the Arm intention to restore depleted' reserves of plant and equipment to enable adequate and uprto-date teleS hone facilities to be made available for resients in city and country areas as soon as possible. In addition to materials which are now being received, orders have been placed for 120,000 lines of automatic equipment, 330,000 tele-, phones, 250,000 pair miles of underground cable, and carrier wave systems for 800 trunk channels, and it is proposed to install 500 rural automatic exchanges in country districts. Much has been done by the department to foster the manufacture in Australia of telecommunications equipment and components, and a large proportion of the apparatus required is now being .produced locally in the departmental workshops or by outside organizations. Negotiations are proceeding with interests in the United Kingdom and the United States of America for the establishment of factories in Australia for producing automatic switching equipment. The present factories for making telephone cables cannot cope with the demands, but arrangements have been made for further factories to be erected in the Commonwealth. The exceptional measures which have been taken by the department to meet the unprecedented demand for new services and to overtake the arrears which have accumulated will be evident from the fact that since the war ended, and' despite the abnormal difficulties associated .with new buildings, technical materials and skilled labour, 174,000 telephones have been installed throughout the Commonwealth and 525 new trunk .lines have been brought into service. The importance of overtaking the arrears of applications for telephones is appreciated, fully by the Government and the Postal Department, achieve this objective.
