New Works And Buildings Bookkeeping Provisions Of The Constitu","tion, which have not been altered, govern the return of revenue tp the States, but that a few years ago the practice was fixed of charging the States, for new works and buildings, per head of population, the result being, according to the Budget papers, page 87, that in five years New South Wales has had to pay ,£177,000, and South Australia £14,000, more than the actual expenditure. Does not the honourable gentleman think this method of charging unfair? so important-it s intricacies revealing themselves more and more as one sets himself to grapple with it-that I do not wish to give a reply off-hand. I shall have the matter considered. twelve months ago. the honourable member did, and I hope to be able to tell him to-morrow exactly what the position is. I believe that there is a slight discrepancy. during the first three years of Federation, the actual expenditure on new works and buildings incurred in a State was debited to that State, but that Sir George Turner, recognising the unfairness of it, obtained the sanction of Parliament to a new procedure, under whichthis expenditure is debited per head of population? very important matter, I do not wish to reply until I can give a full answer.

29,Mr Hume Cook (Bourke,"Honorof the motion to remit the question of insurance, including fire insurance, to a Royal Commission for inquiry, I had hoped that the honourable member for Kal goorlie would consent to the postponement if not the withdrawal of this measure. inquiry involves the fate of this B i ll or the ability of the House to decide on its merits. We might go to a division on it . honourable member's desire, I wish first to indicate the views of those interested on the other side as to the proposals in the B ill , and then to state the Government's attitude. TheB ill proposes to substitute for the present form of policy what, in the insurance world, is termed ' ' a value-payable policy."" In other words, instead of paying, in the event of a fire, tlie amount of actual loss, the company insuring the property or goods would be called upon to pay the whole face value stated in the policy. So far as I am able to gather, this is an entirely new principle in insurance, and has not been adopted anywhere else. is misinformed. It has been adopted by many of the American States. I am open to receive information oh the subject. I am sure, at any rate, that a similar proposal to the present one has been considered in a number of places and by a number of extremely reputable companies, and in the majority, if not in all, of the cases, which have come under my observation, it was eventually rejected. The grounds of the refusal of those interested are many, and amongst them is tlie confident assertion that it would involve such increased premiums that the public would eventually complain, and there would be even more trouble for those who have to insure their goods than there is at present, l t is significant that the New Zealand ment, which is probably regarded by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie as a model, has never put forward or adopted any such principle. a matter of fact, the policies issued by the Department contain exactly the same clauses as those issued by ordinary companies elsewhere. proposal, if put before the Department, (would be rejected, In the B ill itself some exemptions are proposed from the principle which it seeks to lay down. For instance, clause 4 provides that"" Policy"" does not in clude a policy of marine insurance; or any policy of insurance so far as it insures against loss or damage to goods, wares or merchandise, owned or held for the purpose of Trade or I do not think that the Commerce; It is asserted that those exemptions would' lead to so many complications as would make it almost impossible for companies, even if they accepted the principle, to honestly carry out the provisions of the measure. The conditions appertaining to fireinsurance generally are so complicated, and the owners of goods and merchandise, to say nothing of household furniture, wearing apparel, and so on, are sorelated to oneanother in the general conditions of policy,, that it would be a matter of extreme difficulty for the companies to carry out the law faithfull y and fairly, even if they were most anxious to accept the principle in itsentirety. The proposal that the assured) should get the f u l l sum for which he insures seems, on the face of it, equitable and proper, but it must be obvious upon inquiry and consideration that it involves a departure from the basic principle of insurance generally-indemnit y against the actual loss incurred. It has never yet beer* held by any reasonable person that the assured should make a profit out of a fire. The object has always been to recoup him the amount of the loss which he actually sustains. It is asserted that people who insure now never get back the f u l l loss that they make, but that statement is distinctly arguable. The companies are in keen competition with one another in all the States. rates only as to the rates of premium, but the companies are in keen competition with one another to get the business. rates of premium, is everything. combination of companies, with respect to the rates to be charged, does not prevent them from entering into the keenest comAs petition with one another, on the basis upon, which they have agreed, to get all the business that they can.

That case, liowever, does not in the least detract from the fact that there is amongst a number of companies very keen competition. On this matter I speak with knowledge, owing to the fact that for fifteen or sixteen years I have been an agent for two companies; and I know the pressure which other companies have brought to bear on me in an endeavour to induce me to take up their business. So keen is this kind of competition that companies offer every inducement to agents to accept agencies for other or additional companies. of men ! but the companies are so keen for_ business, and anxious to get. good men, that they offer pretty fair inducements, though,",13,Northern Territory Paper

SENA TE Debate resumed from ist October (vide RESTThat, with the object of securing to a much greater extent than at present a representation in the Senate of members personally known to and identified with the electors they represent, and in order to terminate at once a system which must be found more inequitable and impracticable, especially in the larger States, as population increases, the time has arrived when, under the powers given to the Parliament by section 7 of the Constitution, the system hitherto in force of having one electorate for the whole of each State, for the election of Senators, should cease, system there is certainly a chance of obtainand that the following be substituted :That for the elections for Senators, each State be divided into three electorates, each electorate returning two may crop up in a State for a few months Senators, in the case of a general election in which the whole six Senators are to be elected, and one Senator each, in the case pf the periodical the people do not require. I have figures elections for the Senate. seconded this motion, for the reason that in large States, with many industries and interests scattered over wide distances, candidates for the Senate have no chance of even travelling over the whole area. The extent of a State like Queensland, South Australia, qr Western Australia is altogether too great to allow of one man representing the whole of it. In the case of small places like Victoria, which bears to the larger States somewhat the relation of a cabbage leaf to a paddock, a man could run all over the State in a very little while. Of course, the population is concentrated on a smaller area, but comparing the extent of Western Australia or Queensland with that of Victoria, one cannot but be impressed with the magnitude of the task of any man who undertakes to represent the whole of either of the former States. to travel across the whole area. sent a State he must know something about it, and he cannot know anything about it without seeing it. I know a little about Australia, and have been in most of the States. I have been for a number of years in Western Australia andi probably have seen as much of it as any man carrying out the McWilliams, W. J. undertakings that I have carried out there Sampson, S. could be expected to see. For any man who has been in the State only a year or two to Willis, Henry turn up in Melbourne as a senator to represent the whole State, or pretend to know all about it , is absurd. Such a man cannot represent Western Australia or misrepresent it. here except by the vote of the people. that. No man with a slight knowledge of a country gained within a month or two can represent any State as large as Queensland* South Australia, or Western Australia. A different system obtains in the United States. The State Parliaments are elected by the people, and senators are elected by the ' State Parliaments.

If the last Senate election had been decided hvthe polling hi those older parts of Western Australia, iMills, one of the candidates who was not elected, would have been at the head of the poll, Pearce, who was elected, would have been second, and Clarke would have been third. Consequently, two who were not elected Would have been elected, but that result was counteracted by the polling on the goldfields. I claim that the gold-fields should be well represented, but they should not dominate the representation of the State. No gold-fields member would claim that he should represent Agriculture. The right honourable member for Swan proved that 200,000 out of the 270,000people in that State reside within the area that would have returned those other two candidates as senators, had' the State been divided in the manner now suggested. It was never expected when I f he wishes to reprewe entered Federation that one party should dominate a State.

112,Mr Hedges,"I am allowing for i l lr.ives both to this House and to the Senate should be adopted which will allow all the people to be represented. Probably the result of the poll in Western Australia is to be accounted for in some degree by the small percentage of electors who went to the poll. In the Fremantle division only 37.47, in the Perth division only 29.96, and in the Swan division 44.97, of the electors voted*for Senate candidates. this reform required an alteration of the Constitution, I should not advocate it ; but the contingency was certainly contemplated, because there is already a provision in the Constitution .to meet it . There is provision in the Constitution that a State may be divided, if it be so desired. prevail in the other States? we see that New South Wales has no labour representatives in the Senate. I am sure that no one will say that labour interests should not be represented; and I claim that no system which does not allow representation to all parties is right. Western Australia the mining industrygold-mining, tin-mining, and so forth-is , of course, of great importance, and employs a large number of men for the time being; but the future prosperity of the country must depend on agriculture and the older industries. Those engaged in the latter will be responsible for the public debts; and yet industries which have sprung up, and may last only a few years, now govern the State. While it is quite riglit that those engaged in these industries should have a voice in the Parliament, I do not think that the representation of the whole State should be handed over to them, either in the case of this House or the Senate. I did not expect to have to speak on this motion, and, without going further, I have only to say that I shall be pleased to see it carried. move That all the words after "" force,"" line io, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" should be abolished and the Hare system of election adopted."" The Hare system was used in the first Senate election in Tasmania, and, from my stand-point, was very successful. The result was the return of a pronounced free trader, a protectionist, a labour man, one who was looked on as a military expert, a commercial man, and a general politician, who had been in the State Parliament and is now a member of the Senate. It will be seen that all parties were represented. But although at the last election the Labour Party received a large vote, they have no representation' in the Senate at the presenttime, whereas, if the Hare system had been used, they would have had at least one. The Labour Party of New South Wales, who returned so many members to this If House, have not one in another place. I have always been against the block system of voting, because, under it , half-a-dozen may ta.ke the whole of the seats, to the exclusion of all other parties. I am not very keen on party politics, but, at the same time, I believe that every party should be represented in a deliberative assembly, because that leads to all views being laid before the country, and a better In every State; and basis is provided on which representatives may form their judgment. What has happened in New South Wales may happen in all the States. South Wales all the senators were returned In by an absolute majority. know that a large number of labour members have been returned to this House, and that the votes in favour of their'party largely increased that year. This shows how the public feeling is going; and yet, as has been pointed out, New South Wales has no labour representation in the Senate. three representatives for New South Wales we shall have none. think it is necessary to make at long 'speech in support of my amendment, and therefore, I content myself with simply moving it. Amendment negatived. motion of the right honourable member for Swan does not commend itself to me. It (Bass) [3.42] I would put the representation in this House, and in another place, almost on the same franchise and basis; and that is not in accordance with what I believe to be the spirit of the Constitution, which, rather, provides that the Senate shall represent the States' interests, as, perhaps, sometimes opposed to the majority interests, of the people of the Commonwealth. This has been the case in almost every Federal Constitution up to the present; and it has always been recognised as necessary to have special representation of the States' interests which are involved in any partnership",19,Electorate S Any Other State Of That Size H E Can Only

Therefore, in my opinion, the arrangement made by which a State shall vote as one body is one which better reflects the opinions and wishes of a State as a State than if there were different electorates, as in the case of the House of Representatives. The fact that the present system has not worked as some honourable members would wish it to work in one State or another, is no reason why the present arrangement should be altered, providing the principle itself is a sound one. The fact that one particular party may have got more representation than some honourable member may desire, or another party in another State may have got less, is not to my mind a convincing argument or reason why the principle laid down in the Constitution should be annulled. A t the present time, we have, in each State, whether it be of comparatively small area like Tasmania, or of large area like Western Australia, Queensland, or South Australia, a representation elected, at all events, by tlie majority of the people voting as a whole. The honourable member for Fremantle pointed out that the three electorates proposed in the motion for Western Australia would have returned two members of oneparty and one member of the Labour Party, instead of three members of the latter, as at present. But, from the figures the honourable member quoted, it seems to me that the result of the Western Australian election was not due .so much to the system as to the fact that in the mining districts the electors chose to come to the poll, while in other electorates the people did not avail themselves of their right to the same extent. There was the same percentage throughout. understood the honourable member, but that is certainly what his figures led me to believe. In any case, it seems to me that we get a fairer reflex of a State's interests and wishes by the present system than we could possibly get by that proposed in the motion. It was recognised, when the Constitution was framed, that it was necessary to have the present system, partly because some of the States would otherwise probably be swamped. provided that the smaller States should have more representation in this Chamber than was actually their due on the basis of population, and. further, that the Senate should be able to conserve the interests of the States in two ways-on e by giving each State, irrespective of area, population, and other considerations, the same representation, and another by making the Senate electorates extend over the whole of the State, in order that there might be, as I said just now, a reflex of a State's interests and wishes. The present' system has not worked altogether satisfactorily ; tlie Senate has not, to my mind, been the custodian and guardian of the interests and rights of the States, as it thought it would be. But, at the same time, I do not think that the motion, if carried, would make any difference in this respect. It would mean, if anything, a change for the worse, and would certainly make the Senate more than ever a duplicate of this House. To my mind, the proper system has been followed under the Constitution, and in the scheme of electorates adopted, and I shall, therefore, be reluctantly compelled to vote against the right honourable member's motion. adjourned.

D r . ' ' CARTY _ SALMON marking that I did not feel that any apology was necessary for the introduction of this motion, because I am sure honourable members' will agree that the principle for which'it provides should obtain in connection with our Defence Forces. There may be in the minds of honourable members an impression that all that I ask for is already contained in the Defence Act and the regulations framed thereunder; but I Would point out that although section 8 of the Act provides that the Governor General may, amongst other things, appoint an officer to be commandant of any military district, and appoint and promote officers of the Defence Force, and issue commissions to them, it does not provide that it shall be incumbent upon the Governor General, or the Commandants whom he may appoint, to select officers upon considerations of merit, as overriding all other qualifications. In these circumstances. I feel that it is necessary, since the question of seniority is allowed to have, not merelv an undue, but an absolute influence on all promotions, that we should place in the very forefront of our defence legislation the principle that merit should have more influence upon appointments and promotions than any other factor. What is the position? We endeavoured to provide in the Public Service Act that merit should govern promotions, and went very much further than I propose to go in the direction of placing in clear language in that measure our desire in that regard. We find, however, that the dead hand of seniority controls the situation,and that length of service has a paramount influence upon appointments and promotions, which we specially desired should be governed by merit. Any honourable member who has inquired into this question will be satisfied that the spirit of the Public Service Act has been set at naught by those who should have been its most cordial and sympathetic administrators. find that the desire -which we have so clearly expressed in that Act is being to a very large extent ignored, we have additional reason for inserting this necessary provision at the earliest possible moment in our Defence legislation. When I a. vacancy occurs under present conditions, what is done? Practically the first and the last step taken is to ascertain who is next on the list in order of seniority. The officer determined to be next on the list is then appointed to the vacant position. I was reThat is not in accordance with the principle that should govern our Defence Force. We have determined that we should have what is known as a Citizen Defence Force, and that we should not rely solely upon a number of permanent men, more or less highly paid, for the defence of Australia. We prefer rather to rely upon the patriotism, industry, energy, ability, ancl capacity of our people as a whole. That being so, we ought to insure to those who take up the very necessary work of fitting themselves for the defence of their country every possible means, not only of perfecting themselves in their profession, but oi* reaching the highest positions in the service. As I have alreadv indicated, wnen a vacancy occurs the consideration of seniority is allowed to have absolute sway in determining how it shall be filled. Thc question which an officer asks before he makes a recommendation is invariably the same. It is not, "" Is this the best man available for the position?"" but "" Is this man good enough for the position ? "" That question ought to be varied. AVe should have appointed to any vacancy the very best man available and qualified to fill it. We should allow the. officer charged under the Act with the power of making a recommendation to make a choice, after a proper examination, both theoretical and practical, of the man best fitted to fill the vacant position. The present Minister of Defence has, to a larger extent than has any of his predecessors; shown his sympathy with the citizen defence system. He has displayed that sympathy in connection with the interchange of officers, having decided that the system shall no longer be a sort of close corporation for permanent officers. He has provided that militia officers shall have an opportunity to go to other parts of the Empire to obtain information and training that will be valuable to Australia, and he has also provided that the Military Board, which has presumably the control of oui When we Defence Forces, shall include members, of the militia. In the first place, he determined that militia officers should' be consultative members of the Board; but finding that that was not sufficient, he-",21,Promoti On Ofmembers Of Defence Forces
127,Mr Speaker,"The honourable memdirected that militia members should be think that I am entitled to say that fullj' appointed to the Board. The result, I have heard that it was very much although it is, only a brief period since the against his own will that he was taken change was made, has more than justified from aposition in New South Wales to his action.

However, until the duties of such a position with credit to now there has been this line, which militia themselves and advantage to those under officers may not cross, with the result that them.

Had the senior officer been appointed, the Director-General of the Medical Staff would have been given the position. able appointed? be right to discuss that question now ; the principle we should follow at all times is to appoint the best man available. This is the only case, so far as I am aware, in which an appointment has not been dictated by reasons of seniority. I do not wish to occupy more time than is necessary in putting the motion before the House, because I feel that honourable members are in sympathy with it. Since it has been on . the notice-paper, no honourable gentleman has expressed any considerable objection to it, and I do not think that even the Minister will strenuously oppose it. I am desirous that the principle which it embodies shall be affirmed. Although much has been accomplished by the present Minister, he would have done much more had he acted upon that principle. doing so have occurred time and again, but, unfortunately, he has not seen his way to avail himself of them The passing of the motion would be a direction to the Government that the principle must be embodied in any amending Defence Act, and in new regulations regarding promotion. In my opinion, considerations of merit should transcend all others. We must get the best material But no barrier available, and use it to the best advantage. In a body like the Defence Forces, there are always men wh'o are content to be carried along by the years to the goal which they ultimately hope to reach, and other men who will employ every spare moment, and grasp at every opportunity, to fit themselves, not only for the better discharge of their immediate duties, but for He is an Australian 'the performance of the greater responsibilities which they hope to be called upon to I do not bear. It is those of the latter class whom we should encourage. Under the present system, they are not sufficiently' encouraged. The right honourable member for Swan, when Minister of Defence, made many desirable reforms-althoug h I was opposed to He is a credit to his changing the volunteer into a partially paid system-bu t he would have done stiH more than he did to give satisfaction to the Still, whatDefence Forces had he provided that merit and capacity should be the chief factors in determining appointments and promotions. I commend the motion to the House with confidence, feeling sure that honourable members are in accord with it. Although merit may be recognised under the existing law, Parliament has not said specifically that that should be done, and, consequently, promotions are governed almost wholly by It would not seniority. honourable member for Laanecoorie may well submit, with confidence, a motion embodying so much abstract good; though I fail to see that the carrying of it will have much effect on what he has at heart. He asks us to affirm the principle of promotion according to merit. I do not think that the Minister would admit that the Board responsible for promotions is guided broad.lv by any other consideration. complaint is that while at present only permanent officers are promoted to positions in the Permanent Forces, abler militia officers, if available, should be called on. honourable member laid most stress, just Opportunities for prior to resuming his seat, was that merit should take precedence of seniority in determining appointments. His other point was that citizen soldiers should be given an opportunity to obtain promotions in the Permanent Forces from whicli he says they are at present debarred.

Undoubtedly the Promotion Board will still be able to say of a citizen soldier: ' He is an excellent 1 officer in the field, but we do not think he is able to give all the time required to the work, and consequently we recommend such and such a permanent officer for the position."" Dr. officer himself be the best judge as to whether he could give the time or not? a position to the work of which he states beforehand that he thinks he will be able to give a l l the time and attention necessary, and finds afterwards that he cannot do it , would the honourable member suggest the infliction of pains and penalties on him ? tired. for. the proposal would be perfectly safe. -But under present conditions, in any case, the Board that deals with promotions-generally would be the first to recognise the capabilities and enthusiasm of such officers of the Citizen Forces as wished to occuoy for a certain time permanent positions.

He is a citizen soldier, and is responsible for the collection of a great deal of the intelligence concerning the whole of the forces, so that, under the present system, it is fair to state that a citizen soldier who wishes to give the time and has the ability to occupy a position will be promoted by the Board.

""When I noticed this motion on the business paper, I wondered that the honourable member for Laanecoorie had brought it forward, because I was under the impression that what he desired wa.s already provided for by regulation. I find, however, that that is not so, although my memory was correct this far, that it was the law at one time.

He could become as old as he liked once he got into the Permanent Force, but he must not get old in the militia or volunteers. That -anomaly needed only to be pointed out to be altered.

154,Sir John Forrest (Swan) [4.34],"by about one-half, and that can only be clone by reducing: the number, because soldiers are very badly paid as it is, ancl I do not see how any economy can be expected in this connection. Our permanent soldiers, as a matter of fact, are both badly treated and badly paid; and, in this House, are subject continually to adverse criticism to which no man should be open. There is too much personality in the criticism levelled at our officers j and I think that we ought to be able to attack the system without descending to attacks on individuals. I regret that since Federation * 1 there have been so many personal attacks on individual officers in our forces, though I am glad to say the criticisms have in the main come from a few members. We shall never have discipline, or place the officer in the position in which he ought to be, if he knows that every single action of his will be criticised, not in general terms, but as an individual matter. I hope that the motion will be carried. I believe that I was Treasurer in 1905; but I had no idea that this regulation was not in force all the time; and I am sorry that it should ever have been annulled. I do not think that we shall find any one to say that this rule is not on the right lines, ancl should not at once be re-enacted. fact, as indicated by the right honourable member for Swan, that a regulation, which facilitates the introduction of members of the irregular forces, if I may so call them, into permanent positions, has been quietly dropped, emphasizes the necessity for this House giving expression to its opinion on the subject in a very emphatic way. AndI am quite sure that the opinion expresserl will be emphatic, and practically undivided. I regretted to hear the speech of the honourable member for Wentworth, which, although not very openly indicating his intention, appeared to be a piece of special pleading for the retention of those particular privileges which have been enjoyed by the permanent forces in Australia. I know that in the Old Country a very rigid line has been drawn in the past, and still exists, between the officers of the volvice, unless in time of .war it rendered theunteer service and the officers of the regular army fit to discharge its responsibilities, army. I feel sure that this tradition of l the regular troops of the Old Country has been carried into Australia, and continues here, in spite of the efforts made to put an end to it. If the defence of Australia is to be placed on a proper basis, embodying the principle of a citizen force, we must allow of the freest access to the higher positions, even in the permanent service, by men who belong to the less regular portions of the troops. I have known men of the volunteer branches of the service, who, by reason of ability and enthusiasm, were well fitted to take very high positions, but, by reason of this peculiar conservatism, that seems almost to be inherent in military matters, they were carefully blocked from taking that Tank to which tbeir merits and enthusiasm entitled them. I hope the Minister will take what I believe will be the unanimous direction of this House, and will see that no obstacle is placed in the way of officers belonging to the non-permanent forces getting equal facilities with others for attaining to the higher, better-paid, and more responsible positions. If that be done, it will prove an effective method of popularizing the proposal for which the Minister is responsible-the system of universal service. It will be an incentive to many of our young men to study and take their position as members of the Defence Forces in earnest. I believe that the quality and enthusiasm of our young men is such tiia/t we can rely on them to attain the very best levels ever attained in the regular service. I hope the niotion will be carried unanimously, and will be regarded as a direct indication to the Minister of the desire of the House to make this the principal feature of his scheme of national defence.

The honourable member for Laanecoorie rightly suggests that we ought to obtain our officers wherever we -can get them, making ability the main qualification. Except, perhaps, in the case of the Engineers, there is no difficulty with regard to the entrance of militia officers into the Permanent Forces, provided that they can pass the necessary examinations. The honourable member further desires that when there is a vacancy in any branch of fixed rules which must be followed. thc Military Forces, and there is a competent, able militiaman more suitable than all others, wherever they may be, to fill the position, it shall be given to him. porarily left the forces. material.

Forces we have very great trouble, and I should like, with the consent of the honourable member for Laanecoorie, to move an amendment that will have the effect of slightly extending his proposal. If it is wise to obtain able men from any part of the forces, it ""is surely wise, in the case of the Permanent Forces, to secure able officers wherever we can find them. To do that, we must destroy the controlling influence of seniority. I was asked iust now to support the extension of this principle to the Public Service generally. What happens now in the Public Service of the Commonwealth is that which occurs in the Defence Force. open, and Jones is the next in order of seniority, he secures it , unless he is absolutely unfit for it. Smith, another man in the service, may be singularly brilliant and able, but he will not be selected because Jones can, passably, discharge the duties of the position. We can well understand the reason for this. Those charged with the duty of making a selection probably say, "" If we have regard to seniority in making an appointment, we shall have nothing to explain, provided that the person appointed can do the work; but if we pass over to the man next in order of seniority, we shall have to explain a good deal to Parliament."" The same thing happens in connection with our Defence Forces. clusion that it is absolutely necessary to do away, as far as we can, with the dominating importance of seniority, and select the able man wherever he may be found. If the selecting Board and the Minister have a direction from Parliament to pay no special attention to seniority, but to select on merit, the position will be greatly improved.

Parliament will want to know a good should like Parliament to sustain the 1 Board by adding to the motion the proviEven with our own Permanent sion that, primarily, merit must be considered. The motion speaks of providing opportunity for promotion to any position which, "" by reason of adequate qualifications,"" any member of the Commonwealth Defence Forces may be competent to fill. We agree with that in theabstract; the difficulty is to determine what are adequate qualifications. If I disregarded seniority in making a promotion, the question would be asked, as it is continually asked in minor matters, if the adwhether I should be prepared vice of my experts had been followed. Frequently a Minister cannot do other than adopt the recommendations of his advisers. Therefore, although, if the House passes the motion, a method to give effect to it: If a position is thrown must be devised, it will be difficult to determine what that method shall be. But, while agreeing with the honourable member for Laanecoorie in general terms, it is necessary to add that care must be taken that the militia men are not given a preferenceover permanent men. They should be given a fair.opportunity, and if their qualifications surpass those of the professional.' men available, should be selected. I do not desire to criticise the Promotion Board or Military Board, whose members perform these duties. Buti t will hearten them to, know that Parliament expects them, not merely to consider seniority, but to see that, the best men are promoted.

(5.18] -The Minister has this _ afternoon given expression to many a truism. has repeated what has been said over and over again in this Chamber; that we should try to get the best men to the top. _ All are agreed as to that, our concern being to learn what steps he has taken to get the best men to the top, and to dislodge incompetence. That is the question to which the Minister should have addressed himself, instead of, as usual, confining .himself to generalities having no practical bearing. Seeing that he knows his duty so f u l l y, 1 ask what has he done to_ give effect to the admirable principles which hie has enunciated. poses to amend it , be carried, what will the Minister do? hearten the members of the Board. have known some singular happenings in -connection with that precious Board. In my opinion, its creation has not proved an advance upon the General Officer Commanding system which preceded it . We have not to-day a control superior to that which -obtained in the past. All are agreed that we should try to bring military ability to the top, and that to-day it is not on the top. In many instances, it is a long way down. What we wish to learn, therefore, is what steps the Minister is taking to bring -about the control of our Forces by the best military ability available, not merely in Australia, but within the Empire. If in one thing more than another, we should strip ourselves of prejudices and predilections, it is in dealing with the safety of the Empire. In such a matter our concern should be, not whether men are Australians, . Canadians, or Britishers, but whether they are the best for the positions which we wish -to fill. Where ability is equal, I would give Australians the preference, because there is no need to go abroad unless it is necessary to do so to obtain greater ability, skill, and experience, than is available here. But who is to prescribe the standard of merit ? The Minister says that he cannot do so. If we solemnly enact the propositions before us, we shall be no nearer the solution of that vexed question. Should it be proposed to entirely ignore seniority, I am not in accord with the amendment. It seemed to me, when being equal, seniority must count. ability and fitness shall be specially considered. done without the appointment of a special He tribunal. Who prescribes the present standards for our military officers? Other officers, who have never been in war. After all, text books are not everything. A man may study them until he has grown grey, and yet know little about military practice. Warfare is an aptitude and an art as well as a science. I have been told of a series of questions that were put to an officer high in command a little while ago. He answered them in the light of his South African experience, and, needless to say, he went down. They were all questions relating to the disposition Suppose the motion, as he proand movement of troops, and this oflicer, who had come from South Africa with the He says that it will greatest qualifications and tributes to his I capacity as a troop leader, failed when hauled up before people who had never seen a war. Consequently, we get back to the great trouble as to who is to prescribe the standard of efficiency and ability. If the Minister can solve that difficulty for us, there will be nothing further to say but I venture"" to assert that this amendment will not bring us one. step nearer the solution of that vexed problem. of suggestion to the Board. Minister wants the suggestion to go to the Board, but a prior question to be considered is this: Is the Board itself the embodiment of all the ability and skill in the service? Are your best men on your Board? If so, we may very well send them these indications of the intentions and wishes of the Government-.

That ought not to be. When the examiners put any officer through a test, they ought to consider equally his seniority and his ability. He has no right to promotion if he has not ability as well as seniority, but if he has both, if he is effiinterfere too much with the military forces. cient, I do not see that he ought to be told to step down in favour of another who has the ear of the examiners in a way that perhaps the man who has done his duty for many years has not.

After a l l , a Minister can do much in a Department like this to see that equity prevails, and that the administration of the Department, altogether apart from its technique, is just and fair to all the officers of the service. Much, therefore, depends upon the Minister. You may get as many experts as you like, but a Minister can still exercise useful functions-in those directions. The Minister might well let the motion go as proposed, as it would meet the circumstances of the case much better than if amended as he suggests. think that the Minister's amendment carries the motion much further. first. cannot be objected to on the grounds given by the honourable member for Parramatta.

Consequently, if a junior, for merit or other reasons, is put over a senior officer, the special circumstances governing the case have to be set out distinctly to the Promotion Board, and the senior officer superseded by the promotion has to be informed.

If A, who has merit, is junior ""to B , and is recommended to the Promotion I have no objection. I Board, the fact of his being junior to B has to be pointed out before the Promotion Board can act. Consequently, although the Minister's amendment does not ^carry .the motion [much further, it is not open to objection on the ground taken by the honourable' member for Parramatta, which is already fairly met by the regulations. I am glad the honourable member for Laanecoorie has moved the motion, although it is a great pity for civilians to We have had examples of that in history. When Lincoln decided as a mattei of policy that Washington had to be defended, against the best aelvice of his generals in the field, he caused a tremendous loss to the Federal forces. Going further back in history, Oliver Cromwell won the battle of Dunbar simply because certain Presbyterian ministers advised the generals on the other side that that was the time to attack the Puritans. When Cromwell, who had previously been in the tightest corner of his life, saw the attack coming he said, "" Let God arise and His enemies be scattered,"" and sailed in. In that case the advice of the Presbyterian clergymen, which would have been very good in the kirk, was most ill-advised in the field, and gave Cromwell the victory. Instances like that show that the less civilian interference there is with the military arm the better. But that Hoes not in any sense affect apolicy motion like this. I like the motion for this reason: The Minister knows that men in the militia or volunteer forces who win their commissions by service and examinationand some of those examinations are superior to those set for the Permanent Forces-if transferred to the Permanent Forces lose all their seniority and rank, and have to start again at the lowest level. If a captain or major in the militia having the Permanent Forces, and passes the examination, he must start again as a subaltern. That is not right. He should be transferred at his present rank. The present practice deters a lot of good men in the citizen forces from joining the Permanent Forces, and they are really the",31,Promoti On Ofmembers Of Defence Forces

I refer -to Colonel Robertson, who has the confidence of the whole of the Military Forces of Victoria, and was, I understand, willing to take the Commandantship of the State; but he was passed over because he was a. -militia officer, and a permanent officer was -selected.

I thought that was a very generous admission for Colonel Bingham to make. ColonelH a l l made a life-long study of artillery, and his opinion on that subject was sought by officers of the Permanent Forces. When he went fo 'Easter camps to take charge of the fighting detachments at the forts at the Heads-the station of the Garrison Artillery in time of war it was always found that every man, permanent and militia, in the camp had may have some special case in his mind, had a large increase in training after being but, for some time past, the examinations under ColonelH a l l . was not selected.

In a month's time an just as Colonel Robertson has been. If this examination for officers is to be held and motion can cure that sort of thing and the a number of officers, non-commissioned Minister supports it ancl actually puts it officers, and men have become candidates. into practice, he will be doing a great serAsI have already pointed out, there is a vice, because the effect will be to make different standard in each of the States, citizen soldiers feel that they will not be passed over for the highest commands if they like to make an enthusiastic study of their work. A citizen officer deals with citizen forces. He has grown up with them, and possibly has been right through the ranks. He has got to know the men, to understand exactly what the citizen forces desire, and how to deal withthem tactfully. That is why the citizen officer can succeed, where the permanent officer frequently has not such tact or ability. I has lately made a great advance in this connection. There has recently been established an Intelligence Corps, and a militia officer has beenput in command, not only in a State, but over the whole of the Commonwealth. I think those who know that officer will be proud of the selection, and the more so because this Intelligence Corps is being placed on a basis which will be a credit, not only to its military head, but to the Minister who instituted the innovation. I may further quote the Some of the best men who have gone into war have not necessarily had the training Colonel Bingof permanent officers. The great Cromwell, who, I suppose, was the greatest soldier England ever produced, was a He himself told me, country gentleman with only a little training in the Yeomanry; but he was a born leader of men, ancl his is by no means an isolated example. It is not necessary for a commander to have the confidence of the people that he should have been cooped up in barracks all his l if e ; ancl the Commonwealth need not at all fear placing a citizen officer even in the highest position.

If , as is probable, there are three candidates from Western Australia, two from South Australia, nine from ""Victoria, eight from New South Wales, and others from Queensland and Tasmania, it is very difficult to see how they can all be subject to the one examination. All the candidates might he brought to one central place, but then there would be danger of men entering merely for the sake of the trip. The other alternative is to have a shifting Examining Board, consisting of, say, three; but that-would mean a great expense, and the examination would occupy at least a couple of months. Colonel FOXTON -What is to prevent the examination being standardized ? in the case of a theoretical or educational examination, but the test to which I am referring now is practical, and is applied in the field; and we all know that different examiners have different standards. there be fifty or sixty candidates, it would cost about £ 2 0 each to bring those from Western Australia, and then it might be found that their only desire was to have a trip. travelling Board of three to visit each capital ; but there must be fairness, whatever the cost. Colonel would be sufficient. sist of one, if we had sufficient confidence in the man selected; but I do not like single Boards of the kind. Another difficulty is that there are different standards set for permanent officers as compared with militia officers. Since 1903, majors, in ' order to obtain promotion to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, have had to be examined, promotion having come as a matter of course prior to that year. The other day I cited the case of several militia and volunteer majors, who, in order to undergo examination, were taken out to Heidelberg, and there confronted with almost a f u l l brigade. On that occasion the examination I do not like to menwas thorough, and occupied nearly the whole of the day. There were two permanent officers who had to undergo the examination, and I understand that they were taken to Heidelberg by the 3 o'clock train It is a very big problem -arrive d there about 4 o'clock-reache d the ground at twenty minutes past 4 o'clock, and left within one hour, having completed successfully their examination. I may further say that one of these officers was given duty at outposts, and he was in a difficulty, when he was told, "" The best thing you can do is to say ' m o v e . ' "" The officer f o l lowed the advice, and the regiment was so well trained that it did the work, and he passed his examination. The 400 or 500 men there knew the facts, and the relation of them must have given rise to a sense of unfairness. The whole subject is tempting, but I have no desire to talk the motion out, and, therefore, conclude by expressing the hope that it will be carried. motion must commend itself to the House, only I am perfectly sure it will impose new difficulties on the already harassed Minister of Defence. It cannot be gainsaid that the men best fitted to occupy certain positions should be open to selection, but the Minister, by the amendment which he has proposed, and'in which he suggests that merit should be considered, shows that he appreciates the difficulty to which the motion gives rise. I have no hesitation in saying that the Promotion Board, which is to be appointed, will .have their task greatly increased if seniority is not to beregarded as the primary consideration amongst candidates who may otherwise beequal. Unquestionably promotion should be open to men who show particular ability, the motion' will commend itself to honourable members. I rose, however, for the purpose of referring to the Military Forces-List of the Commonwealth of Australia, whicli was published on ist August of this year, and which, I am sure, would prove most interesting if the Minister would supply copies to honourable members.

CARTY ' SALMON (Laanecoorie) [5.55] I think there is some misapprehension in the mind of one honourable memtar as to the action of the Minister in regard to the Militia. I have been in communication with the honourable gentleman during the whole term of his office, on the subject of greater recognition being given to this branch of the service, with the result that the Minister, in the first place, appointed consultative members of the Militia to act on the Military Board, and, when he found that that was not sufficient, he made them full members. He has also provided that militia officers shall have, with regard to excnanges, the privileges that are enjoyed by permanent omcers, and that non-commissioned officers in the militia shall participate in the same concessions. He has directed further that militia officers shall have special instruction at universities and schools of training. In addition to that, he has created a medical reserve for the whole of Australia, a body which the Director-General of the medical service, General Williams, had sought for years to induce-other Ministers of Defence to establish. The consequence is that we now have enrolled, without any cost to the Commonwealth, the most highly-trained surgeons and physicians in Australia, who are prepared, when called upon, to give their services. The honourable gentleman also chose fpr the position of head of the Intelligence Corps, which extends all over Australia, a militia officer of very high qualifications. I refer to Colonel McCay, of Castlemaine, a former member of this House, who, I think, is one of the most promising militia omcers that we have. This is the first time that a militia officer has been chosen for the supreme command of a Commonwealth force. The Minister's acwith the interest that he has always shown in the development of our militia system.

I have had for a considerable time in my mind's eye a number of energetic, able, self-sacrificing, and patriotic officers who have spared no effort to qualify themselves to carry out their duties, and who will regard the passing of this motion as a partial discharge of the debt whicli the country undoubtedly owes them.

I wish, at the outset, to say that my criticism, whilst levelled at the scheme for which this Bill provides, does not involve any personal attack on the Minister himself. Notwithstanding that he has seen fit to change his views on this question during the last few months views. gentleman must have done so, since the Bill embodies principles diametrically opposed to those which lie declared to be essential to the effectiveness of our Defence Force when he was not in office. It is necessary that the Minister's scheme should be subjected to the most searching criticism, since it involves immense interests, and any grievous mistake regarding the principle by which our Military and Naval Forces are to be governed would be attended by far-reaching consequences. Reference has been made to the manner in which the forces have been treated, and the Minister .himself has complained that they do not"" take the trouble to make themselves efficient. The wonder is, after listening to tbe ""statements that have been Bill is to be proceeded with almost immade as to the treatment of members of mediately. the forces in the matter of promotions, instruction, and equipment, that there is anyi desire on the part of any section of the community to offer their services in a military capacity. But as I showed yesterday when speaking to this motion, the report of the Inspector-General indicates that he takes a most optimistic view of, BILL. not only the present condition of the forces, but their future development, if the present system receives anything like proper encouragement. I propose to relate to the House a case that I have already brought under the notice of the Minister,' since it shows the lack of encouragement offered to those who desire to serve in a military capacity. The case is that of a man who has served with distinction, has an excellent record, is well spoken of by his former officers, and who is admitted to be one of the best qualified instructors that we have had in Australia. He left the service temporarily to engage in private business, and is now precluded by regulation from re-entering the service unless he submits himself to an examination. There is also a provision which debars him on the score of age, although he is a compara^ tively young man, still in the full vigour of manhood, and anxious to render service to his country. He has made application for positions that have become vacant in the Defence Forces, and for which he has special qualifications. Nevertheless, he is absolutely debarred from re-entering the service, except at the discretion of the officers charged with the making of appointments, who may waive certain regulations. . Some of the regulations impose unnecessary restrictions on, and place unnecessary obstacles in the way of, men who desire to serve their country, and whose services would be of extreme value to us. I shall not mention the name of the man to whose case I have referred, for I know that the Minister is familiar with it, and intends to inquire into the matter. As to the general question of defence, this Bill does not take into account the naval side of our Defence Forces. That we are told is to be dealt with at a later stage. To deal with the military arm before we have settled the naval policy of Australia is to put the cart before the horse.",35,Telephone Connexions And Extensions New South Wales

The naval side of our defence is of paramount moment to Australia, but die Bill does not make more than passing reference to it. Under certain clauses its provisions are applied to the Naval as well as to the Military Forces. In clause 3, for instance, it is provided thatThe active Citizen Forces-to be known as the National Guards shall consist of those undergoing training under sections 58A and 58B of this Act, together with the officers, soldiers, petty omcers, and sailors serving. . . . and so forth. passing references to the Navy. in agreement with the amendment moved by the honourable member for Flinders, and think that it correctly sets forth what should be the attitude of the Government in dealing with the question of defence. The people have been told that Australia needs to be self-reliant, and to have a navy of her own. We are told that Australia must no longer look to Great Britain to protect her, and that the time has arrived when she must strike out for herself, and assume a more or less independent attitude. But even should it be at any time advisable for Australia, while forming part of the British Empire, to take such a step, the occasion for it is not yet ripe. To do so would involve the country in immense expenditure and consequent greatly increased taxation.' socialistic members of the party on which the Government mainly relies for support may hail with satisfaction the prospect of establishing an Australian navy, not because they regard it as requisite for our defence, but because it will assist in the realization of their socialistic aspirations, by increasing expenditure, and necessitating the imposition of heavier taxation. That they dearly love to impose taxation upon the people was shown recently in the discussion of the Tariff. we shall have to impose extra taxation to provide the money directly, or to pay interest and to meet loans, should it be borrowed. This would give them an excuse for imposing further taxation on property. silly? socialistic members of tlie party look upon the possession of private property as an It should have been evil whicli must be met by the impositionof taxation, and think that the frittering On the naval away of money on an Australian Navy would afford a reason for increasing taxation, and thus getting in a blow against owners of property. They seem to forget that defence of the lives of the citizens is the primary consideration, .protection of property merely a secondary one. If we have a navy, it must, in time of war, be under the control of the British authorities. Ever since the Prime Minister surprised this community by declaring at the Imperial Conference that we were not favorable to the continuance of the contribution under theNaval Agreement, he has inisisted in his We find in the Bill only negotiations with the Admiralty, first, that I am we must have a navy of our own, or the nucleus of one, and. secondly, that it must be 'controlled by the Australian people. To that the Admiralty has replied, "" We do not ask for a change in the existing arrangement; but, even if you cease tosubscribe towards the cost of maintaining the British Navy, we shall recognise our responsibility to safeguard and protect Australia in common with every other part of the Empire."" The Prime Minister has made diplomatic efforts to get the Admiralty to f a l l in with his views, but it has refused to be led into so false a position. It has taken the attitude that it will not object to the discontinuance of the subsidy, and the substitution of some other arrangement for the present agreement; but it will not ask for or suggest a change, and insists The that even if the Commonwealth Government decide to terminate the existing Agreement, and-build an Australian, fleet of her own, vessels of war must, in time of trouble, be under British control. In this connection I should like to read one more extract from a speech of the Ministeri n 1903 on the Naval Agreement Bill-Han sard, volume x i v . , page 2053I see no difference between Imperial and Australian interests in this case.

A little later he saidNow, let me turn to what appears to me to be the vital, and perhaps the most plausible part of the argument of the honourable members who opposed the B ill . They claim that an Australian Navy would be always on the spot. The honourable member for Bland referred to that -aspect of the case. It is therefore reasonable to ask, in what part of Australia will the Australian Navy always be found? The people of Sydney have visions of it destroying the enemy right against Port Denison. The people of Melbourne imagine that a bloody battle will be fought on the pellucid waters of the Yarra. Thc South Australians expect that an engagement will take place in Largs Bay, adjoining the precincts of the evangelical city of Adelaide, while the Western Australians imagine that the squadron will always be found off Fremantle, at the mouth of that magnificent streamlet, the Swan. Fvery coastal village and seaport town has the fantastic notion that the naval battles of the future will be fought on the adjoining ocean. Are honourable members aware that Australia has a coast line 8,000 miles in extent, so that to circumnavigate the Continent is to travel as far as one-third of the distance round the world, or two-thirds of the distance to England? Before"" an Australian Navy could steam once round the Continent war vessels could arrive from Africa, from India, from China, and from the Mediterranean. If that be so, we should need a navy which could intercept the fleets of foreign powers wherever they were converging upon Australia. But what is proposed is merely tlie construction of a few vessels, to be kept anostly within our harbors. Such a fleet, if these vessels can be so dignified, certainly couJd not be sent to sea to intercept -a.n enemy. merely an improved coastal defence, not ths building of a navy like that of Great. Britain. calls it a navy, but what is proposed is, of course, not a navy at all. And such a small flotilla could be used, if at all, Australian Navy is to be merely a flotilla commerce at sea, where the greatest danger lies? This is what the Minister said in If the vessels of an Australian Navy are to of the coastal cities, how many shall require? How many will there be to protect Sydney? How many will lie off Port Phillip? How many will be required to protect our coast and trade? It is obvious that, to keep open the highway of the sea, our ships must, not wait for the enemy. Our Navy must be strong enough to seek out the enemy and destroy him wherever he may be found. That is the difference between having a Navy and having a few torpedo boats or cruisers to protect our ports. What is essential is to control the sea by destroying the enemy. A little later he saidObviously this notion of an Australian Navy remaining in port rests upon a rotten foundation, and need only be dealt with in the most casual way for the whole argument to evaporate. There is the Minister's own condemnation of the present harbour and coastal defence scheme. Captain Creswell, in a report on the defence of Australia, furnished in 1905 in reply to questions asked by the then Minister of Defence as to what the Commonwealth should have in the way of a Navy, specified three ' cruiser-destroyers, sixteen torpedo boat-destroyers, and fifteen torpedo boats, first and second class. He states the estimated cost of the vessels at ,£1,768,000, with .£532,000 for the maintenance of the vessels, commissioned and in reserve, during seven years, or a total of ,£2,300,000. He adds for the cost of upkeep j£ 120,000 per annum in peace time, '' including an addition of 456 to the Permanent Forces, and 466 to the Naval Militia,"" but he does not call this a fleet for the effective protection of Australia. All he says is thatThis will provide a defence not designed o as a force for action against hostile fleets or squadrons, which is the province of the Imperial Fleet, but as a line necessary to us within the defence line of the Imperial Fleeta purely defensive line, that will give security to our naval bases, populous centres, .principal ports, and commerce.

The vessels should be under the Admiral in crews subject to the Naval Discipline Act, embarked under the same terms of engagements as in the Royal Navy.

It is practically certain tliat the system of defence recommended would do very little to protect Australian interests from their depredations. He refers to radding cruisersThat system would be like the militia of Dryden's day"" In peace a charge, in war a weak defence."" Sir Edward Fremantle saysSo far as I have studied the report, I can, I think, see that the proposals made by Captain Creswell are, in the main, sound, as while local defence will always be necessary, and receive popular favour, he recognises that the true defence for an island, with an important oversea trade, must rest in the "" command of the sea,"" which must depend, not on local effort, but upon the up-to-date strategic fleets of a strong maritime power. A defeat of the British Fleet in the Mediterranean or Channel would mean far more to Australia than even the bombardment of Sydney or Melbourne. All these experts are in agreement on the two salient points-the ineffectiveness of a small local naval force, and the necessity, if naval defence has to be considered, of having an up-to-date sea-going fleet, prepared to go thousands of miles, if necessary, into other seas to deal with the enemy. Only recently the London Daily Chronicle, in a leading article, had the followingThe. Admiralty very properly stipulates that in war time its control of the Australian Navy must be absolute. Nothing is more certain than that Australia will be unable for many years to assume the sole responsibility of naval defence. Her safety depends 011 the British Navy, and will continue to so depend. Then we have Admiral Bridges sayingIt was commonly believed that the ships would be well employed in the defence of particular localities, but this was opposed to all well understood naval stategy, and completely refuted by every page of British naval history. There is only one position in war time for the British man-o'-war to occupy, and that is, in close proximity to the enemy's ships. The Australian Squadron could not be considered a social institution, to steam from port to port, but had imcomparably higher functions to perform. In past history badly managed naval combinations had invariably been due to interference by shore-going people to be effective in the wrong direction. These are the opinions of naval experts, ancl I quote them in order that the arguments I have advanced against the Government scheme may not be declared to b* those of one who, having had no practical experience, cannot claim to be an authority, and whose utterances, therefore, are not worth serious consideration. In regard to the much lauded local effort at defence of coasts, harbors, and rivers by means of a small flotilla of destroyers, torpedo boats, and [48] similar craft, the experience of the RussoJapanese war shows that torpedo boats are of practically very little effect. They have but little chance against a vessel in proper fighting trim, even under cover of darkness, for the searchlights would betray them, and they would be exposed to fire. In rough weather, they are of little use. and in the recent war, they only operated in smooth water with destructive effect noon ships already crippled by gun-fire. Special reference is made to this point in some of the reports by those who were en gaged in the struggle between Russia and Japan. Captain Klado, late Flag-Captain for Admiral Rozhdestvenski, in his account of the battle of Tsushima, speaking of the attacks by torpedo craft, statesSuch attacks on ships unharmed by gun-fire, and having room to manceuvre, have little chance of success. This was proved in the battle. . . . The torpedo craft of the enemy played the role assigned to them-to attack and sink ships already damaged by artillery. This they effected, and under most favorable circumstances. At night, when the sea became calm, they sunk four or five ships amongst those which were the worse battered by gun-fire during the day. Our (these) vessels could neither see ""the approaching vessels nor fire upon them; and, in addition to this unenviable state, they were already h a l f f u ll of water through the damage caused by the enemy's guns. In my opinion, if the Japanese really had from 70 to 100 torpedo boats they should have destroyed more ships-the situation was so favorable to them. This though did not happen, and the difficulty of attacking a ship (by torpedo craft) which has preserved its power of repelling attack, was fully demonstrated by the fact that those of our ships that were saved from destruction were the ones least damaged by gun-fire during the day. Similar testimony is given by Captain Semenoff, who was one of the oflicers on the Russian flag-ship at the same battle, showing the modest success of torpedo craft, even in these most favorable circumstances. Sir G. S. Clarke, in his preface to Captain Semenoff's book, saysA few isolated successes obtained by torpedoes in exceptional circumstances have given rise to exaggerated claims on behalf of this weapon which can only end in disappointment. I need not quote any more, though I have other authorities equally reliable. It is proposed to spend an enormous amount of money on a line of defence which has been proved quite recently to be anything but up tb the standard of efficacy which many claim. As to submarines, they move slowly in the. water, and their reliability has yet to be demonstrated. It would be foolish for us to spend money on the acquisition of vessels which are only in their experimental stages, ancl have not proved of any value in actual warfare. What we have to consider is the nature of the attack we are expected to repel, and the quarter from whence it may come. The danger certainly does not iie within our own borders. If the States were separate communities, speaking different languages, with different aims and objects, and actuated by mutual jealousies and desire for conquest, we could understand the necessity for a standing army of some kind. But we are one people, very few in number, scattered over a large continent; and we have dividing lines only to the extent that is necessary to give each State a system of local self-government uncier one common flag. Although, as a matter of precaution, it is wise to have a land force of some kind, and to have it fully equipped and ready in every respect, still we do not need a force sufficiently large to repel that kind of invasion which we might expect if we were distinct communities, with antagonistic designs, separated only byimaginary lines. The only attack we may expect is from over the sea; and we ""have to ask ourselves, what are the probabilities of attack, and with which nations are we most likely* to come in conflict. Some people have an idea that our only fear is of invasion by Asiatic, races; but I regard that as a mistake. Those who think the Japanese, for example, may swoop down on our shores, overlook the fact that the Japanese have much to do now in developing their internal policy, and that they have sufficient lancl in Korea under their control to accommodate anysurplus population for some years to come. pare against invasion by a country with a population of 46,000,000? vasion, no matter by whom. that quarter, should we be able to meet the enemy with any land force that we could put in the field. Are we to prevent such an invasion with the little flotilla which the Prime Minister speaks of as the Australian Navy? cording to the honourable member. nothing as .spend millions on a scheme so futile as that proposed. There is also to be taken into account the existence of the British-Japanese alliance, which, while it continues, precludes any idea of Japanese invasion. It is interesting to remember in this connection what is the strength of the fleets of the naval powers in the Pacific at the' present time, ancl to consider what chance Ave should have of dealing with any of them, if we were unfortunate enough to become embroiled. .In the Pacific, Japan has thirty-ione large armoured ships, including two Dreadnoughts and two Inftexibles now building, each of which is as powerful as any of the ships of the American Fleet which lately visited Australia. In addition, Japan has two huge battleships, the AM and the Satsuma, which are the most formidable of the kind in the Pacific. Those six vessels are practically of the effective fighting force of six Dreadnoughts, and added to them there are ten other first-class battleships, twenty-five cruisers, 112 torpedo craft, besides five river and gunboats. If Japan is a country from which we have to fear invasion, I ask the honourable member for Macquarie what chance we should have against such a fleet, ancl all the hundreds of thousands they could' bring to our shores? got together in twenty-three vears. not attempt it with a population of four and a quarter millions of people, nor had' they a British Navy behind them. As I have said, ten or fifteen years hence will be soon enough for us to° consider the desirableness of establishing an Australian Navy, but if we are to deal with a country possessing a navy so strong as is that of Japan, we must have an equally powerful one to defend us. It is in this respect that we have to relyon Great Britain. As long as her fleetsremain we need have no fear, and there is no occasion for us to spend money in this direction. Great Britain has expended' o v e r .£200,000,000 on her navy, whilst the naval expenditure of Japan must haverun into tens of millions. Are we prepared to saddle the taxpayers of Australia with the cost of providing such a] navy, and is. it necessary in any case for us to do so?' I do not think that we have any fear of"" invasion from America, but I would point out that the United States have in thePacific-chiefl y in the Philippines-fifteen , large armoured ships, six cruisers, and seven torpedo boats.

Nor is it necessary for me to refer to the navy of Chili, for we have nothing to fear from that direction. The navies of China and of Russia will take some years to become formidable in comparison with those of other naval powers in the Pacific, and there is no serious ground to apprehend trouble from those quarters at present. Where we have to look for the possibility of aggression is from England's greatest commercial rival. That there is a probability in .the more or less distant future of Great Britain coming into collision with Germany we have some evidence. We have, for example, only to trace briefly the history of the rise of German naval power. Until 1888 Germany bad no navy to speak of. She had a. great army, and was chiefly concerned with internal affairs and with the task of keeping her neighbours from crossing her borders. maintained a large and efficient standing army. It was only on the accession of the present Emperor of Germany fo the throne, in 1888, that the Germans began to develop a new naval policy. That that policy was not developed for the purpose of home defence I shall be able to prove by quoting from the utterances of many notable German authorities. Germany's new naval policy was initiated by Lieutenant-General Von Stosck, and afterwards continued by his successor, Von Caprivi. Let us see the progress made during the few years of the reign of the Emperor William II . In 1888 the German Navy had a tonnage of 189,136, with 182,470 horse-power, and 15,573 men. In 1905 the tonnage had increased to 500,893 tons-a n advance of 311,757 -wit h 682,670 horse-power and a complement of 40,862 men. In that short period Germany practically trebled her naval strength It was in 1884-5 that she entered upon her oversea colonizing expeditions. She first began to assert herself and to acquire territory in South Africa, South-West Africa, East Africa, New Guinea, the Marshall Group, the New Britain Group, and other portions of the Pacific. We now see that she has naval bases stretching round Australia some thousands of miles, to the coast of South America, and these will afford her convenient coaling and refitting stations. In support of my belief that the German[ 8]-2 4 Navy has been built for offensive and not for defensive purposes, I shall quote a few extracts from some notable statesmen. Since the eighties the naval policy of Germany has been directed mainly to wresting from Great Britain the supremacy of the seas. In Marcli, 1897, the Secretary of State, Admiral Hollman, declaredWe require no navy for coast defence; our coasts defend themselves. On 24th A p r i l , 1897, the EmperorW ill i a m II . , speaking at a banquet at Cologne, said, pointing to a figure of Neptune, ""That trident must be in our fist."" On another memorable occasion he said, "" Our future lies upon the water."" That has been ever since the watchword of Germany. Onn t h December, 1899, Prince Von Bulow declared in the ReichstagWe must create a fleet strong enough to exclude attack from any power. Admiral Terpitz, who was Minister of Marine, a few days later saidWith that object-in view she We do not know what adversary we may have to face; therefore we must arm ourselves with a view of meeting the most dangerous conflict possible. Then, again, the preamble to the German Naval Bill of 1900 readsGermany requires a fleet of such strength, that a war against the mightiest naval power would involve risks threatening the supremacy of that power. What does that mean? I do not think that Great Britain has aggressive designs on any power. That has not been her policy for many years. The object of the British Navy has been to preserve the peace of the world and to safeguard the commerce of the Empire, to keep open the ocean highways of trade, and for that purpose alone does it aim at retaining supremacy to n s of the seas. Great Britain is constantly adding to its navy merely for the purpose of self protection. Having in view the increasing armaments of its great commercial rivals-especiall y those just across the Channel-it realizes the necessity of keeping up its naval strength to at least a two-power standard. That is the sole reason for the present new expenditure on Great Britain's Navy. The utterances I have quoted on the part of prominent German statesmen and by the Emperor of Germany himself cannot be overlooked. They are not made in a haphazard fashion, and they carry a significance to which due importance must be attached. It is necessary, therefore, for Great Britain to have her fleets always in such a state of preparedness and effiuiency that she may be able at the shortest notice to withstand any onslaught. has no hostile designs against any other nation, but she has a large Empire to defend against aggression and immense responsibilities of an international character to discharge. The supremacy of the sea is, therefore, a vital question to her. MonsieurM . E. Lockroy, who was'three times French Minister of Marine, in a book which he published, made the f o l lowing significant declarationGermany wil l be a great naval power in spite of her geographical position and history. Her claim to rule the waves w ill bring on a war with Great Britain, earlier or later. That war will be one of the most terrible conflicts of the tention to the training of the junior and twentieth century. We cannot afford to ignore statements of this kind made by statesmen of experience, whose business it is to know what is going on, not only at home, but abroad. have to look the possibilities in the face and to realize what they mean to us. We must recognise how puny, after all, are the efforts indicated in this B ill to meet the contingency foreshadowed in these utterances. I propose to summarize my views on this question by saying that my chief objections to the B i ll are that there is no need for a change in the present system, no present necessity for an Australian Navy, and no occasion for a large army ; that there is no need for conscription, but rather for encouraging the system of voluntary service which should be paid for. What we really need is to endeavour to help the Mother Country in her efforts to protect us in the only way in which we can be effectively protected, and that is by guarding our commerce on the sea. can best afford that assistance, not by wasting money on small flotillas and experimental fleets, or on a large standing army-by whatever name it might be called-bu t by increasing our contribution to the cost of the British Navy. should make our contribution more commensurate with the measure of protection we receive than is the subsidy that we are now paying. the honourable member propose? hurting ourselves, increase the amount to ,£500,000. Looking at the matter even from a mercenary stand-point, it would be cheaper and better fo do that than to spend the large amount proposed for the construction of a small flotilla of questionable utility. The work which the proposed She vessels are to do could be much more effectively and cheaply accomplished by land batteries. As to the proposed conscript army, while the Minister deserves credit for his attempt to improve the efficiency of our forces, I think that it would have been better had the recommendations of the Inspector-General been followed, and, our existing forces placed on a more satisfactory footing and brought up to their proper strength and equipment, as proposed by the Prime Minister before the last general elections. More encouragement should be given to the partially-paid Militia Forces and the rifle clubs, and more atsenior cadets. But I do not see any need to go to the extent proposed by the B ill , and, as I think that the amendment expresses the true position, I shall support it . WeI am sure that in time of need Australians will be found ready and willing enough to offer voluntarily service in defence of their country. not my intention to wander through old numbers of Hansard, or to hunt up returns or statements, which others can find and read for themselves, and form their judgments upon. By abstaining from doing this, I shall save both time and expense in printing. The speech of the honourable member for Corio was one of the most practical on defence questions I have heard in this Chamber. He went to the root of the many evils of the present system, showing that it has largely failed because there are in charge persons who are nof competent to perform their duties. I was sorry We to notice that one of the morning newspapers referred to his speech as though the honourable member had spoken of the In spector-General as a square peg in a round hole. As a matter of fact, he paid a compliment to the Inspector-General, who, in We my opinion, is the best-qualified officer in Australia for the work he is doing. He has shown an immense amount of energy and intelligence in the discharge of his duties, and, in many cases, has taken upon himself work which should have devolved on others. When we, in Tasmania, want anything done, it is always to him that we appeal. A great deal has been said about compulsory service. I hold that our present Act provides for that.

If it were made compulsory for men to be trained, they would attend drill in larger' numbers, and the cost of drill instructors would be no greater than at present, except that in towns where no drill is now held new companies would be formed and extra instructors provided. In Tasmania, we have had as good companies and drill instructors under the volunteer system as we could have had under any other system. It was not until the militia system was introduced on the mainland, and the Tasmanians became dissatisfied at not being ""paid, although they were connected witli the Commonwealth Forces, while those on the mainland were paid, that we had any trouble in that direction. Some people ask, "" What is the reason for taking any more action towards defence than we did some years ago?"" Every year we are advertising Australia more fully. We did so by means of the visit of the American Fleet; our commerce is increasing, as is shown by the gratifying expansion of our imports and exports; we are growing in importance, and people who'have not heard of us in the past will hear of us and of our increased wealth in the future. The fame of our goLd mines will go forth, and if there is trouble with other nations, no doubt they will have an eye on Australia, l t is, therefore, our duty to prepare to defend ourselves. With regard to the amendment of the honourable member for Flinders, whether we have a navy of our own or depend' on the British Navyi t is our duty to have land forces in order to be able to give a fitting reception to any force that escaped the navy and sought to land on our shores. We must therefore undertake, not only naval, but also military defence, and, in providing a strong land defence, we shall only be carrying out our part of the agreement, which we have not yet carried out to the f u l l . The right honhit. That was because the men had not orable member for Swan said two or three years would elapse before this force could be brought intp operation. We have been told that the present force is not to be interfered with, and therefore it is quite right that we should begin the new scheme as early as possible. I do not favour the expenditure of a large sum of money for anvthing but the supplying of the troops with uniforms, rifles, and ammunition. I do not believe in paying men to defend their own country. We pay no man to defend his own hpme, and it is no more necessary to pay a man to learn to protect himself and his country against an enemy. One honourable member has been referred to as a sweater because he suggested the payment of is. 3d. per day. I believe there is sufficient spirit in the men of Australia to make them ready to defend their country when called upon. If training were made compulsory, more men would be willing to attend drill when they saw that all the citizens were in the same position. At present, while the working classes go to drill, they see members of another class of the community going about dieir pleasures. labourer do if he had to be away from his work for practically a month every year, without any payment for it? man to leave his work for eighteen days. I would ask men to attend drill for two or three hours a week. That would be more useful and profitable. Camp life could be quickly learned. Men who live in the country do not require a great deal of instruction in that sort of thing. People who live in towns need it more, while those in the country would perhaps need more instruction in drill. The honourable member for Lang referred to rifle ranges and shooting practice. It is easy to shoot, if one has a good eye and a steady hand, knows the distances, and is aided with all the paraphernalia for sighting the target; but in actual warfare men need the faculty of judging the distance of the enemy. Men in the country are better judges of distances, because that is part of their daily life. Men who live in the towns should be taken into the country to learn range finding. Some time ago I went to Williamstown, and saw a number of riflemen shooting at the new head-and-shoulder targets at unknown distances. When the figures were examined, we found that very few had been been trained to judge distances, and the conditions were new to them, if they had been trained in that kind of work they would probably have scored a much greater number of hits. I found this out as a rifle shot myself years ago. When I went into the country and tried my hand at judging distances, I made mistakes, and had to measure off before I could effect good shooting.

247,Mr Storrer,"I would not ask anytion in the direction proposed 'by the Government. Some honourable members are always opposed to new legislation, not because they have looked into it, but simply because they do not want to give the necessary time ancl attention to discover whether it is better than what has gone before. Thev are content to let things go on in the quiet old fashion; but I like to look into new proposals for myself and to adopt, anything that I find to be good. 1 believe that the adoption of compulsory training for the young men of Australia will be one of the best things that could happen here. That system is adopted in Switzerland, and has been commended by other nations, but some honourable members are inclined to oppose it because it is foreign to us. It is advocated by some of the newspapers, and altogether would be a good thing for Australia. I hope the B ill will pass, and that we shall have a strong and effective Defence Force at no great expense to the community. If that is achieved, it will be as distinct gain to the community. I trust that the Minister of Defence, whoever he may be at the time, will see to it that young, vigorous, energetic officers are selected, who will insure that drill and all other details are carried out to the letter. It will be better to put many of the. old men on the retired list, and let them pass their remaining days in comfort, than to have them as stumbling blocks m the way of those who are energetic, and who wish to do what is best for their country. which will be a credit to us and that many of the drawbacks of the present system will disappear. for Swan regarded it as a reflection on the people of Australia,-althoug h it is unfortunately true-to state that a number of men join the forces for a little while in order to take part in a big parade, or some expedition to a distant city, and then drop out of the ranks again. I do not sav that those men do it for the sake of the money, but they do it for the sake of the trip. I have seen it happen over and over again, and sometimes have thought that it has brought discredit on the forces. Uncier a strict system of discipline those men would not be allowed to take part in the trip. They sometimes come in before a big parade and destroy the good marching of those who have been drilling for a whole year. The others are disgusted, and will not attend drill again. Men should not be allowed to participate in these trips unless they have attended a certain number of drills, ancl thoroughly qualified themselves for their duties. I do not pose as a military expert, or as one who can. give much scientific advice on these matters, but I have read a great many of the opinions advanced by experts, including the Minister. I heard him, ana read his speech afterwards, but not twice, as the honourable member for Flinders did, and I think I have fairly got the hang of the situation. It is difficult to criticise a measure dealing with the defence of Australia when only half of the complete scheme is put before us. We are told that Australia is an island continent, and that the Navy ought to be our first line of defence. But the Bill does not deal in any way with the naval question, and it is difficult to pronounce an opinion upon the land defence proposals while we are kept entirely in ignorance of the intentions of the Government with regard to naval defence. I must, therefore, support the amendment of the honourable member for Flinders. First of all, we have to consider what are the dangers against which we have to provide. We have been told by experts that there are not any very great dangers; but I am not one to belittle dangers, of anv sort. I do not like to mention names, but one has been mentioned so commonly, that it can now make little difference; and I point out that, with an enormous country like Germany, containing an inI hope we shall have a force creasing population of 62,000,000, thoroughly drilled, there is a menace which the people of the Old Country reThe right honourable member gard as very serious. If we were to place ourselves in the position of the German people, and we found our people emigrating to foreign countries, we would, I think, take any measure we could to obtain some portion of the earth's surface, where we could colonize under our own flag. I cannot, therefore, say that Germany is doing anything that she should not do in vieing with Great Britain in producing a navy, which, in a few years, will be a menace to the navy of the Old Country. We see that over 80 per cent, of the vessels of the British Navy are gathered around the British coasts in order to watch for and ward off any attack upon the heart of the Empire. vessels where there are no foreign ships. and there are so many foreign ships close",45,Defence Second Reading

250,Mr Fairbairn,"In that I agree;to the heart of the Empire, that very few of the British Fleet are available for service abroad. I would be the last in the world to belittle the British Navy. The question with us is how we can best help it; and so far as I can judge, the best way is for us to form harbors of refuge. I see that that is the recommendation in the report of the Committee of Defence; and I think it is a point on which we are all agreed. The Committee indicate Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Fremantle as the places where such harbors might be provided. In my opinion our own oversea defence must always be undertaken by the British Navy; and all that we can expect to do is to assist that navy by such means as I have indicated, and, perhaps, by providing a small fleet of torpedo destroyers, and submarines, and so forth, in the way suggested by the Government. At any rate, such a step would be in the right direction. A point which, I think, deserves attention is disclosed in the Prime Minister's correspondence with the Admiralty, namely, that the Australian Commonwealth could never expect to have complete control, in time of war, of its own navy. I do not need to go into strategic reasons', but.the law of nations provides that there can be only one control of the forces in time of war, and that control must be in the hands of the King and his officers. There could be only two motives underlying the desire for Australian control of an Australian navy. One motive would be an exceedingly unworthy one, namely, the eventual breaking away of Australia from the Empire; and I do not think there are many people in Australia who have any desire in that direction. Another motive would be the feeling that the Commonwealth should have the power to decide whether or not the navy should be used in any part of the world, the idea no doubt being that there might be a panic in the Old Counable member for Richmond is an excellent try, ancl that the Australian Navy might be taken off to the British Channel, or elsewhere, leaving the Australian coast unprotected. But, independently of such motives, we have to make up Our minds that, unless we can change the law of nations, we cannot have the control of the Australian Fleet in the hands of the Commonwealth. That being so, there is removed any possible motive for the creation of a sea-going navy; and I feel sure that honourable members agree that the British Fleet ought to be helped in every Mr Fairbairn. way possible. In the agreement with the Admiralty, under which Ave pay the moderate sum of ,£200,000 a year, we have a very good bargain. Far more than ,£200,000 is spent annually in our toAvns by the vessels of the British Navy, and there is also the indirect advantage that we ha\'e some 500 Australians trained in the finest naval school in the Avorld. It AA'ould, therefore, be most ill advised to in any Avay alter the present Naval Agreement, or withhold the paltry sum of ,£200,000, for which Ave receive such a splendid return. bargain in the world ! gain that e\'er was made. I now turn to the land forces, Avhich are exclusively dealt with in the Bill. For myself, I favour a certain amount of compulsory training if it can be brought about. There are many arguments in favour of such a policy;' but we have, of course, to consider, first, Avhether the present management is right, and whether the finances of the country can bear the strain. The management of the great Department of Defence is principally in the hands of the Minister, although there is a Board of Advice, which has a certain amount of power. power as a final resort, and takes the responsibility. been in public life, I have preached that there must be a permanent official or Board to do departmental Avork from year to year.

However, if elective Ministries would cure the evil I have indicated, they would certainly find in me a supporter. If this enormous enterprise of the defence of the country is to be intrusted, as at present, to a fluctuating responsible head, then, the less we do the better for the country. The Bill ought to have contained a clause clearly defining the responsibility, and not have left so much to the Minister. Just imagine for a moment what would happen to any business which had had nine different managers in seven years; and it must be remembered that defence is a most intricate and complicated business. one time, it was the fashion to choose the most ornamental and least useful Minister as Minister of Defence; but that time has gone by, and we now have a useful Minister in regard to whose capacity for ornamentation honourable members may form their own opinion. I had hoped that when this measure was laid before us, the Minister, as a man of business, would see that the great defect I have referred to in the organization was remedied. I have heard that the best Minister of Defence that Great Britain ever had was the Right Honourable W. H . Smith, of bookstall fame, who had been trained in business and brought an admirable business capacity to bear on his administrative work. I had hoped that some such choice might have been made possible by means of the B ill . a principle. that; because the defect I have mentioned forms one of my main objections to^fhe measure.

When the railways of Victoria were under Ministerial control, a d r if t set in until they began to lose £ 1 , 0 0 0 per day.

To my mind, a Board of three is the best managing body that one could have over any large Department or business concern. We should have a permanent Board of three men of ability and from such a system of management we should be likely to obtain the best possible results. I desire to look for a moment at the financial aspects of this measure. There are two financial considerations-the direct cost resulting from the passing of the B ill itself and the indirect cost to those who will be called upon under it to give up their employ for three weeks every year in order to go into camp. Dealing first of all with the indirect loss, I do not think that it would be very material. The indirect advantage that would be gained from the discipline imposed-the improvement in the character and morale of the young men-woul d largely compensate for I think the whole it.

I am sure that this Parliament would not be prepared to inflict upon those young men the hardship of serving three weeks every year without any remuneration. In these circumstances the direct cost of the Bill must become a heavy tax. 1 think that the Minister said that the'new system would cost ,£200,000 in excess of the expenditure on that now in operation.

We may need to appoint a Military Wages Board to settle the question. the Labour Party have been questioning me on this point, may I remind them of the suggestion made, I think, at the Brisbane Labour Conference that the cost of this Bill should be provided by a property tax. Was a more absurd suggestion ever made? Are honourable members going to compare the value of life with that of. property? Have we not been told from time to time in connection with agitations for broadening the franchise for the Legislative Council that property counts for nothing, and that life is all in all?

Another point that has been discussed during this debate is what will be the position of the present forces under this measure. If this scheme breaks down we shall be in nothing less than a state of chaos, unless the present force is -retained. We should find in such a contingency that we had got rid of the old love and were without the new. I hope that the Minister will see that, under this scheme, if it comes to anything-and I have my doubts about its doing so-the present forces are maintained until the new system has been put into something nke working order. We have in Australia some splendid troops, and it would be a matter for regret if they disappeared before we had in readiness the defence machinery to take the place of that now in existence. I have-said We may have to nothing about the cadet movement, because I take it for granted that we are all agreed that it must be encouraged to the utmost capacity of the nation.

Our relationship is of a much more practical nature, and those motives hardly operate at all. It is really a matter of conserving trade. The man in the street in Great Britain knows little, and perhaps cares less, about the defence of Australia. The people concerned are the captains of commerce, the financial magnates of the world whose home is London, whose interests are at stake, whose ships girdle the globe, and whose cargoes are risked on every sea. Those are the concerns that are operating practically and almost entirely in the matter of defending Britain's oversea possessions. Simple sentiment, which is very fine and large in its way, and of which I am just as capable in its proper place as is any other man, is not a factor in the equation when it comes to a matter of defence. shillings, and pence with the people who practically constitute the British Empire to-day. It is the concern of the financial magnates and those who have large vested interests all round the world to protect the commerce of the Empire. They are more concerned about commerce than about protecting us. Mere sentiment may be indulged in at mothers' meetings, but this is no place for it . We have to deal with matters of fact, and one of the facts, as I see them, is that those who practically control the movements of the British Empire, and are principally concerned in its defence, are interested, not so much because of love of us, as because of love 06 money. That is the main issue with them. We are, of course, under a mutual obligation. gation in any way, but I do repudiate the assumption that all the obligation is on our side. To those people who are mainly concerned in the protection of Australia and its commerce, the matter is one of interest rather than of mere sentiment. Sentiment goes down before business interest every time. that took our young men to South Africa? them was that they could not get a decent living here, and they took the first opportunity of going to a new country with new prospects before them, although, of course, many were influenced by the desire to share in the fight. poses to shed their blood ! ber is very apt at mouthing pretty platitudes when he wants to hide bald facts, but we are here to deal, not with platitudes, but with facts as they are. The right honourable member has asserted that the British taxpayer has to foot the bill for the navy, but that individual does it more or less unconsciously. He does not realize all that he is doing. The rank and file of the wage-earners who are helping to foot that bill are placing the moneyed classes of Great Britain under a greater obligation to them than they are placing us, because it is mainly the interests of those moneyed classes that are being conserved. If the trade of the Empire that we hear so much about were run in the interests of Great Britain as a whole, there would be greater justifiI t is a matter of pounds, cation for the general imposition of taxation to sustain it. If the huge profits rolling in to Britain were shared by each section of the community, the wage-earners of Britain would be in a much better position than they are in to-day. If the burden of taxation to maintain the defence of that trade were borne by each section of the community in proportion as that section participates in the profits, the wage-earner would have very little to pay towards Great Britain's huge outlay on its trade protection and its pauper population. I realize that we are vitally interested in the upkeep of the navy. I admit that the obligation to see that the navy is paramount is mutual. But, after all, our pari of it does not begin and end with the contribution of ,£200,000 a year towards the support of the navy. I 'do not repudiate our obliI t is because I desire to do more, because I more f u l ly realize our responsibility than do honourable members who are merely opposing the Bill for the sake of opposition, that I take my present stand with regard to Australian defence.

It is the first line of defence, as we all admit; but the integrity of this Commonwealth is just as essential a factor in the protection and maintenance of British trade and British interests, as is the upkeep of the navy, so far as this section of the Empire is concerned.

It is assumed that we cannot afford a navy at the present juncture; but I am not altogether satisfied that we cannot afford something in the nature of a navy. Admitting, for the sake of argument, that we cannot, we can still afford a Citizen Defence Force. An effort on our part to qualify ourselves as soldiers will cost us nothing in comparison with the building and maintenance of ships. And so, seeing that it is our duty to do something, let us do what we can most easily accomplish at the outset--foun d a Citizen Defence Force, which I hope will be the beginning of a complete system of defence. The British Navy is at present fully efficient ; but let us assume that its efficiency is more truly loyal to the Empire. Those by force of circumstances impaired in anyway. , Should we not then be in a much better position, if our people are trained as soldiers, than if all our support had gone when the efficiency of the navy went? Should we not be in a much better position than if we were dependent entirely upon the outcome of that contribution of £[200,000 a year ? There is no guarantee that the line will never be broken. The pressure on the Government at Home has been so great as to force it to retrench in its defence expenditure, and there is not the invulnerability about the navy that some honourable members would have us believe. cards that the first line of defence may some day be broken. Where, then, should we be if our men could not shoulder a rifle? If we cannot have a navy here, surely we are justified in establishing a well equipped Citizen Defence Force. I do not at all under-estimate the value of a navy. Personally, I should be prepared to support the raising of as much as ,£10,000,000 to found one, so long as the sinking fund to liquidate the debt could be provided in a way that appealed to me as just and right, and provided also that we could arrive at some satisfactory arrangement with the British Admiralty as to the control of the ships. It is quite possible to make some amicable andsatisfactory arrangement for the conMr Carr. trof of an entirely Australian Navy, because the Admiralty, so far as I can judge, has shown itself more than gracious in its treatment of these proposals. An utter dependency upon the British Navy is not to be tolerated by a self-respecting community nor is it justifiable on the part of a country with such limitless natural resources as we have. It is undignified and unbecoming, and the attitude of honourable members who preach it is on all fours with that adopted by the ancient Romans who were satisfied to hire aliens to fight for them, with what disastrous results the pages of history show. The moral standard of those who advocate that position for Australia is comparable with that of the mediaeval Christian who was prepared to buy indulgences in order to avoid the honourable obligations of life. As an Australian, I resent that attitude. I feel that in being truly loyal to Australia, by doing what it is within our power to do -to cultivate a citizen soldieryI shall be who have such faith in the navy should be reminded that faith without works is dead. When an attempt is made to secure greater immunity from works by money payments, the position is still more deplorable. I believe in the principle of this citizen defence proposal-. There are some provisions in the Bill which must be altered, but I believe that it can be licked into shape. The principle itself is beyond all question. In the first place, because it is much more within our means to establish this form of defence than to establish a navy. We are told that we cannot immediately afford a navy, but, even if we It is, therefore, quite on the could, there is, at any rate, not sufficient support for us to attempt it. As we must do something, it behoves us to do the thing nearest at hand. In the second place, this proposal will secure for the Commonwealth a system of physical culture that would be otherwise utterly impossible. It . will bring the youth of the Commonwealth under medical review at the most opportune period of their lives, with great benefit to the community. It will, I believe, engender a knowledge bf the general laws of health, and assist in building up a people who will indeed' te strong and self-reliant. It will give a knowledge of nature's laws, sufficient toteach avoidance of the pitfalls of youth; and that, in itself, is a feature of the Bill,, quite apart from the question of defence,, which should recommend it to every one, if only because it means selfprotection by better regulated lives. Theni t seems to me that the military can do just as good service for the Empire as any navy we might be able to found. One would think, to hear some honourable members, that all the wars of the past have been on the sea, while, as a matter of fact, it is many years since Great Britain had a naval conflict. British battles of late have been on land; and if ever the Old Country wants assistance it would most likely be in the shape of land forces. ing ourselves beyond reach of rendering rather the reverse, because we shall be able, if desired, . to furnish soldiers of better quality. It will be seen, therefore, that the contention that we are trying to dissociate ourselves from the Empire, falls to the ground, because we are really placing ourselves in a better position to assist, than we are in by paying the paltry sum of ,£200,000, or, according to the suggestion of the honourable member for Lang, increasing that to the magnificent sum of £[500,000 a year. The system of universal training appeals to me as preferable to any sectional system of defence, because the latter has a tendency to foster a caste socially, and a faction politically, which would not conduce to the general harmony of the Commonweailth. We know what a standing army means; and I contend -that an army apart from the people-a n army fit and really spoiling for a fight-is a constant menace to the community, whose influence and weight are more liable to subversion, than could possibly be the case if the whole community constituted the army. The broader basis, the wider control, and the larger interest in defence which universal training gives, are in themselves added securities for peace. We have then a further precaution against any declaration of war, because every man knows that he will have to fight. Under universal training there can be no caste, with possible prejudice against the civilian; and there will not be the power on the part of any Government or individual to ""let slip the dogs of war,"" because, it may be, certain interests are in ' jeopardy. That is a result to be desired; and it can only be attained by a universal system of defence. In addition, it seems to me, that when ail are equally responsible for the laws we make-whe n we chose to establish a White Australia, or lay down certain laws regarding shipping entering our ports-it is incumbent on all to defend those laws. It Is only a natural corollary that, when we take a stand which may appear antagonistic to other nations, every man should be responsible for defending that stand; he should know that, when he makes a law which may be regarded as a sort of threat, he has to maintain that law. In this, as I sa.y, we have a sate and wise check. men of eighteen, who have no vote? We are not, therefore, placable memher be prepared to shoulder arms and go for a few weeks into camp? The assistance to Great Britain, but right honourable member knows what chance there would be of passing a Bill which would make such a thing possible; and he also knows that we must adopt expedients in order to get legislation through. The Opposition have raised a bogy in regard to the question of finance. They declare that we ought to "" know where we are "" before we enter upon this scheme of defence; but it would be too late to "" know where we are"" when we had possibly to pay an indemnity. I have not become subject to a scare, and I do not say that an invasion is imminent; but we do not know what may happen, and when things are quiet is the time to take the necessary steps for our defence. The safety of the Commonwealth is at stake; and the paltry excuse that we have not the necessary money, or cannot get it, should not be introduced; there is no room for such an excuse, because these steps must be taken sooner or later. It is obligatory on every nation to defend itself ; and we know the burdens that are .borne in this respect by England, Germany, and other countries. Of course, no man will approve such a state of things per se, but it is one that is inevitable. And the bogy of expense that has been, raised does not reflect the patriotic sincerity of the House. It is a question of whether we shall hire our fighting men, or learn to fight for ourselves; and there is noquestion as to which is the nobler course. As to the amendment of the honourable member for Flinders, I admit the fact that land defence is subsidiary to naval defence. But even if the naval defence is as. good and impervious as we are led to believe, does it not behove us to supplement it by a subsidiary land force? member will admit that we cannot settle our subsidiary defence properly until we have settled our main defence.",52,Defence Second Reading

296,Mr Joseph Cook,"The honorableParramatta has been very loud in his praise of the navy and its invulnerability; and, if the navy is so perfect, we may regard our first line of defence as attended to, and turn our minds to the second line of defence. The idea of adding to an already efficient machine is simply ridiculous; and we ought to devote our attention, if the honourable member be right, to subsidiary lines of defence. The attitude of the honourable member for Parramatta is beyond my comprehension. Seeing that Great Britain has attended to the first line of defence, an Australian navy may be left for the present, in the belief that in the future a more satisfactory arrangement will be come to in this regard. We have been told by the right honourable member for Swan that we are, as it were, in the ' position of a son in his father's house that we are utterly dependent on the British Navy, and that all we have to do is to further finance that navy. That is a view which, I think, is lamentably circumscribed. The right honourable member for Swan regards Great Britain in a paternal light, while the right honourable member for East Sydney regards the Old Country in a maternal light-sh e is the mother of the one, and the father of the other. I can understand the right honourable member for Swan, with his childlike and bland manner, desiring to hold his father's hand all the days of his life; but we here have reached maturity, and it is our duty to do something for ourselves. ber steal the £[200,000 from the "" old man "" after promising to give it to him? much better use. At present it is a mere bagatelle, compared with the millions spent by Great Britain, and it is practically wasted. Let us spend a million or two if we like on the second line of defence, which would be just as useful as anything Ave could furnish in the shape of a navy. I cannot, for the life of me, see hoAV the right honourable member for East Sydney can advocate our putting all our eggs in one basket; because, if the first line of our defence Avere ever broken, Ave should fall an easy prey to any marauder on the high seas. refer to only one or tAvo points of the Bill.

There is no legitimate ' comparison betAveen the proposed uniA'ersal training, and compelling a man to do something which cannot be defended on broad patriotic grounds.

There are other laAvs Avhich are unnecessary so far as such men as the honourable member for Parramatta is concerned, but he has assisted in making them compulsory, because it is essential that they should be. It has been contended that the cadet service should also be compulsory. It seems to me that under the automatic operation of this measure, it will be so. It provides that if a certain service is not rendered by lads as cadets, they must devote a longer period to training Avhen they reach a more mature age. That in itself, I think, will be sufficient to secure an effective service on the part of all Avho are fit to render it.
