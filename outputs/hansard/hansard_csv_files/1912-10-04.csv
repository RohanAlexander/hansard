Speaker, if you have any power to direct the attention of the authorities of this State to the great inconvenience to which members are put by the dark smoke which drifts into the building when the wind is blowing from a certain quarter? ferred to has existed for some time, and had been complained of before I became Speaker. I have on' two 'occasions written to the City Council about it. About eighteen months ago I received a reply to the effect that the matter had been referred to the Public Health Department, which had obtained a promise from Messrs. Angliss, whose chimneys are responsible, I believe, for the smoke, that the grievance would be remedied at an early date. However, nothing has been done, and I have "" written a second letter to the Council, to which I have not yet got a reply. The smoke is blistering and destroying the front of the building, and I intend to consult with the President, so that a representation may be -made to the State Government on the subject. Made in Sweden. MUNICIPAL RATES: GRANTS TO Prime Minister whether, he is considering, or will consider, the subsidizing of municipalities to the extent to which Commonwealth properties are free from rates? It has been the practice of some of the States to make specific grants to cover municipal I do not think rating. Attention has been drawn to the matter several times by the honourable member for Wentworth, who has moved a motion affirming the desirability of doing something of the kind. this Government to contribute to the municipal rates on account of Commonwealth public buildings or property. take into favorable consideration the reimThe fact is, howevei, bursement of municipalities where the Commonwealth, by its. operations, has been , the chief instrument in cutting up roads and rendering them almost impassable?

Whether the people who have great Commonwealth buildings placed in their midst may be regarded as unfortunate is not for me to say.. regarding a matter of groat importance to the community.

18,Mr West,"I wish to ask a questionWill the Minister endeavour to prevent persons suffering from consumption from coming here? There are persons ber may not make a statement; he may only ask a question. -the Government will take steps to prevent the idea becoming prevalent in Great Britain that Australia is a home for consumptives. for Maribyrnong asked me a similar question yesterday. It is a fact that persons suffering from tuberculosis have recently -come to Australia, and negotiations are now .proceeding between this Government and -the Governments of the States with a view -to providing for the examination of intendthe question. ing immigrants in Great Britain, so that persons infected with consumption and -other diseases may be prevented from setting out for this country. When such persons have got here, it is often dimcult to send them back, though many have been sent ""back. persons suffering from tuberculosis are not allowed to enter America, and that the steam-ship companies trading between Great Britain and the United States will not permit such persons to go aboard their vessels ? I understand that the United States Government maintains health officers at various the honourable member and come to the bar ports of departure in Great Britain and Europe, by whom emigrants intending to go 4o America are examined. This Government is alive to the need of preventing any -but the healthiest persons from coming to Australia. Much as we sympathize with the unfortunates who are diseased, we cannot afford to have them in our midst. It is possible that within the next few months an arrangement will be made for the examination in Great Britain of all intending to emigrate to Australia. 'had charge of shipments of immigrants, but I was not permitted to examine them, ex-cept with a view to seeing that they had been vaccinated, and I know that diseased persons who should not have been admitted to this country were able to come here. I ask the Minister, therefore, what power the Agents-General of the States have to cause the examination by medical officers of intending emigrants? time to time the Department of External Affairs is informed that persons suffering from the loss of a leg or an arm, or otherwise disabled, and likely to be a burden on the State, are coming to Australia, and the Minister is asked whether he will give permission for them to enter the Commonwealth. I do not know what powers the Agents-General have in regard to the acceptance or refusal of immigrants. The final authority is that of the medical officers at ""this end; and when afflicted persons have been refused admission an agitation is immediately got up on their behalf. I know that many such persons have been sent backj but the Minister of External Affairs will be able to give all the desired information next week if notice is given of that many of the residents in the Federal Territory have no Parliamentary representation, would the Government offer any objection to a delegation being heard at the bar of the House in explanation of the grievances under which they labour ? Federal Territory are not without representation so long as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is in this House. My suggestion is that if the people abandon of the House, they will lose by that course. Seriously, I do not think that the appearance of private people at the bar of Parliament ought to be encouraged. stances are peculiar. should be made only on the rarest and most momentous occasions, and I do not think the case referred to by the honourable member affords an instance of the kind. The Government have stated that they will provide, in the next Parliament I hope, for the representation of residents of the Federal Territory; and, in the meantime, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who has been, and is still for all practical purposes, their representative, may be intrusted with their case in Parliament. ter aware that there is a great and growing discontent in regard to the class of",15,Diseased Immigrants

One of the weaknesses of the present system is that, while the Commonwealth may regulate, encourage, or discourage immigration, there is no power"" to demand from the States where immigrants shall go, or how they shall be employed. I have no doubt that the information asked for can be supplied. ' The weakness in the situation arises from the fact that, perhaps, artisans of a particular kind, when they arrive here, cannot obtain employment, and that people, who expect to be settled on the land, find places in the cities instead. It is a matter for inquiry; but it should be a quiet informative inquiry if it is to be of use, not only in the present, but in the future.

On the face of it, of course, there is power conferred in subsection xxvi. of section 51 of the Constitution to deal with coloured aliens, but to what extent that power goes I should hesitate to attempt to precisely determine further. ferred for some purpose, and there is reason to believe that the prohibition against discrimination which extends generally in regard to Commonwealth legislation, is affected by sub-section xxvi. so far as the people of other races are concerned. Whether that sub-section permits us to make laws in regard to industrial matters or to segregate the aliens so far as their occupations are concerned I do not know. This is certainly a new aspect of the question which I shall look into carefully. As to the latter part of the question, it would be premature to say anything until we see exactly what power we have. In regard to the powers we have been acting under, it has not been considered that the action suggested by the honourable member could be taken; but, as I say, I shall look into the matter. General at the same time ascertain whether any action can be taken in regard to, say, the Chinese furniture makers in Melbourne ? whatever powers we may have in regard to people of other races, I take it that they would not include discrimination between one person and another of the same race. That seems to me to be opposed to the principles of justice and of fair play. The Constitution provides that the law should be applied to all alike, without respect to locality, status, or anything else. have said, possibly an exception is created by sub-section xxvi. of section 51, but only so far as the people of other races as compared with those of our own are concerned. As to its effect upon Chinese, I would point out that the law, after all, is based on common sense, or what was common sense at the time it was made; otherwise the law is a great reflection on us. Taking into consideration the spirit of the Constitution, sub-section xxvi., in my view, does not permit of the differential treatment of Chinamen in Melbourne and Chinamen anywhere else. from the Minister of Home Affairs when the papers in connection with the use of karri sleepers will be placed on the table as promised? the impression that all the papers had been laid on the table, but I shall make inquiries.

There are occasions, however, when a Minister lays a paper on the table, and there is no motion made at the moment that it be printed. Again, a Minister may send a paper into a Department, the officers of which know that permission to print it is going to be asked for, though three or four days may elapse before that is done. The fact is that these reports are already in print; and I take it that the resolution in the report does not mean that the officers shall not be allowed to afford honourable members the opportunity to peruse a document before it has actually been moved that it be printed.

If that interpretation can be read into it, it Chamber is an impracticable suggestion, and would place the Executive Government of the Commonwealth in a ridiculous position. I ask the mover to allow the elimination of that part of the report for further consideration, or to consent to the report being referred back to the Committee. It would be unwise to attempt to tie up the Government in this matter, and, even if it were done, no Government worthy of their office would comply with the resolution. They would simply continue to get papers printed as required. I might instance the Budgetpapers as a case in point. [11.2] -Generally speaking, a strict interpretation of the terms of the resolution would lead to great delay in the circulation of printed papers to members, and there is a great deal too much delay in that regard already. I should like to see their production hastened considerably. Sometimes we do not get them for weeks after they have been laid on the table, when all the interest has evaporated, and a great deal of their usefulness has gone. something to do with it. there was an alteration. it worse. greater delay.

In one Chamber a procedure had arisen by whicli the Clerk used simply to hand certain papers on to be printed, and they were printed without reference to that House, the Printing Committee, or Ministers. That procedure was not adopted in both Houses. The Printing Committeethought it advisable that there should be some body responsible for determining whether the papers should be printed or not. The question of the Budget papers came before the Committee, and it was never intended that the resolution should apply to them.

Eranklin spoke of officers getting reports printed.

The Prime Minister's fear that the resolution, as -worded, will interfere with the right of the Executive to print its own papers is unfounded. The Committee, I take it, had -no desire to bring about any such result.

In this Bill, ""passenger"" is defined as meaningAny person other than the master and crew, or the owner, his family or servants, carried on board a ship with the knowledge or consent of the owner, agent, or master thereof. The definition in the New South Wales Act is similar, but it has been decided that a person carried gratuitously on ship-board is not a passenger within the meaning of that Act.

Under this clause provision is made for making regulations in regard to ""cargo to be carried and the method of stowing cargo."" That is one of the most important points to be considered in connection with the regulations, and I hope that the Minister, in framing them, will see that a responsible officer-preferabl y the chief officer-shal l be responsible for the stowage of cargo. A responsible officer should be appointed. He should know where every package is stowed, and the proper place in which to stow cargo of various kinds, so that in the event of an accident, due, possibly, to lack of stability on the part of the ship, there may be available a record as to the stowage of cargo, enabling a diagram to be prepared, which would show at a glance whether it was properly or improperly stowed. In that way it would be possible to sheet home to some individual, who should be in charge, the responsibility for any loss of life or property incurredUnder present conditions ho one is responsible. Persons travelling by sea have to trust their lives to more or less incompetent men in charge of the stowage of cargo-shoreme n without any knowledge of ship construction, the stability of ships, or where cargo should properly be placed. On British ships the chief officer is responsible for this work. He is supposed to know where every package is stowed, and the examination which he has to undergo includes bests as to his knowledge regarding the proper disposition of cargo. I think, therefore, that in this clause provision should be made for the framing of regulations covering one or two more points. I am prepared to move the addition of two new paragraphs providing for the making of regulations in regard to(I) Stability. (m) Determining maxima and minima of metacentric height for different seasons and different types of ships. ings would come under the regulations to be framed under this part of the Bill Mr VV. ELLIOT JOHNSON -The safety of passengers is dependent upon, amongst other things, the proper stowage of cargo. The whole stability of a ship is really dependent upon both of the matters to which I have referred. If the framing of such regulations would not come within this part of the BillI would suggest that it might be advisable to introduce a new part. I shall be very happy to hand to the Minister a suggestion framed by a well-known navigator who proposes the insertion of the following new divisionDivision 5A-Stability Record1. Every ship shall have the following data, mounted and framed, displayed in a conspicuous and always accessible position :(a) The position of G, the centre of gravity of the ship when light. (0) A table of heights of the transverse metacentre at every foot of draught between "" l i g h t "" and ""loaded.""

ELLIOT JOHNSON I hope that the Minister will avail himself of the first opportunity to inspect the apparatus. It should be a part of the compulsory equipment of passenger vessels and large cargo ships. By means of this apparatus the stability of a ship can be ascertained at any moment. It is a most ingenious contrivance. There is attached to it a carefully compiled scale and a series of weights representing tons, hundreds of tons, thousands of tons of cargo, as the case may be. It shows at once the effect of the displacement of cargo on any part of a ship upon the ship's draft and stability. It is called Ralston's patent stability indicator. latest Inter-State steamer, the Warilda, is equipped with it. should like the Minister to examine the apparatus, with a view to deciding whether it would not be desirable to compel vessels to carry some such instrument, and to keep a record in the chart room which would show at all times the condition of the vessel in respect of her cargo, and enable her officers to know exactly how to load her. The adoption of some such apparatus would decrease the risk of capsizing.

The time has arrived when the shipping companies should be compelled to insure the lives of their employees. tributed over the cargo would be very small; but it would be a great boon to those depending on sailors to have this provision made for them.

We ought to know what is the intention of the Minister as to the definition of the word "" port."" ney-General) [12.19] -The effect of the amendment proposed by the Government upon the coasting trade and the clauses dealing with it may be briefly explained. In the first place, it is provided that Part VI . shall apply to all ships, whether British or foreign, and that it shall come into operation on a day to be fixed by proclamation. Then, in proposed new clause IA, which gives the scope -of the Bill as a. whole, and must, of course, include Part VI . , it is provided thatIA -(1. ) This Act shall not apply in relation to auy Australian-trade ship, limited coast-trade ship, or river and bay ship, or her master or crew, unless the ship(a) is engaged in trade or commerce with other countries or among the States; or (4) is on the high seas, or in waters which are used h)' ships engaged in trade or commerce with other countries or among the States; or (c) is in the territorial waters of any territory which is part of the Commonwealth. Paragraph 2 of the proposed new clause is. as it were, an expression of our recognition that the Constitution, plus any Imperial statutes, limits pur powers. Applying that clause to the proposal in front of us. we find th.it this part nf the Bill is to apply to British ships and foreign ships, to Australian-trade ships and coasting-trade ships when and as long as they are engaged in trade or commerce with other countries or among the States; or are on the high seas, or are in waters which are used by ships engaged in trade or commerce with other countries, or among the States, or are in the territorial waters of any territory which is part of the Commonwealth. The honourable member has brought forward a matter which in its relation to the particular vessels that he has in mind is not very important; but since, in its application generally, it is important, the Committee may be invited at once to address itself to it. He desires to know whether this clause will apply to vessels plying exclusively within inland waters, and I shall' dispose of this point because the honourable member has asked for information in regard to it. Whether it is advisable that it should or should not apply to such vessels is another matter; but I think that, in regard to the rule of the road, the carrying of lights, and such like matters as must arise, and are likely to interfere with navigation as a whole, and tlie safety of shipping generally, our power must be asserted, and this Bill asserts it. To what extent it ought to and will exercise that power must depend on particular circumstances. I know what the honourable member has in mind, and to the general question of whether as a. fact generally the provisions will apply to such boats as he has in his mind, which, I gather, are what are termed river and bay boats, I would answer, subject to what I have stated before, "" No."" I come now to the far more important point raised by the honourable member for Angas in regard to the question of treaties. The position of the Commonwealth in regard to treaties was for some time, and still is, very complicated. We are bound, of course, by any treaties into which Great Britain has entered, and which were assented to by the States, or any of them. We are bound, of course, by treaties which any one of the State's assented to. Ifc is by no means easy to discover what those treaties are; but so far as we have been able to ascertain, the countries with which we had treaties were Austria, Egypt, Greece, Honduras. Mexico, Muscat, Paraguay, Roumania, and Salvador. Between 1905 and 1911 we gave notice of withdrawal'from the treaties with all these countries save Salvador, which seems to have been overlooked.

I that has found generalAustralian shipping is effectively recognised, while the rights* of other nations to equal treatment under our maritime laws is not overlooked, in the clauses as we propose to amend them. An amendment which the Minister is to move is the omission of the word "" foreign "" from clause 287, so that the -clause may readNo ship shall engage in the coastal trade unvernment, and this party. less she is licensed so to do. As the clause stands it would exclude Austrian and Salvador shipping whose rights are safeguarded by treaty, but, as amended, it treats all shipping alike, whether registered in Australia, Great Britain, or in any other country. No shipping will be permitted to engage in the Australian coastal trade without a licence issued subject to the provisions of this measure. form of the licence will be determined by regulation. the difficulties created by treaty rights and international obligations. The principle underlying international law that all nations have equal rights, subject to each other's municipal laws and territorial powers, is fully recognised. Subject to the provisions of clause 286, any vessel which picks up passengers or cargo at any port in the Commonwealth for conveyance to any other port in the Commonwealth will be deemed to be engaged in the coasting trade, and must obtain a licence. In order to obtain a licence, there must be paid on board these vessels the rates of wages in force on board Australian ships, either as the result of agreements between employers and employees obtaining general acceptance, or as the awards of competent Courts or other tribunals having jurisdiction, and there must be compliance with other conditions similarly arrived at. This is a perfectly fair provision. All vessels will be treated alike, our own ships are protected against unfair competition, and everything is done to meet the convenience of persons living in outlying parts of the Commonwealth who ""have infrequent communication, and whose facilities for transport ought not to be diminished. The protective policy to which ton in drafting the first Bill, has been recognised by each succeeding Government. It has gone through the fiery furnace of -criticism and discussion and emerged unscathed. It was before the Royal Commission of Navigation, it was discussed at the Merchant Shiping Conference, and no exception was taken to it, provided that British ships ought not to be asked to do any. more than other ships, to which we agreed. However"" much we may desire to leave the shipping industry unhampered, and free to all, we cannot escape the position created by the policy of this Parliament, this GoWe have imposed conditions on Australian shipowners, compelling them to pay rates of wages substantially twice as large as the highest paid on the best class of vessels registered out of Australia, and five or six times as large as those paid on coloured labour ships trading to the Commonwealth, and from one part of the Commonwealth to another. As we compel our shipping to The pay these rates of wages, and to observe other conditions which are onerous, we This amendment gets rid of ought to protect them as we protect our manufacturers ashore from the competition of rivals which are not similarly handicapped. It may be urged that the issuing of licences will be a complicated and lengthy business. I do not think so. In any case it is not a serious objection. More licences are issued for the management of hotels and for other businesses than will have to be issued under the Bill. At present every ship has to get a clearance before leaving port, and be furnished with other papers, and the obtaining of a licence would be a mere formal matter, on com-pliance with the conditions laid down. This, then, is the policy of the Government in regard to this most important matter, and I venture to assert it is a sound, fair, and equitable one. So far as the Government is aware, there is no other way in which treaty rights and obligations can be respected, international complications avoided, and the shipping interests of Australia duly protected against unfair competition. glad that the Attorney-General has referred to the matter of treaty rights, because, although only a few countries had treaty rights preserved in the first Merchant Shipping Act of 1854, remonstrance might be made by other countries were they refused privileges granted to rivals.

As a matter of law, our power to regulate the coast trade of Australia is limited only by certain treaties, but as a matter of policy it may be limited by all treaties with countries affected by its exercise. The Attorney-General remarked that the scope of the old treaties may be extended to other countries by allowing the vessels of those countries to register under the laws of the countries with which the treaties were made, but I do not think that that would enable foreign shipping to get outside the provisions of our legislation. Those treaties must be read in the sense that only existing rights are preserved; and surely it would be a violation of the principles of international law and ethics if a country could extend an exemption to other countries simply by allowing them to register. chant Shipping Act of 1904 does is to preserve whatever treaty rights the ships then registered enjoyed. treaty, which would be quite independent of the Act. refer to international law is that I think the scope of that provision, as it relates to treaties, would be regarded as a saving section merely. ment would have the right of remonstrance against any country which abused the privilege preserved by that Act. by extending registration to other countries. A sensible interpretation is to be given; and that would exclude additions to the exemptions such as, by an abuse of treaty right,a nation might give. But apart from that, there are wider questions that have always affected me. The coasting trade presents, no doubt, a very difficult problem. We must maintain .a. standard of wages here; and if British vessels come and. take up a large portion of the trade that legitimately ought to belong to local vessels, we cannot have that standard of living we hope to develop. the Minister could give some information as to the extent of the competition in cargo and passengers, first by ocean-going British vessels, and, secondly, by foreign vessels. In 1903, when the question of the coasting trade arose in connection with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, Sir Malcolm McEacharn gave us some figures, which, I think, showed that there was practically no such competition in regard to cargo. took some evidence on that point, and it showed that, in regard to cargo, thecompetition was not great, but that in regard to passengers it was considerable. showed that there was practically no coastal cargo carried by tliose oversea vesselsthat, if I remember rightly, out of a total tonnage of some millions only about 25,000 tons were taken on board in a certain year between Fremantle and eastern ports. We may, therefore, I think, leave cargo out of account, though we ought to know to what extent there is competition for passengers. As pointed out by either the honourable member for Kooyong or myself, our localvessels have very large responsibilities. The vessels, under what is known as the What section 736 of the MerCommonwealth Steam-ship Owners' Association, number 133, with a gross tonnage of 287,000 tons. The wages, including overtime, paid amount to ,£562,000 a year, so that it will be seen we have a pretty large industry to consider. The outlay for stores, which indicates that there are important dependent industries, is ,£417,000. while for docking, repairing, and so forth, there is paid ,£353,000. These are all facts that we have to bear The Imperial Governin mind, and we ought to know the number of passengers that have been carried from.

The Inter-State ships are, I believe, very -fine, and, perhaps, some honourable members may be able to give us an idea of the -comparative rates charged to passengers. In making such a comparison one has to remember that the first class passengers on a local line may come into competition with -the second class passengers by the Peninsular and Oriental or Orient line. the mail steamers were double the local rates. in 1903 or 1904, but I would not risk mentioning the rates then, because, in matters of this kind, we ought to be quite up-todate. two that almost every person engaged on or about Australian vessels has been brought within the scope of an industrial agreement or award. men employed on the wharfs, and others, are all under some industrial determination which prescribes pretty good rates of wages, or under some award which incidentally affects the ship-owners. comparison, therefore, as to freight or fares, we have to bear in mind the necessity for raising them created by the increased obligations of the ship-owners. Then, from the point of view of Imperial -interests, I have always advocated that ocean-going British vessels ought not to be too much hampered so long as they do not substantially compete with local vessels. Sir Robert Griffin, President of the Board of Trade, who is a very strong Free Trader, and a great authority on all matters connected with Imperial trade, declared, either in giving evidence or in some memorandum, that, in his opinion, _ the coasting trade of the British dominions, and even the coasting trade of the United Kuigdom, where foreigners competed only to the extent of 9 or 10 per cent., ought to be preserved for British vessels. That is a statement by a competent authority who is not likely to give a prejudiced account. I do not think that the competition by foreigners is very much, but we cannot grant them privileges that we deny to British vessels. About ten years ago I know that the foreign competition was slight, being confined mainly to Norwegian vessels, for instance, which did a particular class of trade that was not carried on by our own vessels However, I do not proI am very largely impose to deal with that matter now. The British Government have not persisted in their opposition to the provisions in this part of the Act. They did raise objection in the beginning, but they finally acquiesced in the inevitable by simply not voting. A statement to that effect, I remember, was made in the House of Comintroducing more distinction. The Attorney-General has mentioned that by omitting from clause 287 the word "" foreign "" we are, practically, in some respects, treating all ships alike. I cannot see how that makes any difference, or how it helps us much, for instance, in connection with treaty obligations. Treaty obligations cannot be touched by the law, and in regard to licences, the importance is not in the It is only within the last year or statement that all vessels must be licensed, but in the extent to which we refuse licences to some vessels. Officers, engineers, the would not deny that we could prevent any private trading at all on the coast-that there could be a Government monopoly, for instance? member deny that we have the same rights in regard to water carriage as we have in regard to land carriage? say that we could even prevent private trading in the case of land carriage, but, as the Attorney-General himself has said to-day, one cannot give extempore opinions on every point. It may be that section 92 of the Constitution, which prpvides that, after the passing of uniform Customs and Excise, trade and commerce and intercourse among the States must be absolutely free, would preclude us from making such a limitation as suggested. instance, that all vessels on the coast should have green funnels? proper provision. have twin screws. venting private carriers is a. different matter.

144,Mr Archibald,"In this mattershould not materially influence us in dealing with this matter. We have to regard it from the stand-point of Australia and the protection of our shipping. The movement that has been growing up in Australia to increase the standard of efficiency and comfort in our maritime service cannot be maintained unless our ship-owners are protectedto a certain extent against their British competitors. One can well.understand the opposition of leading .ship-owners in the Old Country to this Bill. At a certain time of the year there is a great rush of passengers by the mail steamers for Great Britain, and the passenger lists are rapidly filled. It is then very difficult to secure a passage by one of the oversea mail steamers to Western Australia; but during the English winter the oversea mail steamers are quite prepared to pick up all the trade they can secure along our coast. During the busy season with the oversea steamers, the Australian mercantile marine deal with our Inter-State trade, but in the slack season the British mail steamers are willing to secure it if they can. If the British mail steamers had to observe Australian conditions and pay Australian wages, I do not think that the local shipowners would object very much to their competition. But since the Australian shipping companies have recognised our standard of living, they need to be protected. The effect of this competition on the part of the mail boats during the.slack season in the passenger traffic for Great Britain must be, eventually, to cause some of the best steamers trading between the east coast of Australia and Fremantle to be laid up. that kind so far occurred? be a tendency in that direction unless we are prepared to guarantee local shipping the protection which it has a right to expect. British shipping companies are not philanthropic institutions; they are run by shrewd business men, and if they can make a pound or two on the Australian coast they are not above earning it: We as a Parliament ought not to be scared by any cry as to the treaty rights of Great Britain. Sufficient unto the clay is the evil thereof. It is time for us to meet these suggested difficulties when they actually arise. As a matter of fact, they may never occur. No doubt, in accordance with the usual policy of the British Government, we shall bave a number of memoranda in regard to certain parts of this measure. We shall receive them through the Board of Trade, and they will be prepared by the legal advisers of the Board. But the British Government, when it finds itself in a difficult position, does not concern itself very much about legal opinions. An English Labour member .told me when I was at Home last year that when he approached the Prime Minister of Great Britain in regard to a certain matter , and received from him a promise that it would be attended to, he asked, "" But what about the House of Commons?"" "" O h , "" said the Prime Minister, "" do not trouble about Parliament; it exists only to talk, whereas the Government exists to work."" There can be no doubt of the truth of that remark. I think that the views to which the honourable member for Angas has given expression are entitled to careful consideration. We are all much indebted to him for the forcible way he has put before us his opinions concerning this question. I would remind the Committee, however, that we ought not to be scared by bogies.. When the British Government realize that a succession of Governments of the Commonwealth have determined that the policy embodied in this Bill shall be the policy of Australia, they will treat us as they have treated all their oversea dominions. They will probably say in the end, "" Very well, if you are strongly of this opinion, by all means have your opinion, and we shall make the best we can of the matter."" It will be necessary, however, for us to be firm, yet respectful. Nothing is to be gained by taking up an offensive attitude; but I think we may well assume a firm and dignified attitude in regard to this matter. If we do so, in the end all will be well. There may be differences of opinion amongst honourable members in regard to Free Trade ancl Protection, but these, after all, are now mere questions for academic discussion. I told some of my friends in the Old Country last year that if I were living in EnglandI should be a Free Trader, but as I lived in Australia. I was a Protectionist.

We have heard a great deal about the subsidies that are paid by the German Government to the German mail ships trading to Australia; but I was told on good authority only a week or two ago that they received no subsidy in the sense in which we understand the term. They are not subsidized as our mail steamers are. The German mails to Australia are paid for on the poundage rates as mere dead weight. I received this information from a gentleman who wrote to the directors of the company at Hamburg.

We have either to take up a firm attitude on this question, or to be prepared to allow our coasting trade to be flooded by the competition from other countries-to open our coasting trade indiscriminately to all nations. English brothers would secure the bulk of the trade. I do not think that the statement that British ships do a very large way in which, under this Bill, we could treat proportion' of the coasting trade of other foreign and British companies alike would countries is altogether correct. It is true, steamers-the bulk of them sailing from ports on the north-east coast of England, call at various ports on the American coast. They take cargo for two or three ports on the American coast, but they do not pick up any cargo there. Having discharged their consignments of British cargo at American ports, they secure a charter wherever they can, or return straight away to Great Britain. And so with British vessels calling at other foreign ports. The vessels of certain companies sailing out of the leading ports of England, drop cargo along the Australian coast, but no one would think of interfering with them, because, so long as they confine themselves to that particular branch of the trade, they cannot be said to be engaging in the coasting trade of Australia. But you cannot call that coasting trade. A ship is engaged in the coasting trade when she picks up passengers and cargo at ports along the coast, and conveys them to other ports on the coast. We must stand by these provisions if we intend to preserve the standard of comfort that we have prescribed for those engaged on Australian vessels. found difficulty in following the honourable member for Hindmarsh after listening to the Attorney-General. The latter thinks that there should be no differentiation in regard to foreign vessels, that all shipping must be put on the same basis, and that regard must be paid to the Imperial position of Great Britain, and the value to her of -the British carrying trade. We are told by the Attorney-General that any action of ours creating differential treatment and tending to excite foreign hostility would reMuch may have happened since act on the British carrying trade, and through the diminution of the British mercantile marine affect the British Navy; and would, therefore, be detrimental to Australian interests.

There has been an attempt to give this discussion the aspect of a fiscal controversy. mail steamers do not carry a ton of cargo from one Australian port to another. refuse to carry cargo from one Australian port to another. they decline this cargo because they cannot compete with the Australian lines, because you can send a ton of merchandise from London to Genoa for less than you are charged for sending the same weight from Sydney to Melbourne. steamer companies have deliberately declined coast cargc trade to avoid the appearance of competing with the Australian companies, and for the same reason they charge higher passenger rates than the Australian companies charge. How then can the question have a fiscal aspect? Is it suggested that the Australian coastal shipping is a languishing industry, that the competition of the mail steamers for passengers at higher rates affects it detrimentally? Is it not a fact that the Australian shipping ring is buying larger steamers, and giving a better service? advocate. tralian shipping ring-the Australian companies have an arrangement between themBut there are other selves-is doing well without the protection that is alleged to be necessary to it.

Passengers do not travel on the holders fair and reasonable profits; and they do this without any protection. If they are given protection, they will be asked to pay still higher rates of wages, and will ask consignees to pay still higher freights and passengers to pay still higher fares; so that the public will have to bear the burden.' It must be remembered, too, that many persons travel for the sake of their health, and most health travellers use the mail steamers. Are you going to prevent our citizens who are willing to pay higher fares for the privilege from travelling in the best steamers on our coast?

This is obviously not a fiscal question, but a labour question.

If we endeavour to impose limitations on the splendid boats sent here by English, German, French, and other companies, we shall do more harm than good. It is, in my opinion, going to a silly extreme to debar such eessels from taking on a few passengers. The friendly spirit, and a desire to see those splendid vessels in our waters; and I cannot conceive how Australian shipping companies or Australian sailors are in any way benefited by this petty game of "" dog in the manger."" orable members from the great city of Sydney, which has been built up largely on the fine shipping services which have plied there for so many years, should take such a short-sighted view. vices built up the trade of the north-west coast of Tasmania? do with the question? that we should do all we can to foster and help the Australian coastal trade; but we should not carry a principle to the extent of removing what has proved a great stimulus to our own shipping companies to keep up to date. being ordered for Australia, and I believe that one of 8,000 tons is shortly to be undertaken. nage came out the other day for the Australian trade. goes Home shows an increase in tonnage and all the latest improvements. The trade carried on by these foreign vessels between Western Australia and the eastern States consists of the carriage of a few passengers, who have to pay more for the coastal boats^ although the latter give a fair return on the capital invested. A little while ago Huddart, Parker, and Company put some shares on the market, and they were over applied for in a perfect rush by investors. Our coastal trade is on a very sound footing, and it should be maintained; but we should not make the silly mistake of depriving the foreign boats of the right of carrying passengers. For abled, by means of the mail boats, to leave the trying summer -climate of Sydney and enjoy the salubrious climate of Hobart and other parts of Tasmania. It would be all very well if the local shipping companies provided decent vessels for the Tasmanian trade, but they do not, as the honourable member for Denison knows. The foreign vessels carry our produce to the other side of the world, and add much to the prosperity of Tasmania; present arrangements show a and yet the honourable member would inflict a heavy tax on the producers in his own States. The apple-growers of Tasmania are certainly amongst the most deserving of workers. They have built up an industry under the greatest difficulty without any I am surprised that honState aid, and can now boast of fine, clean orchards; but they had to run the gauntlet of wharfingers, commission agents, and others who have come between them and the people who buy the fruit.

It is easy enough to be W h a t has that to dogmatic and arbitrary, but most difficult It is quite right to meet a problem fairly and squarely and evolve a working proposition.

193,Mr Atkinson,"Certainly not. IThe Australian coastal companies do not provide any decent service between Sydney and Hobart, and it would be a very short sighted and unpatriotic action to shut out other companies. If we cannot get over a little difficulty like this by passing an amendment similar to that foreshadowed by the right honourable member for Swan, we do not deservethe name of a National Parliament. I hope the Committee will act in an impartial spirit in this matter, because we are dealing with a non-party measure. If we approach the problem in that spirit, I am satisfied that we shall give satisfaction to all concerned, in the persons of sailors, ship-owners, and producers. If 1 thought that the passing of the clause would interfere one iota with the growing tourist traffic of Tasmania, I Bhould certainly vote against it ; but I am convinced that it will not interfere with the tourist traffic at all. Not a great number or men of any other nationality, so long as of people travel to Tasmania by the boats referred to. Those who do come by them arc generally the very wealthy, who want luxurious travelling, and there may be a section of others who desire to say that they have travelled on one of the mailboats. 1 believe that with the splendid mercantile fleet that has been built up by our Australian companies, they will be able to cater in the future, as they have done in thf past, for our growing Australian traffic. We hear honourable members on the other side continually proclaiming their patriotism; but as soon as a little £ s.d. is concerned, they say it does not matter where the ship comes from, by what crew she is manned, or what wages she pays, but that so long as she will carry passengers along our coast she ought to be allowed to do so in competition with our own ships. What will the constituents of the honourable member for Wilmot, on the North-West Coast, say when he tells them that he voted to allow ships to carry cargo and passengers on thc Australian coast, which, if they got the bulk of the trade, would crush out of existence those vessels which have helped to build up the NorthWest Const of Tasmania? I want to encourage the Australian ship-owners to give us the service we require. If they will not, we, as H party, are, I think, strong enough to insist on their doing so. I believe the day is not far distant when they will recognise the requirements of Tasmania, and improve the communication between it and the mainland. I hope they will keep a little in advance of the traffic, as other shipping companies in the Old World have done; but the amendment of the right honourable member for Swan would give the Peninsular and Oriental and other companies power to undercut our Australian-owned ships, and drive them out of the trade. Our ships cannot pay the wages upon which the waterside workers and sailors are insisting-and those are only fair and reasonable wages-and , at the same time, compete with outside vessels that pay low wages. We simply want to protect our Australian companies against unfair competition. I cannot understand why any body of men should object to enable our companies to get bigger and better ships built. I am proud to say that every one of our Australian vessels is manned by white crews. Unfortunately, many ships flying the English flag are manned by foreigners. Tbeir owners will take Chinese, they are cheap. It is a great disadvantage for any -country to man her mercantile marine with foreigners. When the German Emperor was asked, on one occasion, why Germany insisted on German boats being manned by Germans, he replied, "" They are being trained in our mercantile marine; some day they may be useful in another place."" It would be a good thing for Great Britain if she had a mercantile marine of British sailors available for drafting into the Navy when required. The Australian companies are now getting out boats of about 9,000 tons register, and this means that they will give the public better travelling facilities. After travelling between England and Ireland, and England ancl France, I can sav that there is not a boat in those services equal to the Loongana, the splendid vessel that travels between Melbourne and Launceston. If we can get a few more boats of that kind, surely it is worthwhile encouraging the companies to bring them along ? . To pass the amendment of the honourable member for Swan would mean that those boats would simply pass out of existence. The waterside workers' wages and the sailors' wages have been raised only recently. sent Government came into power.

'AH this measure does is simply to ask British and foreign vessels who want to carry passengers in our coasting trade to pay the same wages and comply with the same conditions as Australian ships do. Pressure is being brought to bear on me from Tasmania to vote against this part of the Bill. One municipality in my electorate passed unanimously a resolution instructing me to vote in a certain direction in favour of amending the Bill, and advised me accordingly; but, for reasons already mentioned, I cannot change my opinion. One member of the municipal council, to whom I spoke about the matter, said he was not present at the meeting when the resolution was carried, and he knew nothing about it. The money-owners, the' rank Tories, who know no patriotism and no country, are anxious to see the honourable member for Swan's amendment carried. If I thought that the clause would in any way restrict trade in Tasmania, 1 should be prepared to vote against it. In other words, if I believed that it would have the effect of preventing the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's steamers and other like vessels coming into competition fairly with our own shipping I should vote against it. I am confident, however, that it will not have that effect. It places each and every ship on the same footing, and that is all for which any true Australian could wish. Progressreported.
