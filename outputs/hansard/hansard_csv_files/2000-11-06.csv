256,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Goods and Services Tax: Finance and Administration Portfolio (Question No. 1774) Mr Hatton asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 14 August 2000: (1) Is the Minister’s Department and agencies within the Minister’s portfolio compliant in respect of the Goods and Services Tax. (2) What action did the Minister’s Department and agencies within the Minister’s portfolio take to ensure that they were GST ready by 1 July 2000. (3) Is the Minister able to guarantee that no agency within the Minister’s portfolio will suffer negative impacts on its budget or services due to the GST; if not, or if the guarantee was subsequently proved incorrect, would the Minister be prepared to resign. (1) In June 2000, the chief executives of all agencies within my portfolio were asked to provide me with written confirmation that they would be able to comply with The New Tax System from 1 July 2000. I received such assurances from each agency. (2) Each agency within my portfolio took the following action to ensure that it was GST ready by 1 July 2000: Initial scoping of all activities to develop a GST implementation plan. Formation of a project team to manage implementation. Examination of contracts to determine GST implications. Registration for the Australian Business Number and for GST. Review of record keeping requirements to ensure compliance with the GST. Changes to financial systems to record and account for the GST. Analysis of effects of the GST on cash flows. Staff training (both general awareness training and tailored training for staff whose roles were directly affected by changes to systems and/or processes). Suppliers were notified of relevant issues relating to the GST. Price changes, where required, were made in accordance with the agency pricing guidelines. Each agency within my portfolio participated in the comprehensive monitoring surveys, coordinated by my Department’s whole-of-Government GST Unit, to ensure implementation milestones were met. (3) The implementation and ongoing management of tax reform by agencies is the responsibility of their respective chief executive officers or boards of management (as applicable). While the Government will continue to monitor the impact of the implementation of The New Tax System, it does not expect that the reforms will reduce agency funding in real terms.

(2) Has the Government considered funding a buffer zone at Kilburn to assist in the noise problem; if so, what was the nature and cost of the proposal. (3) Will documents to potential purchasers relating to the proposed sale of National Rail refer to the environmental difficulties associated with the operation of the Islington Depot and the community campaign for a buffer zone, including its cost. (4) What environmental impact will any extension of the Islington freight terminal have on the surrounding community as a result of work arising from the development of the Alice Springs to Darwin line. (1) National Rail (NR) advises that independent contamination audits have been undertaken at the Adelaide Freight Terminal. Ongoing noise testing is being undertaken at the perimeter boundaries and terminal staff meet regularly with concerned locals. (2) No. (3) Bidders for NR will have made available to them all reasonable information necessary to make an informed bid for the company. A vendor due diligence process is currently underway, and this will incorporate a review of all material environmental issues at NR. Islington Depot will be reviewed as part of this process and if it is determined as a material issue, relevant information will be provided in the bidder due diligence phase of the process.

Waterfront: Stevedoring Efficiency (Question No. 1797) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 15 August 2000: (1) With regard to Patricks dispute with the Maritime Union of Australia, is he able to say whether the Prime Minister told the 1998 New South Wales Liberal State Conference that Australia’s export future was at stake. (2) What was the cost of a dry container on the (a) Melbourne-Singapore, (b) Melbourne-Hong Kong, (c) Melbourne-Bangkok and (d) Melbourne-Seoul runs (i) prior to the dispute and (ii) in October 1999. (3) What was the cost of dry container on the routes referred to in part (2) in August 2000. (4) Has the peak Australian shippers association said that despite the Government’s professed concerns at export costs that Australian exports had not had a cent in benefits from increased stevedoring efficiency. (5) In the period since January 1998 to July 2000, has Lang Corporation’s share price risen from $1.16 to $9.09. (6) During the period referred to in part (5), what benefits have accrued to Australian importers or exporters as the result of drops in the cost of stevedoring. (7) Did he meet Lord Sterling, Chairman of P&O, when he was in London for the Centenary of Federation celebrations; if so, did he raise with Lord Sterling the possibility of passing on some of the cost savings of waterfront reform to Australian importers and exporters; if no, why not.",127,Advertising
260,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Yes. The Prime Minister in a speech to the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party on 3 April 1998 stated: “It will be important that you continue to give us, and those involved in these events, your wholehearted support because Australia’s export income future is at stake. The potential jobs of thousands of Australians are involved and the economic reputation and the reliability of this country as seen by the rest of the world is very much involved.” (2) and (3) Actual freight rate levels in liner shipping are a commercial in confidence matter, and can vary between individual shipping lines and their clients, depending on factors such as the nature, value and volume of the cargo, and the regularity of shipments. However, information in the Productivity Commission’s report on International Liner Cargo Shipping (15 September 1999) indicated that the general trend in freight rates for Australian exports had been downward in the past decade. In a number of cases rates were reported to have fallen to levels that were commercially unsustainable in the long term. For example, information from the liner shipping industry indicates that between 1995 and 1999 export freight rates fell in real terms by about 10% in the European trade, by about 13% in the North American trade, by about 28% in the North Asia trade, and by about 50% in the South East Asia trade. These decreases in freight rates were largely due an oversupply of shipping. The larger falls in the Asian trades reflect the added factor of the Asian economic crisis. Since mid 1999 there has been a recovery in freight rates, but in general these are reported to be still below the 1995 levels in real terms. Stevedoring charges make up only a minor proportion of the freight rates paid by export shippers. On 27 August 1999 in response to a question from Senator O’Brien of the Senate’s Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee as to whether there has been an overall increase or decrease in stevedoring charges since the beginning of 1998, Patrick Stevedores CEO Mr Chris Corrigan stated: ‘The facts are that our stevedoring charges have declined’. (4) The Australian Peak Shippers Association (APSA) has on a number of occasions claimed that freight rates have not been reduced as a result of the Governments recent waterfront program. Shippers have received benefits from the Government waterfront reform program through the marked improvement in stevedoring performance within Australia’s key container ports. The June 2000 issue of the Bureau of Transport Economics publication Waterline reported that the five-port average crane rate reached a record 20.4 containers per hour for the March quarter 2000. This compared with 19.1 containers per hour for the December quarter 1999. The rates at which the stevedores work ships also reached new records due to better utilisation of quay cranes. The five-port net ship rate was 31.8 containers per hour for the March quarter 2000, well above the pre-Patrick dispute figure of 24.3 containers per hour. Berth availability also reached a new high point of 94 per cent, which is just short of the Government’s reliability benchmark of 97 per cent. (5) Yes. (6) Refer to answer in question (4) above. (7) Yes. I met Lord Sterling while in London earlier this year. Our discussion covered a range of issues relating to P&O Ports activities in Australia including the recent waterfront reform process. Roads: Funding (Question No. 1808) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 15 August 2000: (1) What is the current share of national road funding received by Victoria. (2) Has Victoria’s share changed over recent years; if so, by what sums has it changed.",128,Advertising
261,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s questions is as follows:(3) How long does the existing agreement for the division of national road funding last. (4) What is the process by which roads are declared Roads of National Importance. (5) On how many occasions during the period 1993-1999 did the Victorian Government seek to secure with the Federal Government an agreement over any Roads of National Importance. (6) What was the first occasion in which the Victorian Government requested the Federal Government to agree to declaring the Scoresby Freeway a Road of National Importance. (7) Has the Federal Government refused to fund the Scoresby Freeway project. (1) Victoria’s current National Highway and Roads of National Importance allocation totals $95.13m from a total national allocation of $816.84m. (2) Victoria’s funding share, as with all States and Territories, changes on an annual basis. For example, in 1998/99 Victoria’s share of National Highway and Roads of National Importance was $107.4m from a total national allocation of $874.5m. In 1999/2000 Victoria’s share was $84.7m from a total national allocation of $815.4m. Victoria’s allocations for the years 2001/02 and 2002/3 are forecasted to increase to $220.8m and $205.9m respectively, depending on the ability of the Victorian Government to bring proposals to the point where tenders can be called. (3) Road funding is based on competing priorities on a National basis and not on a predetermined States share agreement. Projects are assessed on their merits and focussed on those areas of the network where the largest net benefit can be achieved. (4) Roads of National Importance can be nominated by State Governments or by specific interest groups. The broad criteria when designating Roads of National Importance is that the project is not on the National Highway system and that it will return significant economic benefit to the nation. (5) The Roads of National Importance program started in 1996. The Victorian Government has sought funding for Roads of National Importance annually as part of their general road funding submission. (6) Since the early 1990s the Victorian Government has sought to secure funding for the Scoresby Freeway. Under the Roads of National Importance program. Victoria has sought declaration since 1996. (7) Development of the Scoresby Corridor is the responsibility of the Victorian Government. The Federal Government, for its part, is prepared to discuss with Victoria how best construction of the Scoresby Corridor might be funded. The release of the Partnerships Victoria paper by Victoria provides an ideal policy platform from which private sector development of Scoresby could be pursued. Colston, Former Senator: Movement Records (Question No. 1817) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 18 August 2000: Further to the answers to questions No. 1654 and No. 1153 (Hansard, 8 June 2000, page 16339), is the information concerning former Senator Colston a matter relating to law enforcement pursuant to subsection 488 (2)(e) of the Migration Act with respect to charges alleging misappropriation of Commonwealth revenue, namely travel rorts. the honourable member’s question: The investigation by the Australian Federal Police into allegations concerning former Senator Colston did not extend into 1999.

The total cost to AMSA was $697,101.40. (2) None of the costs were recovered. Search and rescue services are provided by AMSA in pursuance of the AMSA Act and in accordance with relevant maritime and aviation international conventions.

(3) What communications have he and his Department had with their British counterparts on this issue. the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) In undertaking its responsibilities regarding the repatriation of cultural property from overseas, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) has been in contact with the University of Edinburgh in the UK regarding Australian Indigenous human remains held in that institution. The University of Edinburgh cooperated with ATSIC and the Australian High Commission in London to return the skeletal remains of approximately 330 Indigenous individuals to Australia in June this year. the Polish Government and museum authorities for the return of an Indigenous human skeleton held by the Kornik Museum in Poland. Earlier this year, the Museum was said to be agreeable to the return of these remains to Australia but subsequently changed its position and has indicated that ongoing scientific research does not permit handing over the skeleton in the near future. (2) The recommendations were published on 25 July 2000 and made widely available on the Internet and I did not have access to them before that time. (3) During the last year there have been ongoing discussions between the Australian and British governments aimed at developing a cooperative approach to dealing with the repatriation of Indigenous human remains from Britain. In June 2000 I made a submission on this issue to the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee inquiry into Cultural Property: Return and Illicit Trade. The Australian and British Prime Ministers issued a joint statement on 4 July 2000 that outlined their governments’ commitment to increasing efforts to repatriate human remains to Australian Indigenous communities. Roads: Casula and Campbelltown Ramps (Question No. 1907) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 31 August 2000: (1) Further to my question No. 818 (Hansard, 29 September 1999, page 10333) what are the results of the planning study examining the need for additional ramps on the F5 between Casula and Campbelltown. (2) What progress has been made in implementing the findings of the report. (1) and (2) Work on the Campbelltown Ramps Study is progressing. On 25 August 2000 my Department met with the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority and the consultant to discuss a Working Draft of the study. As a result, the consultant will further review the draft and is expected to finalise the report within the next few months. Superannuation: Non-residents (Question No. 1912) Mr Andren asked the Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 4 September 2000: (1) Is it the case that (a) prior to 1 July 1998 Australians leaving the country permanently could access their superannuation regardless of its value and (b) until that time, superannuation deposits of less than $500 could be withdrawn by their holders.",131,Execi $59 280 15 155

267,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Is it also the case that since 1 July 1998 people leaving Australia permanently have been unable to access their superannuation before retirement unless their holdings are $200 or less; if so, why. (3) Is he aware that as a result of the changes (a) young people leaving Australia with small superannuation holdings risk losing track of their superannuation altogether or having it eroded by fees and charges and (b) may be unable to access their superannuation for 30-40 years. (4) Will the Government consider reforming the superannuation early access rules to allow amounts held by Australians leaving the country permanently to be rolled over into a complying fund in the country the claimant moves to; if not, why not. honourable member’s question: (1) (a) and (b) Yes. (2) Generally, yes. Early release of preserved benefits is possible, subject to the governing rules of the fund, if the benefits are taken in the form of a lifetime non-commutable pension or annuity, are restricted non-preserved benefits, or on compassionate grounds in certain limited circumstances. The purpose of the superannuation preservation rules is to ensure that superannuation savings that have benefited from Australian tax concessions are used to provide income in retirement and not for other purposes. (3) (a) “Member protection rules” are in place to ensure that fees on superannuation accounts with balances below $1,000 do not exceed investment gains. (b)The superannuation preservation rules are to ensure that superannuation savings are used to provide income in retirement. (4) The Government has announced that it would be prepared to negotiate arrangements with other countries on a reciprocal basis to allow non-residents to transfer their superannuation entitlements to an approved pension fund in their home country. Airports: Runway Debris (Question No. 1950) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 7 September 2000: (1) Are there Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) regulations governing the regularity of checking and clearing debris and objects from runways at Australia’s capital city and major regional airports, if so (a) how often are checks required, (b) does CASA conduct audits to ensure airport compliance with CASA runway inspection regulations, (c) how many audits have been conducted since 1995, and at which airports have they been conducted and (d) have there been any prosecutions or show cause notices issued to airport operators with respect to the runway inspection regulations since 1995. (2) Is the airport owner or operator responsible for ensuring the checks occur. (3) Do airport operators record the frequency of runway checks. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has advised the following: (1) Yes. Civil Aviation Regulation (CAR) 89H requires the operator of a licensed aerodrome to have an aerodrome manual, and CAR 89I states that the information which must be included in the aerodrome manual is shown in Schedule 10 of the CARs. All capital city aerodromes are licensed. All regional aerodromes which are used by regular public transport (RPT) aircraft with a seating capacity exceeding 30 passengers must also be licensed and all aerodromes may apply to be licensed regardless of the presence or size of RPT operations. Schedule 10 requires the operator of a licensed aerodrome to include, in the aerodrome manual, information about the aerodrome as well as the arrangements that are in place to ensure that safety is maintained. These include details of the arrangements for carrying out inspections of the movement area (including runways), arrangements for keeping records of the inspections, frequency of the",132,Atsic Has Also Been In Touch With The Australian Embassy In Warsaw Which Has Negotiated With
268,Mr Costello,The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the,133,Atsic Has Also Been In Touch With The Australian Embassy In Warsaw Which Has Negotiated With
269,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:inspections, an inspection checklist, arrangements for reporting and correcting any unsafe conditions and the names and roles of the aerodrome staff who are responsible. (a)Chapter9 of the CASA publication ""Rules and Practices for Aerodromes"" contains details of aerodrome inspection requirements, including the frequency of inspections. At aerodromes with 24 hour Air Traffic Control (ATC), inspections are required each day as soon as practicable after first light, after significant weather phenomena such as strong winds or heavy rain, and when requested by ATC. At other aerodromes, inspections are required each day before the first daylight public transport service movement, after significant weather phenomena such as strong winds or heavy rain, and when requested by Airservices Australia or CASA. Aerodrome operators may exceed these minimum requirements and CASA can direct an aerodrome operator to alter the procedures using CAR 89M if required to ensure the safety of aircraft. (b)Yes. CASA employs 12 Aerodrome Inspection staff who conduct audits of all licensed aerodromes in accordance with the Aviation Safety Surveillance Program (ASSP). The audits include all aspects of the procedures in the aerodrome manual, including aerodrome inspections. (c) There are approximately 260 licensed aerodromes in Australia, which are all audited on a regular basis in accordance with the ASSP. The program specifies an audit each 12 months for aerodromes which are used by RPT aircraft with more than 9 passenger seats and each 24 months for all other licensed aerodromes and for unlicensed aerodromes which are used for RPT operations. (d)No. There have been no prosecutions or Show Cause Notices issued to aerodrome operators in relation to runway inspections since 1995. (2) Yes. The aerodrome operator is responsible for ensuring that the checks occur. CAR 89M states that the aerodrome operator must operate and maintain the aerodrome in accordance with the procedures set out in the aerodrome manual. (3) Yes. The aerodrome manual must include details of the frequency of checks, the checklist used and a logbook or other system for recording inspections. Foreign Aid: Microcredit Funding (Question No. 1976) (1) What increase in funding for microcredit has been included in the 2000-2001 aid budget. (2) Is the additional funding supporting lending to the poorest people. (3) Is the funding being used to enable non-government organisations to distribute assistance to individual microcredit programs. (1) The Australian Government remains committed to doubling microfinance expenditure through the aid program within the life of the current Parliament, consistent with ensuring a high quality portfolio of activities. In support of this commitment I announced in the 1999-2000 Commonwealth budget, a three-year $3 million fund to act as a catalyst for further assistance to the microfinance sector in partnership with developing countries in our region. There has been no specific budget allocation for microfinance apart from this seed fund. This reflects the fact that the Government’s microfinance commitment will be met by increasing the role of microfinance in its regular programs, not by introducing a separate allocation specifically for microfinance. The role of the seed fund is to facilitate this process. It is only if we succeed in giving microfinance a more secure and prominent role in AusAID regular bilateral and NGO programs that a long-term enhancement of Australia’s contribution to the development of microfinance will be assured. A lot of work has been done and will continue to be done, much of it independently of the seed fund, to consolidate and expand the role of microfinance in Australia’s aid program (2) AusAID’s microfinance projects target those among the poor who are able to make effective use of credit. Consequently, there is a strong focus on women, given their disproportionate representation",133,Atsic Has Also Been In Touch With The Australian Embassy In Warsaw Which Has Negotiated With

271,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:among the poor, their reliability as borrowers and their propensity to use the income generated by loans to improve the living standards of their families. (3) AusAID’s microfinance expenditure is channelled through a number of intermediaries including Australian commercial contractors and non-government organisations (NGOs), both in Australia and in developing countries. Some of the Australian Government’s funding is being used to enable NGOs to distribute assistance to individual microcredit programs. For example, part of the microfinance seed fund was made available to Australian NGOs in 1999/2000 and 2000/01 to increase their microfinance capacity and that of their implementing partners. Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund: Estimates (Question No. 1982) Mr Tanner asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: (1) What are the forward estimates for (a) 2000-2001, (b) 2001-2002, (c) 2002-2003 and (d) 20032004 for the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund. (2) What sum has been committed to projects for each year referred to in part (1). has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The present Networking the Nation (NTN) program was originally established as the $250m Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund (RTIF) over five years from 1997-98 and funded from the sale of the first third of Telstra. This is now referred to as the NTN General Fund. An additional $171m Social Bonus funding from the sale of the next 16% of Telstra was provided for initiatives including: The Local Government fund ($45m over five years from 1999-2000) to assist local government authorities in regional Australia to provide online access to information and services including the Internet– this funding is not incorporated into the RTIF; Building Additional Rural Networks ($70m over five years from 1999-2000) to promote ongoing, sustainable improvements in regional telecommunications services – this funding is not incorporated into the RTIF; The Internet Access fund ($36m over three years from 1999-2000) to stimulate Internet service delivery in regional and rural Australia – this funding is incorporated into the RTIF; The Remote and Isolated Islands fund ($20m over three years from 1999-2000) to improve telecommunications access for remote island communities – this funding is incorporated within the RTIF. Social bonus funding for Mobile Phones on Highways ($25m over three years from 1999-2000) is incorporated within the RTIF but will be allocated through a competitive tender process and not through the NTN Board process as applies to the other initiatives outlined above. The objective of this initiative is to deliver mobile service to the maximum number of users of the designated highways, and any additional highways, regardless of where these users normally reside or do business. Forward estimates for the Regional Telecommunications Fund (administered under the Networking the Nation program) are as follows: Year: 2000-2001 2001-2002 2002-2003 2003-2004* Fund: $m $m $m $m General Fund 48.243 47.859 27.759 BARN 10 20 20 10 Local Government Fund3 15 12 10 Combined figures for: Internet 27 27 Access Remote and Isolated Islands Mobile Phones on Highways",134,Atsic Has Also Been In Touch With The Australian Embassy In Warsaw Which Has Negotiated With

Commitments for the Mobile Phones on Highways initiative will be made following a competitive tender process and have therefore have not been included in the above figures. Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business: Regional Assistance Program Estimates (Question No. 1983) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Employment Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: (1) What are the forward estimates for (a) 2001-2002, (b) 2002-2003 and (c) 2003-2004 for the Regional Assistance Program. (2) What sum of the estimates in each year is committed. Forward estimates at this level of detail are not available at this time. Oil: Australian Production Costs (Question No. 2004) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: (1) Is the Minister able to say what are the current costs of production of oil in Australia as declared by the major companies involved in such production. (2) On a year-by-year scale, how does this cost compare with previous years since 1990. (3) How do the costs of production compare with those in other oil producing countries, including the USA, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States and Nigeria. (4) How does the cost of Australian production compare with the OPEC price and on a year-by-year scale, what has been this comparison since 1990. (5) What is the reason for the difference between the cost of production in Australia and the OPEC figures. answer to the honourable member’s questions: (1) The sort of information required to answer the questions is commercially sensitive and oil companies do not generally release it. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources has been advised by the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association Limited; the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics; the Australian Bureau of Statistics; and the International Energy Agency that the sort of information required to answer the honourable member’s questions is not available.

Oil: Australian Company Production Profits (Question No. 2005) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: (1) Is the Minister able to say what are the current rates of profit of the oil-production companies within Australia and on a year-by-year scale, how does this compare with previous years since 1990. (2) What percentage of these profits is currently being spent on exploration and on a year-by-year scale, how does this compare with previous years since 1990. (3) Given the level of profits made by the oil production companies, is the Government satisfied that the level of investment in exploration justifies the linking of Australia’s oil prices to the international price. answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes, this is shown in the second line of Table1 below. (2) This is shown in the fourth line of Table1 below. (3) The level of investment exploration by oil production companies is a commercial decision for those companies. That said, the Government encourages petroleum exploration because it generates employment, economic activity and contributes to improving Australia’s energy self-sufficiency, as well as its fiscal and external position. If the Australian price of oil was set below the international price, petroleum exploration in Australia would be discouraged and such activity would tend to move overseas.

Oil: New Production Technologies (Question No. 2006) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: (1) What efforts are being made to implement new technologies that would serve to loosen the grip that oil companies have on the Australian motorist. (2) Is the Government exploring the idea of alternative fuels to be used in new cars, such as the use of ethanol based E-85 in all government cars in Illinois, USA. (3) Is the Government prepared to follow the lead of other nations such as the USA and implement an initiative which would promote clean fuel-burning and also serve to help sugar farmers who could sell their sugar cane to produce the ethanol needed for E-85.",136,Atsic Has Also Been In Touch With The Australian Embassy In Warsaw Which Has Negotiated With
275,Mr Moore,"The Minister for Industry, Science and Resources has provided the followinganswer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Government is providing significant support for the development of alternative fuels. Ethanol, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and compressed natural gas (CNG) have been included in legislation as alternative fuels which are excise exempt. The excise exemption represents a cost to revenue of some $700 million each year. It provides a 38 cent per litre cost advantage compared to petrol and diesel. The Government, through the Australian Greenhouse Office has an integrated strategy to encourage the use of cleaner alternative fuels through three programs: The Alternative Fuels Conversion Program The CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) Infrastructure Program The Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme The Alternative Fuels Conversion Program (AFCP) is a four year, $75 million initiative which was commenced in January 2000. The Program applies to certain heavy commercial vehicles and provides funds of up to 50 per cent of either: the difference between the purchase price of new CNG/LPG fuelled vehicles over their conventionally fuelled equivalents; the cost of converting conventionally fuelled vehicles to operate on CNG/LPG; or the cost of upgrading the fuel systems of vehicles already operating on CNG/LPG where improvements in greenhouse and other emissions can be demonstrated. The CNG Infrastructure Program (CNGIP) is a $7.6 million program designed to facilitate the establishment of a national network of CNG refuelling stations. The Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme (DAFGS) commenced in July 2000 and will maintain existing price relativities between diesel and a range of alternative fuels by allowing transport operators that are eligible for the diesel fuel grant to also be eligible for alternative fuel grants. (2) Yes. The Government is actively exploring the use of alternative fuels such as ethanol. In addition to the beneficial excise treatment of certain alternative fuels, on 20 June this year the Renewable Energy Action Agenda New Era– New Energy was launched. Under this Action Agenda the Australian Greenhouse Office has been tasked with managing the process of identifying key opportunities for the sustainable development and use of renewable transport fuels. A Renewable Transport Fuels (RTF) Working Group has been established and had its first meeting on 5 September 2000. At current levels of production of ethanol, there is insufficient supply to enable its use by all government vehicles. As a fuel its main use is as a blend stock in the production of petrol. (3) Yes, the Government has a program to promote cleaner fuels. Environment Australia (in conjunction with the Department of Industry, Science and Resources and the Department of Transport and Regional Services other agencies and the refining and automotive industries) is currently developing new cleaner fuel specifications. An important aim for the specifications is to reduce exhaust emissions. Currently, specifications for the principal transport fuels, petrol, diesel and LPG, are being developed. The Government is aware of the potential benefits to the environment and to sugar cane farmers of a competitive, robust and ecologically sustainable fuel ethanol industry. On 25 September 2000 the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon Warren Truss MP, announced the Government will fund a study, coordinated by ABARE, of the commercial viability of increasing production of ethanol by the Australian sugar industry. The Government believes it is more appropriate for the industry to make commercial decisions about the use of ethanol, rather than for the Government to impose its use through legislation.",137,Atsic Has Also Been In Touch With The Australian Embassy In Warsaw Which Has Negotiated With
