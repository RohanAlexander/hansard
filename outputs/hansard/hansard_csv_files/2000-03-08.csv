216,While The Potential For Combat Conditions Mr Speaker,"Order! It being 8 p.m.,Wednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14223 Wednesday, 8 March 2000 ----Social Security: Funding Cuts letter from Mrs Bangsa-Jayah. Mrs Bangsa-Jayah is a model parent. She participates in community events and prides herself in raising her family-one son is studying at university. Mrs Bangsa-Jayah’s problem is that she very recently became unemployed, with only some very hard-earned savings put away. Because of these savings, Centrelink has decided to delay unemployment payments to her for 13 weeks. This obviously leaves her both without a secure financial future and without the possibility of providing further assistance to her son at university. I will read you an extract from a letter she sent to my office. She states: I am a sole parent with an 18 year old son studying Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry at Curtin University. In January 2000, on the day of the enrolment, I made an undertaking to pay the HECS fee up-front in order to receive a 25% rebate and not to mention to avoid interest being added to the fee annually. The amount I am expected to pay is approximately $4000.00, and I intend to fulfil that commitment. I have just received my car registration bill of $368.00 and there are other bills, such as books for my son and various outstanding amounts totalling approximately $1500.00. My car needs urgent repairs for approximately $1000.00. These are in addition to our normal living expenses. I did not attempt to cheat the system by hiding the cash at home and running the risk of losing my hardearned savings. As a result I feel that I have been penalised by Centrelink Policies How does this sort of scenario develop? It develops when this government, in its infinite meanness, passed the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. This added up to about $1.5 billion worth of savings over the period. It contained quite a number of measures, which we in the opposition found objectionable. Citizens like Mrs Bangsa-Jayah have to live with the consequences. Mrs Bangsa-Jayah and her son also have to contend with HECS at a higher rate than when the Labor Party left office-another not inconsiderable burden on the family. Of course, many in the community would also tell Mrs Bangsa-Jayah’s son that the quality of his education is now threatened due to budgetary madness and short-sightedness. It is no wonder that Mrs Bangsa-Jayah asks when the next election will be. Like many, she wishes to rectify this sort of social injustice. According to the Australian Council of Social Service, cuts which mainly affect low income earners account for more than 30 per cent of all expenditure cuts in the coalition’s last four budgets. Under the guise of simplification, the coalition has broken many of its pre-election commitments, specifically in terms of not hurting the poor, the needy and the most vulnerable in our community. Members of this government should hang their heads in shame at this treatment of ordinary Australians. Killarney Glen, Queensland concern to many of my constituents. This is an issue which dates back nearly 30 years and to which successive governments have been either unable or unwilling to find a solution. I am speaking of the Defence department’s pursuit of the Killarney Glen/Back Creek Gorge property-occupied by Mr Paddy Fitzgerald for his entire lifetime and for the last few years tended and maintained by his son Patrick after Paddy passed away. I ought to point out that the Fitzgerald family owned this land since the 1880s, until the Defence department decided in 1971 to resume the property in Back Creek Gorge as a buffer",128,Interfet Which Had Been Deployed In East Tion Building Civil Policing Election Moni

CanI say at the outset that I do not personally have any problem with the land warfare centre. I am proud to have this service established in my electorate, and I am particularly proud of the men and women who work there. WhatI am not proud of is the Defence department’s ongoing and bloody-minded efforts to defy all logic and community expectations to pursue the property at all costs. I am standing here today on behalf of local residents who want to ensure that public access to the property is maintained and that the unique environmental aspects of the land are preserved for future generations. To fully detail the 25-year legal battle and the promises made and broken by successive governments to the Fitzgerald family would defy a 20-minute speech, let alone the short three-minute opportunity I have today. WhatI want to say is that this heritage listed property, admired by locals for years and by bushwalkers from all around the nation and overseas, should not be sacrificed for the sake of never taking a backward step, which seems to be the only reason for the Defence department’s trenchant position. They have yet to explain why this property remains so desperately needed while others nearby do not. They have yet to explain, if this property is so desperately needed for safety reasons, why there has been public access to it for the last 30 years and, indeed, Mr Fitzgerald and his family have lived there. It is one thing to claim you have the law on your side; it is another to be doing the wrong thing. I share the views of many local residents who do not want to see this special property lost to the community. I want to assure the friends of Back Creek Gorge, the Local Progress Association and other concerned residents that I will continue to fight for ongoing public access. Killarney Glen is a special place. It ought to be preserved and admired and enjoyed by generations of local residents. I urge the Defence department to rethink its position, to consider the will of the majority of local residents and to help find a solution to this problem. I will personally continue to pursue this at the highest level. the time for members’ statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 February 2000, on motion by Mr Entsch: That the bill be now read a second time. Treaty (Transitional Arrangements) Bill, the purpose of which is to amend the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Act 1990 and related acts to reflect the fact that the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor-UNTAET-has replaced Indonesia as Australia’s partner in the operation of the Timor Gap Treaty. The bill is consistent with Labor’s approach to the future of the Timor Gap; specifically, that an independent East Timor could and should be encouraged to step into the shoes of Indonesia in respect of the operation of the Timor Gap Treaty. That policy position was first enunciated by Labor in September 1998 and elaborated in statements in January and later in 1999. On 26 October 1999 Eastern Australian Time, UNTAET was established by resolution 1272 of the United Nations Security Council as the interim administrative and legal authority for East Timor. In Dili on 10 February, diplomatic notes were exchanged between the UN Transitional Administrator in East Timor, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and Australia’s diplomatic representative in East Timor on interim arrangements for the Timor Gap Treaty, so that that the terms of the treaty will continue to apply in the transitional period until East Timor’s",133,Representatives Main Committee

221,Mr Brereton (Kingsford,"Smith) (10.00 a.m.)-I am pleased to support the Timor GapWednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14225 independence. It is a matter of public record that this agreement was negotiated in consultation with East Timorese representatives. In a press release on 10 February announcing the agreement between Australia and Senator Minchin, indicated-and I quote: In talks in Jakarta last weekthat is the first week of FebruaryIndonesian representatives agreed that following the separation of East Timor from Indonesia, the area covered by the Treaty was now outside Indonesia’s jurisdiction and that the Treaty ceased to be in force as between Australia and Indonesia when Indonesian authority over East Timor transferred to the United Nations. Ministers Downer and Minchin also took the opportunity to place on record their appreciation of Indonesia’s constructive approach to these talks. Since that press release, a number of Indonesian politicians, mainly from West Timor, have claimed that Indonesia should assert a continuing claim to at least parts of the Timor Gap and should retain a share of revenues from petroleum development in the region. The Governor of West Timor, Piet Tallo, was reported on 28 February to have said that Australia is in no position to unilaterally determine to whom the Timor Gap should belong, saying-and I quote: It is unacceptable, if Australia says that West Timor has no right to the gas and oil deposits in the Timor Gap. More significantly, Indonesia’s Minister for Mines and Energy, Susilo Yudhoyono, has been reported by the Jakarta Post and Agence France Presse as saying that Indonesia wants to hold talks on its sea boundaries with Australia in respect of the Timor Gap. The minister was quoted on 18 February as saying: The termination of the Timor Gap Treaty should be followed by talks as to how we should determine the sea boundaries between the two countries. In the light of these statements, I ask the government whether, before the conclusion of this debate, they can provide further details on the talks in Jakarta in early February. Specifically, who were the representatives on the Australian side? Who were the representatives on the Indonesian side? Were any formal agreements reached; that is to say, was the Indonesian agreement referred to in the ministers’ press release of 10 February contained in an exchange of notes or a memorandum of understanding, or, indeed, in any other formal agreement between Australia and Indonesia? What precise arrangements were agreed in respect of the Timor Gap joint authority, its personnel and its assets? A detailed response on these matters would be of some value and, indeed, some interest. Turning, if I may, to the agreement between Australia and UNTAET, the exchange of notes of 10 February provides that UNTAET accepts all the rights and obligations previously exercised by Indonesia under the Timor Gap Treaty. Speaking on 10 February UNTAET Administrator de Mello rightly said that the agreement comes at ‘a very important moment for East Timor’, as it will guarantee potentially valuable revenues for the territory as it recovers from last year’s anti-independence violence. The agreement with UNTAET applies retrospectively from the establishment of UNTAET, thereby achieving a seamless transition between Indonesia’s exit from the Timor Gap Treaty and UNTAET’s entry into a treaty relationship with Australia. This interim agreement is without prejudice to the position of the future government of an independent East Timor. Long-term arrangements for the Timor Gap will need to be concluded between Australia and an independent East Timor after the departure of UNTAET. There will, no doubt, be ongoing discussions between Australia and East Timor’s political leadership on this issue. It is a matter of public record that East Timorese leaders have 14226 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 2000 expressed a range of views on possible future arrangements for the Timor Gap and have raised the possibility of renegotiation. That said, I am confident that Australia and an independent East Timor should be able to conclude arrangements which ensure continuity, give security to the companies operating in the Timor Gap and ensure that East Timor will derive significant economic benefits from the Timor Gap. Enactment of this bill should contribute to investor certainty in the Timor Gap. Over $US700 million has been spent on petroleum exploration and development of area A of the Timor Gap zone of cooperation since the treaty entered into force in 1991. The first commercial oil production commenced in July 1998 with the development of the small ElangKakatua field, which currently produces about 16,000 barrels a day and generates revenues to both Australia and East Timor at a rate of approximately $US3 million per annum. Development of other potential projects in the zone of cooperation, notably the BayuUndan and the Sunrise-Troubadour gas condensate fields, could involve capital expenditures of about $US15 billion, including major onshore facilities in the vicinity of Darwin. The development of the Bayu-Undan liquids project, a world-class project by a Phillips Petroleum-led consortium, has the potential to provide several tens of millions of dollars per annum to both East Timor and Australia for a period of 10 to 20 years, commencing in the year 2004. The Bayu-Undan project has the potential to make a very significant contribution to the economic development and stability of an independent East Timor. Development of the second LNG production phase of the project has even greater potential both for East Timor and for the Northern Territory. The changes contained in this bill should provide continuity in the arrangements under the terms of the Timor Gap Treaty to reflect the change in Australia’s treaty partner from Indonesia to UNTAET and validate actions of the Timor Gap Ministerial Council and joint authority since 26 October 1999. They will also enable the continuation of a range of Australian taxation, customs, immigration, crime and quarantine laws relating to petroleum operations in the Timor Gap. They should not have any direct financial impact on companies and individuals or on the Australian government. The bill has Labor’s strong bipartisan support. Treaty shows some of the benefits of the actions that the Australian government and the Australian Defence Force have been involved in in recent times. We have, in the words of one columnist I have read, basically given birth to or assisted as midwives in the birth of a new country-East Timor. Its future will be an interesting prospect for the people who live there. It will also be a big burden for all the countries associated with the new nation of East Timor because, in part, it will be our responsibility to ensure the success of the nation that has been born as a result of all these activities. In doing so, I think it is important that we set about trying to ensure the financial and economic future of East Timor. In passing, I am disappointed in the opposition spokesman, the member for Kingsord-Smith, Mr Brereton. We heard 8½ minutes from him on this issue. East Timor is going to be a very important part of our region. It has been all the way through. He can scoff. But the fact is that East Timor will share an important treaty with us on the exploration of oil and gas in this region. This will provide jobs and it will provide much of the economic base on which East Timor will rely. The future of our relationships with East Timor and with Indonesia will depend very much on the success of this treaty. A significant thing will be whether or not the provisions of the treaty that has been in place with Indonesia for some time will remain in full. The result of this changed treaty was referred to by John Loizou in the Northern Territory News on 12 February 2000. He said:",134,Representatives Main Committee
222,Mr Cameron Thompson (Blair) (10.09 A.m.),"This agreement on the Timor GapWednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14227 The Northern Territory News has learned that it is also likely to mean the eventual relocation of the zone of co-operation’s administrator, the Timor Gap Authority, from Darwin to Dili. I think that is a significant event because it does show the change in the power relationship. An independent nation like East Timor will have the opportunity to take a much more effective role in the administration of this zone of cooperation than it ever could as a province of Indonesia. I think that is an interesting prospect. That will mean a transfer of power to the new East Timor nation, a transfer of jobs and a greater economic stability than could ever have happened under the previous relationship with Indonesia. It is important that we recognise the value of that. Historically, I would like to refer to a speech made by the Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, at the National Press Club on 1 December 1999. Firstly, he said: Australia’s policy on East Timor is clearly in line with our national interests. Prior to the creation of INTERFET and the actions that followed that, he said: And in considering in our national interest in this matter, one point I’ve often made is that East Timor stood in the way of establishing a genuine long-term productive relationship between Australia and Indonesia. That is the problem of East Timor that he is referring to there. He went on: In effect, the presence of East Timor on our bilateral agendabetween Australia and Indonesia, that ismade relations with Indonesia very one sided. For example, between June 1975 and November 1999, there have been 12 official visits by Australian Prime Ministers to Indonesia-indeed, by every Prime Minister from Whitlam to Howard. In that same period, the Indonesian President has not visited Australia once. That is an indication of how one sided that relationship was as a result of this impediment in the relationship over East Timor. He went on to say: President Soeharto did not visit because he knew there would be massive demonstrations on the subject of East Timor. The very fact that he felt unable to come here shows there was a very big problem in the bilateral relationship, one that made the relationship very unbalanced. From that lopsided situation we are now able to move on to resolve past tensions, and for both sides to have a more balanced and stable relationship. That is a very important point to consider in this process. Juxtaposed to those comments from the Foreign Minister, I move to an article on 19 February this year in the Weekend Australian. There was a discussion of the impending visit of the new President of Indonesia, Abdurrahman Wahid, to Australia and whether that will be in March or in May. In all that time, 12 years, there has been no visit by any Indonesian president. Now, in this very short time frame, we have the prospect that we will see the new president in Australia. That change in our relationship is a welcome development. The foreign affairs spokesman on the other side mentioned some debate about whether or not Indonesia would now want further discussions about the seabed boundary between Australia and Indonesia. That is referred to in the same article in the Weekend Australian: Meanwhile, the Indonesian Government said yesterday it wanted to hold talks on its sea boundaries with Australia after the separation of East Timor from Indonesia. … Mines and Energy Minister… had said the sea boundaries should be redefined to take into account the exploration of oil and gas under the Timor Gap treaty, which has been transferred to the UN. That is right: they may very well want to have talks along those lines. But the fact is that at the moment there is a very effective agreement that is working, providing for three zones in that boundary. It must be one of the few places in the world where a boundary actually has a series of lines in it. It looks more like a venetian blind than a boundary. It provides for zone A, 14228 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 2000 the area of cooperation between Australia and now the new state of East Timor under its United Nations administration; zone B, the area which Australia basically administers but in which 10 per cent of tax collected goes to the East Timorese authorities; and zone C, which is basically administered by the East Timorese and in which 10 per cent of the revenue flows the other way, back to Australia. The fact that we have been able to settle so quickly on this treaty coming into place, with basically the same old treaty with Indonesia able to be transferred straight over and administered in a new relationship between Australia and East Timor, shows the underlying strength of the relationship between Australia and Indonesia. A lot of work has gone into that over the years, and the fact that that has not become a huge source of irritation in this dispute is significant and shows that there is a maturity of the relationship. While the Indonesians will no doubt want now to have a series of discussions on the subject, the fact that there has not been an immediate blow-up on the subject is healthy and shows that our relationship is healthy. I would like to discuss some of the benefits of this agreement coming into place. We should look first at the announcement itself. The foreign affairs spokesman on the other side referred to the agreement that was signed between Australia and the United Nations administration. I would like to read into the record a part of that exchange of notes between the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor and the Australian government. The UNTAET note states: obligations under the Timor Gap treaty previously administered by Indonesia are assumed by UNTAET, acting on behalf of East Timor until the date of independence of East Timor. UNTAET, acting on behalf of East Timor and Australia, may enter into subsidiary arrangements or agreements relating to the continued operation of the terms of the treaty. In agreeing to continue the arrangements under the terms of the treaty, the United Nations does not thereby recognise the validity of the integration of East Timor into Indonesia. If the understanding of Australia is in accordance with the foregoing advice, UNTAET has the honour to propose that this note and Australia’s confirmatory note in reply shall constitute an agreement between UNTAET, acting on behalf of East Timor and Australia, which shall be applied as of 25 October 1999. A short part of Australia’s reply says: The Australian mission has the honour to advise that the foregoing proposal is acceptable to the government of Australia and to agree that the UNTAET note and this reply shall constitute an agreement between the government of Australia and UNTAET which shall be applied as of 25 October 1999. That is the guts of the two notes that went backwards and forwards and sealed in concrete the agreement between Australia and East Timor under the United Nations. Of course, once East Timor gains its full independence they may well want to come back and have further discussions on the shape of that agreement as well. But of the fact that it is a solid agreement there can be no doubt because it has resulted in a flurry of activity up there. The fact that we have been so quickly able to establish this agreement on solid ground has resulted in a couple of developments, the first one being a joint announcement-and I have a copy of the press release here from Senator Nick Minchin-by the UNTAET administrator and Senator Minchin in which they announced the unlocking of a very significant petroleum development in the Bayu-Undan field as well as in the whole of the zone of cooperation in the Timor Sea region. That agreement, which is being led by Phillips Petroleum, involved a capital expenditure of $US1,400 million and the recovery of up to 400 million barrels of condensate and liquified petroleum gas. The first phase provides for a foundation for the second stage of development that will deliver gas to Darwin for use in Australian markets or for export as liquified natural gas. Wednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14229 That shows-if you are purely interested in this whole exercise from a greedy Australian perspective, a purely parochial viewpoint from our perspective-that the benefits that will flow on to Darwin from having a solid agreement on the zone of cooperation are manyfold. It is very good to see that occur. I am sure that the member for the Northern Territory will be welcoming that, and it is something that we should all welcome for sure. But, in addition to that particular project to which I refer, further developments have followed in relation to the Sunrise gas resource, involving a deal between Woodside Petroleum and Shell Australia. There was discussion of that on 7 March in the Australian where it was reported: Woodside Petroleum and Shell Australia are on the verge of staging a $5 billion natural gas coup after securing a conditional promise to buy 110 petajoules of gas a year from the Sunrise field in the Timor Sea. This Sunrise field does extend into the area that, as I said, looks like a venetian blind and that involves joint arrangements between Australia and the new United Nations administration in East Timor and will result in benefits as a consequence. To underline that, the agreement involves Canada’s Methanex Corp and they have signed a letter of intent to build a methanol plant near Darwin, fed by gas from Sunrise, on condition enough customers can be signed for development to proceed, gas reserves are confirmed and government approvals granted. The partners are focusing on proving-up the recoverable reserves in Sunrise, and this is always a bit of a difficult process but it is under way. It is estimated currently that there are 9.16 trillion cubic feet of gas and 321 million barrels of condensate in the Sunrise area, which extends into the zone of cooperation with East Timor. That is another massive development that can flow from this good news. So in its efforts to help resolve the problem, the question of East Timor, I think the government of Australia has done a great service not only to the people of East Timor but also to the people of Australia, because we will be facilitating great developments, particularly in the Northern Territory, based on the strength of the resources there in the zone of cooperation. I do not want to continue further because I think the major ramifications of this have been covered in what I have said. Fundamentally, if we take a wider world view rather than the parochial one that I have been focused on in the last five minutes, the question to ask is with respect to the future of East Timor itself and making that nation financially viable so that it can provide for the people who live there. As I said, there will be benefits to East Timor as a result of the zone of cooperation agreement. I am pleased to welcome this legislation and to endorse it. the debate this morning on the Timor Gap Treaty (Transitional Arrangements) Bill 2000 for a number of reasons, including my historical interest and my involvement in the issue of East Timor, and the mere fact that I am the member for the Northern Territory and what that has meant over a number of years. Mr Deputy Speaker, I was the chairman of the Timor Gap Task Force under the previous government. The purpose of that task force was to facilitate as far as we possibly could, as interested observers, developments in the zone of cooperation, and at the same time ensure that Australia got a fair share of the benefits. Of course, the agreement over the Timor Gap ensures that, but we were very concerned to keep our eyes on the ball. The Timor Gap Task Force had participants from the industry, from the trade unions and from governments-the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth government-and we had regular briefings from the joint authority. That was very useful because it gave me an understanding of the issues involved in the development of the Timor Gap. I have to say that an important aspect of that is the agreement itself, which has been referred to previously by other speakers. An aspect which is crucial, of",136,Representatives Main Committee
223,Mr Snowdon (Northern Territory) (10.26 A.m.),"I am pleased to make a contribution to14230 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 2000 course, is a fair division of the spoils, and that is that the benefits which accrue are divided roughly fifty-fifty between ourselves as a signatory and a partner, in this case UNTAET, acting on behalf of the East Timorese, previously the Indonesians. I see this as a very positive sign. I have to say I was a person who had difficulty in accepting the initial signing of the agreement because of my own position on the question of East Timor. I was an advocate of the East Timorese cause over many years and yet a member of a government which had signed an agreement based on de jure recognition. That was something I had not really agreed with in the first instance and so it was quite difficult. Nevertheless, accepting de jure recognition is what we did under previous governments. It was initiated by the Fraser government in 1977 or 1978. As a result of that we accepted Indonesian occupation of East Timor and its annexation and we accepted Indonesian governance of the area. On that basis we signed the agreement over the Timor Gap. It is a good agreement. I think it is fair to say that it is an agreement which can be seen by all parties as providing a fair distribution of the resources and as providing the capacity for industry to recognise that they, despite the sensitivities involved in the area, can develop the resource in an appropriate way. Not long after the United Nations became heavily involved in East Timor last year we had visits by senior spokesmen for the CNRT, not least by the leadership. One of those people who came here very early on was Dr Mari Alkatiri. He came here to talk with our government about the way in which CNRT would approach the issue of the Timor Gap. In my discussions with Dr Alkatiri he made it very clear that their concern was to facilitate the ongoing development of their region and that it was not their desire for there to be any impediment to the commercial development of the Timor Gap. He did say, and I think it is a caveat which was mentioned previously by the shadow spokesman on foreign affairs, that at some point when East Timor has its own government and is independent of the United Nations it may seek to renegotiate the agreement. I think we should say that is well and good. We should welcome the possibility of sitting across the table from a sovereign government of East Timor to renegotiate that deed if that is required. The important element of that is that renegotiation should not cause a difficulty for those people who are planning to invest considerable resources in the development of the region. It seems to me that the message which has been given by the CNRT leadership, independently from UNTAET but I am sure UNTAET has given it as well, is that it is their desire to facilitate the development in an appropriate way. Clearly there is the real question that, if there are major impediments to the ongoing development of the region and the investment of the billions of dollars which have been earmarked for Bayu-Undan and potentially for Sunrise, it is important that it does not take with it sovereign risk as a result of the actions of governments, given that agreement has been reached and given that they are working under the current arrangements and an agreement which has been signed initially by Australia and Indonesia and, subsequently, with an exchange of letters by Australia and year. I say that this is an important milestone. It is an important milestone for our country, Australia, to come to terms with our responsibilities as a neighbour to East Timor. Over recent months we have seen Australia become involved in East Timor in a very positive way. Despite whatever reservations I might personally have had about our past relationships and our de jure recognition of Indonesian occupation, I think it is fair to say that over recent months Australia has acted and shown its bona fides in a way which should be applauded by all Australians. I know it is recognised and acknowledged by the East Timorese community. Not only have we repaid an enormous debt in the form of the relationship that we have had Wednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14231 with East Timor historically as a result of the Second World War through the leadership of General Cosgrove and INTERFET; we have recognised in a mature way the importance of the East Timorese being self-determining in their relationships with us. That, to me, is extremely important. I know the previous speaker, the member for Blair, spoke of our relationship with the Indonesian government. It is true that it is very important to us that we maintain a very strong relationship with Indonesia. I personally believe that we are in a position to extend that relationship to well beyond what it has been, certainly over the last 12 months, as a result of what has happened recently in East Timor. Important also is recognition by us of what this really means to the East Timorese community. Those of us who have had the privilege of visiting East Timor will understand how devastated that community is and will understand how important access to whatever material resources and benefits flow out of the development of the Timor Gap will be to the people of East Timor. I do not think it is unreasonable to say that we should not be building false hopes. The fact is that we are talking about the development of a resource which is dependent on a whole range of factors which are by and large beyond the control of government. We are hopeful that this will be a boon that will provide the potential for tens of millions, if not billions, of dollars over the years ahead to our respective countries but it may not. I think what we need to comprehend is that while ever it does, the use of those resources, in terms of the benefits it will bring to the East Timorese community, is extremely important. For my own community in the Northern Territory, we have been and are well placed to take advantage of the benefits that will flow from the development of the Timor Gap. We know already of the plans by Phillips Petroleum-and now we hear by Woodside and Shellfor the further development of the resources which come out of the Timor Gap through plants developed in the Northern Territory near Darwin. Those are very important to our economy. I do not think we should underestimate their importance to our economy or the fact that they will provide significant benefits to the people of the Northern Territory. I have had some discussions with the people involved in these developments previously, and it is very clear that, whilst their interests are commercial, they see there are significant benefits of a non-commercial nature which will flow to those people who are participants in the Timor Gap. The spin-offs which will flow to my community in the Northern Territory are clearly significant and are very welcome, as they would be significant and welcome to the people of East Timor. There is one issue about this which causes me some irritation, and that is the fact that really we have the United Nations as a partner in this deal at the moment. In my view, the quicker the United Nations is replaced, in a sense-at least in terms of these formal arrangements-by a sovereign government or sovereign representatives of East Timor, the better. That may well take some time, given the internal factors which are at work in East Timor and the need for the United Nations to act responsibly. I think it is extremely important, and I know that it is at the forefront of the minds of the senior people within the United Nations. UNTAET should act in concert with advice and with the views of the people of East Timor, particularly those people who act as the leaders of CNRT. I do not think we should underestimate that importance. It is not appropriate for UNTAET to make decisions in isolation. I am not saying that they would intend to do that; I am hoping they will not. Certainly, statements which have been made by Mr de Melo and certainly by the Secretary-General of the United Nations would lead us to believe that that will not be the case. Nevertheless, it is an observation which I think is worthwhile making. There is a real issue here about the East Timorese community being able 14232 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 2000 to develop their own views about the world, to develop their own relationships with people of the world and to ensure that arrangements which are made on their behalf by UNTAET meet their objectives and their priorities. I am hopeful that that will be the case. I am just saying that I have some reservations about the role of the United Nations. Nevertheless, this is an important piece of legislation and it is something which I think we can be proud of in terms of our role in it. I look forward to an ongoing relationship with the people of East Timor through this arrangement. It will be part of a very wide relationship. There is no question about that. As a person who lives in the Northern Territory, I am looking forward to that partnership, of Australia being a very close neighbour to the people of East Timor. I think this is a very important piece of legislation and I commend it to the House. acknowledge the presence in the gallery today of members of the Public Accounts Committee of the parliament of Fiji, led by the Hon. David Pickering, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I note that the subject of Timor, which is the subject matter in part of this bill before the chamber today, is a matter of interest in recent times to both our nations. I welcome them here. Second Reading Debate resumed. Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (10.39 a.m.)-I would also like to welcome members of the committee from Fiji. I met with them a few moments ago in our House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration. It is good to see you in the Main Committee. So welcome once again. I also rise today to speak to the Timor Gap Treaty (Transitional Arrangements) Bill 2000. I would like to add to much of what was said by the earlier speakers, including the member for the Northern Territory and the member for Blair. It has been a tumultuous year for the Timor region. While we have all been shocked and horrified by the events of the last year, it is also with some great hope that we look forward to a stable and independent future for East Timor. It would be remiss of me not to congratulate the Australian soldiers, the Federal Police and other people from my electorate of Petrie who contributed to the East Timorese effort.Yesterday’s function was just a small token of appreciation by the government and members of the opposition for the fine work that they contributed to in East Timor and the excellent work, leadership and role model provided by General Cosgrove in that particular campaign. I know that all of Australia was proud of their efforts over there and the way that the mission was conducted. Under these very difficult conditions they were able to maintain peace and make life just a little better for the victims of the fighting. I know that all of us would hope that the atrocities that occurred in that area will never happen again. It is now up to the United Nations, through the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, to continue the process as East Timor becomes an independent identity. With these transitions, it has become necessary for amendments to be made to the Timor Gap Treaty. Clearly, for investors to remain interested in the area, it is really up to the Australian government and the United Nations Transitional Administration to ensure that all existing regulation and administration of the region are maintained in an ongoing manner. I know that previous speakers were all in accord with this. The specific purpose of this bill is to amend the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Act 1990 and related acts to replace Indonesia with the United Nations administration in matters relating to the region. Following the recent events in East Timor,",139,Representatives Main Committee
224,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Andrews),"Before calling the member for Petrie, IWednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14233 Indonesia can no longer hold sovereign rights over the area covered by the Timor Gap Treaty. It is therefore vital that these changes be made to ensure the continuation of development projects in the region. And we are talking about a world-scale project when we talk about this particular development. I had the pleasure two years ago of visiting the North West Shelf as part of the industry, science and technology committee, and I was absolutely overawed by the level of the project and the process that went into establishing that particular project. Woodside are one of the partners in that project, and I understand that they, along with Shell and Philips, have expressed a very keen interest in the Timor Basin region. The magnitude of the project was something that I never envisaged until I got there. I think we visited the North Rankin field and the platforms. The living conditions, the infrastructure, the pipeline to the shore, the amount of liquid petroleum gas that is exported by tanker every year to Japan and the wonderful effects that this is having on our export industry and the infrastructure were just amazing. That project took a long time to get off the ground. It was a project that was not without its troubles; it was a project that did not have a smooth road. But once it was established, it created an incredible infrastructure for the area. It also provided jobs for many hundreds of people in the area and also for people outside the area. As long as we have Japan as one of our partners in this export venture, we will continue to provide liquid petroleum gas to Japan in these huge tankers, the size of which I still cannot get over. This is what we are talking about here-developing a similar project for the East Timor region. It is important that we look at some of the aspects of this. I know that it is in its early development stages. The member for the Northern Territory expressed some reservations about United Nations involvement. I can understand where he is coming from; I think that we all share those reservations. But in this transitional period before East Timor becomes independent and is able to maintain its obligations and responsibilities under the treaty, it is important that they have some foundation and some assistance, and this is where Australia and the United Nations have come into the picture. Earlier, the member for Blair would have spoken about the enormity of this particular project and, again, I just want to emphasise the size of this project. There is capital expenditure of up to $US1,400 million. We are talking about something like 400 million barrels of condensate and liquid petroleum gas, as I mentioned earlier. The first stage provides a foundation for the second stage of the development. It will also deliver gas to Darwin and provide some very valuable gas for use in Australian markets as well as the export of liquid natural gas or LNG. It is important to emphasise the positive aspects of this. It is in its infancy and it is important that governments be on hand to provide whatever assistance they can to companies like Woodside, Shell and Phillips. They are clearly interested in the area and willing to invest resources and considerable effort to ensure that the project is a success. Local content was one of the things that comes up all the time. Particularly in the North West Shelf, it is important that people and resources from the region be utilised in the best possible way. Clearly, that will be one of the benefits to East Timor of this particular project. It is not an easy project. It is going to involve a gas production line, a subsea trunkline, an online pipeline and the Syngas plant itself. The potential will be huge. It will not pay off in the early stages but the potential for returns down the track will be significant indeed. It is important to note that this particular agreement was formalised in an exchange between Australia and the United Nations early in February. In usual situations this legislation would have been in place prior to that exchange. However, in the very exceptional circumstances it has been impossible to follow through with the normal procedure. Since the upheaval of the last year the Australian government has worked very hard to implement 14234 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 2000 continuity and certainty in arrangements like the Timor Gap Treaty. Historically, the Timor Gap Treaty has worked very effectively. I understand that approximately $700 million has been invested already in the exploration of the area and the flow-on from the benefits of these projects will certainly be beneficial for the developing nation. It is important that East Timor has the facilities and the ability to maintain its economy and expand. With estimates of follow-up investment at approximately $15 billion it is a huge project. Most of the amendments to the treaty involve the replacement of the word ‘Indonesia’ with the ‘United Nations Transitional Administration’ in East Timor in the act. The bill also ensures that actions by the ministerial council and the joint authority are validated from 26 October 1999 when the United Nations established the Transitional Administration as the administrative and legal authority for East Timor. There are also validation provisions for things done since that date but with provisions to protect against retrospective criminal liability and to preserve the immunity from persecution. In relation to the petroleum operations in the region, the bill will allow for various taxation, customs, immigration, crime and quarantine laws in the gap as well, and the Crimes at Sea Act 2000 currently before the parliament had amendments inserted to reflect the changes in the bill. The Crimes at Sea Act 2000 follows a new arrangement between the Commonwealth, state and territory governments regarding criminal actions at sea and will replace the current Crimes at Sea Act 1979. Other related acts to be amended in relation to the changes have been listed previously by my colleague the honourable member for Leichhardt. Whilst many of these amendments appear small they are absolutely vital to the smooth transition of the administration of the treaty, and the changes made in this bill do not alter the conditions of the exploration of the area but provide that continuity for the companies involved. The events that followed the referendum results in East Timor were disgraceful, to say the least. It really is a testament to the strength and resilience of the East Timorese people that they are able to rise above that. They are able to look to the future with happiness and certainty and put their lives back together again. The Australian government have shown their commitment to the people of East Timor and will continue to have that commitment to them over the months and years ahead. This bill will ensure that companies investing in the region can be absolutely confident of the future regularity of administrative arrangements in the Timor Gap zone and for this very reason today I would like to commend the bill to the House. Ms HOARE (Charlton) (10.50 a.m.)-I would like to join my colleagues, both in the government and the opposition, in expressing my pleasure at the opportunity to be able to speak briefly to the important Timor Gap Treaty (Transitional Arrangements) Bill 2000. The treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the zone of cooperation, in an area between the then Indonesian province of East Timor and northern Australia, was signed on 11 December 1989 after 10 years of negotiation. The Timor Gap Treaty is the most substantial bilateral agreement concluded in the history of Australia’s relations with Indonesia. The treaty resolved a dispute over seabed boundaries and established the foundation for cooperative exploration for and exploitation of petroleum resources which would have been delayed by efforts to define a single boundary. The zone of cooperation consists of three areas. AreaA is the area of joint development. AreaB is the area of sole Australian jurisdiction, with Australia paying 10 per cent of the gross resource rent tax revenues from this area to Indonesia. AreaC is the area of sole Indonesian jurisdiction with Indonesia paying 10 per cent of its contractor’s income tax revenue from this area to Australia. With the successful vote for independence by the people of East Timor in August last year came many problems and questions on the development of a new nation. There also came hope and inspiration. There also came the need to negotiate new arrangements with regard to Wednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14235 the Timor Gap Treaty in preparation for the transition to an independent East Timor. Though over the past few months some Indonesians have claimed that the Indonesian government should retain a share of the revenue from petroleum exploration and development in the Gap, in February of this year, Abdurrahman Wahid’s government agreed that the area covered by the treaty was now outside Indonesian jurisdiction. This agreement means that the Indonesian stake in the previous agreement will now be assumed by the party which has been given the responsibility by the United Nations to oversee East Timor in its development as a nation. In February this year, the INTERFET forces handed this responsibility to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, UNTAET. In relation to the Timor Gap Treaty, UNTAET acting on behalf of East Timor has agreed to assume all the rights and obligations previously exercised by Indonesia under the treaty. The eventual outcome of these transitional arrangements will be, hopefully, for the East Timorese to own and use the revenue generated by the development of the petroleum sites. In the past nine years, $US700 million has been spent by an American company in this area. The potential for further petroleum exploration and development in the Timor Gap zone of cooperation could generate possibly tens of millions of dollars per annum for East Timor and Australia for decades. Let us reflect on what this wealth could mean for the development of economy, infrastructure and the social structure of the independent nation of East Timor. To fully understand what these tens of millions of dollars could mean to the dignity, well-being and equality of life of the East Timorese people, we need to know what the current situation is. The violence perpetrated during the independence vote and after the outcome of independence saw over 80 per cent of the infrastructure of the fledgling nation razed: houses destroyed, hundreds of thousands of people displaced, water supplies contaminated, crops ravished, roads, bridges and other transport infrastructure destroyed. The administrative structure of East Timor was largely made up of Indonesians who have since fled this emerging nation. With an increase in the economic wealth of East Timor, we will hopefully see a situation where Timorese workers who are paid only $3 a day for a 12-hour day will not have to strike to demand a minimum wage of $10 a day for a nine-hour day, including a onehour lunch break. So what we have is a brand new nation with minimal infrastructure and with no administrative structure, but with hundreds of thousands of people with passion and compassion determined to forge their own destiny. These people are encouraged and inspired by the leadership of Xanana Gusmao and Jose Ramos Horta. Australia is spending nearly $75 million this year in a program of assistance for the East Timorese. This money is provided through our overseas aid program to help in their independence and future development. The funding will help provide for repatriation and resettlement and for the materials needed to rebuild this nation. We are also providing financial support for emergency health, nutrition, water and sanitation programs for the people of East Timor, who will be able to continue to develop these programs as they establish their economic independence with the assistance of the revenues which will come to them in relation to this bill. I take the opportunity on this International Women’s Day, which celebrates the activities and the aspirations of women around the world, to pay tribute to the women of East Timor in their pursuit of peace, economic and political stability and a sustainable, secure future for their families and their communities. Women have always played a positive role in the rebuilding of communities. Women understand the need for healthy food for their families and children, untainted water for them to drink and shelter so that the children of East Timor can be nurtured in a caring environment where it is possible for them to become future leaders. 14236 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 2000 As the nearest developed nation to East Timor, Australia has the responsibility to facilitate the distribution of the potential wealth from the Timor Gap petroleum fields. We must remember that world attention will continue to be diverted away from the plight of a small new Asian-Pacific nation when other humanitarian crises occur. Just this week the international media has focused on the tragedy occurring in Mozambique due to the massive floods. When international attention is diverted, it remains our responsibility to bring forward and facilitate the self-development and welfare of the East Timor nation. A smooth process of transition for arrangements relating to the resources in the Timor Gap will make an invaluable contribution to the economic viability of East Timor by giving investors the confidence to proceed. Australia’s role is to ensure that East Timor has a tangible measure of economic self reliance, not just political independence. If we cannot ensure that East Timor benefits from the wealth of the Timor Gap oilfields, we will sentence East Timor to an indefinite period of dependence on overseas assistance and aid. Arrangements) Bill 2000. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Petroleum (AustraliaIndonesia Zone of Cooperation) Act 1990 and related acts to reflect the fact that the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, UNTAET, has replaced Indonesia as Australia’s partner in the regulation and administration of petroleum operations in the Timor Gap. In a press release dated 10 February this year, Foreign Minister Downer and Industry Minister Minchin indicated that, in talks in Jakarta in early February, Indonesian government representatives had agreed that, following the separation of East Timor from Indonesia, the area covered by the treaty was now outside Indonesia’s jurisdiction and the treaty ceased to be in force as between Australia and Indonesia when Indonesian authority over East Timor was transferred to the United Nations. UNTAET, acting on behalf of East Timor, has agreed to assume all the rights and obligations previously exercised by Indonesia under the Timor Gap Treaty. This was formalised through an exchange of notes between Australia and UNTAET on 10 February 2000. This interim agreement is without prejudice to the position of the future government of the independent East Timor. Long-term arrangements over the Timor Gap, between the new independent government of the new state of East Timor and the Commonwealth of Australia, have yet to be determined. Those changes, when they do occur, will be reflected in subsequent amendments to this legislation. The bill before us is consistent with Labor’s approach to the future of the Timor Gap which was enunciated by the shadow foreign minister, Mr Brereton, in September 1998 and elaborated subsequently in statements of January 1999. Enactment of this legislation is critical in terms of the long-term economic viability of East Timor. So far, it is estimated that over $US700 million has been spent on petroleum exploration and development in area A of the Timor Gap zone of cooperation since the treaty entered into force in 1991. The first commercial oil production commenced in July 1998, and both Australia and East Timor are presently being remunerated at a rate of approximately $US3 million per annum as a consequence of that development. It is expected, or at least it is hoped, that there will be commercial development soon of the Bayu-Undan and Sunrise-Troubador gas condensate fields. If this occurs, the investment will be considerable; and it is estimated that, subject to the magnitude of that investment, several tens of millions of dollars per annum to both East Timor and Australia will flow as a consequence of that regime for a period of up to 10 to 20 years, starting as early as the year 2004. This brings me to the related question of East Timor’s long-term economic development requirements and Australia’s role in that regard. I would argue that there are principles which should govern this nation’s future aid relationship with the emerging independent state of East",142,Representatives Main Committee
225,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (10.58 A.m.),"I rise in support of the Timor Gap Treaty (TransitionalWednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14237 Timor. The first is a simple one, but one which we will need to remind ourselves of in the years ahead, in this parliament and as a country. It is simply this: let us not forget East Timor as it slides from national and international attention, as it ceases to be newsworthy in the international news media, as it drops from the attention span of voting publics across the world; we must never forget East Timor. There are two reasons why we should not do so. One, of course, is a universal moral obligation which we have, given our historical engagement in East Timor, both in World War II and most recently. The second is what John Stuart Mill would describe as enlightened self-interest. East Timor lies within the immediate sphere of strategic interest of the Commonwealth of Australia, and it is in this nation’s interest to ensure that there is a smooth and proper path of economic development in that newly independent state so close to our northern borders. That is the first principle. If there is a second principle which should govern our future aid relationship with East Timor, it is this: we should learn from our experience with Papua New Guinea; we should not repeat the mistakes which both sides of politics in this country, when they have been the government of this country, have made in our national aid relationship with Papua New Guinea. I believe there is a bipartisan view across this parliament that there have been huge errors in our aid relationship with Papua New Guinea since 1975-76. A large part of those errors lay in the extent to which we have dedicated historically large resources to the delivery of budgetary aid for the government of PNG. We must intelligently and in a focused way research, understand and learn from the lessons of that aid relationship experience. We must not repeat the mistake with the new emerging government of the independent state of East Timor of delivering quantities, let alone large quantities, of direct budgetary assistance. Before talking about the parameters which should govern our overall financial commitment to the future aid and economic development requirements of East Timor, we should focus on what, in fact, such a program of economic development should be. I draw the attention of honourable members to a very useful paper recently drafted and presented on this topic by Colin Barlow at the Australian National University and simply entitled, Development of East Timor. It is worth the attention of honourable members and the House in terms of some of the observations which Mr Barlow makes. I believe that, when we construct our future aid program for East Timor, we should focus on three simple principles. The first is human capacity building. The record of the Portuguese in this period over nearly five centuries was a poor one indeed. some view that there was some previous halcyon period in the political and economic evolution of East Timor-there was none. In fact, we can find extraordinary parallels between the absence of the development of the civil society of East Timor during the period of the Portuguese occupation and that which also occurred in Macau. If you looked at the different states, for example, of political evolution in Hong Kong versus Macau, you can see quite a different culture at work in the sophistication and the maturation of the local civil society in those entities by the time they returned to Chinese rule most recently. The Portuguese colonial record in East Timor exhibits all the hallmarks and much worse than we saw in their occupation of Macau. In the period since 1975, the record in terms of human capacity building during Indonesia’s occupation was not much better. Of course, most recently what we have seen is the wanton destruction of the physical infrastructure necessary to provide such basic things as education and training opportunities to this new and exceptionally young nation state-both in age of the nation state and age of the population of that nation state, that we see in East Timor. Australia’s aid effort should therefore have as one of its first focuses, human capacity building through rebuilding and",146,Representatives Main Committee

I am pleased to note that AusAID, so far, has indicated that that is also one of its priorities. A second governing principle as far as our future aid relationship with East Timor is concerned should be the rebuilding and the construction afresh of the physical infrastructure of that economy. Again, we have seen graphically through the television news the wanton destruction across East Timor in the period following the independence ballot in early September last year. The requirement for the physical construction of roads, electricity infrastructure, water infrastructure and basic sanitation, all the things we take for granted in the operation of a modern nation state, let alone a developing nation state, lie as large challenges for this emerging new society. They become the building blocks for subsequent economic development. The operation of market forces in an economy so impoverished as East Timor is unlikely to generate this sort of basic economic infrastructure. If we reflect on the economic developments of this country-particularly in the 19th century, the laying out of the rail infrastructure, the establishment of the electricity grid and the establishment of the water reticulation systems of the country-we see that they were not in the main provided by private operators operating within competitive markets. By and large they were laid down by the state. They are the basic tools and building blocks through which subsequent economic development, hopefully based on a properly operating and competitive market economy, subsequently occurs. The third focus should be institution building. This is probably the most difficult of all. It relates to comments I have just made about the extraordinary period of Portuguese colonial occupation. There was no emerging civil society in this Portuguese colony. In the period of Indonesia’s occupation, civil society consisted of how best to organise a revolutionary or independence movement in order to replace the Indonesian occupation. The challenge facing the new and emerging government of East Timor is to construct, almost afresh, the civil society of that country. I am optimistic that the role of the Catholic Church in East Timor will be one of leadership in doing that. But the construction of a normal political exchange between competitive political parties in a normal electoral processsomething which we have taken for granted in this country for the last 150 years-is something which is not taken for granted in East Timor. The assumptions which underpin our political process in this country are not alive in East Timor. Therefore, the challenge we face of how specifically to assist and construct indigenous organisations which can implant the basic principles of a normally functioning civil and political society must remain the third focus of what we seek to do in that country. I repeat, as I said at the outset, that we must avoid like the plague the delivery of unqualified budgetary aid to the emerging government of East Timor. Our aid must be delivered with a clear orientation towards the three focuses to which I have just referred. Related to the economic development requirements of East Timor is, of course, the associated development requirements of West Timor, which is still part of Indonesia and part of NTT province. I visited West Timor last November and it was an extraordinary experience. AlreadyI have presented a report on that visit to the House of Representatives. The problem faced by the government of NTT province is simply this: subsequent to the independence of East Timor, NTT province became Indonesia’s poorest province. The resource base of that provincial administration is appallingly thin. They have a small population, somewhere between two to three million, to which has been added, since the events of September last year, an additional 200,000-plus refugees from East Timor. Some of those have returned, but a large number still remain there. Wednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14239 Practical needs such as the provision of health services, housing services and expanded economic infrastructure are being felt keenly by the administration of that province. In my discussions with the provincial governor in Kupang in November, it was plain that, given the limited financial resources available to what is a very small provincial administration within what is already a stretched national fiscal environment, this administration was facing real challenges in meeting the new needs and the new dislocations caused by the influx of people from the east. I am also pleased to note that AusAID, in its involvement in the delivery of our historical aid program to NTT province, plans to continue and I hope expand that aid delivery program. Not only is that necessary, given the large influx of refugees into West Timor; it is also desirable given the benefit which such a continued program would give to our overall bilateral relationship with Jakarta. If you are looking at the world from Jakarta’s perspective, it is worthwhile to take note of the fact that when they in Jakarta see a large delivery of aid programs into East Timor to build the new nation state, which is entirely appropriate, they often ask where is the parallel international interest in the remaining 206 million people of the Indonesian republic, many of whom exist in dire poverty-and West Timor, NTT province, is the most impoverished part of that republic. On the question of the refugees themselves in West Timor, I spent some time last November visiting a large number of the camps. The conditions in those camps then were appalling. Since the commencement of the wet season, they are trebly appalling. In the report that I presented to the parliament last November, I warned of the likelihood of large-scale mortality among children, in particular. Regrettably, that prediction has proven in large part to be correct. When I visited Jakarta again three to four weeks ago and asked for a briefing from the international aid agencies in Jakarta about the state now in the refugee camps, the picture which emerged was still a disturbing one. We have had between November and March some hundreds of deaths in camps, 80 per cent of those deaths being children under the age of five. The principal cause of death in those camps was malnutrition. There are multiple causes as to why this is occurring. It is not that the international aid agencies have been derelict in delivering large quantities of food aid, in particular, to the authorities in Kupang and seeking to distribute them. The problem at heart has still been the attitude of local TNI supported and part supported militia commanders who have prevented the effective distribution of that food aid into the camps where the food is most needed. This is an appalling tragedy when you see it happen-the food delivered to local distribution points but not getting to kids who need it 200 metres up the road. It is therefore important, as I said before about the diminution of international interest and attention in East Timor, that simultaneously we do not forget West Timor and the 100,000 plus refugees who, as we sit in this chamber today, languish in camps. Part of the reason lies in the need to impose proper authority from Jakarta on the military commanders in West Timor to ensure that militia commanders are removed from what remaining political control they have over some of the camps there. Part of it lies in ensuring that a continued quantity and quality of aid delivery occurs. I repeat, and I will say it throughout this year, that we must not forget them because the fact that they exist in those camps is a direct consequence of the foreign policy actions of this government and the reaction to those actions by the Indonesian government in the events of last September. Finally, it is important to reflect on where all this stands in our overall relationship with the new government of Indonesia. It is important, in delivering aid programs of this nature and in our deliberations on the Timor Gap Treaty, that we are mindful of how that relationship now develops. A couple of weeks ago in JakartaI spoke at a conference hosted by the University of Indonesia on rebuilding the bilateral relationship between Australia and that country. 14240 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 2000 Foreign Minister Shihab also spoke at that conference and delivered a positive and encouraging address. The conclusion I drew from that conference was that, in terms of rebuilding our relationship, the central problem is not so much Timor itself. If you look at the recent policy pronouncements coming out of Jakarta-the beginning of the normalisation of the role of the military in Indonesian politics and, subsequently, President Wahid’s reconciliation visit to Dili-you can see that the wise policies pursued by President Wahid are pointed in the direction of normalising the role of the military, asserting normal civilian control of the administration of that country, which means that there is associated with that a recognition that the Timor matter is now dealt with. Let us hope that that process of civilianisation of the military continues. Regrettably-and this comment is somewhat partisan; I do not often make partisan comments in foreign policy debates-the clear perception emerging across Indonesian political elites on all sides of politics is that the single central impediment to the normalisation of the Indonesian relationship with Australia is their perception of our Prime Minister, Mr Howard. The Indonesian government, under President Wahid, knows this country well and knows it better than any other administration which has preceded it. President Wahid has personally visited here many times. He has many friends in this country and has two members of his staff who have lived and worked here for something like a decade between them. Therefore, what passes for domestic debate in this country is known well beyond our borders. It is read and studied carefully within the councils of government in Jakarta. They know the full texture and depth of the Prime Minister’s statement last year through the Bulletin magazine-the so-called Howard doctrine-and asked themselves this question: what does this signify in terms of Australia's future intentions vis-a-vis Indonesia? They read, and have read carefully, the statements made during the last several years by the Prime Minister on the question of Hansonism and his Voltairean defence of Pauline Hanson’s particular views on interracial harmony. They are also aware of the Prime Minister's contribution to the immigration debate of the late 1980s. All these form a picture in the minds of the new government of Indonesia that this Prime Minister is not serious about Asia or, in fact, has a sceptical view of it. I make these remarks with a degree of seriousness. I do not make them flippantly and I do not make them as some sort of polemic in an overall foreign policy debate, but they are core to our desire to build a future relationship, a new relationship, with Indonesia. Indonesia was often used as an example of an unfair treaty. Everything that seemed to be wrong with that relationship between Australia and Indonesia seemed to be symbolised by that treaty. Some argued that it should not have been entered into or it should have been entered into with Portugal. At this stage, let me reinforce the view, regarding Portugal, of my colleague the member for Griffith. The Portuguese were in Timor for over 400 years but they did very little and it has always, even with the debates over the years about Timor, somewhat amused me that the Portuguese took the high moral ground. The Portuguese have no reason to take any high moral ground on their role in Timor. On Monday, in tabling the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report on the visit to East Timor last December, I said: Geography and history dictate that we will have a close relationship with this new nation, but it will be a nation whose destiny will be decided by the Timorese. This bill we are debating today will confirm that statement in more ways than one. It is one of the reasons why the opposition supports its introduction. The purpose of the bill is to reflect the fact that the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor-UNTAET-has",147,Representatives Main Committee
228,Mr Hollis (Throsby) (11.15 A.m.),"The Timor Gap Treaty between Australia andWednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14241 replaced Indonesia as Australia’s partner in the regulation and administration of petroleum operations in the Timor Gap. On 26 November 1999, eastern Australian time, Indonesia ceased to exercise sovereign rights in the area covered by the Timor Gap Treaty. UNTAET has agreed, acting on behalf of the new nation of East Timor, to assume all the rights and obligations which were previously the preserve of Indonesia. This has been formalised in the exchange of letters between Australia and UNTAET on 10 February. The bill is consistent with the approach the opposition has advocated on the future of the Timor Gap and announced on a number of occasions by my colleague and shadow minister for foreign affairs, particularly in September 1998 and in January 1999. It should be recognised that my colleague and shadow minister for foreign affairs has led the way in urging Australia’s reaction and renewed policy approach to East Timor both publicly and within the Australian Labor Party. I believe that needs to be recognised, and there is no better time than during this very timely debate. important moment for East Timor. The agreement provides for a simple transition for Indonesia’s exit from the Timor Gap Treaty and for UNTAET’s entry into the treaty relationship with Australia. East Timor’s political leadership has confirmed acceptance of the transition process both publicly and privately. On 18 October last year, Xanana Gusmao said that it was his intention to respect the terms of the treaty. The agreement is an interim measure which is without prejudice. Obviously at some time in the future when East Timor emerges from this important transition stage, the future government of an independent East Timor may wish to conclude longer-term arrangements with Australia. In those circumstances, this bill may require further amendment or new legislation may need introduction into the parliament during this term. This bill reflects a true partnership between Australia and the new nation of East Timor. Australia and East Timor both recognise the important need to maintain stable, uninterrupted operations, revenue flows and continued investment. The bill will contribute to investments certainly in the Timor Gap and for petroleum exploration and development. Over $700 million has already been spent on petroleum exploration and development since the treaty came into force in 1991. This is an important investment to develop a key resource for a new nation aiming to build for itself a new community and economy. In July 1998 the first commercial oil production began with the commissioning of the Elang-Kakatua field. This oil production field generates revenue for both Australia and East Timor of about $3 million a year. I suggest, important as this money may be for Australia, it will be even more important for East Timor. The development and commercial operation of other projects in the zone of cooperation has a potential to generate nearly $15 billion in capital investment. Major onshore facilities near Darwin will be constructed. These oil production fields will provide tens of millions of dollars in revenue to East Timor for decades, beginning in four years time. The Timor Gap Treaty has a great potential to significantly contribute much needed economic development to a struggling new nation. The fact that East Timor did not have an economic base was one of the arguments against East Timor’s independence. It has also been suggested that one of the reasons Australia did not react more strongly when Indonesia invaded Timor in 1975 was that Australia did not want an economically poor and possibly unstable nation on its doorstep. Whether or not that is true is for others to argue, not me. The revenue generated for Australia will also assist us in ensuring economic development and stability in East Timor. Australia has a tremendous obligation to assist this new nation, just two hours flying time away from our northern capital. But this association and assistance must be based on advice 14242 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 2000 from the East Timorese. I have a worry that, because there are so many aid agencies in Timor-and it seems that every aid agency in Australia has to have a presence in Timor, even if only for domestic reasons of fundraising-there will inevitably be an amount of duplication in the work provided. It must be stressed-and this is a point that the member for Griffith was also making-that anything relating to aid or revenue in Timor must be Timorese led. I think it is very important to always respect the sovereignty of East Timor. In our troop commitments of September last year following the mindless violence of the independent ballot, Australia finally began to repay a historic debt. Today Australia must continue support. We must and we will. But, as I said before, it must be Timorese led. We must respect their sovereignty. What we do not want there is a mini Australia. We want a sovereign, independent Timorese nation and I believe our treaty obligations will help that process. The estimated cost for Australia to assist East Timor is already on the public record, outlined in the Prime Minister’s ministerial statement of last November. The total cost for 1999-2000 to 2002-03 is expected to be over $3 billion. The changes reflected in the bill can provide a continuity in both countries’ arrangements in the Timor Gap Treaty and confirms actions taken by the Timor Gap Ministerial Council and the joint authority since late October last year. The bill also includes a continuation of other arrangements in our taxation, customs, immigration, crime and quarantine legislation which Australia has linked with operations in the Timor Gap. Many of us in this place and, indeed, in the wider community, have been legitimately critical of elements of the Indonesian military and of the government over recent months. Some of us have been critical of Indonesia for much longer, since the invasion of East Timor in 1975 and its incorporation as Indonesia’s 27th province in July 1976. But I think it is fair to say that just as Indonesia under new President Wahid is mending bridges there, it is equally true that everyone in this parliament will want good and friendly relationships between Australia and Indonesia. This bill and the arrangements it confirms could have been made more difficult had Indonesia insisted on keeping its claims under the treaty even after it ceased to exercise rights over East Timor. A number of Indonesian politicians from West Timor argued that Indonesia should continue to retain a share of the revenue from operations in the Timor Gap. However, such calls came to nothing when Indonesia made clear that its exit from East Timor also meant an exit from the treaty relationship with Australia, and we support this. The opposition provides bipartisan support for this important bill. It reflects the transitional nature of the political and economic developments now under way in the world’s most infant of new nations. Following the departure of UNTAET, East Timor’s leadership and government are free to pursue aspects of this treaty and establish long-term arrangements. This is appropriate. East Timor should not be held ransom to a small economic base. The Timor Gap and the petroleum resource there must be available for East Timor’s development and for the Timorese. Australia and East Timor are now linked forever. We should show our goodwill and optimism about our close relationship by this bill. The Timorese have paid a very high price for their independence, but I would like to echo the words of my colleague the member for Griffith, especially in regard to aid and the lessons that we should learn regarding aid from PNG. When our delegation came back from PNG our report said that we should exit from the budget support aspect of our aid to PNG-which I always thought was wrong. We must never get into that situation, as he said, with the same arrangements with Timor. Despite revenue from the Timor Gap there will be a responsibility for Australia to continue to give aid. I think that when Timor goes off the world map, as it inevitably will, it will be left to Australia. Wednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14243 Australia will continue to be the main contributor to aid there, and rightly so. My hope is that with this legislation we will maintain a good, strong, friendly relationship with Timor and quickly restore the good relations we have enjoyed for some time with Indonesia, especially now that an impediment to that relationship in Timor itself has been removed. The opposition, as all the speakers have indicated, strongly support this bill and I commend it to the chamber. and Resources) (11.31 a.m.)-in reply-I thank the opposition for their support on this important bill, the Timor Gap Treaty (Transitional Arrangements) Bill 2000, enabling the smooth process to give effect under Australian legislation to the new treaty arrangements. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Act 1990. The bill provides both Australia and East Timor with an important bilateral treaty to ensure security for oil and gas exploration and development in an area of proven great potential by providing continuity and certainty in the legal arrangements for existing and future commercial operators in the Timor Gap zone of cooperation. We have watched the tragic destruction in East Timor unfold following the ballot last year, and it is an honour for me to have carriage of this bill, as it plays a significant role in assisting East Timorese rebuild their lives and the economic future of their country. The treaty is no less important for Australia. The zone has proven its resource potential and the treaty signed by UNTAET on behalf of East Timor on 10 February will provide a smooth and seamless transition for the treaty arrangements, especially for the petroleum company’s rights and obligations under the treaty. I take this opportunity to thank the officials of my department and the department of foreign affairs who facilitated, with their Indonesian counterparts, Indonesia’s disengagement from the treaty. I also thank the member for Kingsford-Smith for his strong support of this legislation. Unfortunately, I do not have on hand today the detailed information he seeks in relation to the talks and agreement made by officials on behalf of all parties. I will however forward the relevant information following this debate. I also thank the members for Blair, Petrie, the Northern Territory, Charlton, Griffith and Throsby for their contributions in the debate today. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to House without amendment Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 February, on motion by Mr Truss: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr O’CONNOR (Corio) (11.34 a.m.)-The Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Amendment (Funding and Wool Tax) Bill 2000 continues the process of reform of this very important industry to rural and regional Australia. I acknowledge the presence in the chamber today of the honourable member for Wannon who has a deep and abiding interest in this particular industry. He warned me not to get fired up on the industry, so I will not do that in this debate today. However, I remind him that the stockpile is still there. It is an issue that still has to be dealt with by the industry. I will now turn to the legislation that is before us. The opposition does not intend to oppose the legislation that is before the parliament. The bill is part of the government’s response to the recommendations of the Future Directions Taskforce chaired by Ian McLachlan. That taskforce recommended, among other things, the establishment of a new company to commission wool innovation for the maximum benefit of",150,Representatives Main Committee
229,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science14244 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 2000 wool growers. The company would be established as a conventional company with shares issued to growers in proportion to their compulsory wool levy contributions, would be commercially focused with its key attributes being innovation, implementation and customer service, would have a mixture of commercial and levy funded activities and would be controlled by a newly formed board of directors with wide commercial experience. This bill will allow the minister, through the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, recommended by the taskforce. Let us cast our minds back to that very historical day in November 1998-when I had just come to assume the shadow ministerial portfolio responsibilities for agriculture-to the AGM of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, at which a resolution of no confidence was passed. That vote of no confidence was a watershed in the history of this industry: out of it came the formation, in December 1998, of the Wool Industry Future Directions TaskForce, chaired by a former minister of the government, the prominent South Australian wool grower, Ian McLachlan. The taskforce reported to the government in July 1999. In response, the government formed a working party which has conducted the WoolPoll 2000 survey of wool growers throughout Australia to gauge their views on how research and development moneys should be raised and spent. The working party produced a series of propositions on those levy funding alternatives, which have been put to wool growers. One important recommendation of the taskforce was the establishment of a new organisation designed to promote innovation and commercialisation in the wool industry; that is the subject of the legislation that we have before us today. The working party identified some key issues. Some related to innovation and commercialisation but one related specifically to the empowerment of wool growers by assisting them to take control not only of their businesses but of their industry. It is a subject of some concern to me that, given the quite contentious and rather intense debate within the wool industry itself about its future, there has not been a greater response to WoolPoll 2000 on the part of wool growers. I understand that farmers are busy, I understand the requirements of their business, but at the end of the day, although growers can argue that governments ought to get out their way and get out of their business, it is very important for the industry and growers in it to cooperate with government when it attempts through a poll to genuinely gauge their attitudes to a very important aspect of their industry operation. I am referring to how moneys are going to be raised to fund research and development activities and the direction of those research and development activities once that money is raised. I commend the government for taking the initiative to consult wool growers on the future of their industry. It seems that governments of all political persuasions at state and federal level have been conducting polls lately, and I refer to the polls that have been conducted within the dairy industry, both in New South Wales and in Victoria. These, I think, are honest attempts by government to gauge the feeling on the ground of farmers. But they are like everything else-they ought not to be the sole determinants of a policy direction, because often the information may be made available to producers but not digested sufficiently for them to make an informed judgment on the propositions that are before them. In the case of the wool growers and the Wool Working Party, the propositions that were put to wool growers were quite impressive. I commend the work of Dr John Keniry, the Chairman of the Wool Working Party, for the documentation that was put before growers on the funding options that might be available to them. The industry has not responded as we might have wanted it to do because the particular area that they were asked to pass judgment on is one that is critical to the future of the wool industry in Australia. The working party identified four core business and service areas that needed to be addressed. Without going into them all, I want to make comment on one in particular, and that Wednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14245 relates to innovation, research, development and delivery. As a general proposition, I think it is fair to say the cutting edge of Australian agriculture in this millennium will be driven by research and development and by innovation. It is rather disappointing, if we look generally across the spectrum of industry research and development in Australia, to see the very poor performance and guardianship of this very important aspect of our economic development by this government. I will not quote the figures here today because they are well known in the parliament, but it is quite an appalling record for a nation that is seeking to propel its economic development off the back of the skills development and certainly of the research, development and commercialisation of new innovative technologies, not only in manufacturing industries but in agriculture industries as well. I think it is acknowledged generally in the wool industry that there are some-if I could call them this-cultural obstacles to change. The McLachlan taskforce was about propelling the industry to change its cultural outlook to come to grips with some of the inhibitors that were holding the industry back from progressing and growing. It identified innovation, research and development as critical elements of the future of this particular industry. That taskforce identified, very importantly, the place of on farm research as well as off farm research in the manufacturing chain for wool. As far as on farm research is concerned, it is very important to dairy farmers-I mean to wool growers. My apologies, Madam Deputy Speaker, I have just come out of the main chamber debating the dairy bills. There was no offence meant there to wool growers. On farm research and development will have positive impacts for wool growers because that research and development can be directly linked to the profitability of enterprises. When that on farm research takes place we start getting the shift in the culture that is required to ensure that farmers open their minds up to new possibilities, look for new ways and are more receptive to the introduction of new technologies. The wool industry is a case in point because surveys indicate that where wool growers have adapted and applied those new technologies, where they have been receptive to the application of information and other technologies, these growers invariably run more profitable enterprises. So we can actually make a direct link between the outlook of the farmer, his capacity to undertake and join in partnerships in on farm R&D, and the eventual profitability of the enterprise. Of course, off farm research is very important as well-the post-farmgate area; the textile sector R&D, the processing sector. The efficiencies there are important to the general efficiencies that are developed within the chain of production for this particular product. Of course, in my electorate and in the electorate of the honourable member for Wannonand we are joined in the chamber today by a great supporter of the wool industry, the honourable member for Lyons and, I am sorry, I absolutely throw myself on the ground for omitting the honourable member for Hinkler in this discussion-we all know very well that wool plays an essential and important place in the local economy. We all know very well the part played by Geelong in the history of wool. We are a hub for the transportation and storage of wool. There is a productive hinterland in the Western District and in the outer fringes of my electorate where there are very important wool growing areas. Of course, the port of Geelong is a major bulk handling port-the biggest bulk handling port in the Southern Hemisphereand it is over that wharf that wool production goes. We have in Geelong the National Wool Museum, a very advanced museum and very well patronised, not only by the people of Geelong but by people from throughout Australia. We have also the CSIRO Division of Wool Technology where research is conducted into the wool industry. In the processing sector we have Godfrey Hirst, Brintons Carpets and Australian 14246 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 2000 Wool Combing located in my electorate. So we really are the wool capital of Australia and we are quite proud of that fact. Let me pay tribute here to a gentleman who passed away in 1999, Mr George McKendrick of Godfrey Hirst. There was no greater supporter of the wool industry than George McKendrick. He would not mind me saying that he was a cowboy from the old school, but he had the interests of this industry at heart and passionately believed that Australia ought to build its value adding capacity, and build it quickly. He put his money where his mouth was, the money that he and his family accumulated through this industry, and he grew this enterprise in Geelong from almost nothing to where it now employs over 1,100 people. Geelong mourned his passing, and the industry did as well. I was walking down the street the other day and I passed a retail outlet called Juswool. It prompted me to go in and have a cup of tea with the proprietor, a person who I have not seen for some time, Hedley Earl of Hedrena Textiles. Mr Neville interjecting Mr O’CONNOR-The honourable member for Hinkler is showering accolades on me today, just as I am on him. I popped in for a cup of tea with Hedley Earl because I had not seen him for a long while. When I was on the staff of Senator John Button, we assisted Hedrena Textiles in the infancy stages of the business. Hedley Earl was a producer of fine wool and at the time was manufacturing fine woollen baby blankets and dressing gowns. He has now moved-and honourable members will be interested in this-into the area of fine woollen underwear for both men and women. I purchased a pair of socks there the other day. They are top of the range and quite expensive, but for well-worn feet like mine, feet that have done some miles, they are a beautiful product to wear. I congratulate Mr Earl because at one time this particular entrepreneur used to get in his car and travel around rural and regional Victoria and New South Wales to retail outlets to get his product into the marketplace. I would suggest he has made it now in one sense in that he has opened a retail outlet in the centre of Melbourne where the product is being snapped up by international visitors. They cannot get enough of it. He did have some harsh things to say about the impact of the GST on his business. I should just remind the House of that. We ought not gild the lily. The hard work of this entrepreneur is going to be burdened by the introduction of the GST. I will not go into the details of that but certainly it will happen where his product is going into the domestic market. He could not get the quality servicing here in the Australian market, so he had to have the fine wool processed in Germany. When it comes back over the wharf, he will be required to pay a GST. As the product is on-processed very carefully, it can take many months before the product gets into the marketplace and, of course, he is going to have to carry the burden of the GST like many other businesses around Australia. Frankly, I have a great deal of sympathy for these small business people, who are trying to create jobs, because the GST is a job crusher. It is as simple as that. It is a job crusher. They try as hard as they can to generate jobs in this particular industry but along comes the government with a 1960s tax to burden them with compliance costs. Of course, all the money that has to go out to prepare for the GST I would imagine could, in the case of that particular business, go into promoting the product, getting more sales, securing his supply and securing the future of wool growers in the meantime. In conclusion, might I reflect on the outlook for wool in the coming years. I noted with interest the assessments and the forecasts that were made at the Outlook conference recently. There is some potential for prices to increase in the short and medium term and I think wool growers will generally welcome that development. We have seen a strengthening of demand in the Asian markets, especially in South Korea and Chinese Taipei. Of course, China, which Wednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14247 had a slowing of its growth, is still in there as a significant buyer of Australian wool. We are seeing signs of a resurgence in the Japanese economy and that is very important to the demand for apparel. We have had some very interesting markets come on line for wool in recent times. India is emerging as a very important market. We are securing some interesting markets in Turkey as well. How are wool growers going to respond to these developments? I guess over the long term we cannot expect a real or substantial strengthening in demand domestically but certainly the rise in prices will be moderated by the fact that the industry is holding significant stocks on farm and in brokerage houses around the nation. This particular legislation also allows the government to set the rate of wool tax in accordance with the wishes of growers as they were indicated in the wool poll ballot. That ballot concluded on 3 March if memory serves me well-and these days, at my age, with overload, sometimes it does not serve me well but I certainly remember the policy omissions of this particular government. I think the results of this particular poll will be known late this month, around 23 or 24 March. This particular legislation will enable the minister and the government to set the rate of wool tax in accordance with the wishes of growers that were expressed in that poll. In conclusion, let me say once again to wool growers in this fine industry: you have an industry which I honestly believe the current government believes in, as does the opposition. We see potential for growth here. But, as night turns to day, there will be many people in the industry who will be prepared to attack the government, regardless of its political persuasion, for the initiative that it mounts in that particular industry. I do believe that this government is motivated by a desire to see this industry grow, restructure and refocus its efforts in the sorts of ways that were outlined in the McLachlan report. We concur with many of those recommendations in the way these changes will encourage the industry’s development over time. Having said that, it is up to wool growers themselves to participate fully when the opportunities are given to them in good faith by the government. I think that needs to be said. I would encourage wool growers who have not participated in this poll to examine why they have not and perhaps make it their business to keep themselves informed of the developments in this industry and its structure as those changes occur. They need to keep themselves up to speed, keep an interest in their industry and keep abreast of what is being done by the industry and by governments of all political persuasions, who genuinely want this industry to grow and to be restored to its pre-eminent place in Australian agriculture. Madam Deputy Speaker, the opposition will not be opposing the bill. with misleading this chamber on the whole question of how the GST is going to work and how, in fact, it will benefit wool growers, processors and others in the wool industry, including Mr Earl.

231,Mr Hawker,"He should know, of course, that the GST can be claimed back. Again, he14248 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 2000 Geelong at this late hour really is insulting. Of course, as he would know, we have events like Sheep Vention there and it is a national focus. I would make one other observation. When the member for Corio talked about the implications of this WoolPoll, the results are not binding on the government, although I would expect the government would take very strong note of what they have to say. I also want to remind him that his approach is the typical Labor approach of, ‘We know best.’ Yet, when you look at the time the Labor Party were in government and their changes to the Wool Marketing Act 1987, we saw-not by design maybe, but by effect-the worse agricultural marketing disaster of this century. When we look at the problems of wool growers today, we can trace them right back to what happened in 1987 with the Wool Marketing Act. You can see it was the Labor government that brought in this change which then led to the accumulation of a 4½ million bale stockpile. Mr O’Connor-You’ve got blood on your hands. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-Order! The member for Corio has had his chance. innocently and say, ‘We support wool growers,’ but you have a bit of form on this, mate, and some of us have a long memory. This bill will allow the government to implement the results of the wool poll. The member for Corio mentioned how far the wool poll has gone. The latest figures I have indicate that something like 22,400 wool growers out of a total of 46,000 have voted. That is nearly 50 per cent. There are still some votes believed to be in the post, so obviously the number will be a bit higher. But I think it is also significant to note, although we are not sure at this stage, that we will probably find that those growers who have voted will in fact represent well over 70 per cent of wool production. The significant point about this is that those who have a primary focus on wool growing have taken the trouble to register-have taken an interest in what the future is. I would suggest-although I do not have evidence as such-that the majority of those who have not voted probably see wool as a sideline to prime lambs or as only a small part of their farming output and therefore do not see this as significant an issue as those who have a primary focus on growing wool. I am not criticising those for not voting but I am saying that those who are vitally interested in the future as their primary focus have taken the trouble to register their interest. What is important when we look at what we are really debating here is how the government is setting about implementing changes for the wool industry. Already we have seen a very major change in moving to the privatisation of the stockpile through WoolStock Australia, and the change from Wool International to WoolStock, I think, is already starting to show some real benefits. Not only will it allow growers ultimately to get some direct reward for having carried that stockpile for so long and having paid the cost-and it is important to remember that growers have had a very big burden over the last decade in financing that stockpile-but also we are seeing the development of some marketing skills through WoolStock Australia which will be developed for the benefit of the industry. While it is true that the stockpile, once sold, will be gone, those who are developing those skills will not necessarily be lost to the industry. That is the first point-that the government has taken this very positive step. The second point, having first of all set up the wool taskforce and now going through the steps of implementing it, is that it is important that we remember what the focus of this is going to be. As Ian McLachlan, who chaired the taskforce-and I believe the report they produced is an outstanding report; that is the only word that could be used for it-pointed out, the new body to replace AWRAP will have a simple mission statement, and that is ‘to",157,Representatives Main Committee
232,Mr Hawker,"It is very easy for the member for Corio to suddenly come in here allWednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14249 commission wool innovation and to commercialise the results for the maximum benefit of members or shareholders, however it is finally structured’. This is a primary focus. I think it shows a big step forward from the diverse range of aims of the former body through the International Wool Secretariat and AWRAP, and I think that confusion often led to a lot of wastage-and I might come back to that if I have time. The other points I think we want to look at are some of the key recommendations in the report. The report puts things in perspective when it makes comments such as ‘When we are dealing with the difficulties facing wool growers there are no magic puddings and there are no messiahs’. I think too often governments and agripoliticians have been guilty of trying to pretend they have solutions when they could not deliver them. It also goes on to point out the need for a fundamental cultural and attitudinal shift amongst wool growers, which I believe is already happening. I think the report has been a great catalyst for this, so that we talk about wool growers individually now and we no longer talk about ‘the wool industry’. One of the great problems has been that, by referring to ‘the wool industry’, it has been too easy for growers to delegate responsibilities that they should have been assuming themselves, and I think we all share in the guilt for that. It is also important, as the report highlights, that we celebrate the diversity of wool, not lament the fact that there is a range of wools produced. In other industries, for example, the wine industry, there is a range of products and everyone celebrates that-sometimes too much, maybe. We nonetheless recognise that that is an important aspect. Hedrena produces a very specialised product and a magnificent product; I will agree with the member for Corio on that. We also recognise that there are other excellent products that can be produced from different types of wool. The other point in the executive summary that I think is very important is that it talks about the success of wool’s future critically depending on continual innovation and its quick implementation. There are examples where some magnificent research has been done, particularly by the CSIRO and others, yet there has been an inordinate delay in the implementation of that research into products. There is no doubt that it is a highly competitive field out there nowadays. If wool is to succeed against other fibres, then it has to be able to make sure that those innovations and research are implemented as quickly as possible. When we talk about the way of the future, I think we have got to recognise that there are not unlimited dollars there. Wool growers are not in a position to fork out large sums, and what dollars are spent have to be focused on results. When you look at the report’s summation of the amount of money that has been spent on research and the promotion of wool over the last 50 years, it is horrifying to think that so much money was spent and the results really are not that significant. There are two other points in the report which I think we should continue to draw attention to that are important and, while they are not part of this bill, I think they are significant in terms of getting a better future for wool. Those were the recommendation by the taskforce about truth in labelling-other products have found that there is a lot of value in that, and I think the wool industry would certainly benefit as well-and also the suggestion that the textile, clothing and footwear strategic investment program be tapped into for some funds for future development of innovative products. I know the minister has been looking at this, but we still have not, at this stage, heard back on what opportunities there might be. It is also important to remind ourselves why some of these changes are needed. If you look at the conclusion of the report, you will see that it makes the point-and we must never forget it-that the Woolmark company has also been a blockage to more effective communication between processors and wool growers. It is a very important point which we should never lose sight of, because there is always a danger that people in that type of body, particularly as it 14250 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 2000 was structured in the past, have a temptation to continue that blockage of information. So we must ensure that that is not allowed to occur. One other point made in the main report is that it is worth looking at the whole question of the costs involved in transport, handling and marketing of wool compared to cotton. It is pointed out that there is something like an 83c a kilogram clean cost differential between wool and cotton. As the report points out: The transport, handling and marketing system from farm to domestic scouring and top making mills or shipped for export has been exhaustively analysed over the last 30 years. Indeed, the degree of scrutiny seems inversely proportional to the changes which have occurred. I think this might sum up some of the problems with the structures we have had in the past. The report also goes on to talk about the cost of contamination, which I think all members will be aware of. In fact, I was a member of a committee that looked at this some years ago. While we have seen some improvements-for example, the introduction of nylon wool packs-I am not sure that we have got it all right yet. In conclusion, I strongly support this bill. It demonstrates that this government is serious about helping the wool industry and the wool growers in particular to get onto a stronger footing for the future. It is another step forward. I believe the changes that have been occurring as a result of the wool taskforce are showing some very positive benefits amongst those who want to continue to have a future as wool growers. I support the bill. I believe it will show some very positive benefits as we continue to develop from this the new structure that will replace AWRAP. We must continue to work through the wool taskforce report and its recommendations because I think they are very soundly based and very well researched. this government for what it is doing for the wool industry. It had many years in government to get involved in innovation and move the wool industry forward. It failed to do that. The Labor Party seems to have been in power when it has needed to assist the wool industry and move it forward to look at innovation. The wool price collapsed because people set the price too high. You know that. It had nothing to do with the minister of the day. The price was set too high by the growers themselves and it is a reflection on that period. The member for Wannon constantly raises this political issue in debates on wool to try and blame Labor for the collapse of the price of wool. This is a furphy and it should be treated as such. It is an untruth and it is something that will not hold up when history is written, as it has been. The Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Amendment (Funding and Wool Tax) Bill 2000 is part of the government’s response to the recommendations of the Future Directions Taskforce chaired by Ian McLachlan. Part of the recommendations from this study was the establishment of a new company to commission wool innovation for the maximum benefit of wool growers. The idea was that it be established as a conventional company, with shares issued to growers in proportion to their compulsory wool levies. It also would seek to be commercially focused and promote innovation, implementation and customer service. It is supposed to be a mixture of commercial and levy funded activities. It will be controlled by a board of directors with wide commercial experience. In September last year, the federal minister announced an eight-point plan of action for implementing the report. One of them was to have an industry wide vote on future industry services and wool tax arrangements in a grower ballot that was to conclude on 25 February of this year. The idea was for growers to have a say up front. Growers were invited to vote on a series of wool service models delivering research and development, and consumer and retail marketing through the new commercially oriented innovation organisation mentioned before. A number of financial models have been developed by the wool working party and independent business analysis consultants KPMG, in liaison with the National Wool growers",158,Representatives Main Committee
233,Mr Adams (Lyons) (12.11 P.m.),"The honourable member for Wannon makes claim forWednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14251 Forum. However, the information about the poll must not be getting through to wool growers, particularly the smaller ones, as reports last week said the response was less than 50 per cent and came mostly from the bigger enterprises. That is a pity. It was a nice idea, but perhaps some growers in the more isolated areas are having difficulties getting onto the Net or getting their communications back. I am not really surprised, as I have been having a number of complaints of late about how tardy Telstra can be when dealing with country problems. One fellow rang me recently to have his phone connected just outside a small town in my electorate, on the east coast of Tasmania. When he had finally got through to someone in Telstra, he was told to wait a month. He did all the digging and preparation himself-still noone. Then someone came out after six weeks, looked at the hole and the house and said no, he could not do it that day. That was just before the weekend. Four days later, with frantic phone calls, he finally got someone to connect him. It took three minutes only, but he had to wait for someone to drive out from the nearest city to put the thing in before driving home again. Total nonsense. Maybe some of the wool growers also are having difficulties with their connections in communications. It reminds me of fleets of Telstra vans coming off the Spirit of Tasmania on a Monday morning and returning on a Friday to Melbourne. What sort of service is going on in this regard? I realise that I digress from the main issue, but this sort of thing makes you wonder how the devil some country businesses survive. It is a pity that some people did not fill in the questionnaire, but it is not surprising in view of some of the difficulties that people have with communications in regional Australia. In the questionnaire it is stated that a vote is not compulsory, but if you do not vote you disenfranchise yourself. I hope all this also went out by snail mail, because people may not have realised what they were supposed to do unless they received a notice in the ordinary mail. I certainly hope that we are not going to see some sort of mess coming out of this voting situation. The voting entitlement is calculated by every $100 that growers paid in wool tax levy during the two financial years ending 30 June 1998 and 30 June 1999 entitling the grower to one vote. The entitlement is based on the total levy paid during those two financial years. For example, if a grower paid $1,040 in 1997-98, this number is rounded up to eligibility for 11 wool poll votes. Likewise, if the grower paid $2,100 in 1998-99, this gives 21 wool poll votes. The big growers are obviously going to have more say than the smaller ones and it is very sad that the small growers are going to be virtually disenfranchised-another blow to the local man on the land, who will be controlled by the big conglomerates and the overseas money, sold out again by the Liberal coalition government. Farmers have reason to complain also about the GST, as the shadow minister rightly said, because of the extra time and the compliance costs of the GST which farmers are just starting to realise are coming upon them after 1 July this year. The bill will allow the government to set the rate of wool tax in accordance with the wishes of growers as indicated in the wool poll ballot. It will also allow the minister, through the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, to meet the costs of establishing a new Australian wool services organisation as recommended by the taskforce. The whole thing is supposed to be in action by 1 January 2001. I would not hold my breath, though. The process seems to be taking an age to go through, because government is not prepared to put any facilitation or funds into it. We have big-noting, big speaking, big speeches up here in the parliament, but, when it comes to putting a bit of money in to assist making this happen, the government has failed the test and is failing the wool growers again. One of the people who did get the information and is helping to promote the idea is an innovative grower in my electorate of Lyons, Clare McShane, of Oaklands. Casaveen 14252 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 2000 Knitwear is now going to the world. Clare was sick of getting low prices for her fine wool and not being able to do anything about it. She developed some downstream processing: she started having her own wool processed and returned to her on the farm. The result is now an internationally renowned company, putting together some great designs of jumpers, cardigans, skirts, scarves, hats, jackets and vests. If you do not believe me, you only have to look as far as the parliamentary shop, which stocks a good selection of Casaveen for overseas visitors and for any locals that wish to take up the opportunity to buy. The business engages 50 contractors using domestic knitting machines and 12 full-time staffers to provide a range of beautiful items. It markets 10,000 garments worth in excess of $1 million and has brought a much needed boost to a small rural community largely dependent, at the moment, on the wool industry. It is innovation, going the new way, the positive way in regional Australia-looking at new ways, looking to move forward, using a very good product. The member for Wannon did mention innovation-he certainly has some very good examples in his own electorate and he should have mentioned more of those-as did the member for Corio, Mr O’Connor, who mentioned the examples that he has. He once showed me some examples of the superfine wool that is made into suits and that comes from that region of Victoria; I think they are called merino suits. I certainly do not knock the idea of having an innovation and marketing levy. In fact, I applaud it. I talked about such a scheme in my first speech in the House, in May 1993, and of the need for brands and labels to help identify regions that are proud of the particular product which they produce but who get no handle on it and have no recognition. That was how the wool industry operated in Australia. Even though we produced the best superfine wool in the world in Tasmania and took the record price every year, with Mr Fuji buying it for his mills in Japan, we really did not get any recognition for growing that superfine wool. There was no flow-back to Tasmania in recognition that this was where superfine wool was grown, because we had no products out of Tasmania made out of the wool that was sold out of Tasmania. It did not come into our tourism thinking or tourism opportunities; it did not come into the value adding of that great product, wool. Of course, that is changing, and this process is helping change it. We certainly need those brands and labels. I remember that in that first speech I made. I talked about going to the Harris isles and seeing the roughest sheep I had ever seen in the world, but I always had in my wardrobe a Harris tweed jacket, like so many other people. You have to establish a brand name and a marketing skill, as with the Donegal cap which hangs on the hook at home. There is a need for us to have a Cressy worsted and Campbell Town tweed to get recognition for that quality wool. This is what will help drive the new regional Australia where wool is grown if we can get it back to where we are using innovation. I hope this proposal works, for the sake of those who have these ideas and want to take them forward. I hope the small grower can contribute and I would like to see some of the retired growers being used for their expertise in making things work during the difficult times. We have a huge expertise tied up in people who do not want to or cannot do the backbreaking work anymore but would jump at a chance to help the industry move forward. There is a whole range of those people. In my own electorate, Ian Downie comes to mind, of Dungrove at Bothwell. He was an innovative farmer during his days-he is in his 70s now-who went to his own breed of sheep, the comio, in the early days. He has now passed on his property to Peter, his son, who is doing enormously new innovative things with forestry and forest farming. We need to have the expertise of people like Ian Downie being used in the new thinking. Youth and energy harnessed to experience and common sense can make some great things happen. It does not need much to make those sorts of things occur, just a little bit of pulling together and recognition that those people exist. Wednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14253 Just coming back to the actual GST compliance cost for farmers, there has been nothing released but I guess it is going to be a substantial sum and that will hit some of these innovative ideas. Therefore, the GST is not going to do any favours for regional Australia, and that should be given some consideration. We on the Labor side will be giving support to the bill, and I wish growers all the best for the future development of this great industry, the wool industry. Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Amendment (Funding and Wool Tax) Bill 2000 today because I come from that great state, Western Australia, which has been a very major producer of wool for this nation. In fact, I also represent the electorate of Pearce, which has been a significant contributor to wool production in the state of Western Australia. I always get a little concerned to hear the kinds of comments made by my colleague the member for Lyons, because it is a very negative ‘can’t do’ approach to things. It is a sort of cynical, negative approach to this issue. If this country is to position itself as one of the leaders in marketing its products in a global marketplace we have to have a positive ‘can-do’ attitude. We have to be able to leave the past behind and move into the future. Indeed, that is what this bill does because the government has managed to draw together some of the best expertise this country has to develop the future directions paper and the WoolPoll 2000 documentation that came as a result of that. We are fortunate indeed to have not only the expertise that has driven that process but also the expertise of growers and others in the industry who are now going to be pivotally involved in ensuring a strong future for the development and production of wool and, of course, for its marketing, both domestically and internationally. I could not help but reflect that Australia has had a history where all Australian people have benefited greatly because of the efforts of wool producers. Our country has had that kind of history. However, I could not help but reflect on the fact that life has been pretty tough on the farm over the last decade or so. I do not want to dwell too much on the past because I believe that we have got to move forward. But part of the problem in the wool industry was a government led by a man who said, ‘This is the recession we had to have,’ and, ‘This is as good as it gets.’ It was a government that was not willing to really try to get costs off the backs of producers and ensure that we had a sound and positive marketing process for their product. We have seen a reduction of demand for wool which has resulted in low prices. We have added to that an increased cost of production, the Asian economic crisis, and a stockpile of five million bales of wool in 1990-91. The situation was reaching breaking point for many wool producers in my electorate of Pearce. The falls in the price of wool have been very dramatic. The eastern market indicator fell from 738c a kilo clean in 1997 to 540c in the early 1998-99 period, and prices proceeded to fall under 500c before climbing back up to 534c in early April last year. In 1998-99, the stockpile was about a quarter of the annual production in the past, and production in 1998 was the lowest it had ever been, and it is expected to decrease even further. Having a competent organisation with contemporary ideas and a contemporary approach to managing wool marketing and a business plan for the industry is probably very critical at this point in our history. There is no doubt about that. Governments cannot afford to stand still and do nothing, as we have seen happen in the past. This government, I think, has taken a very positive step toward ensuring a future for this industry. In 1993, the Garnaut review of the wool industry resulted in two new statutory bodies, Wool International and the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. Despite this, the industry still had to go through fairly tortuous times. The role of Wool International",160,Representatives Main Committee
234,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (12.26 P.m.),"I am delighted to be here to speak on the14254 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 2000 was to dispose of the wool stockpile and retire debt. In July 1999 it became a corporate entity, WoolStock Australia, with wool growers becoming the shareholders. The Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation was funded with levies on wool growers, supplemented by a matching contribution by the government. This pays for research and development and, of course, for the Woolmark licence fees. The catalyst for these changes was the growing dissatisfaction felt by wool growers. That led to a vote of no confidence in the board in 1998. Under that regime, wool growers had no control over the management of their industry’s future and they were frustrated over not being able to manage the changing environment. I think that frustration became very evident in recent times. In response to this, the government established the Future Directions Taskforce, which was chaired by the Hon. Ian McLachlan, AO. The conclusion of the taskforce was that the growers needed to take responsibility for the future of wool sales and marketing. I think it is important to once again stress here that we have a vast pool of talent out there in Australia. I think perhaps one of the failings of governments in the past has been not recognising that talent and ability and not employing that expertise to resolve some of the problems. These people, who had all the knowledge about wool and all of the problems associated with growing it and ideas for the future marketing of it, were not being consulted; they did not have a role. I think that is a great travesty. Hopefully, this is going to rectify that situation. The role of the government is really to concentrate on overarching industry reforms and, of course, the levy arrangement. But the principal driving force behind this new entity is going to be the growers themselves and that is a very positive move. Under the present legislation, wool growers are restricted to voting on the rate of wool tax. They cannot have a say in the services they want in return for the wool tax or the level of tax they pay. I cannot see that being a particularly satisfactory arrangement-it is not, and we have seen the evidence that it is not. In December 1999, a working party provided the report to the minister. A voter kit and memorandum were developed, widely disseminated and publicised. Every wool grower has been given the opportunity to cast a vote and to determine the future of their industry, essentially. The bill provides that the minister may take the preferences of wool taxpayers into account, as expressed in WoolPoll 2000, in determining the rate of wool tax in a particular financial year; the minimum rate of wool tax is lowered from 2.5 per cent to zero per cent, effected in both AWRAP and the wool tax acts 1 to 5, to allow the range of options put to growers in WoolPoll 2000-that is, from the current four per cent down to a minimum of zero per cent-to be implemented; AWRAP’s functions are increased to allow it to plan, facilitate and participate in the reform, privatisation or abolition of the organisation, or the establishment of a new body to allow any of these processes to take place. These functions, of course, are constrained by any written direction from the minister. There is no doubt that the government has a responsibility to contribute to these processes and to maintain a close watch over developments in the interests of the growers and in the interests of all Australians. There has been an exhaustive consultation process undertaken, including major peak industry organisations, overseas customers and processors. Voting closed on the 3rd of this month, and it now gives wool growers the opportunity to directly participate in reforming and taking control of the future of their industry. The reality is that, in an increasingly competitive and global marketplace, our wool producers need every single advantage they can get. Someone once said that if you cannot measure, you cannot manage. I think that is pretty wise advice. Research does inform a whole range of issues which are very vital to the success of the sale and production of any product. Knowing the marketplace, understanding what buyers want and being able to respond in a timely way to the requirements of the marketplace are pivotal to our success. Wednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14255 Wool has many advantages as a natural fibre, and we have heard quite a bit about that today. But, like any other product, its disposal needs clear marketing strategies and the industry needs to have a clear vision and goal for the future in order to move forward and meet the new challenges and demands of buyers. I have said many times to my growers that, if your customer wants their wool baled in bales with pink spots, give it to them, as long as they are prepared to pay. I think sometimes we have taken the view that the customer is going to just take our product the way we want to sell it. We are not being responsive enough in a new environment in a new marketplace. We need to take that into account. By giving greater control to the people that grow the wool and know the wool, we should be able to achieve much better outcomes in the future. There is a vast pool of talent and experience within the industry, and that can now be tapped into. We now can ensure that that is used for a good future for growers and their products. The government is acknowledging here that there is expertise out there and that WoolPoll gives maximum opportunity for growers to use that expertise in the most beneficial way. We have been fortunate enough to have the benefit of the experience of my former colleague the Hon. Ian McLachlan and Dr Keniry, who steered these processes together. It is in the interests of all Australians that we understand and acknowledge the importance to Australia of primary production, particularly that of wool, and support the efforts of the producers in determining the future of their industry. been in the doldrums, starting off with some disastrous decisions made by the then Labor Minister for Primary Industry, John Kerin-although I hasten to say that he is not totally to blame for all the woes in the wool industry. The wool industry had in place a reserve price scheme that had pushed the price up too high for the market to be able to support it. In fact, former Minister John Kerin allowed the reserve price to be pushed up too high when he had the power to reject that price. He accepted the advice of the wool growers rather than advice from his own department. The former minister then not only accepted that price of 840c a kilogram but also changed his mind after seeing the effects of that excessive reserve price. He then reduced the reserve price to 700c a kilogram, saying that the new lower reserve price was set in concrete and would not change. But, of course, the market ignored him. Only a few months later, he had to scrap the reserve price scheme altogether. So the market signal sent to the producers was to keep on producing because the reserve price scheme would guarantee a price above the market price. As a result, we had too much wool produced at a price too high to sell, resulting in enormous debts and an enormous stockpile. We, the wool producers and the wool processors, are still paying the price of that inconsistent and disastrous chain of events. The wool processors bought the wool in the belief that its value would be guaranteed by the reserve scheme only to see it scrapped by the Labor government when it became untenable. They lost money. They lost confidence and they lost the desire to continue their involvement. No wonder the wool processors left the industry in droves, thereby reducing the demand for wool even further. It would appear that the wool industry was let down by an inept Labor minister, an inept Labor government and a wool industry that misused the reserve price scheme. The reserve price scheme should only have been allowed to reflect the cost of production and not allowed to try to push the price of wool up. But this is typical of a Labor government and a Labor Party which think the government knows best and the government can set a market. The wool growers themselves must share in that blame because they advised the minister. I, personally, have never believed in reserve price schemes because they corrupt the market. If the reserve price is too high, the market will rebel and simply not pay that price,",163,Representatives Main Committee

Agrarian socialism-or its misnomer, orderly marketing-simply will not work. It took a monumental blunder in the wool industry to prove it to some people, even if those opposite might not have come to accept it, even after seeing a wool industry in dire straits for over a decade now. This government commissioned the McLachlan wool taskforce to come up with some proposals and recommendations to help give direction to wool industry participants. A large part of those recommendations dealt with the wool industry taking responsibility for themselves and reducing government intervention. The McLachlan wool taskforce headed by my predecessor in Barker, the Hon. Ian McLachlan, is hopefully the report to end all reports and has largely been well received by the industry. Last year, in partnership with Senator Jeannie Ferris, I met with a large number of wool growers, wool sellers and wool processors. We were both pleased to see the forward looking goals of all those people and their positive response to the McLachlan report. There was no doubt that there were several positive plans to deal with the wool stockpile and the future of the wool stockpile and their preparedness to take responsibility for their own industry. I have risen to speak on an industry which is dear to my heart. As a fourth generation wool grower, it is great to see that this government is looking to promote research and promotion of this industry through the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Amendment (Funding and Wool Tax) Bill 2000. This bill has two important aspects to it. It will allow marketing arrangements, subject to ministerial direction. The second aspect of this bill is that it will also allow the government to lower the rate of wool tax to three per cent as of 1 July 2000. This will again be subject to the wishes of the wool growers as foreshadowed in the minister’s eight-point plan of action for the wool industry. This reduction is aimed at providing immediate respite to wool growers experiencing hardship as a result of the poor prices they have been getting for their wool. Overall, this bill is needed to allow the smooth transition from WoolPoll 2000-or the first stage-into the second stage of wool reform which addresses the appropriate structures to deliver the services growers say they want. Voting in WoolPoll 2000 finished on 3 March 2000. I, personally, am looking forward to the findings. IfI can be so bold as to make a prediction, my feedback from the wool growers in the electorate of Barker is that a two per cent wool tax will be opted for by the wool grower. But, of course, we all know what predictions are like and how dangerous they can be. The background to this bill is vast and impacting. Following the 1993 report of the wool industry review committee, otherwise known as the Garnaut report, two new wool statutory bodies, Wool International and AWRAP, were established. AWRAP was given responsibility for the promotion of wool and wool products, and research and development. Wool International was charged with the disposal of the stockpile and discharge of the related debt. It was converted into the Corporations Law company, WoolStock Australia, on 1 July 1999 with wool growers as its shareholders. AWRAP receives the majority of its funding from levies on wool growers. This is supplemented mainly by the government matching contributions for research and development and Woolmark licence fees. Wool growers have faced very difficult times since the early 1990s with low prices and poor demand exacerbated by the Asian economic crisis in 1998. I have had many of these disappointed members of the industry visit my office to discuss this matter. The vote of no confidence in the AWRAP board in November 1998 was an expression of wool grower dissatisfaction and frustration at their lack of control over the industry’s future and their Wednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14257 inability to respond to ongoing pressure. In response to this frustration and the dire circumstances many wool growers found themselves in, the government appointed the wool industry’s Future Direction Taskforce in December 1998, chaired by the Hon. Ian McLachlan AO, to help set future directions for the industry. The majority of the taskforce recommendations were for individual growers and primarily addressed the need for growers to take responsibility for their businesses and their wool. The recommendations that the government is focusing on are those relating to reforming industry structures and levy arrangements. The current legislative framework governing AWRAP allows only wool taxpayers, that is the wool growers, to vote whether or not to accept the recommendation for a particular rate of wool tax. There is no scope to undertake the questioning about what services wool growers want in return for their wool tax and, indeed, how much wool tax they prefer to invest in such services. The government established the wool working party chaired by Dr Keniry of the Ridley Corporation in October 1999 to address this. The wool working party provided a report to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry on 24 December 1999 including a draft information memorandum and voter kit to explain to growers the options that they have the opportunity to vote on. This was approved and distributed to a comprehensive mailing list which combined the voluntary been widely advertised and canvassed in the media, giving every wool grower in Australia the opportunity to cast a vote on these fundamental questions. I now turn to the amendments. The bill provides that the minister may take the preferences of all taxpayers into account, as expressed in WoolPoll 2000, in determining the rate of wool tax in a particular financial year; the minimum rate of wool tax is lowered from 2.75 per cent to zero per cent, effected in both the AWRAP and wool tax acts 1 to 5, to allow the range of options put to growers in WoolPoll 2000-that is, from the current four per cent down to a minimum of zero per cent-to be implemented; AWRAP’s functions are increased to allow it to plan, facilitate and participate in the reform, privatisation or abolition of the organisation, or the establishment of a new body to perform its current functions, or both. AWRAP will also be able to provide funding to allow any of these processes to take place. These functions are constrained by any written directions from the minister. The consultation process in arriving at this point has been exhausted. The wool industry Future Direction Taskforce consulted widely with industry in Australia. It had meetings across Australia visiting most capital cities and several major regional wool centres. It also undertook a program of consultation with overseas customers and processors. The wool working party travelled throughout Australia explaining WoolPoll 2000 and the voting arrangements in the lead-up to the wool poll’s closure on 3 March. The development of the poll has taken into account the concerns and issues raised by the National Wool growers Forum, which had three members on the working party. The National Wool growers Forum acts as the wool industry peak body. It includes representatives from the Wool Council Australia, Australian Superfine Wool Growers Association, Australian Wool growers Association, Australian Association of Stud Merino Breeders, Australian Interior Textile and Carpet Wool Council, Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia, New South Wales Farmers Association, Victorian Farmers Federation, South Australian Farmers Federation, Western Australian Farmers Federation, AgForce Queensland and the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association. As you can see, the consultation has been extremely wide and broad ranging. The departments of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Treasury, the Office of Regulatory Review and the Attorney-General’s Department were also consulted in developing the amendments. 14258 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 2000 Given the diversity of views within the wool industry, virtually any decision by the government could attract criticism from some quarters. The National Wool growers Forum is supporting a levy rate of not less than two per cent. One group within the NWF, the Pastoralists and Graziers Association, has supported a zero per cent rate. Recent industry meetings in Queensland are reported to favour a three per cent rate. However, while ever there is uncertainty over the future of AWRAP, it has an unsettling effect on the wool market at a time of continued low wool prices. Removing impediments to funding the process will allow a more timely response to the grower poll and help to provide certainty to the market more quickly than would otherwise be the case. These reforms are in response to wool grower calls for changes to the structural arrangements funded through their collective levy. Some in the industry will undoubtedly consider and say that the government should pay, rather than the costs being met from the wool levy funds from AWRAP. However, the generally accepted practice in these change processes is for the industry that benefits from the reform to pay for the process. This has been the case in the reforms of the Australian Wheat Board, the red meat industry arrangements and, most recently, Wool International. This bill is working towards helping an industry, which has, in the past, predominantly been one of the country’s strongest. These amendments have had serious consideration, the industry has had serious consultation, and I believe that, in the end, this bill will be of benefit to the industry. reply-I thank all those members who have contributed to the debate on the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Amendment (Funding and Wool Tax) Bill 2000. These amendments themselves are not earth changing, but they are a significant further step in the reform in the wool industry. They are amendments which will progress the industry towards the new structures that it wants to put in place to ensure that effective services are provided to support wool growers. The debate has ranged over a number of wool industry issues. The wool industry has been one of Australia’s greatest industries over many decades. In more recent times, its economic returns have declined and there has been considerable hardship confronted by many people, particularly coarse wool producers as the demand declines around the world for their product. It is in this kind of context that the industry is seeking structural reform to ensure that the services that are provided, and for which wool growers pay, are delivered in an efficient and responsive way. The government is committed to supporting the industry in coming to that position. Wool growers throughout Australia have now cast their votes in WoolPoll 2000. The closing date for ballots was 3 March. I do not as yet, naturally, have any details of the wool poll outcome but the participation rate has been encouraging, with about 50 per cent of wool growers having voted and their ballot papers having been returned. That is better than we had thought was going to be the case a week or two ago, and obviously more ballot papers would be still in the mail. Whilst that represents about 50 per cent of the number of growers, the votes are weighted according to production and the amount of wool tax that has been paid, and so we believe that the percentage of the industry that is actually represented in the vote is very significantly higher than 50 per cent. The outcome of the poll will be a very clear demonstration of the industry’s real wishes in this matter. Wool poll gave growers the opportunity to vote on the types of business services they want and how much they are willing to invest in those services. WoolPoll 2000 is the first stage of a two-stage response to the Wool Industry Future Directions Taskforce report. The results will be known later this month and then the",165,Representatives Main Committee
236,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (12.53 p.m.)-inWednesday, 8 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14259 government will move to stage 2 of the reform process. This will involve, as I have foreshadowed, the establishment by 1 January 2001 of the most appropriate company structure to provide the services that wool growers decide they want for AWRAP’s successor. The bill allows this to happen by giving AWRAP the function of facilitating and funding the reform process, as was done in the privatisation of Wool International but is currently precluded by AWRAP’s governing legislation. It will also allow the government to take wool growers’ wishes into account if WoolPoll 2000 clearly indicates growers’ wishes to have a lower wool tax from 1 July 2000. Currently the legislation would require a second vote of growers to actually alter the levy. That would clearly be a waste of time and effort when this poll has given growers the maximum flexibility in choosing the type of levy arrangements they want for the future. Obviously, whether we need to use this provision will depend on the outcome of the poll, but it is important that we are in a position to put wool growers’ wishes into place as soon as possible. The honourable member for Barker, in his remarks, gave an excellent summary of the history leading to this legislation. I can do no better than acknowledge the summary that he has provided as a record of the events that have brought us to the legislation. There will be costs associated with whatever decision the industry makes about its future structure. The costs will be the greater, the more radical the change to the existing arrangements that are required. And the greater the prospective reduction in wool tax revenue desired by the industry, the greater the costs of restructuring will be. Wool growers can be assured that every effort will be made to manage the process in a manner which minimises the costs. It may be appropriate to make any reduction in wool tax in phases to ensure that these costs are able to be met without unduly disrupting the transformation of the business activities of the new entity. I want to be able to release the results of WoolPoll 2000 by the end of March, at which time. I am hopeful of being in a position to map out more clearly the government’s approach to stage 2. The growers have participated in a very difficult exercise in working towards the future regime of measures and services that will be provided to the industry. I want to give an assurance again today that the government is committed to implementing the outcomes of the poll and to responding to growers’ wishes in relation to the future services to be provided to the industry. I thank honourable members for their constructive contribution to this debate and commend the bill to the Main Committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

(2) What measures has the IMF put in place to ensure funds flowing from this line of credit have been used appropriately to stabilise Indonesia’s financial system. (1) In November 1997, Australia offered to provide, within the Manila Framework arrangements, up to $US1 billion in ‘second tier’ support to Indonesia as part of a $US23 billion IMF-led assistance package. No funds were lent to Indonesia under this facility. On4 February 2000, the IMF Executive Board approved a new three-year, $US billion program for Indonesia, replacing the previous program. It is unlikely that Australia will be approached by the IMF to provide financial assistance to Indonesia in support of its new program.

(1) Employment conditions for staff of the Australian Public Service are a matter for local agreement, through Australian Workplace Agreements or certified agreements. There is no one travel policy that applies throughout the public service. Some staff receive allowances, others are issued with credit cards to cover expenses, still others are required to stay with accommodation providers who will direct bill the relevant Department. Many Government agencies that pay allowances are currently considering whether they should move away from an allowance system.

240,Mr Fahey,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) In November 1999, in its Statement on the 1999 review of judicial remuneration, the Remuneration Tribunal signalled its intention to conduct a wide-ranging examination of official travel arrangements across its jurisdiction in the near future. In its Statement, the Tribunal also advised it had agreed in principle to a new framework that will allow agencies to make greater use of reimbursement in meeting the travel costs of judicial and other public office holders and would make a public statement in due course. Genetically Modified Crops: Consultations (Question No. 1067) Mr Griffin asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 6 December 1999: (1) In approving applications for the deliberate release of genetically modified (GM) crops, does the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC) consult local councils; if so, (a) what form does this consultation take, (b) how much time are councils given to respond, (c) are the local councils given the location of the field trials, (e) are the local councils able to consult relevant constituents on their views and (f) can local councils deny permission for GM crop trials in their area. (2) Are non-GM crop producers with properties surrounding GM crop trials consulted about field trials. (3) How do surrounding non-GM producers ensure that their crops are not contaminated by the trials. (4) Will non-GM producers be compensated if their crops are contaminated; if so, who will be liable to provide compensation. (5) Will all producers now have to test their crops for possible contamination prior to export under the Export Control Act which requires AQIS to attest to the freedom from GMOs in commodities such as grain and seed. (6) On what evidence does GMAC base its decisions on the size of isolation zones surrounding GM crop trials. (7) What types of isolation zones are used. (8) Is evidence reviewed regularly and the requirements changed as appropriate. (9) Which GM crops have been approved for deliberate release, how many hectares have been approved and what are the isolation zone requirements for each crop trial. (10) What constitutes a field trial as opposed to a general release. (11) How many, and what type of, general releases have been (a) approved and (b) rejected and what was the reason for rejection. (12) Is there a difference between a commercial trial and a field trial. (13) What are the perceived trade and export benefits of GM crops. (14) Is the Minister able to say whether any Government Departments have researched the international market for Australian GM crops; if so, (a) what are the expected short, medium and long term financial gains to the Australian export market and (b) how do these compare to short, medium and long term income from non-GM crop exports. The following responses are provided in the context of the current administrative arrangements that exist for the regulation of genetically manipulated organisms (GMOs). Legislation is currently being developed that will replace the voluntary scheme overseen by the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC) with a statutory regulatory system. Many of the issues raised in these Questions on Notice are the subject of public consultation on the form and function of the legislative scheme. (1) Yes. GMAC is the independent expert scientific committee that provides advice on the safety aspects of work with GMOs. It operates within the Interim Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (IOGTR) in the Department of Health and Aged Care. Both GMAC and IOGTR consult with a wide range of organisations and individuals, including local councils, on any proposals for deliberate release of GMOs into the environment for field trials or for general release. (a) For field trials, a letter and a short description of the proposed release are sent to each local council in which a release is to take place. The description is also placed on GMAC’s website. In addition, for general releases the proposed release is notified in The Australian newspaper and in State/Territory and local newspapers in",176,Members Of The House Of Representatives And The Senate Invited To
241,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:areas that will be particularly affected by the release. Comments provided by local councils (or any interested person in the community) on safety matters are taken into account in GMAC’s assessment of the proposal. (b) A consultation period of 30 days from the date of publication of the notice of application in the Commonwealth Government: Government Notices Gazette is set aside for field trials. The period for consultation on general releases is longer. For example, the current general release application (for Monsanto’s Roundup Ready cotton) has a public consultation period of 66 days. (c) The precise locations of field trials are provided in some cases but not in others. Precise locations are generally not provided when the trial is on a private property, but these details may be requested from the organisation conducting the trial. (e) Yes. (f) Local councils can deny permission for GM crop trials in their area if their local town planning or land use regulations give them the power to do so. (2) GMAC’s responsibility is to assess risks to the environment and human health. The location of the trial is therefore only relevant if it has a bearing on these risks. If the risks associated with a release are not able to be managed, a release is not permitted to proceed regardless of its location. Any member of the public can make a submission to GMAC on environmental and public health issues associated with a proposed release, and these comments are taken into account by GMAC in its assessment of the proposal. (3) While GMAC is responsible for assessing health and environmental risks, sometimes people mistakenly believe that it has a broader mandate to, for example, consider issues of contamination that are not safety issues. While GMAC does not consider such issues, the scope of the new legislation (and whether it should cover such issues) is currently the subject of active consultation, including with organic farmers. Under the current arrangements, GMAC generally requires that field trials of GM crops are isolated by a certain distance from other crops with which the GM crop might be able to hybridise. These isolation distances will minimise the potential for contamination of neighbouring crops. For some types of plants, it is not possible to ensure zero chance of contamination of neighbouring crops by pollen from the GM crop. However, as noted in the response to Question 2, if contamination of other crops were assessed by GMAC as posing unacceptable risks to human health or environmental safety, the field trial would not be permitted to proceed. (4) Not under current administrative arrangements, where responsibility is focussed on environmental and health risks. (5) This question does not relate to this portfolio. It should be referred to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. (6) The size of isolation zones is determined on a case-by-case basis using: results from previous field trials; data published in the scientific literature; data obtained in overseas trials; the expertise and knowledge of GMAC members; accepted distances for production of certified pure seed; assessment of the consequences, with regard to environmental safety, of gene escape from the GM crop. (7) Isolation zones may be comprised of: a specified distance of the trial plot from specified plants; a specified amount of specified plants to surround the trial plot; other physical barriers to gene escape. (8) Yes. (9) Approximately 120 field trials of GM crops and extensions to these trials have proceeded. The crops trialled have been: potato, canola, tomato, cotton, carnation, sugar cane, apple, chrysanthemum, rose, subterranean clover, lupin, tobacco, field pea, white clover, wheat, barley, Indian mustard, oilseed poppy, pineapple, grapevine, papaya, lentil, and lettuce. The size of the trials has ranged from 0.002 hectares to 5000 hectares (spread over a large number of sites). (10) GMAC’s Guidelines for the Deliberate Release of Genetically Manipulated Organisms, April 1998, define ‘field trial’ as: a deliberate release of a genetically manipulated organism into the open environment on a restricted scale, for a limited period, and under conditions which minimise or reduce the potential for dissemination or persistence of the organism or its genetic material in the environment. ‘General release’ is defined as: deliberate release of a genetically manipulated organism into the open environment with no provisions for limiting the potential for dissemination or persistence of the organism or its genetic material in the environment. (11) (a) Three general releases have been allowed to proceed: a colour-modified carnation; a carnation with improved vase-life; and insect-resistant (Ingard®) cotton. The latter was approved and registered as a plant-pesticide by the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. (b) Five proposals submitted as general release proposals were allowed to proceed only as field trials, with conditions for isolation and monitoring. These proposals were for: a herbicide (Roundup)-tolerant cotton; a herbicide (Liberty)-tolerant canola; peas with resistance to pea weevil; a herbicide (bromoxynil)-tolerant subterranean clover; and a herbicide (Liberty)-tolerant lupin. For the herbicide-resistant crops, GMAC advised that general release should not take place in the absence of active consideration of a national strategy for the management of herbicide-resistant crops; for the proposal involving the pea weevil-resistant peas, GMAC advised that further information was required on a number of issues before general release. (12) GMAC does not draw a distinction between commercial trials and field trials. The distinction drawn is between field trials and general releases, according to the definitions provided in the response to Question 10. (13) This question does not relate to this portfolio. It should be referred to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. (14) This question does not relate to this portfolio. It should be referred to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Aged Perons Savings Bonus: Qualification (Question No. 1069) Mr Ripoll asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 6 December 1999: (1) How many aged persons does the Government estimate will qualify for the Aged Persons Saving Bonus component under subsection 8(3) in Part2 of the A New Tax System (Bonuses for Older Australians) Act. (2) How many qualifying persons does the Government expect will receive less that $500 under the scheme. (3) How many aged persons does the Government expect will receive no bonus at all. following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) 1,160,340 (2) 838,818 (3) The Department of Family and Community Services does not hold income information for the entire Australian population of aged persons. As such, it is unable to estimate the number of aged persons who will receive no bonus at all. Exports: Pork and Citrus Products (Question No. 1077) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 6 December 1999: (1)What has been the growth in (a) pork and (b) citrus exports in both price and volume since June 1998. (2) What financial assistance has the Government provided to (a) pork producers and (b) the citrus industry since June 1998. 1(a) Exports of Australian farmed pork were at record high volumes during the 1998/99 financial year. This trend continued in the four months to October 1999. Exports for the 1998/99 financial year reached 19,041 tonnes, up 31% on the previous financial year, which were valued at $57.6 million. In the four months to October 1999, Australia exported 12,935 tonnes, valued at $48.6 million. In comparison with the same period last year (July October 1998), Australia exported 4,351 tonnes, valued at $14.6 million. 1(b) The total value of citrus exports has increased by approximately 5% since June 1998.

The Government’s Pork Industry Restructure Strategy includes a $24 million integrated package of programs to assist individual enterprises and groups along the supply chain achieve a strong market focus, improve their international competitiveness in the global market, or exit the industry. The $24 million Pork Industry Restructure Strategy comprises: the $9 million National Pork Industry Development Program (NPIDP) to fund projects ranging from market research to skills development. The program is designed to improve the industry’s international competitiveness and boost export market development; an $8 million Pigmeat Processing Grants Program (PPGP) to stimulate investment in the processing sector and help address efficiency and productivity problems; . a national skills enhancement training initiative for pork producers costing $1 million under the FarmBis program known as PorkBiz; and, . $6 million for financial assistance for non-viable pork producers to exit the industry. The 1998 Productivity Commission Report into ""Pig and Pigmeat Industries"" concluded that there was justification for measures that directly promoted industry restructuring and an export focus while providing assistance to those leaving the industry. While the PPGP targets processors and the NPIDP supports all levels through the supply chain, the $6 million Pork Producers Exit Program (PPEP) and the $1 million PorkBiz initiative focus specifically on producers. The PPEP is designed to assist the most severely affected pork producers voluntarily exit pork production. Producers who are in financial difficulty, are unable to borrow, and who have decided to exit the industry, can do so with dignity under the PPEP without exhausting all family assets. The PPEP had, as of October 1999, received approximately 440 enquiries. To date 50 applicants have drawn on $1.9 million in funds from the program. Applications are still being received and will be accepted until 31 May 2000. The PorkBiz component of the package is targeted at assisting producers improve their business management skills, prepare business plans and develop risk management strategies. Pork Biz awareness forums and promotional meetings with producer groups have been held right across regional Australia between June and November 1999. PorkBiz workshops have also been held in all States to date and some on farm consultations in NSW. The eligibility requirements of the $9m NPIDP, as detailed in the program guidelines, make it clear that applications are invited from all sectors of the production chain including producers. 2(b) The $8.4m Citrus Market Diversification Program (CMDP) has been the Government’s principal vehicle, since 1994, for assisting structural adjustment in the citrus industry. Its main objectives are to provide assistance to facilitate adjustment within and improve the international competitiveness and long term growth prospects for the Australian citrus industry. To this end particular emphasis is placed on measures aimed at increasing exports of fresh fruit and fruit juice as well as import substitution. Members of the citrus industry, as rural producers, are able to access available funds from generic rural assistance programs such as the Rural Partnership, Exceptional Circumstances and Rural Communities Programs and may have done so, however this has not been included in this analysis. Total assistance provided through the CMDP from June 1998 to 30 June 1999 was $1,638,102. This assistance was in the form of the following projects 1998/1999 . $25,000 to NSW Agriculture for efficacy testing of dimethoate and fenthion for citrus. . $30,000 to NSW Agriculture for testing of food dyes as an alternate to malathion. . $10,000 for Horticultural Research and Development Corporation (HRDC) to manage joint experiments with Korean officials to facilitate the removal of non tariff barriers applied to Australian citrus exports, this is an additional amount to support the necessity of another visit by a Korean official. . $115,000 over two years to Minneola Tangelo Grower’s Unit Trust to provide a quality control component to support the coordinated marketing of Minneola Tangelos. . $150,600 over three years to the South Australian Research and Development Institute’s Entomology Unit to study the ecology and biology of Microxeromagna vestita, a small snail which is a considerable pest in citrus orchards and a major threat to exports. . $20,000 in new funds, a transfer of unspent funds (up to $22,000) from the previous grant to NSW Agriculture for TriState Community Awareness and the provision of funds to match industry contributions, up to a maximum of $15,000, to NSW Agriculture for funding a TriState Community Awareness program. . $27,000 to Australian Citrus Growers (ACG) to develop a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) template for the citrus industry. . $95,148 to the Victorian Department of Natural Resources & Environment (Sunraysia Horticulture Centre) to continue research into the movement of Queensland fruit fly into and through the fruit fly exclusion zone for a third year. . $77,980 to enable the Queensland Horticulture Institute to evaluate pre-harvest bait spraying and post-harvest inspection for tropical and coastal citrus as part of a whole systems approach to reducing chemical use on citrus preharvest bait spraying for citrus. . $100,694 for an HRDC/South Australia Research and Development Institute (SARDI) study to identify the risk of different species of mealybugs occurring on citrus which can be used to present a case for changing quarantine regulations to improve security of market access to the USA. . $8,500 from the National Residue Survey (NRS) pilot residue monitoring project for the preparation of information on the Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for citrus in Australia’s major citrus export markets. . $19,380 to NSW Agriculture for work on pruning strategies for citrus to produce optimum fruit size for the export fresh fruit market. . $294,800 over two years for the HRDC to manage a consortium of the Central Queensland University, Queensland Department of Primary Industries and the Queensland Horticultural Institute to undertake development of near infra-red spectroscopy hardware to undertake internal quality based sorting of citrus fruit. . $209,000 for the first year (1999/00) of a three year appointment of a manager for citrus industry propagation improvement under the management of HRDC. . $232,000 for the Australian Horticultural Corporation to undertake market research and a communication program for the development of the domestic market. . $168,000 to the ACG for the first year of a three year appointment of a citrus industry communication development manager. . $50,000 for Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to facilitate a visit to citrus growing areas by the Korean Director-General of Agriculture and for orchard testing of oranges and lemons to support Australia’s application for market access. . $5,000 for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Australia to publish and disseminate a brochure outlining the outcomes of the program. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Runway Changes (Question No. 1098) December 1999: (1) Has the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) claimed that the constant juggling of runways at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (KSA) was tiring, demoralising and overwhelming for the air traffic controllers. (2) Has his attention been drawn to complaints by pilots that they are sometimes given up to three runway changes on descent and that they are being required to land on short runways under tail and crosswind conditions. (3) What steps has he taken to ensure that these complaints and other similar concerns are addressed as a matter of priority.

245,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:“The volume and complexity of the changes occurring in the Sydney TCU may have exceeded the capacity of many of the controllers to assimilate such change. Whereas, a safety case may have considered a change to be an acceptable risk in isolation, a holistic approach to system capacity for change has not yet been addressed. The constant pressure for change has overwhelmed a number of controllers who, in turn, have resigned themselves to quiet acquiescence. Alternatively, some controllers believe that there will be some occasions when they will not be able to cope with a problem, and others believe that they will have to manage the situation ‘as best they can’ at the time. It is therefore important that Airservices Australia take a more considered approach to forthcoming changes in order to ensure that all controllers are adequately prepared at both the initial and ongoing phases of the change process and that the cumulative effects of change are being adequately assessed and addressed.” In response to this BASI recommendation Airservices Australia extensively reviewed the program of change in Sydney to prioritise changes to ensure that safety was not compromised. For example the training for The Advanced Australian Air Traffic System transition was postponed and the introduction of new Long Term Operating Plan Modes8 and 6A was also deferred. Airservices Australia has instituted an ongoing program of monitoring the introduction of new procedures and processes to ensure that the operational impact of change is well managed. 2 and 3 I am advised that pilots are not being required to land under conditions which they believe unsafe. The pilot-in-command of an aircraft always has the discretion to reject the nominated runway in favour of another for safety reasons. Spent Nuclear Fuel Rods: Radioactivity (Question No. 1166) Resources, upon notice, on 15 February 2000: (1) What is the level of radioactivity of the 308 spent fuel rods that were transported to Cherbourg, France from the Lucas Heights reactor. (2) What will be the level of radioactivity of the waste remaining after reprocessing? (3) Will the radioactive waste from the reprocessing operation be returned to Australia; if so, when? (4) How will the radioactive waste be transported to Australia? (5) Does Australia have the appropriate facilities to store or dispose of the radioactive waste material once it is returned to Australia; if so, where are those facilities located? answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) 8494 Tbq (one Tbq is 1012 becquerels) (2) Less than 8494 TBq (3) Yes, by 2015 (4) In specially built and licensed, dual purpose transport/storage casks. (5) The casks mentioned in (4) are designed to serve as the necessary storage facility. They will be stored at the national store for long-lived intermediate level waste which is to be constructed to manage Australia’s existing holdings of radioactive waste in this category. The location for this store will be considered by the Government once a site has been chosen for a national waste repository for low level and short lived radioactive waste. It is expected that a preferred site for the national repository will be determined during 2000. Interest Rates: Increase (Question No. 1190) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 16 February 2000: (1) Which 64 investment banks and other institutions gained information about the interest rate increase of 2 February 2000 before the general public. (2) Is he able to say which of those banks and institutions traded in a manner to exploit the early release of information.",182,Members Of The House Of Representatives And The Senate Invited To

247,Mr Moore,"The Minister for Industry, Science and Resources has provided the following(3) What profit was made by the banks and institutions that acted on the early information. (4) What action will the Government take to prevent this occurnng again. (5) What disciplinary action, if any, will be taken by the Government concerning the breach in security. (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) These issues are covered in the Governor’s Statement of 18 February 2000 on ‘Review of the Reserve Bank’s Arrangements For Releasing Market Sensitive Information.’ Land Clearing (Question No. 1091) Mr Kerr asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 8 December 1999: What action is the Commonwealth taking to stop unregulated land clearing. answer to the honourable member’s question: The honourable member would be well aware that regulation of land clearing is a State/Territory responsibility. The Howard Government is however concerned about the level of land clearing in Australia and has taken positive action to address this important issue. The Bushcare Program of the Natural Heritage Trust, an initiative of this Government, is the largest investment in the sustainable management of Australia’s native vegetation ever made by an Australian Government. The goal of Bushcare is the reversal of the long term trend of native vegetation decline in Australia through funding on-ground projects and providing incentives to assist farmers and other landholders to reduce land clearing and increase revegetation; to catalyse institutional reform; and to assist communities at local and regional levels to improve native vegetation management. In signing the Natural Heritage Trust Partnership Agreements all State and Territory Governments made a commitment to contribute to that national goal. A further key initiative of the current Government is the National Framework for the Management and Monitoring of Australia’s Native Vegetation which was endorsed by the Australia and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council at its meeting in December 1999. The Framework provides a vehicle to implement the commitment made by the Commonwealth and State/Territory Governments to reverse the long-term decline in the quality and extent of Australia’s vegetation cover by June 2001. Interim work plans have also been prepared by all jurisdictions as the principle means of implementing the National Framework in a consistent and coherent manner. This is a major step forward in the protection of Australia’s native vegetation. Regulation of land clearing is only one aspect of a best-practice framework for managing native vegetation. Through Bushcare and the Natural Heritage Trust, the Commonwealth is working with landholders, communities, industry and all tiers of government to develop more effective and practical incentives for the conservation of native vegetation. For example, I have to date approved Bushcare funding of $20m in Queensland and $15m in New South Wales for conserving remnant native vegetation and enhancing well-planned revegetation efforts. The Commonwealth is also investing directly in the conservation of high priority native vegetation throughout Australia.",183,Members Of The House Of Representatives And The Senate Invited To
