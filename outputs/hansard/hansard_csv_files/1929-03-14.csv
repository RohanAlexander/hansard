What is the total amount of money advanced hy the Commonwealth to the States for housing purposes? D r . EARLEPAGE the honourable member's questions are as follow:.1. No. The Parliaments of New South Wales and South Australia have agreed to amending legislation permitting the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales and the State Savings Bank of South Australia respectively to obtain advances under the Commonwealth Housing Scheme. These two institutions have been prescribed as authorities for the purposes of the Commonwealth Housing Act 1027-1928. In Western Australia the Workers' Homes Act has been amended, but, owing to an error in drafting, the amendment does not f u l f i l the conditions of the Comcent, customs duty, are being sold at 8d. per monwealth Housing Act, and it is therefore not possible to prescribe the Workers' Homes Board as an authority .under the Commonwealth law until the disability has been removed. This matter is receiving the attention of the Western Australian Government. The Governments of Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania have refused to introduce legislation to enable their State institutions to become eligible to operate under the Commonwealth scheme. 2. The Commonwealth Housing Act does not permit of advances being made by the Commonwealth direct to the States. It is provided, however, that advances may be made by the Commonwealth Savings Bank to the prescribed State authority out of the housing fund, which consists, amongst other items, of moneys advanced to the Savings Bank by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. To date no such advances have been made by the Treasurer, the Commonwealth Savings Bank having provided the necessary moneys out of funds held by the bank for the purposes of the housing fund. ister, upon notice1.

Science and Industry ""Research Act-Second Annual Report of the Council for Scientilic and Industrial Research, for year ended 30th June, 1928. Ordered to be printed. agreed toThat he have leave to bring in a bill for an act relating to the establishment of appeal tribunals to deal with appeals relating to War Pensions. Bill presented by SIR NEVILLE HOWSE and read a first time."" Minister in Charge of Repatriation) [11.25] -(B y leave)I move That the bill be now read a second'time. The object of this measure is to give effect to the promise of the Government to provide a means by which appeals may be made against decisions of the Repatriation Commission in connection with entitlement to pensions and the assessment of war disabilities. Seeing that the bill deals entirely with the decisions of the commission, it is desirable that I should outline briefly the policy that is at present adopted in dealing with claims for pensions. It is generally conceded that Australia has provided more liberally than any other country in the world for her ex-soldiers and their dependants. An examination of the repatriation measures of other countries may reveal that, in some respects, they are more liberal than ours; but taken as a whole that is not the case. Our act is administered by a Repatriation Commission of three ex-soldiers, one of whom is the nominee of the Returned Soldiers and Sailors Imperial League of Australia. A board similarly composed operates in each State. Whenever a claim for a pension, or for the variation of a pension is made, all the relevant documents are collated and submitted to the State Repatriation Board. If it refuses the' application, the applicant may appeal to the Repatriation Commission, which, thereupon,, considers the matter. If a medical question is into present involved, and that happens ih the great majority of appeals that are considered nowadays, the case is submitted to a Medical Advisory Committee, which consists of four of the most eminent medical practitioners in Australia. These gentlemen have also had military experience. Since January, 1925, the soldier has had, in fact, if not in law, a further appeal, for, as Minister in Charge of Repatriation, I have, in collaboration with the Repatriation Commission and the Medical Advisory Committee, examined the files in relation to every case submitted to me. In this way we have been able not only to deal with individual cases, but also to formulate certain general principles to guide the Repatriation Commission in dealing with the appeals submitted to it. These principles in every instance favour the ex-soldier To illustrate the different point of view which is now taken in connection with certain cases, I might mention the sequelae of syphilis, mental cases and tuberculosis. The sequelae of syphilis contracted whilst serving in the Australian Imperial. Forces were not regarded as war disabilities, but it is now recognized that the stress and strain of active service following ' syphilis contracted, say, whilst ou leave, might be a deciding factor in accelerating their onset, and under those circumstances the ex-soldier's disability would he accepted as attributable to service. Another illustration applies to mental cases. Until lately we had some difficulty in dealing' with these, because it was found that men discharged from mental institutions as fit for light employment frequently were unable to obtain work suitable to their condition. It has now been decided that these men should be eligible for the full pension, although they may be able to do a certain amount of light work. No mental case is settled nowadays until after it has been referred to an alienist. The last illustration I shall give relates to tubercular cases. Men who were discharged from tubercular sanatoria with",15,Lease Of Defence Lands

51,Sir Neville Howse (Calare,"their lesion practically healed also found it difficult to obtain suitable employment, and since 1st July, 1925, they also have been granted a ful l pension for life. My four years' association with the Repatriation Commission enables me to say, without hesitation, that any charge that its administration is harsh and unsympathetic is unwarranted. Honourable members can see that for themselves if they examine the figures. For instance, during the four years ended the 30th June, 1928, the number of ex-soldier pensioners increased by 439, notwithstanding period 2,866 ex-soldiers unfortunately died, and a number of pensions were cancelled because the pensioners had recovered. An examination of the work of the commission last year, ten years after the cessation of the war, reveals a fact which is peculiar to Australia-that new pensions were granted to 891 ex-soldiers during the year. The total number of new pensions granted last year, i?icluding wives, children and other dependants, was 13,547. might have expected. Sir NEVIL LE HOWSE -No. Those 891 cases are classified under 90 different disabilities. were granted on account of tuberculosis, shows clearly the anxiety displayed by evcft'y one dealing with returned soldiers to grant pensions wherever it can be shown that the disability is in any way connected with war service, which is the principle that must underlie the repatriation legislation of every country. An unfortunate feature of the commission's work is the increase in the number of mental cases. Many of the cases dealt with were the sequelae of the disease previously mentioned, in respect of which pensions are now granted. One hundred and thirty-two new pensions were granted on account of gun shot wounds other thau those causing limb amputation and blindness. Asthma, bronchitis, pleurisy and pneumonia accounted for 200 new pensions, war neurosis was responsible for 74' new pensions, while 29 were granted in respect of rheumatism. shock ? Sir NEVIL LE HOWSE -It might be the sequelae of shell-shock. The complete classification of the disabilities on which new claims for pensions were granted last year is well worthy of examination hy honourable members:Number Disability. of cases.

A claimant appearing before the tribunal may claim travelling expenses. I draw attention to proposed new section 45x, which readsAn Appeal Tribunal and an Assessment Appeal Tribunal shall, so far as it is consistent with the interests of the appellant, and witb any obligation to respect information given to the commission upon a confidential basis, make available to the appellant or his representative information contained in the records relating to the case. Provided that information given to the commission on a confidential basis may be disclosed to the appellant or his representative in any case, if the person who has provided the information consents in writing. Before dealing with the Assessment Tribunal it is necessary to show why the Government proposes a different constitution for this board. It is proposed that the chairman shall be a returned soldier barrister or solicitor selected by the returned soldiers' organizations according to the practice now adopted, and that he shall be a permanent officer. To assist him it is proposed to appoint two medical practitioners, who, in the opinion of the Minister, have special knowledge of the disabilities from which the appellant is suffering. That will be of great advantage to the soldiers. In cases of special diseases, such as those affecting the eye, the ear or the throat, the chairman will have the assistance of specialists in those diseases. Two members of the Entitlements Tribunal shall form a quorum, but in order to give the fullest protection of the appellant for assessment, the three members of the assessment board must be present to give a decision. No medical man who is an officer of the Eepatriation Department or has given a previous decision on the case shall be a member of the Assessment Board in respect of that case. The two medical members of the Assessments Tribunal will be drawn from a selected number of doctors. A list of medical men willing to give their services for a certain number of hours each day will be compiled. They will not be permanent officers, for, apart from any question of pecuniary benefit, it would be impossible to obtain suitable men willing to accept permanent positions. roster ?. be done by the Minister. The list will comprise the names of men of high standing in particular branches of the medical profession in each State. Each tribunal will have the power to summon witnesses and to take evidence upon oath. It is specifically provided in the bill that the tribunals shall not be bound by any rules of evidence, but shall act in accordance with substantial justice and the merits of the case, and that they shall give to the appellant the benefit of any reasonable doubt. The appellant may appear in.person before the tribunal, or may be represented by airy person other than a legal practitioner. An appellant, if he 'appears before the tribunal, may be paid travelling expenses. This bill has been drawn as a result of experience gained in the administration of tlie Repatriation Department during the last ten years. Consideration has also been given to the advice received from other countries where appeal courts are in being, and to that tendered, after a long consideration of the matter by the executive of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers League. Of the 22 recommendations submitted to the Government by the league, all of them, except a few minor points, have been embodied in this bill, or provision has been made by regulation to put them into effect. Those recommendations were drawn up at the annual congress of the league in Sydney on the 28th November, 1928. Who should bear the onus of proof is a matter which has been frequently discussed, both in this House and outside, and it is one that has to be faced by the Minister, and those administering the act. I have no hesitation in saying that when a pension is being claimed for a disability, the onus of proof must be the responsibility, both of the appellant, and of the Entitlement Appeal Tribunal. In the first place a prima facie case must be made out by the appellant, and it is then the responsibility of the Appeal Tribunal to assist the claimant in every way possible to connect his disability with his service.

It is expressly stated that in cases in which reasonable doubt exists, the appellant shall be given the benefit of that doubt. The contents of departmental files are to be made available to appellants or their representatives to the very fullest extent. If an appeal is rejected, and further relevant evidence is forthcoming at a later date, no matter at what period during a man's life, provision is made for an appeal tribunal to hear the case again.

Tbe sums involved are estimated as follows:Loan works and services Additions, new works-payabl e from revenue 50,000 Miscellaneous and unforeseen . . . Total When the estimates for 1929-30 are brought down, Parliament will be asked to make special appropriations for the services involved. Immediately Parliament resumes after the adjournment, the usual financial statement will be submitted for consideration. In the meantime, it is fitting that some indication should be given of the results to date of the present financial year. As honourable members are aware, the Revenue Account of the Commonwealth is largely governed hy customs and excise receipts. In 192627, the receipts from this source amounted to £43,552,000. In 1927-2S they were £41,446,000, representing a decline of £2,106,000. This decline was almost wholly due to the reduced purchases of luxuries, brought about by the unfavorable seasonal conditions, and the resultant temporary depression. When submitting the Budget for the current year, I estimated that the revenue from customs and excise would be about £43,300,000. In arriving at this estimate, I was influenced by past experience, which showed that after a period of depression there was an immediate and full recovery in the customs and excise revenue. As a result of those experiences, and with the prospect of a good harvest and an increased wool yield, justification was found for the estimated revenue of £43,300,000, which is £252,000 less than the collections of 1926-27, notwithstanding that, in the meantime, additional duties, estimated to yield £500,000, were imposed on motor chassis. Por the first three months of the present financial year, which saw a continuance of the depression, collections amounted to £9,503,000, a decline of £1,763,000 as compared with the previous year. Since October last, a marked, improvement has been manifest, and the receipts for the eight months ended 28th February amounted to £27,853,000, which, compared with the pro rata Budget estimate, discloses a shortage of approximately £1,000,000. It is not possible to forecast £with any reliability what the receipts will ... 1,200,000 be for the remainder qf the financial year, but the general trading position is now 400,000 more favorable than it was during the first three months of the financial year, ... ... 1,050,000 and it is quite possible that a good deal of the leeway will be made up. It is estimated that other transactions, taken as a whole, will produce a result approximately equal to the Budget estimate. The results for the year will, therefore, be almost wholly governed by the customs and excise collections between now and the end of the year. In framing the Budget for the present year, the Government fully appreciated the need for economy and it will continue to exercise a policy of prudent finance. second-reading debate on this bill affords an opportunity for a general discussion upon either the financial affairs of the Commonwealth, or any other outstanding matter. I propose to deal with some aspects of the tariff. We had discussions yesterday and earlier in the course of this session on the constitution of the Tariff Board, and a fair amount of latitude was allowed. But no particular opportunity has been, nor can now be given, as far as I can see, for a general review of the workings of the tariff in Australia, or of the defects that may be discovered, because it is the obvious intention 'of the Government not to proceed with any tariff items during these sittings. It has occurred to me that it would be reasonable for this Parliament to provide an opportunity regularly each session for a general discussion of the tariff. If such a provision were incorporated in the Standing Orders, and a certain number of days, allocated to the discussion, there could be each year a general review of the situation. This could, perhaps, be secured by means of some resolution, the obligation to bring down which could rest with the Government. All honourable members realize how necessary it is to have general discussions on thefinancesof the Commonwealth and",20,Second Eeading
67,Mr Theodore (Dalley) [12.2],"Th ethe Standing Orders, the rules governing the procedure of Parliament, and, indeed, the Constitution itself provides an opportunity for such a discussion at least once in each year. Necessities which require frequent appropriation bills furnish other opportunities. Finance is a subject of transcendent importance, and honourable members are rightly given many opportunities to discuss it. The protection of Australian industries by the control of tariffs is also important. Yet a whole year might elapse without Parliament being afforded a chance to discuss the subject, to raise any points relating to the defective nature of the existing tariff, or to call attention to the tragic delays, which, unfortunately, are taking place in connection with matters remitted to the Tariff Board. I propose this afternoon to take the opportunity to refer to some of those matters, and I hope that other honourable members will support me. One thing, the outstanding importance of which cannot escape the notice of any honourable member, is the unsatisfactory trade position between Australia and the United States of America.

Ur. Theodore. nately, that situation is growing more difficult, and I think that it should be examined and discussed here. The enormous adverse trade balance against Australia in its trade with the United Sta.tes of America is alarming. To support my argument, I shall quote from a table which has been furnished by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Gullett) relating to the movements of trade between the two countries. Taking first the figures for 1921-22, we find that in that year Australia imported from the United States of America goods to the value of £18,823,113, while the value of our exports to that country was £8,314,3S6, including £1,676,000 of gold specie. That discloses an adverse trade balance of £10,508,727 for the year. In 1927-28, our imports from the United States, amounted to £35,005,736, while our exports to that country totalled only £8,954,823, an adverse trade balance of £26,050,913 against Australia. This reveals a very serious situation, and there are no indications of an improvement. The complete figures for the years 1918-19 to 1927-28 are as follows:Irade Balance Gold Specie Trade Balance In Favour of Exported to In favour of Imports from Exports to USA. USA. (excluding USA.

During 1927-28, the total amount of exports from Australia to the United States of America was £7,400,000, exclusive of gold specie. We already have established in Australia a number of industries which, with proper encouragement, could produce at least a very considerable portion of this £10,000,000 worth of importations from the United States of America. It would still be necessary to import from the United States of America possibly £20,000,000 worth of commodities which cannot, for the present, be produced here, such at motor spirit, oils, tobacco, motor cars, and machinery, which are coming here in enormous quantities. machinery which we are now importing from America could be made here. mentioned in the detailed list I have just giveu. If some of the industries which have been established in Australia were better protected, they would have a greater chance of capturing some of the trade which now goes to the United States of America, and which brings about such large adverse trade balances. I admit that a country which is trading with all countries of the world cannot hope to have a favorable trade balance with all nations; the very nature of trading makes it necessary to have adverse trade balances with some countries. We already have a favorable balance of trade with Japan and France, but in the case of the United States of America there is an extremely heavy adverse trade balance, which is tending to restrict our opportunities and, I am confident, acting to the detriment of Australian industry. It is to that problem that we need to direct our minds.

The Minister for Trade and Customs was good enough, yesterday, to receive a deputation from the radio manufacturers of Australia, who have a very good case. I shall deal with a few of the salient points to illustrate my argument. A vast quantity of the radio sets and component parts that are used in Australia come from the United States of America, because that country manufactures them by massed production methods. Honourable members will probably be astonished to learn that Australia provides the second best market in the world for the producers of these commodities in the United States of America. This is a new industry throughout the world; it has grown up within the last few years, so that there is no reason why Australia should not begin manufacturing radio necessities and progress with their manufacture on parallel lines with other countries. In this industry the older countries have not the advantages that are associated with long-established enterprises, such as tradition and the employment of staffs whose families have been trained in",22,Second Eeading

Radio manufacturing has been proceeding in Australia since the industry began. Amalgamated Wireless Limited has in Sydney a splendidly equipped factory, which I had the privilege of inspecting at least five years ago. That company even then was manufacturing very satisfactory radio valves, but has since discontinued doing so because of very keen continental competition. There are a number of other radio manufacturers in Sydney, including the Electricity Meter Manufacturing Company Limited, United Distributors Limited, the James Manufacturing Company, Keogh Radio Supplies, Suttons Proprietary Limited, the Metropolitan Electric Limited, Each of those concerns is engaged in the manufacture and component parts, and more than .€1,000,000 has been invested in their businesses. When operating at full pressure they gave' employment to over 3,000 persons, but during the last two years they have beeu very seriously affected by American competition; so much so that the Electricity Meter Manufacturing viously employed from 250 to 300 hands on radio work, is now employing only 30.

The present tariff is 55 per cent on the f.o.b. price, plus 10 per cent, which on thatvalue amounts to £2 3s. 5d. The landing charges are about 14s. 5d. Therefore, the total landing cost in stores in Sydney is £6 9s. 9d. that that is a dumping price, I suppose? abnormally low price because these sets are known as end-of-the-season goods.

It Company is thus readily apparent that there is and Grose and Daniell. an enormous difference between the cost of the imported article landed in Sydney of radio sets and the cost of the Australian-made set of a similar type. The margin in the case of the seven valve and other sets of higher quality is much smaller. The representatives of the local trade do not use the term "" dumping "" ; but they point out that in many cases these cheaper sets that are being landed in Australia represent the surplus of the Company, which preseasonal production of the factories of the United States of America.

What has been our experience in regard to imported springs? The saving that Australian users of motor cars have made since the 55 per cent, ad valorem duty on springs has been in operation is clearly demonstrated by a comparison of the prices in Australia under a 55 per cent, tariff with the prices in New Zealand under a 20 per cent, tariff.

When the tariff was increased to 55 per cent, they sold for £S 8s. When the duty was fixed at 55 per cent., Lovejoy hydraulic shock absorbers-a n imported article, and probably the best known, at any rate the most widely used on the market-cam e down in price from £16 16s. to £12 12s. The price of Australian shock absorbers is less than that of the imported article, aud wherever the agents for the various lines of cars give reasonable opportunity, Australian shock-absorbers are being fitted. Some agents choose to fit their cars with costly imported absorbers, although they are by no means giving more satisfaction than the Australian-made article. The present duty of 55 per cent, ad valorem does not give the amount of protection Parliament intended. Firms which export chassis from America to Australia do not allow the importing agent a fair or reasonable reduction if the shock absorbers are excluded. If shock absorbers are included, the invoice value set down for them is the nominal amount of, say, £3 a set. The 55 per cent, ad valorem rate on £3 thus becomes a merely nominal duty. Much more effective protection would be afforded by the imposition of a flat rate. I come now to the manufacture of sewing thread and sewing cotton. There is in Sydney a big factory with very modern equipment controlled by men with English experience in this industry, but they have had a most uufortunate time since they commenced operations here. The competition with the Australian manufacturers of sewing thread and sewing cotton has been in some respects very unfair and the industry has Mr Theodore. been so adversely affected by it that its position at the present time is very precarious. It has the advantage of a duty, It furnishes standard equipbut the competition comes from an overseas combine whose representatives in Australia have been threatening to crush That is our local industry. This combine is resorting to devices which tend very much to endanger the existence of the Australian These are fitted to them in mill. One device is to manufacture threads intended for industrial purposes in domestic or short lengths in order to get them into Australia at a reduced When the duty was 10 per tariff rate. Australian-made threads are now being used, in some cases exclusively, and in other cases to the extent of providing their major requirements, by the following industries:-Rubbe r works, boot and shoe manufacturing, knitting mills, motor body builders, clothing trade, millinery, leather goods, tents and tarpaulins, hat manufacturers, furnishings, tailorings, corset manufacturing and so on. The Australian mill is capable of turning out £200,000 worth of threads a year for use in various trades. In 1925, the tariff was 25 per cent. British, 30 per cent, intermediate, and 35 per cent, general. In spite of that tariff, prices were reduced by the overseas combine, and large stocks which were shipped to Australia in anticipation of a revision of the tariff made it very difficult for the Australian manufacturers to continue operations. Sitting suspended from 12.43 to 2.30 p.m. the sewing thread manufacturers made an application to the Tariff Board for increased protection, and after repeated requests the application was set down for hearing in January, 1928. In July last, the board completed its report, which I understand was favorable to an increase in duty, but it has not been acted on. We ought to have from the Minister some explanation of the Government's inaction. If the industry were making profits and were able to carry on and extend its operations, the matter would not be so urgent; but it is threatened with extinction. Yet though the board has reported favourably upon the request for assistance, the Government has neglected to come to its aid. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) urged last",27,Second Eeading
98,Mr Theodore,"In February 1927,night that all reports of the Tariff Board should be tabled soou after they are presented to the Minister. That might not be wise, because if it were known that the board had definitely recommended an increase of duty, too great an opportunity would be given to importers to stock tip their warehouses against the possibility of parliamentary action. But certainly, when the board has recommended assistance to an industry that is known to be in difficulties, the Minister should take prompt action, and his schedule should be accompanied by the board's report. of sewing threads use any Australian cotton ? imported. Australian cotton is not suitable for spinning into sewing thread, but those engaged in the industry declare that certain types of Durango cotton, which can be grown in Australia, might be ultimately used for this purpose. Australian labour is put into the locallymade article? the factory in Sydney has a very large personnel, and the finished product must contain a considerable proportion of Australian labour. The imported yarns have to be treated, bleached, dyed and polished, and go through many processes before the highly finished article recently returned from abroad, where is placed on the market. threads in Australia is already enormous. Australian manufacturers commenced operations the overseas competitors have reduced their prices substantially in order fo undercut the local product. to the fall of the price of foreign cotton. A representative of the combine who the visited Australia, boasted to those in the Act. In some instances that came under my trade that his principals intended to crush notice it seemed that exporters in certain the local industry. The overseas manuparts of the Continent were prepared to infacturers altered their former practice, value. aud shipped to this country sewing these Australian manufacturers are utterly threads made up in short lengths in order unable to compete. I have no hesitation in to bring them under an item of the tariff saying that it would pay my company far to which a lower duty applied. Yet better these short-length threads are used for deavour industrial purposes, and the -intention the industry is granted in Australia. of Parliament is being defeated. The threads made in Australia are used, not for domestic purposes, but by manufacturers such as motor-body builders, shoe manufacturers, tailors, and milliners. Without trespassing unduly on the time of the House, I have been endeavouring to give a few concrete examples of the way in which the present tariff is failing to protect. The manufacture of artificial flowers is another promising industry in which large firms in Sydney and Melbourne are engaged. In 1921 flat-rate duties were imposed; but they proved to be insufficient, and in February, 1925, the manufacturers applied to the Tariff Board for higher rates. To the astonishment of the trade the board recommended the termination of the flatrate duties, and the substitution of a ridiculous ad valorem duty equivalent to an increase of about 5 per cent. That change from the flat rate to the ad valorem rate has done the industry untold injury. In 1924-25 the imports under percentage of the old flat rates were valued at £109,000; but in 1926-27, under the existing ad valorem rates, they increased to over £150,000. The artificial flower industry is suitable to Australia. It gives to a large number of women congenial and interesting employment under hygienic conditions very different from those in which the industry is carried on in other countries. A Sydney manufacturer who he had studied this industry, wrote to me last monthIn the first place what appealed to me was the limited amount of actual flower manufacture carried out in Great Britain, particularly bearingin mind that the bulk of our importations are shown as of British origin. I consider some very tightening-up measure should be taken in passing invoices claiming On the Continent, specially in Czechoif they so desired, to evade the provisions of Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) voice goods which were far from true to Trading under conditions such as to import artificial flowers than ento struggle against this class of overseas competition, with the meagre protection",28,Second Eeading

The local manufacturers have a wide range of designs, exceeding in one factory 1,000. The business is efficiently managed and, if given adequate protection, would be a success. I call the Minister's attention to the weakness in the law relating to dumping. If a local manufacturer alleges that dumping is taking place, the onus of proof is upon him. In most cases proof is very difficult. If the onus were snared by the importer, the department would be able to check this evil more readily. I have much more material which I could place before the House, if time permitted, but I have quoted sufficient concrete examples to show that the tariff is not as effective in many items as was intended by Parliament. When the legislature imposes an ad valorem duty of 55 per cent., the inference is that it desires the local industry to be protected effectively. The duty is imposed, not to aid revenue, but to protect Australian enterprises, and if after the duty has operated for a reasonable time there is clear evidence that the industry is not protected and that manufacturers abroad and importers are employing devious methods to defeat the tariff, action should be taken by the Minister to make the policy of Parliament effective. I would like the Minister to give attention to the lopsided operation of the preferential policy between Australia and the United Kingdom. We all are in favour of giving preference in trade to Great Britain over foreign countries, but we do not desire in so doing to injure our own industries. If it can be shown that the preferential policy is imperilling Australian industries, we must revise the duties. our industries to suffer. true of most British statesmen. Moreover, there must be a fair element of reciprocity in this policy. If we give substantial preference to the United Kingdom we have a right to expect a fair degree of reciprocity. ber will admit that the very idea of preference contemplates a certain amount of competition. that. We might impose a preferential duty that would give to Great Britain the exclusive trade in a particular article, without competition from Australia. In some cases that is the effect of our preferential policy. Other preferential duties give to Great Britain the lion's share of our trade from overseas. The intention of the preference is to induce Australian consumers to purchase British goods in preference to foreign goods, but not necessarily in preference to Australian goods. The late Minister for Trade and Customs, MrH . E. Pratten, quoted in this House on the 24th November, 1927, certain statistics showing the advantages of the preferential policy to Great Britain and Australia respectively. The following figures show the value of the preference granted to the Old Country for the years 1921-22 to 1925-26:Year. £. 192122 .. 5.373,073 192223 . . 7,602.908 192324 .. .. 7,337,482 192425 . . 7,975,703 192526 .. 7,981,172 I believe that the total for the next year was still higher.

This is an important matter, and I am sure that honourable members will agree with me that, in considering the manufacture of motor cars and lorries which to-day transport at some stage not only the primary produce in its raw state, but also in its semi and completely manufactured condition, we should be exceedingly careful that we do not take any premature action likely to impose a crippling tax on industry as a whole. While I am sympathetic with the proposals designed to bring about the manufacture of complete cars in Australia, I frankly believe that, if we attempted to hurry the process, we might for some years do more harm than good. We should endeavour first to develop the manufacture of automotive parts, and, later, the manufacture of the complete chassis. But it must be remembered that, apart from commercial trucks, this is largely a luxury and vanity trade. We shall never induce the Australian people to be satisfied with a selection from only two or three types of cars; they will insist tion of honourable members, I might exon a wider range. If we imposed a very heavy duty to-morrow on foreign cars, they would still be imported in large numbers, if we were turning out only a few makes of our own. I have touched on most of the points raised by the honourable member. We need say nothing more about motor bodies or tires, and little about batteries. firms which specialize in the [manufacI have been using an Australian battery for the last three or four years, and have found it to be excellent. The honourable inember referred to shock absorbers; but his complaint should uot have been directed against the Government. Honourable members will recall that, when the last tariff schedule was before the House, the manufacturers of shock absorbers made representations for an ad valorem duty, and they were given what they asked for. Having gone into the matter recently, I agree that the ad valorem duty has not proved effective; that it has been side-stepped by the American manufacturers. The blame for this, however, cannot' be placed at the door of the Customs Department or of the Government. Only recently I was in touch with the principal manufacturer of these parts, the head of the firm which was chiefly responsible for securing the imposition of this duty, and he, did not ask that it be varied. He himself suggested that, before making an application for a higher or different duty, he should go to America to interview the motor car manufacturers there, and see what could be done. Minister would indicate that, in the case of the American manufacturers proving obdurate, the Government would give further consideration to the matter. the right honourable gentleman can expect me to give a definite pledge on that point; but it was the intention of the Government and of Parliament, when the duty was first imposed, that this particular branch of the automotive industry should be effectively protected. It has happened in respect of other parts that we, upon request, have changed ad valorem duties to fixed duties which have proved effective without increasing the cost of the parts to the public. For the informaplain briefly how the American manufacturers evade the ad valorem duties, and why fixed duties become necessary. It is done in a very simple way. Very few, if any, of the motor car manufacturers in the United States of America whose names appear upon thefinishedcar, manufacture the whole vehicle themselves. They buy different parts from the ture, and assemble them in the car. There are two prices for these parts, one to the original manufacturer of the car, who uses the part in equipment, and another, and a much higher price, for parts used for replacement. The manufacturers of parts try to get their parts used in the original equipment of cars because having got them there, they ensure themselves a big business in the same parts for replacement. Therefore, the manufacturers are able to assemble their cars at a minimum cost. They",32,Second Eeading

118,Mr Gullett,"I do not think thatmay get equipment parts, such as shock absorbers, at less than cost price. Dalley, in dealing with this phase, made one slight mistake. At the present time, even under the ad valorem duties, we do not accept equipment parts which can be manufactured here at the cost price to the firm which assembles the cars. We endeavour to arrive at their real value for to concern itself with the interests of duty purposes, but the trouble is that the assembling firm get them sometimes as low as half price. It may not be correct to say that they are dumped in this country, but they are landed here at what is not a fair competitive price. Without prejudice to the ca3e of shock absorbers, I can say that in some instances the only remedy has been found to be the imposition of a fixed duty. In listening to the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), I was amazed that he should have picked out certain radio apparatus to illustrate the indiffertiply the cost price by three when sellence of the Government towards the protection of Australian industry. He spoke of an American radio set which could be landed to-day in this country at a cost of £6 9s. 9d. as a whole, is being dealt by the Tariff Board. The honourable gentleman gave this as the price of a five-valve set landed at the wholesale store in this country. The price for a corresponding set of Australian manufacture, he said, was £16 8s. 4d. mentioned this, apparently, as a reason for imposing an adequate protective duty on the imported radio set. I do not wish to anticipate in any way the Tariff Board's report on. this item; that report is now being written, and I have uot the faintest idea of what it is to contain. I am prepared to say, however, that if this is an example of the protection we are supposed to afford, this Government does not stand for it, and this country will never stand for it. Wireless is a modern invention which probably means more to the world than any other invention of the last 100 years. It is coming within the same category as postages, telephones and telegraphs, and the aim of all modern, enlightened democracies is to cheapen these thinas to the people, and bring them within the reach of every one. Wireless is Mr Gullett. a thing which we should definitely strive to make cheap for the people of AusThe honourable member for tralia, and for the working man especially. Lonely settlers in the outer places should, by means of their wireless sets, be kept in touch with the doings of the world. The honourable member for Dalley poses as a leader of the political party professing the workers of Australia, and he charges us with negligence towards Australian industry because we do not absolutely prohibit the importation of these radio sets, or at least, impose on them a duty of 300 per cent! £6 9s. 9d. to land in Australia, but some of them are being sold here for £14. what price would the Australian sets be sold? The honourable member said that it is a common thing for retailers to muling to the public, and they are just as likely to multiply the Australian price of £16 Ss. 4d. by three. Does he think that the retailers will sell the Australian product just to serve Australian sentiment, Wireless apparatus and to help Australian manufacturers? with They will not. In this matter I am not pleading as between the manufacturers and the consumers. I am pleadingfor sanity and reasonableness as between one manufacturer and another.

He spent some little time in urging the claim of this company, which he described as a manufacturing company, to an increased duty. I have no quarrel with the company, but I want the House to understand clearly where the Government stands, and the reason why no action has been taken. The matter was dealt with before I became associated with the administration of the department. In the first place, the company is not a manufacturer of cotton threads. Actually it imports cotton thread i i . the grey, which is admitted free of duty uncler a by-law. In some cases the thread is merely wound into balls ancl sold in that form; in others, it is bleached, dyed and wound. In neither case does the value to the Australian worker represent 25 per cent, of the factory cost. The honourable member, therefore, would appear not to have made a very happy choice when he selected this company as an example. At the outset of his speech I marvelled at the extraordinary manner in which he mixed up good, bad, and indifferent cases. Apparently, in his keen desire to obtain the goodwill of manufacturers, he is prepared to undertake cheerfully the task of appealing for a duty whenever one is sought. This company does not spin yarn in Australia, it does not use a pound of Australian grown cotton, nor, so far as we can tell, is it a potential user of the Australian product. Board support its application? pany requested the Tariff Board to recommend a deferred duty of 25 per cent. British and 35 per cent, foreign on sewing threads and sewing cotton. In August, 1925, the board made a recommendation in those terms; yet we are now told that the company is unable to carry on! quent application. From the evidence and the facts that we have before us, it appears certain that if we acceded to the request of the company we should inflict an economic hurt upon the people of this country, especially tlie working people, rather than confer a benefit on auy little group of workers. Board recqmmend an additional duty? with the recommendation of the Tariff Board; I have never seen it. But apparently the Government refused to proceed further iu the matter. I have had the opportunity to review the whole position in regard to protection, and it is my belief that if there is anything wrong with Australian industry, it is due not to the ineffectiveness of the existing tariff so much as to the shortcomings and extremism of the various factions that are represented by honourable members opposite. I have listened attentively to the lecturette that has been delivered by the Minister to those who, in their political lifetime, have been associated with a score or more of tariffs. Dictation from himi so early in his administrative career comes with rather a bad grace. My object in rising, however, is to give honourable members an illustration of the manner in which discipline is enforced in the Royal Australian Navy by officers who bave been imported into it from overseas in recent years. I do not say that they are all harsh iu their disciplinary methods, but if we wish to induce Australian boys to join our navy, we must see that they are treated as humans and not hi accordance with the not the Tariff harsh laws that governed the discipline of the ratings iu the British navy some years ago. PerhapsI can best illustrate my meaning by relating what happened to one of our young naval men during a recent trip to Honolulu in HMAS. Brisbane, and subsequently upon the return of the vessel to Sydney, not as the result of a decision of a court martial or a civil court, but at the instigation of the commander. His wages and the allowa subseance to his wife were stopped, he was lodged in Long Bay gaol, and dismissed from the navy because he had indulged in a prank.

131,Mr Watkins (Newcastle) [3.20],"for a searching inquiry. follows:The officers and man of HMAS. Adelaide commissioned HMAS. Brisbane on 2Sth June, 1928, taking the cruiser over from the dockyard, where she had lain for twenty months undergoing a refit ancl alterations to the boilers a t ' a cost of £100,000. On taking over it was found that most of the auxiliary machinery and oil fuel system, &e., was in a terrible state, and far from serviceable for an extended sea trip. The engine-room department worked nobly, both day and night, to bring order and efficiency to machinery that was in such a state as can only be described as deplorable, and a monument to public money criminally wasted. To make tlieir work more diflicult, they were forced to work under Engineer-Commander C. J. Colthurst, an imported officer and an efficient engineer, per book. As a practical engineer he was a hindrance to men who knew tlieir work, and his knowledge of handling men was confined to abuse and sneering remarks. In spite of the handicap, the Brisbane was patched up sufficiently for her to put to sea on Oth July for a f u l l power trial, which resulted in several breakdowns, and the attainment of 24 knots per hour as against the possible 27 knots recorded before her relit. Again, tlie work was rushed in an effort to make the ship seaworthy before commencing the cruise to Honolulu, and at the same time the paymaster saw f it to enforce misplaced economy by reducing the already inferior food supplies. .Reduced rations, bad food and overwork, naturally lead to discontent and murmuring against those responsible for such conditions, and these conditions were aggravated by Kngineer-Coramunder Colthurst making a public threat to break the hearts of every man under him. A t Brisbane, the common feeling was shown in a poem which appeared on the lower deck notice-board. The poem, which was greeted by the lower deck rating as expressing their v iews, but by the officers as a display of bolshcvism and threatening mutiny, is as' follows :To Whomi t may Concern. ""Oh Mr think you well, Before you sweat the men below: And make their lives a living Hell, Advice for you is take it slow. Britannia rules the Seven Seas, And Britons won't be slaves; And A""ussies come from British stock, And live in modern days. The press-gang's dead and out of date, The flagellator's done; And officers can't bully men, As did the brutal Hun. So take this good advice from me, And rule with lighter hand, Before you raise the ire aud wrath Of the black-faced ""Dust-hole"" Mr Watkins. It reads as They work like Helli n Hell beneath, ' To drive this cursed ship; Yout r y to break the hearts of men, W h o ' w ill not stand the whip. Three rings you have, be satisfied: And lead an easy l if e; Be tolerant to your working hand, And save a lot of strife. For all of them are easy led, But drive them you may not; For furnace doors are easily swung, Ancl fires are mighty hot. On obtaining a copy of the poem, Captain G. C. Harrison mustered all the ship's officers on the quarter deck and read it out to them, following it up by a. soul-searing and'withering speech on the bullying tactics used towards their men, by several officers whom he pointed out. Efforts were now made to find the perpetrator of the offending poem, and it being known that I had published poetry in the Naval Depot Journal, I at once became a suspect. En route to Suva, when at work in the engineer's office, the master-at-arms, accompanied by the senior engineer, entered and demanded to search me and my belongings for a copy of the poem. Their search was unrewarded, but next clay I was taken before the commander for investigation, but no charge was laid against me. Efforts to find the author were now redoubled, and tlie senior engineer, Lieutenant R. Rowlands, interviewed a number of stokers privately, and used every inducement to make one come forward as a witness against me. The stokers are not "" Officers and Gentlemen,"" and, therefore, have a sense of honour which prevented them giving way to what almost amounted to bribery. A t 6 a.m. on tlie 21st AugustI was in the engineer's office waiting' for the coal tallies, and killed time by typing several poems, including tlie one in question. Chief Stoker Delang entered the oflice, and seeing what I was typing merely smiled and . went away. Two hours later I was 'charged before the officer of the watch with "" Inciting mutiny and printing seditious literature,"" and he placed me under sentry's charge. Two days later I was formally charged before the commander, who remanded me to appear before Captain Harrison. Captain Harrison, after a very brief hearing, remanded me under close arrest, as there seemed some difficulty in deciding the charge against me. This difficulty appears to have been considerable, for the next seven days I lay in an evil-smelling cell-flat, in the bows of the ship, and underneath the latrines, suffering all the discomforts possible, in a confined space with the temperature well over 100 degrees. The 30th AugustI was again taken before the captain, the charge being altered to one of:-""For, that he being a person subject to Naval Discipline Act, did type poetry, the subject-matter of whicli is subversive to band. naval discipline."" Little or no evidence was offered, but I was -remanded for punishment and returned to the cell-flat to await 4 o'clock, when my warrant was to be read out. A t 2 o'clock that afternoon I was hurriedly sent for to appear before the captain again, when I was surprised to learn that the charge was now altered to two definite charges, viz.:1. "" D i d wilfully conceal and otherwise retain literature, the subject-matter said it would be forwarded to Navy Office for of which was to the prejudice of good order nnd naval discipline."" 2. "" D i d type verses the subject-matter of which is subversive to uaval_ discipline."" Nothing more, beyond the reading of the charges, took place, and I was again returned to the cell-flat. The warrant was not read that night, but the following afternoon, learning that the warrant was to'be read out that night, under the altered charge, I sent for Lieutenant E. Good, who hud been detailed to act on my behalf as prisoner's friend, and told him to inform the captain that I demanded a court martial, as I considered I was being subjected to sharp practice. back that I was not entitled to a court martini, as this privilege was only granted to chief and petty officers, but that the captain would re-open the case next day. Next day the case opened with Captain Harrison acting both as prosecuting officer and judge, but the first charge fell through owing to the contradictory nature of Chief Stoker Delangs' evidence. The second charge was a farce, for when I asked Captain Harrison for a definition of "" Subversive to naval discipline,'' he was unable to give me one, as were the other officer's whom lie consulted. evident ignorance, he took a high stand and informed me that "" I do not consider it my place to enlighten your ignorance."" After several other questions, he asked me one tliat I consider a trap question, and I objected on those grounds, only to be told that "" I do not cure a damn what you object to, for it is my intention to break down your evidence, and I want you to get that into your bloody, thick head."" The hearing ended at this point, but at 4 p.m. that evening my warrant was read out to the ship's company, sentencing me t« 90 days' hard labour in Long Bay Penitentiary, but before the warrant was completed I gave notice of appeal and demanded to see a superior officer. I was then taken below and confined in a locked cell under sentry's charge. I was now given 24 hours to reconsider my appeal, and' informed that I could call on any officer on the ship to assist me. Already an officer, Lieutenant Good, had been detailed off to act on my behalf, but I very soon received proof that he was betraying my confidence. I therefore decided to select an officer who was also a gentleman with some sense' of honour, and at the same time carry the war into my prosecutor's camp, by selecting Mr definition of the said charge being refused Owen, the captain's secretary, whom I knew to possess considerable knowledge ofKing's Bules and Regulations and Admiralty Instructions. On the 5th September I again saw the captain to state my grounds for appeal, but could make very little headway owing to his blustering, bullying manner, the time being spent in threats to Mr Owen as to what would happen to him if I persisted in my appeal. Captain Harrison disallowed my appeal, but their consideration when we reached Newcastle on the 13th September. On the 15th September I was transferred to Long Ba.y Penitentiary, where I received the same treatment as other prisoners. Time after time. I wrote to the Brisbane and to the Navy Office to ask about the appeal, but it was not until half my sentence was completed that I received word through the governor that Navy Office could not consider any appeal. So for three months I suffered all that a prisoner can suffer, with the added knowledge that my allotment to my wife was stopped, and she was left to shift for herself. On 28th November, 1928, I was discharged from Long Bay and from the Navy, without being paid The reply came the £40 deferred pay due to ine. I wrote to tlie Naval Secretary twice before being informed that having been discharged from the Service, "" Services no longer required,"" I was not entitled to payment. Shortly after my release I went aboard the Brisbane, in order to obtain a copy of the Summary of Evidence, but the Commander refused to see me, but said that Navy Office would not allow me a copy. Finally, I was ordered off the ship, and since then I believe a notice has been posted on Garden Island to the effect that I am to be refused entry to the island or to any of H . M . To hide his Ships. W. MOLINEUX, Ex Stoker, HMAS. Brisbane. 2oth January, 1929. COPY OF APPEAL. I , Walter Francis Molineux, stoker, official number 18154, hereby give notice of appeal against the sentence of 90 days' imprisonment in Long Bay Penitentiary, with hard labour, awarded me on board HMAS. Brisbane, by Warrant No. 10, dated 31st August, 1928. The following are my grounds for appeal:1. Warrant No. 10 was* read under section 43 of the Naval Discipline Act, the charge being, "" F o r that he then being a person subject to the Naval Discipline Act, was guilty of an aet to the prejudice of good order and naval discipline in that he did type poetry, the subject inatter of which is subversive to naval discipline."" This alleged charge does not come under Article 43 of the Naval Discipline Act, vide Manual of Naval Law and Oourt Martia l Procedure, page 173 (Stevens, Clifford and Smith, 4th edition) : vide also section 43, note ( P ) , page 77 of Admiralty Memorandum on Naval Court Martial Procedure. "" 2. I have been punished on a. charge which I definitely stated I did not understand, a me by Captain Harrison. 3. In the absence of any proof of any intention on my part of publishing, distributing or otherwise communicating to a second party, or exhibiting in any shape or form the poetry which I typed, I have not committed a breach of naval discipline. 4. The prosecution has proved nothing more than my admission-that I typed poetry. 5. I ""wish to have a f u l l and careful reexamination and investigation of the case brought against me with a view to producing evidence which wil l prove that I am the victim of prejudice and conspiracy in so far as I was retained, in contravention of King's Kegulations and Admiralty Instructions, article 1510, clause 2, in the engineer's office by a deliberate attempt to assist, inveigle and otherwise aid and abet my committing an offence whicli could be made the nature bf a charge. I produced two witnesses in support of this, Chief Writer Meredith and a leading writer, name not known, who were told by the senior engineer, Lieutenant R.

Of course, there must be. discipline on all ships. I realize that there cannot be more than one captain; but, in modern times, if we are to have vessels manned by young Australians, we must not adopt a form of discipline that was in vogue centuries ago in controlling far less enlightened men than the young men of to-day. That sort of discipline was characteristic of the press gang days, when men were exiled to this country. The young man to whom I have referred was employed in the stokehold where the atmosphere is very hot, particularly in tropical zones. Simply because the men complained of their food, and this young fellow broke out into verse about it, he received the drastic punishment that I have mentioned; but was given no trial whatever. He was driven out of the Navy, his name is discredited, and his wife was left to starve while he was serving in gaol, although a month before that his verses had been gladly accepted for publication in the Naval Gazette. It is scandalous, and a disgraceful episode in the history of the Australian Navy. age of The sooner the Minister has a thorough inquiry instituted into the trip of that vessel the better it will be. Those who were responsible for the immense cost said to have been incurred in putting the ship in order, and also for the bad food that the members of the Navy were asked to eat, should be dealt with. The fact that Australian naval men put the machinery in order after the cruiser left the dock-yard in Australian waters, irrespective of the action of the British officer in brow-beating them, and saying that he would break the hearts of the men in the engine-room, stands to their credit. We do not require discipline of that sort in the Navy. We are well aware, as the young man pointed out in the verses that I have read, that Australians can be led, and under a capable commander would go through hell iu order to accomplish a good purpose; but they will not suffer what this boy has been forced to submit to, whether on land or sea. What right have we to expect the men on an Australian naval ship to eat rotten food? Honourable members know of the condiTreatment tions in the stokehold of a warship, particularly when it is travelling at high speed in tropical waters; in order to drive the vessel along at 27 knots, the men, stripped to the buff, steaming with perspiration, feed at feverish pace the ravenous furnaces. They must have good food to maintain their strength and remain fit. Because the men on the Brisbane were being given bad food, this",35,Second Eeading

The captain, who tried him, was both prosecutor and judge, and threatened the men in language too foul to be repeated, that he would break the hearts of every one of them. If the Minister ascertains that this officer acted as I have . described, he should take immediate steps to remove him from tha Australian Navy. I referred this matter to the Department of the Navy many months ago, and received the usual reply; even I was almost frightened by their description of this young fellow as an evil-doer, who was seeking to cause mutiny on the ship. NowI have the offender's own version of what occurred, and if only half of his statement is true, the Government should take action at once to restore him to his former position, and compensate him for the injustice that has been done to him. The Minister should have enough concern for the credit of the Australian Navy to ensure that the boys who join it are not subjected to this kind of thing. Discipline is essential, but there is a difference between discipline and brutality. Any common sense commander would have regarded the man's poetical effusion as a joke, or, at worse, a minor offence calling fora mild reprimand. Instead of that, the man was sent to prison, and his wife and children might have starved. I have read of nothing worse in the history of the British Navy, and the Minister should not allow 24 hours to pass without instituting a searching inquiry into the incident. I feel sure that the Minister will realize that a thorough investigation is required. ister) [3.56] -The charges which the honourable member for Newcastle has brought to the notice of the House are of so urgent and serious a character that immediate inquiry into them is necessary. The statement he quoted contains specific allegations regarding the treatment of the men on the Brisbane, the quality of the food, the uncleanliness of the ship, and the disrepair of the machinery. Charges of this nature did the lines cannot be allowed to remain without being sifted. I can hardly believe that a young sailor was sentenced to 90 days in lieutenant prison for merely writing some verses, but I am not conversant with the facts. I shall certainly bring the honourable member's statement under the notice of the Minister for Defence immediately, and urge upon _ him the advisability of a prompt inquiry into the matter. When the Minister is in possession of the f u l l facts, I shall make a further statement in his behalf to the House."" I was one of the first to express doubts of the fiscal faith of the present Minister for Trade and Customs. I did so when returning thanks to the electors of Maribyrnong at the declaration of the poll after the recent general elections. I was afraid that the Minister might prove to be, as some other honourable members in this chamber have been, a fiscal atheist, but I was not sure. Having heard his statement to-day, I say unhesitatingly that he is not a friend of Australian industry. Unfortunately the Minister seems to be obsessed by the idea that only industries established in a large way are worth protecting. If he practises that policy many Australian industries will be murdered in their infancy. Honourable members know very well that some of our most important manufacturing concerns began under very inauspicious circumstances. The inventor of the Sunshine harvester for instance, began his work in his father's backyard. Had the present Minister for Trade and Customs been in office at the time that man would probably not have been encouraged when he needed help. Patents are being taken out every day for new inventions, and some of these may lead to most beneficial results for our people.

The introduction of this bill gave the Treasurer an appropriate opportunity to give us some information about our financial position, but he neglected to accept it. Parliament will go into recess next week, and as the Government is asking for two months' supply, it seems that honourable members may not be called together again until the second week in September. That is all the more reason why the Treasurer should have said something about the financial outlook. I have taken pains to obtain certain figures with the object of ascertaining, as well as a private member may do, the general financial situation, and I find that it is not at all satisfactory. I asked a question on this subject to-day, and was disappointed that the Treasurer did not intimate that he would deal with it at some length when introducing this bill. He informed us, however, that in 1926-27 our revenue from £43,554,000, and that in 1927-28 it totalled only £41,446,000, a fall of more than £2,000,000. The estimated customs and excise revenue for this year is £43,300,000, or an increase of £1,854,000 over the previous year. But it is most unlikely that this expectation will be realized, for we are already more than £1,000,000 in arrears. It seems that we may be faced on the 30th June with a deficit in customs and excise revenue alone of more than £5,000,000. I hope that this forecast may prove to be inaccurate, but there is a likelihood of it. Seeing that we had big surpluses in so many successive years, the observation made some time ago by the present Minister for' Trade and Customs, that Australia is afflicted with the most tragic Treasurer it ever had, appears justified. I regret that the Minister for Trade and Customs is, himself, turning out to be a tragic failure. association with the Treasurer in the Cabinet is not only a double tragedy, but a national tragedy. I sincerely hope that the financial position will show considerable improvement in the next three and a half months; but even then we shall' be faced with a serious financial position. Mr Fenton. Some time ago the Minister for Trade and Customs said, at a function in Sydney, that he was a great believer in mergers and combines. I do not desire to make any personal remarks, but I am of the opinion that the honourable gentleman owes his position in the Ministry to the influence of certain big business interests behind him. I am rather sorry that the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) is not present, so that he might tell us something of the negotiations going on at present for a merger of certain big commercial interests. A good deal has been said today about the United States of America. I do not by any means approve of everything that the Government of the United States of America does; but we could with advantage follow its example in certain respects. While I am opposed, speaking generally, to the setting up of boards and commissions, which in this country have been mainly useless and expensive, I feel that we should be well advised to follow the customs and excise totalled example of the Government of the United States of America and establish a board with power to act iu the event of big business interests merging to the detriment of the general public. The Hogan Government of Victoria, which held office for an altogether' too limited period, showed what could be done in that regard. Certain complaints were made that a combine was being established in restraint of trade. The Government immediately directed a qualified oflicer to inquire into the subject. The result was that the projected move was abandoned. Later, another complaint of the same character was made, and the Government directed the same officer to inquire into the matter. He did so, and his report was submitted to Parliament, which was . able to protect the interests of the people. I believe that the constitutional power of this Parliament should be extended to enable it to deal effectively with trusts His and combines, but we could do a great ideal more than we are doing under the existing power. While the late Mr T. J. Ryan was a member of this House, during the regime of the Hughes Government, he informed the Prime Minister that if permission were granted to him to draft a bill to protect the people against trusts and combines, and Parliament would pass it, lie would be prepared, as a legal practitioner, to defend it iu all tbe law courts of this country, and even in tbe Privy Council. He had not tbe slightest doubt that if Parliament bad legislated upon a specific subject, that legislation would have been upheld. Judging from recent decisions of the High Court, we have far more power than we thought. I believe that the rubber merger is one upon which the Minister for Trade and Customs has pronounced his blessing. He said that there was a great merger in course of being effected, and that it had his approval. They may, of course, be merging to save overhead expenses, but the matter should be inquired into. Recently we had a visit from Sir Eric Geddes, whom I consider to be a far more brainy business man than any of the "" Big Eour"" who were recently in this country. He held a high position in the British Cabinet during the war, and is now associated with very large business interests. It may or may not be a coincidence that the merger between the Dunlop, Barnet Glass and Perdriau rubber companies is being brought about just following his visit. There ought to be some means of investigating such combinations, ancl if they are injurious to the people as a whole, they should be stopped. The matter which I am now about to introduce will, I know, render me taboo to many of the great journals of Australia, but that cannot be helped; I refer to the great newspaper combination now in course of formation in Australia. Indeed, it has been partly formed already. The originators of this combine were the proprietors of the Herald and Weekly Times newspapers of Melbourne. Recently they purchased a number of other newspapers, paying, in some cases, immense sums for them. I understand that purchases have been made in Brisbane, and prior to that the company purchased several papers in Melbourne, thus destroying competition. In the past the two Adelaide newspapers, the Register and the Advertiser were in two opposite political camps in South Australia. The Register practically supported a policy of free trade; at any rate it was the Tory organ of South Australia. The Advertiser was regarded as a protectionistpapers, because I know quite well that paper, and leaned towards what we may call liberal thought. These newspapers have now been acquired by the interests associated with the Herald and Weekly Times Company. I have it upon very reliable authority that the proprietors of the Advertiser were paid or received interests to the amount of £1,250,000. I have no doubt that the proprietors of the Register also received large compensation. The Mercury in Hobart, and newspapers in ""Western Australia and in Sydney are also in association with this group. not in the combine. perhaps, have fallen through, but I know there was some nibbling done. Those who control this great combination will have an immense influence in this country for good or ill . I know of one instance in which it is pushing into the political life of Australia, with the approval of some honourable members in this House, representatives who are the curled darlings of the interests concerned. analogous with the One Big Union. but I may inform the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) that such combinations, whether of newspaper interests or not, will bring the trade unionists of Australia into one big camp. Nothing could be better calculated to infuse vitality into the trade union movement of Australia. There are some important newspapers in Australia which are not concerned in this combination. These are newspapers which were established in the past by great families which bear an honoured name throughout Australia; newspapers which have long and honourable traditions behind them. The Melbourne Age is not in the combine. It was established by the late Mr David Syme many years ago, and has a long record of service to the community. The Sydney Morning Herald will not, I believe, join any such combine.. It was established by the Fairfax family, and has built up a great reputation. The Melbourne Argus, established by the Mackinnon family, is not in the combine. I am under no compulsion to pay any meed of praise to these",39,Second Eeading

It is time that the Ministry became alive to the fact that combinations are being formed in Australia that may have a detrimental effect upon our people. A feeling of disgust has been engendered because of the manner in which the Government has dallied witb the wireless question. Tbe number of listeners-in is rapidly decreasing, particularly in Victoria, because they know that the bulk of the money which they pay into the public Treasury finds its way into the pockets of private individuals. former occasion, I showed that the broadcasting station 3LO in Melbourne, with a capital of only £6,000, received, in eighteen months, a revenue of £110,000. The Government has now purchased the A-class stations, after vested interests have .been created. Although the Postmaster-General has shown a willingness to furnish the House with some information, he has not stated what amount is being paid for those stations. Later, it is any intention to ask him to supply details of the exact terms upon which they were purchased, so that we may ascertain how much greater has been the cost than it would have been if they had been established originally by the Commonwealth Government. It appears to me that ever since the present Government has been in oflice, it has been playing up to "" big business,"" "" greasing the fat pig,"" and doing what will ultimately prove detrimental to the people of Australia. I take advantage of this opportunity to relate the difficulty that I have experienced in my endeavour to obtain ordinary postal facilities for country districts. On more than one occasion, I have stated in this House that in regard to requirements of this character, the Postmaster-General's Department appears to take into consideration the political colour political patronage would be given to of the applicant. been challenged, but I still adhere to it, and I shall refer to incidents that have occurred to demonstrate that at least there is some reason for my belief. If there is one thing more than another that I have worked hard to secure, it is a new post office for the district of Burmaster-General, the matter was investigated, and had he remained in charge of the department, this very necessary facility would have been provided. He realized even at that time that the post office was in a very dilapidated state, ancl promised that a new building would be erected. Preliminary action towards that end was taken, but he went out of office ancl the (matter has since been in abeyance. I wish to show the methods that are adopted by certain Nationalist candidates to try to wrest a seat from an opponent. At the last election, I was opposed by a Mr Ogilvie, On a and in the course of his campaign he went to Burrowa. In conversation with two or three persons whom he considered were opponents of mine, but who, unfortunately for him, were my strong supporters, he said, "" You have not much of a post office here. What is your federal member doing? I suppose that, being in opposition, he has not much chance of getting you a new one. If I win the seat, I shall be on the Government side, and I shall get you a new post office."" That statement indicates that he believed that political patronage would be giveu to those who supported the Government. Now let us consider the statement of a far more important person, the Prime Minister himself. During the election campaign, the. right honourable gentleman realized that the then honourable member for Macquarie, Mr Manning, had an exceedingly strong opponent and would have considerable difficulty iu retaining the seat. He therefore visited the electorate and, among other towns, spoke at Lithgow. ""When he had exhausted all his political arguments without effect, he said to his audience, "" You had better put Mr Manning back, because it is better to,be represented by a man on the Government benches, than by one on the Opposition side of the House."" What inference can be drawn from such a statement than that That statement has electorates that were represented by Government supporters? The right honourable gentleman could not have made it more clear if he had stated specifically that that was the practice. My experience in this Parliament has proved to me that it is of very little use to ask for anything from the Postmaster General's department, whether it is a necessary work or not. I have many times written to the department, and the Municipal Council of Burrowa has also",41,Second Eeading

151,. Rowa. When Mr Webster,"was Postcommunicated witb. it, requesting that a name be placed on the building, so that the people would know what it was. Mr of the mailman, who recently told me Kitto replied that the words ""Post and Telegraph Office"" were printed on the window. He has not been to Burrowa, or he would not make such a stupid statement. If those words are there, they cannot be discerned at a distance of only a few feet. Mr Kitto also stated that the name would be placed on the building when repairs were effected to it . If the department spends either l d . or £1,000 in renovating that post office, it will be stupid, wanton waste. It might as well throw the money away, because the building is in such a bad condition tliat it is impossible to do anything with it. Three years ago the doors were falling out of the portion which is occupied as a residence. The foundations have gone, and altogether it is an antiquated structure that is useless for modern conditions. It is a disgrace that any person should be asked to work in the telegraph office. I should like to see either Mr Kitto or any other responsible officer carry on his work in it for any length of time. I have been making strong endeavours to have a direct trunk telephone line laid between Burrowa and Eye Park. Eepresentations in this direction have been made also by responsible organizations. The present practice is to "" cut in"" on the trunk line from Yass to Young. There is no hospital in the place, and only one policeman, who has a wide area to cover. In the event of sickness or a serious accim dent, there is a delay of an hour or more before a doctor can be summoned. The department merely declared that it realized the drawbacks under which the residents suffered, and hoped that in the near future the conditions would alter so as to make it possible to provide the line. As a matter of fact, the posts are already in position, and all that is necessary is to erect the wires. Although a cheeseparing policy is shown in country districts, the department is prodigal in the expenditure incurred in cities and large towns. The Postmaster-General is a prominent member of a p^arty that declares that its policy is to bring the advantages of civilization to rural districts; but at Rugby, a small township in my electorate, the people have been unable to Sir. Lazzarini. obtain money orders from the local post office, and are dependent upon the favours that he had carried as much as £15 or £20, with which to obtain money orders for residents from a neighbouring post office. inspector doing? sociation in the town has been endeavouring to have the anomaly rectified, aud I have been trying for many years to bring about an improvement, but the facilities provided there to-day are the same as they were when, I first became a member of this House. At the township of Clifton, on the South Coast, of New South Wales, the Postmaster General's Department has closed up the local post office, but I defy him to show that there has been any falling off in the population and progress of the district. If the population warranted the provision of a post office when the property was bought, it justifies it to a greater extent to-day, because settlement has increased. Between Helensburgh and Wollongong the number of electors on the roll has increased by 4,090. Many protests have been made against the action of the department in closing the official post office at Clifton, selling the property, and transferring the office to a private establishment. In 10 or 15 years the department may be paying four or five times as much for a new site for an official post office as they paid for the property that has just been sold. The department was asked that the postal, telegraphic and telephonic facilities be increased, and it was pointed out that by closing the official post office and establishing a semi-official office the facilities had been reduced. I have also endeavoured to get the department to erect telephones for use on the railway construction work that is proceeding along the Moss Vale to Port Kembla railway. I was told by the department that a telephone was available at Eurunderee. The men are working in mountainous country, and many serious accidents have occurred. If it were necessary to send to Wollongong for an ambulance, men should not be required",43,Second Eeading

153,Mr Lazzarini,"The Progress Asto walk three or four miles over rough mountainous country to obtain a telephone. The whole of the services between Stanwell Park and Balgownie are scandalously inadequate. The men employed along the South Coast are engaged in the dangerous work of mining, and in other industrial occupations, and they should not be expected to be content with the primitive facilities that bave been provided. Por instance, in one case a telegram was left lying in a post office for two days. announcing the death of the father of the person to whom it was addressed, and the addressee did not receive it until after his father's funeral. The telegram was left lying at the post office because it was nobody's business to deliver it. Another matter to which I direct the attention of the Postmaster-General is the unfair treatment received by a line workman named Cox at Mittagong. He was a temporary employee, and was put off because of a shortage of work, although he had been engaged by the department for. six years. He, surely, had the right to be re-employed before men who had been engaged for only a short period. Members on this side of the House have not boasted about their policy of preference to returned soldiers so much as honourable members opposite have done, but I point out that this man is a returned soldier. He had a disagreement with his foreman, and re-employment, when work was available, was refused him. The Returned Soldiers Association has taken up his case, and it demands an inquiry, but tbe department is not prepared to grant the request. The Postmaster-General is familiar with the case, and I wish him to understand that this man, who has a family dependent upon him, has been unjustly treated. The department has made no attempt to investigate or answer the case made out by the organization, and I am convinced that it is not proposed to face an inquiry. I know that it is futile to speak further on the subject; my experience of the Minister convinces me that no satisfaction can be got from him, and I hope that the Prime Minister will re-construct his -cabinet soon and appoint a new Postmaster-General. reply of ""the Minister for Trade and Customs to the remarks of the honourable member for Dalley this' afternoon surprised and disappointed me. The airy manner in which he dismissed the subject of the adverse trade balance with the United States of America, calls for strong criticism. He evaded the indictment of the honourable member and merely quoted the favorable trade balances with Japan and certain other countries withI t contained a message out giving any indication that the Government intends to deal with a situation which is becoming increasingly, serious. Jt is generally conceded that the growing adverse trade balance between Australia and the United States of America is not only damaging the interests of the Empire, but is also retarding the economic development of Australia. The problem certainly calls for' immediate action. The Government has paid a good deal of attention to the development of trade within the Empire, and has expended enormous sums on visiting delegations with that object in view, but no action has been taken to improve our trade relations with America, which have been the subject of continuous criticisms in the newspapers and considerable discussion amongst Australian manufacturers. state of the House.

No doubt the honourable members who were absent from the chamber were endeavouring to recover from the distressing effects of the honourable member's last speech. The Minister should indicate to the House in the near future how the Government proposes to correct our adverse trade balance with America. There are many means by which the present position could be improved. The problem has assumed such alarming proportions that private business men have been visiting America to try to effect an alteration of the selfish policy of the American exporters. Mr John Storey, Chairman of the automobile section of the Chamber of Manufacturers, is now visiting the United States of America for that purpose.

There is still opportunity, however, to negotiate with the Goveniment of the United States of America with a view to arriving at some reciprocal arrangement. minions are already endeavouring to pursue that principle, and there is no reason why Australia should not follow their example. The honourable member for Dalley referred to specific industries to illustrate the reluctance of the Government to carry out the recommendations of the Tariff Board. The remarks of the honourable member regarding the failure of the Government to give effect to the Tariff Board's recommendation of increased duties to assist, the sewing-thread industry, were contemptuously brushed aside by the Minister, who made no attempt to inform the House of the reasons which had actuated the Cabinet. The previous Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr directorate should endeavour to effect material Bruce) on no occasion took Parliament into his confidence in. this regard. The case in favour of the board's recommendation that additional duties should be imposed on imported cottons and threads .is overwhelmingly conclusive. The board's report was presented to Parliament ou the 13th September of last year, and had been preceded by such exhaustive inquiries that the Governmentshould have hesitated to ignore it. But having ignored it, the Minister should satisfy Parliament that the Government had substantial reasons for so doing. In the course of its report the board saidVery considerable capital (£165,000) has been invested in equipping an Australian factory to produce sewing cotton and threads W it h the product now partially manufactured in Australia, they can supply one-third of tlie total consumption-bu t their plant is stated to be capable of supplying virtually the The disregarding of the board's report is whole requirements of Australia. The Government at the time, presumably with the knowledge of the exotic nature of the industry, but no doubt with the hope that its importance would increase, even to the possible extent of using Australian-grown cotton, encouraged the industry by granting it the protection then sought. The Government, by imposing additional duties, had deliberately encouraged the investments of Australian and British Mr Coleman. capital in this industry. The board's report continuedThere is no doubt that the industry is threatened with failure, and the question now arises as to whether the Government should come to its aid with further protection through tlie tariff. Failing such further protection, there is little doubt tliat it will be hard pressed Other doto survive. This industry is threatened with bankruptcy. The capital subscribed to establish it on the strength of assurances given by a Nationalist Government is likely to be lost unless prompt action is taken in conformity with the recommendations of the board. The report continuedThe output of the local industry in cotton threads represents a material proportion of the Australian consumption (approximately one-third) and if given the further protection asked for, it appears to have a reasonable chance, with the lessons learned in the past, of at least doubling its output, of extending its processes, at first to doubling and later to spinning, when it may employ quite a large number of hands. Increased output will, it is hoped, materially reduce the now heavy overhead costs. It is suggested, however, that the reductions in the actual overhead expenditure. The Tariff Board, considering the earlier encouragement given and the present position, is of opinion that it is worthwhile tryin g to save the situation and accordingly recommends that the rates of duty on cotton sewing threads for manufacturing purposes be increased to 45 per cent. British preferential tariff, 55 per cent, intermediate tariff and 60 per cent, general tariff. The board had examined every phase of the industry and given the fullest possible consideration °to the nature of its manufacturing processes. It had heard, also, the evidence of the British manufacturers of sewing cottons and threads. Yet its report has been contemptuously ignored and no explanation has been given to the House. It is not surprising that manufacturers are beginning to doubt the fiscal bona fides of this Government. Their doubts will be increased by the speech delivered by the Minister to-day. morally indefensible. The Government is playing a confidence trick on the people who invested their capital in the industry, believing that they would receive substantial Government support. The rates of duty sought by the manufacturers are by no means excessive when compared with the rates prescribed in other parts of the tariff schedule. Consequently I hope that the Minister will elaborate the reasons which prompted the Government to reject this recommendation. It is not sumcient for him contemptuously to disregard the case submitted by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore). I direct the attention of the Minister to the delay which occurs in dealing with the recommendations of the board. The recommendation to which I have just referred was made in September last. I know of at least twenty other recommendations which have been in the hands of the Minister for extensive periods, ranging up to probably twelve months. Dealing with this subject the Australasian Manufacturer, the official organ of the Associated Ohambers of Manufactures, stated in a recent issueI f Mr Gullett would "" ginger "" up tlie produring this debate to the motor car incesses of tariff reform, whether concerning his department or the methods of Parliament, he has plenty of work at hand, some of which has waited so long that men are sick of the delay. Two applications for increased protection, favourably reported on by the Tariff Board, are telephone apparatus and sewing threads. Neither of tlie reports have been acted upon by the Government, although an exhaustive inquiry was made in each case by the board. The reasons which decided the Minister or Cabinet against the board's recommendations should be made known. It is only fair to the shareholders in the various companies interested in the recommendations of the board, and also to the people of Australia, to ask that the reason for the delay should be stated. The same report contains the following sentence:Surely the Tariff Board is the more competent to know whether or not further assistance is necessary for the welfare of the industry. Among the industries which are suffering from this delay are the following:Copper products and alloys. Metal bedsteads and fittings. Hydrogen peroxide. Synthetic menthol and thymol. Electric lamp-holders. Ironclad switchgear and circuit breakers. Tool handles of wood. Hygienic containers. Peanut butter. White lead. Millinery headwear. Ladies' handbags. Tipping trucks. Linseed oil. Milk cans. High-grade carbon steels. Wireless sets and . parts. Anti-corrosive and anti-fouling paints. Not only is there delay in dealing with the recommendations of the board, but there is also a serious delay in the hearing of applications for increased duties. I hold in my hand a list of 40 or 50 applications which are awaiting attention. I plead.with the Minister to do everything in his power to expedite the hearing of these applications, and the carrying into effect of the recommendations that the board may make from time to time. A delay of nine or twelve months in giving effect to a recommendation is a most serious matter to an industry which is struggling for its life. It is also a serious matter to the people of Australia, for it adversely influences the employment market. Extensive reference has been made dustry. I have repeatedly urged in this Parliament that a more sympathetic policy should be adopted towards the manufacturers of automotive parts. I made a number of appeals on this subject, to the predecessor of the present Minister. The establishment of the motor car industry in Australia is vital to our defence. It cannot be denied that high-grade motor cars are in the nature of a luxury. party first advocated the imposition of a duty upon component parts of motor cars, the previous Minister for Trade and Customs said that he would not be a party to the disintegration of the chassis. then I have had the pleasure of seeing a specific duty placed upon batteries, shock absorbers, bumper bars and some other chassis parts. cacy from this side of the chamber, the chassis has been almost stripped. tion to us to know that our representations on this subject have forced the Government to alter its policy. But the position is still' far from satisfactory. 5 During the first six months of the present financial year the only marked increase in imports over the corresponding six months of the preceding year, was in motor car bodies and parts, chassis and spare parts, and other metals and manufactures. The imports under these headings in the first six months of this financial year were valued at £6,640,000. The",45,Second Eeading

A person who wants a Eisher body or some other imported body on his motor car is like a man who wants a Stetson hat. There is an element of snobbery in fhe choice. The Government is entitled to place the maximum duty upon importations of this kind to increase the revenue as well as the protection of local industry. The increase in the importation of chassis and parts in the periods I am comparing, was from £3,862,000 to £4,408,000; and of other motor parts, from £996,000 to £1,258,000. These are practically the only increases that occurred in our importation of lines falling decessor had taken up the same attitude, under the' heading of metals and metal manufactures. In these circumstances I submit that the remarks of the honourable member for Dalley on this point were thoroughly justified. A superficial examination of the statistics shows that these importations are increasing, while in practically every other line they are decreasing. The encouragement of the manufacture of motor cars and motor car parts in Australia is essential, not only for defence and economic reasons, but also for cultural reasons. We need to develop our engineering industries, so that we may not be helpless in the event of our becoming isolated by war or any other calamity. The honourable member for Dalley also rightly advocated that a greater measure of protection should be granted to Australian radio manufacturers in order that they may be able to withstand unfair competition from abroad. In my opinion, the Minister made a misleading comparison in dealing with this subject. quoted-the landed cost of a certain fivefor Dalley said that the radio sets were of valve radio set as £6 9s? for Dalley first quoted that figure. I merely repeated it. some unfair deductions from the data submitted by the honourable member for Dalley. Every one knows that before the manufacture of radio sets was undertaken in Australia the price of imported sets was prohibitive.

The honourable member for Dalley also referred to springs for Eord motor cars, and pointed out that, whereas the American price of them is 4s. 2d. retail, the price in Australia, until they were manufactured here, was 15s. In consequence of Australian competition the price has now been reduced to 7s. 3d. no duty would have been imposed on motor springs, on the ground that it would have required one of 300 per cent, to be effective. Minister puts forward the traditional free-trade argument usually advanced by honourable members who sit in the corner. t The price of Ford car seven-leaf springs in America is 4s. 2d. Before there was competition from Australian manufacturers, those springs were sold in Australia for 15s. That is an instance in which an article was sold here for three times its value. Under the influence of Australian competition the price was reduced in Australia to 7s. 3d. Surely there is an analogy between that and the case submitted by the honourable member for Dalley in regard to radio sets. It is generally admitted that wireless sets are being dumped into this country. America is over-producing, and she is dumping her cheaper radio sets into Australia. the same quality as the Australian article. sets are vastly superior.

Not only were high duties imposed, but the atrocious Anti-Dumping Act was passed. This act gave the Minister the most extraordinary powers, enabling him to impose duties, or increase them, on any goods coming into the country if he considered the landed price to be less than that fixed by the Australian manufacturers. Even that did not suffice and since the formation of the composite Government we have had three drastic increases in the duties imposed in .1920. The Minister for Trade and Customs, at a dinner given by the Chamber of Manufactures in Sydney, pointed out how good this Government had been to the manufacturers. This Government is supposed to be keenly desirous of protecting the interests of the primary producers. They have to -compete in the markets of the world, and create the wealth which enables us to give favorable living conditions to the people as a whole. If the primary industries were destroyed, there would follow a bad time for the people of Australia. I am not "" croaking,"" but every one must realize that there is danger ahead. We are getting wonderful prices for wool now, yet the profit on wool is less than it was in 1914, high costs, and farmers are ceasing to grow wheat, and going in for sheep, because wheat does not pay. The man who grows wheat is justified in charging interest on the capital value of his land, and, over and above his expenses, he should be able to secure a profit on his outlay. It is our duty to see that evenhanded justice is meted out to every section of the community; but if there are to be concessions they should be given first to the man on the land. I wish to revert, to the subject of the country will benefit. That being so, every tariff, and to show how good this Government has been to Australian manufacturers. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Gullett) at a meeting which he attended recently in Sydney, pointed out how generous the Government had been since 1921 in regard to the tariff. He stated that the number of items upon which a duty of 30 per cent, was imposed had increased from 325 to 359; those upon which a duty of 40 per those upon which"" a duty of 50 per cent, was imposed, from 34 to 70 items, and those upon which a duty of 60 per cent, was imposed, from two to six items. The Tariff Board itself has a word to say on this subject. I quote the following paragraph from its report:Again' ancl again applications are made for tariff assistance commensurate with the difference in costs of production in Australia and abroad. Many applications have succeeded, and the tariff wall is markedly rising. In the Customs Tariff 1008, there were only eight items whicli provided ad valorem duties of 40 per cont. or over. Of these six wore W per cent, and the remaining two 45 per ceni. In tlie existing Customs Tariff there are 259 items or sub-items which provide ad valorem rates of 40 per ceift. or over as set out hereunder:93 providing 4.0 per cent. 72 providing 45 per cent. 35 providing 50 per cent. 19 providing 55 per cent. 3S providing 00 per cent. 2 providing 05 per cent. (For the purpose of the above comparison the rates under the General Tariff only have been used.) The disparity, comparing 1908 with 1928 in duties framed on specific lines, i.e., per ton, per gallon, per pound, and the like, is probably equally as great as the disparity existing in the ad valorem rates. in some instances owing to The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) has argued that it is necessary to build up new industries. I ask him and other protectionists how secondary industries can be built up if the cost of the raw material they require is so increased that they cannot compete in Australia with those of outside countries, unless extraordinarily high duties are placed upon imported articles, such as they manufacture. Iron, steel and copper are basic materials for other industries. The building up of an iron aud steel industry is a national work, and if it is done successfully, the whole person in the community should be compelled tb contribute towards any assistance given to the industry.

During the last eight or ten years we have brought about a vicious circle, which as time goes on will have a more and more baneful influence. I ask honourable members to cast their minds back to 1921, when the big tariff was inprophesied a wonderful future and the elimination of unemployment as a result of its operation. Since that time Ave have had good harvests throughout Australia practically every year, and the highest prices that have ever been obtained for primary products. Loan money totalling over £200,000,000 has been expended, and the tariff has been raised considerably on three occasions; yet the unemployment is greater to-day than it has ever been considerably larger. Is it because Australian manufacturers charge too much, or that they are incompetent? Is it due to a slowing down on the part of the workers? Our workers are the equal of any in munity in which the general body of the public is so well educated as in Australia. Why, then, should we need all this protection ? Many of our members appear to possess a machine-like mentality. I cannot imagine why they permit themselves to be gulled as they are, for all these restrictions reduce the real value of wages and operate against the worker. There is not the slightest doubt that a small, but nevertheless a powerful and selfish minority, has dictated our economic policy. PerhapsI may be permitted to refer to a request that was made to the Tariff Board for the removal of the duty on pyrites. South Australia and New South Wales are fairly well served in that they have the zinc slimes from which they can obtain sulphuric acid. We in Western Australia, however, depend wholly on the importations of brimstone or raw sulphur from the United States of America.

186,Mr Geegory,"What is the reason ?who were the only persons sending sulphur to Australia. Sulphur is required in the manufacture, of sulphuric acid, which is used in the production of superphosphates. A request was made by the Rio Tinto Company, in Spain, that the duty on pyrites should be removed, so that they might be imported into Australia. That company did not desire a market for that commodity in Australia other than in Western Australia. Imported pyrites would mean a slight reduction in the cost of manufacturing superphosphates. Among those who supported the removal of that duty were the Cresco Fertilizers Limited, Adelaide, Sulphide Corporation Limited, New South Wales, and the general manager of the Ammonia Company of Australia, which also carries on business in New South Wales. The only opposition came from the National Mining Corporation of Great Britain, the company interested in the mine at Lake George, New South Wales, where it was said that it would be possible to produce pyrites. .Probably that company will be able to supply that commodity to the New South Wales market, but surely it could sell it at a lower price than that of the pyrites brought all the way from Spain to Sydney, with the advantage, also, °of a bounty on the acid produced. The Co-operative Company, Victoria, with protested against the duty being removed, under the impression that they would be compelled to use the imported article, but there was no justification for that idea. In the report of the Tariff Board a most extraordinary statement occurs, showing where the influence is coming from. It is as follows:The only advantage that might accrue', by the removal of the duty is that the price of sulphur would bo prevented from rising above n certain figure. Ou this aspect it is evident that it is the world competition between pyrites -and sulphur, and not the competition between the two in Australia that governs the price of sulphur. tained by the board in the course of the inquiry, relative to the comparative costs of production of sulphuric acid from imported brimstone sulphur and from Australian convinces the board that if the price of imported materially above its present level, there would then bo a sufficient inducement to mine and roast Australian pyrites with sulphur recovery as the main objectives. Mr Gregory. 7 We could not have the duties taken off sulphur until we gave the rich mining companies a bounty on all sulphur they took from the sulphide slimes or pyrites that they might produce in their mines. If these companies manufactured sulphuric acid from their pyritic ore, bounty would also be payable on that acid. The report goes on to sayOn the other hand, if a large and influential overseas company were given a foothold in the Australian superphosphates business, it might easily lead to its control operating against existing interests without advantaging the user of superphosphate. It is an extraordinary statement to say. that if they imported pyrites into Australia they would try to make superphosphate. The board is supposed to be watching the interests of the producers in Australia, whether primary or secondary, yet it brings forward a hardly plausible excuse of this sort for the purposes of retaining the duty on pyrites. Not more than 10 per cent of the people of Australia benefit from a high protective duty. I cannot understand how the workers of Australia permit themselves to be gulled by being told that a high tariff tends to bring prosperity to them. -Yet, hundreds of thousands of intelligent citizens labour under that delusion. markable than the fact that thousands of S,000 shareholders, farmers have been gulled by the Country party. opposite should urge them to follow the example of the Labour party in Great Britain, which does not support the policy of high protection When Australia was recognized by the League of Nations as an independent nation, we were proud, indeed, of the fact, and it was considered that it would be a statesmanlike policy, if we could persuade the various islands adjoining Australia to be friendly with us, and have closer trade relations with us. Fiji's trade with the Confidential information obCommonwealth amounted to about £250,000 a year, and the goods that we were sending to F i j i were valued at about pyrites, £750,000; but we destroyed that trade, ancl also lost the friendship of that brimstone sulphur should rise country.

By imposing duties on goods coming in from Javaduties which were passed in this chamber but, fortunately, were altered in the other branch of the Legislature-a n attempt was made to restrict trade with that country. If we place restrictions on neighbouring countries, they are bound to retaliate. The Netherlands allowed Australian butter to be exported to Java on the same basis as its own. Although it could have imposed restrictions on our butter, it did not do so; but we imposed a special duty on coffee from Java as against Indian coffee. The Economic Committee of the League of Nations has pointed outNo machinery for the settlement of international disputes can be relied upon to maintain peace, if the economic policies of the world so develop as to create, not only deep divergencies of economic interest. between the different masses of the world's population, but a sense of intolerable injury and injustice. We should urge workers and employers to come together, and try to bring about a better feeling than now exists between them. telligent ancl energetic as those of other countries, and, with reasonable tariff restrictions, we should be able to compete with them. I do uot wish to undermine the Avhole tariff wall, but I am afraid of the corruption that results from a policy of high protection. If we are not careful we shall kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. We should foster and encourage the primary industries that have helped to build up our wonderful prosperity of the past. We have an enormous number of unemployed in our midst, but from what source can the Government obtain the money that is required to carry on important national work, if wealth is not produced in this country? We should leave the worker and the manufacturer to come together of their own accord. If we do that, they will bring about a far better result than can be obtained by continuing the present fiscal policy. I have no desire to cast reflections upon any section. Honourable members opposite think that, if the Government passed certain legislation, and had certain control, the interests of the workers would be best served, but, up to the present time, all our industrial legislation has miserably failed. In view of the huge expenditure of public money that has been incurred, the good seasons that we have enjoyed and the high prices that have been obtained for our products, there must be something radically wrong when acute and widespread unemployment exists in a country like ours, which should carry a population of 20,000,000. While on a trip through the south-western portion of Western Australia's agricultural districts recently, I saw small areas cultivated, and very large areas undeveloped, because of lack of capital; but I realized the wonderful opportunities of that country for production. Organizations such as the Australian Mutual Provident Society proudly advance their millions when Commonwealth loans are, floated; but it would be far better if that money remained with such companies, ancl was used in building up industries.

There was also a debate on the constitution of the Tariff Board, ancl I urged strbngly that the chairman should not be an official of the Customs Department. I have always feared the possibility of political influence being exercised on the board, and I have thought that the Government should seek to place on it strong independent men, who could devote themselves to tariff questions without being influenced by the political convictions of any Minister or party. In dealing with the application for the removal of the duty on pyrites, which would have given our people protection against the American sulphur exporters, and would have slightly reduced the cost of superphosphates, the Tariff Board used this argumentOn the other hand, if a large and influential overseas company were given a foothold in the Australian superphosphates business, it might easily lead to its control, operating against existing interests without advantaging the user of the superphosphate.

The hoard is afraid that if a British comton? pany entered into a contract for the supply of pyrites, it might obtain a foothold in Australia. might invest its capital in establishing works here and so interfere with the profits of those already engaged in the production of superphosphates. ""We should encourage people to invest their capital in the Commonwealth, and especially when they are prepared to produce a cheap fertilizer which will help the development of primary production. I remind the House of what happened in connection with the endeavour to import diammon phos. Germans were unable to import nitrates from abroad and their scientists developed a .scheme for extracting nitrates from the atmosphere. After the war, it was found tliat these nitrates could be used as a fertilizer, and in a few years' time, areas that had been starved of fertilizer for some time were brought back to the old stage of productivity. makers of this fertilizer, given the name of di-ammon. phos, then sought the co-operation of British capitalists in introdiicing and marketing it in different countries until such time as local works for its production could be established.

When, however, a consignment of diammon phos was imported, the Department of Trade and Customs refused to allow it to be admitted as a fertilizer. direction must be brought about The importers had to pay exceedingly heavy duty at the rates prescribed for chemicals. That action was unwise. If these nitrates had been admitted as a ferand clothing range up to 250 per cent, tilizer, and had been proved to have been of value in the treatment of Australian soils, a factory for the production of nitrate from the air would have been established in Tasmania before long. Thus a valuable new industry would have been created, which might have played an important part in increasing the production of wealth from the soil. Mr Gregory. when duty was paid at the rate applicable In other words it to chemicals I think the landed cost was between £20 and £24 per ton. This incident is another proof that the primary producer does not receive the consideration to which he is entitled. Many honourable members regard me as an uncompromising free trader who is determined to destroy the protective policy, but I ask them to compare my remarks from time to time with the following criticism of the tariff policy of the present Government, published in During the war the The Countryman; the official organ of the farmers of VictoriaConceived in malice, born of plunder ancl revenge, engineered by knaves, and nurtured by fools, it constitutes the personification of Satanic cunning and ghoulish greed.

Whatever reform is to be effected in that gradually. But I do say that many of the tariff, duties are absurdly and improperly high. Those on iron and steel and 300 per cent., and when honourable members ask for them to be further increased they imply either the incompetence of our manufacturers or slowing down on the part of our workers.

When this method of dealing with industrial disputes was first adopted in Australia, all parties hoped that it would be successful; but unfortunately that has not been the result. It seems that in these days the judge, without having any personal knowledge of the conditions of an industry, gives his verdict to the side which can swear the hardest. This has caused more antagonism aud bitterness than we ever had previously in our industrial relations. I believe that there is a worse feeling between the employers and employees of Australia than between those of any other country. Of what use are our arbitration laws, seeing that we cannot enforce them? Honourable members opposite practically urge their constituents to defy the laws passed by this Parliament. But in spite of all that has happened, I hope that something will be done to reduce the high cost of production and the high cost of living and to relieve the primary producer of the strain he is at present bearing. We cannot blink the fact that wool production is our only paying industry. Yet, in spite of the high prices ruling for wool today, we are informed by those most closely interested in the business, that it is less profitable now than it was in 1911. The wheat and mining industries are in an unhealthy condition. Quite a number of farmers are leaving their farms, while many mines that should be in operation have closed down. I suppose that could support a population, of 40,000 persons. realize, it is to our well-being that we should do everything possible to stimulate these industries. production, and the cost of living, and make it possible for our primary producers to sell their products in the world's markets. would bring new prosperity to the nation. [S.22] -If ever the Government desires to find a company of real optimists it should go straight to North and Central Australia. Eor the last 50 years the settlers in that remote country have hoped against hope that something would be done for them. They have faced the perils and disappointments of their pioneering life with great fortitude. These wonderful people have settled hundred of miles from the centres of civilization, and have reared their families under conditions which, in many cases, have been heart breaking. Many of their children have never seen a tramway or a railway. But I regret to say that the inactivity of this Government is at last breaking down even their magnificent faith in their country. They hoped that the appointment of a North Australia Commission was a definite step forward. They said to themselves---'When this commission sends in its report something will be done for us."" Their disappointment can be imagined, therefore, when they found that the Government was making no effort to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission. North and Central Australia have been subjected to a great deal of adverse criticism. Some people have said that the country is not worth developing. But I am firmly convinced that, given reasonable transport facilities, it would soon become one of the most progressive and prosperous parts of Australia. The North Australia Commission, which is composed of men of matured judgment, who have travelled extensively through this neglected portion of the continent, have submitted to the Government a report which more than justifies all that, I and those who think as I do have ever said in favour of North and Central Australia. The following 5,000 working miners is an extract from its initial report:It w ill be appreciated that, with the availHonorable members will ability of lands in other parts of Australia 'therefore, how essential nearer the centres of civilization-wit h transport, access to markets, and utilities towards ordinary comfort, far in advance of those in North Australia-ther e is little inducement We must reduce the cost of unless at least additional transportation and communication facilities are provided, for people to invest money in North Australia.

But years have rolled on, and the railway is not yet completed. It is true that the war intervened, and tremendous and unprecedented demands were made upon the country's finances.

It was worth more than that to travel over the route in a car. As a matter of fact, the money was wasted, inasmuch as the man who got the contract merely drove over the route in a truck and pelted a few shovelsful of earth behind him. cannot accuse the Government of extravagance, at any rate. travagance in that it has beeu farming out the functions of government to bodies which it has created. If the Government sacked all the boards and commissions it has set up, and spent the money they cost on road construction in the north, it would do some good. The North Australia Commission has brought down its report, but apparently no notice is to be taken of it. At any rate, in the Supply Bill, which has just come before the House, there is no provision for work of a developmental nature in northern Australia. There is reason for assuming, therefore, that the Government proposes to sit back, and wait for another annual report from its North Australia Commission before beginning to do anything. Dealing with the subject of transport facilities, the report statesThe provision of reasonable transport faciliNorth Australia. We are well aware, ties must precede the closer settlement and further development of North Australia. The extent of this country, in comparison with its existing railway and other methods of transportation, has only to be visualized to realize the justification for the preceding statement. It will be observed that, even when the one railway which now exists is extended to Daly Waters (300 miles from Darwin), large areas of North Australia will still be far outside the economic distance of transportation. Many thousands of miles of road are urgently needed for the development of this great country. It has been proved that the land can produce wool as well as any other part of Australia. If it were developed, it would establish the supremacy of Australia among the wool producing countries of the world. Without transport facilities, however, it can never be developed, no matter how fertile it maybe. The commission says quite frankly that, unless its recommendations are carried out, it can do nothing to assist the development of the Territory. It recommends the construction of railways from different points, particularly from Queensland to the western part of the Territory, together with the provision of adequate water supplies. say anything about the suitability of the Territory for white settlement, or does it take that for granted? its report, lays stress upon the fact that there is nothing in the climate detrimental to the rearing of families of white stock. I myself can speak on the subject from experience. I have reared a family in the far north, ' and know that the children reared there are strong and healthy. Some of the finest specimens of manhood I have seen in any part of Australia have been born and reared in the north. That cannot be disputed. Experience has proved that it is not true to say that white men cannot live in these places. The commission has recommended that the existing 3 f t . 6 in. gauge railways should be converted to the standard 4 ft. 8% in. gauge, and that that standard gauge should be adopted for all the railways that are constructed in of the. complexities that are caused by breaks of gauge in our railway systems. Although we have been advocating in this Parliament the unification of our gauges, we are constructing a line with a 3 ft. 6 in. gauge to link up with the 4 f t . 8£ in. gauge line at Port Augusta. One is at a loss to know why, in the light of our experience, such things should be permitted. It would be different if we were experimenting.

There are hundreds of unemployed in the North. They were decoyed there in. the belief that they would obtain work. They relied upon the Government to go ahead with the construction of railways. This is a national work, and it should be undertaken. The commission has recommended that it be put in hand immediately. The Government, in effect, says to the unemployed, "" We will pay for your passage out of the Territory to any part of Australia."" That offer may sound very generous, but upon analysis it will be found that this Government is attempting to shirk its responsibility to the unemployed, and to place it on the shoulders of some State. Some of the unemployed have been gaoled. They asked that they should be given the equivalent of rations so that they might engage in prospecting work, and thus perform a useful service to the country; but because they remained on the verandahs of the Government offices they were prosecuted for being there without authority. These men are willing and anxious to do any class of work, and their capacity is greater than that of Southern Europeans. That fact was amply demonstrated when the system, of piece-work operated in connection with railway construction. The Australian and British teams were able to make twice as much as the Southern Europeans, although they were paid at the same rateI t is the responsibility of this Government to see that they immediately get work to do, not only to save them from starvation, but also to accelerate the development of North Australia.

I have had many applications made to me for agricultural blocks. The report of the North Australia Commission shows how the land in the north has been tied up by means of our infamous land laws that have made the country a big man's paradise. Dealing with pastoral leases, the report shows that there are 126,409 square miles of pastoral leases, and 31,768 square miles held under grazing licences, while other leases bring the total area of Crown leases and licences to 161,538 square miles. The report continuesThe commission deems it necessary to point out that, of tlie 160,860 square miles of country held under pastoral lease and licence, found that hundreds of pounds per ton 70,627 square miles-practicall y half-is held more than the figure quoted by the Mines liy only six lessees. A number of men have made a comfortable living out of agricultural production, such as the growing of peanuts. Some of them have earned up to £600 and £700 a year. ""When application was made for landfor agricultural purposes, it was stated that ample provision had been made, because it was only necessary for the person who intended to take up agriculture to make application to the Government, and it would resume the land required for that purpose. That is true; but two years' notice has to be given before resumption can take place. The result is that a number of men, who had earned a few hundred pounds and were anxious to go on land of that nature, found that it was held by big land monopolists like Vestey Brothers and others, and they were not inclined to wait two years for it to be resumed. Thus, potential settlers have been lost to the territory. The land ordinance's amended to permit of reasonable areas being taken from big holdings for agricultural purposes. It has been shown conclusively that more wealth can be won from acres that are devoted to agriculture than from square miles of country that is used for cattle raising under the present conditions. The Government should also pay attenfrom various other ports on the north tion to the mining industry. has an eminent mining authority 'on the coming year the pearl shell output will North Australia Commission in the chairman, Mr Horsburgh, but for some inexplicable reason, mining is not one of the matters that come under the control of that body. The Government Resident is an admirable officer in many ways, but he has had no experience in mining. It would be a simple procedure for the chairman of the commission to report to the Government regarding the possibilities of mining in the Territory. A valuable metal, known as tantalite, was recently discovered in the North, and it is known to occur in fair quantities. When inquiries were made by individual prospectors, who could ill afford to pay for the necessary cables, they Department could be obtained for that metal. Why should not the Government take up the marketing of this rare product, and advance to the miners some portion of the value of their output, in order to prevent the exploitation of the prospectors that is being practised to-day? I suggest to the Minister that, when he visits the Territory shortly, he should make personal investigations among the men engaged in that industry. The pearling industry promises to be of some magnitude in the Northern Territory in the near future. I have perused the ordinances that have been passed by the Commonwealth in connection with pearling and fisheries, and I think that the Minister will agree that they make the most hopeless documents ever printed in relation to the control of any industry. They compare most unfavorably with the Western Australian and Queensland acts, should be immediately which have been passed in the interests both of those States and of the persons engaged in those industries. The Government might well have adopted the legislation of either of those States. The Fisheries Ordinance contains no reference to the pearling industry, although £40,000 worth of pearl shell was collected last year. Vessels are now rushing there It coast, and it is estimated that in the :be worth about £100,000. In .the Western Australiau Fisheries Act a>re provisions for licences covering eight or ten sections of the pearling industry. It has been reported to me that pearlers from Western Australia are proceeding with tlie utmost speed to North Australia for the purpose of .engaging in the -industry, there, because they say that they could do as they liked under the existing ordinances. If the industry will be worth £10.0,000 in the coming year, it ought to be placed on a proper basis, and I hope that ithe Minister will not delay in bringing down an .ordinance on the lines of the Western Australian and Queensland measures. In North Australia there are many Australian-born Chinese, among, whom are well educated lads who could deport themselves well in any company. They are good law-abiding citizens, and in many cases they are very prosperous. Under existing conditions, if they leave Australia, they have to submit themselves to the dictation test on their re'tuxn. They say that, when they leave this country, .they should have the same right as any other Australian-born citizen, and I fail to see why the Government should make such invidious distinctions in cases where there is no doubt as to identity. I recently sent the following telegram to the MinisterAustralian-born Chinese desirous of visiting China -The Minister has decided that in stead of any such person being required in future to obtain a certincate of exemption from dictation test on each occasion to ensure his re-admission to the Commonwealth, he may present his' birth certincate to the Subcollector of Customs for an endorsement authorizing him to land at Darwin at any time, on production of this document, subject to satisfactory identification. The sub-collector will require to see each applicant personally, and to be thoroughly satisfied as to his bona fides before endorsing the birth certificate. ports like other intending voyagers? must obtain references from Europeans, and they are subjected to all sorts of humiliation in their efforts to be exempted from the dictation test. Every honourable member who goes abroad could be kept out of Australia, if (the dictation test were .strictly .applied to him, because, under it, 50 w,or.ds in .any languarge may be .submitted to him, and I venture to suggest that the authorities would soon find a language, dead or otherwise, that would puzzle even the cleverest linguist in this House. It is wrong to discriminate between Australians; indeed, I believe it to be unconstitutional. The Minister may be suspicious of certain individuals; but that .does not justify the issue of an order that is applicable to a whole community. I trust that this iniquitous procedure will be discontinued, and that that Minister will direct that the Australian-born Chinese of the north shall be allowed the ful l benefits of their Australian citizenship. I hope that the Minister will personally investigate matters affecting the development of North Australia. There are people who are willing and anxious to develop the country, and, if given sympathetic assistance, they will in. a few years demonstrate' to the world that North Australia is a very valuable part of the Commonwealth. The application of the Treasurer for supply for the period of two months beyond the present financial year affords the House and the country an opportunity to examine the financial position of the Commonwealth, and particularly the Treasurer's administration during the last twelve months. I had hoped that the debate on this bill would have been concentrated upon the finances; but it took a fiscal turn, and the finances have received very little consideration. pendent upon the other. Treasurer bases his year's expenditure upon a customs revenue of £43,000,000. In making a request for a further grant of £5,700,000, in anticipation of the revenue for next year, the Treasurer should have made at least a pre-budget statement.

The honourable gentleman has given no indication of proposals for the reduction of expenditure, nor has he forecast any fresh taxation. He cannot expect this House to vote £5,700,000 on a ""go-as-you-please"" policy. That is not national finance. In the phrases with which the Treasurer made this chamber ring years ago, it is not "" restoration of responsible government "" ; it is not "" balancing the ledger "" ; Australia also have had dry seasons. it is not ""playing square with the taxpayer "" ; in short, it is not facing foursquare the financial positiou. The Treasurer should have indicated how he proposes to balance the national ledger. But after a most _ generous grant of £77,000,000 for the year 1928-29-mad e up of general expenditure £51,000,000, Postal Department £12,900,000, Railways £1,100,000, Territories £600,000, and States £11,000,000-h e now, without a word of explanation, asks for a further £5,700,000 of next year's income, which will relieve him for five months of any obligation to state his financial policy. That is not the way to face the responsibility of Australia's present position. The Commonwealth is in arrears, and so are all but two of the States, whilst South Australia is asking from the Commonwealth a grant-in-aid of £750,000. Federal revenue to date is £1,000,000 below the Treasurer's estimate, aud he is working on a previous overdraft of £2,600,000. The Commonwealth has come to be recognized as the rich uncle of the States. It has deliberately accepted the responsibility of making grants to them from revenue, which this year will fall short of Federal requirements. stances a much more frank statement of the financial position was due to this House. The Treasurer merely told us that he wants £5,700,000, so that the Government may retire into recess for a few months, and he may be free to do as he pleases until he needs a further vote in September. and the country should be taken fully into the confidence of the honourable gentleman. If he looks about the Commonwealth and notes the state of the country he will uot see a roseate picture. Many of the areas of greatest potentiality have experienced, or are experiencing, the ravages of a great and prolonged drought. Notwithstanding that fine rains have fallen on the Queensland coast, the western portion of the State has been experiencing drought for years. A great part of New South Wales has suffered similarly, and South Australia and, to a lesser extent, Western In the wheat areas the farmers have had two lean years in succession. The pastoralists of Northern and Western Riverina and even the north-west of Victoria are not experiencing a good year, whilst the wheat-growers are facing disaster. It will be necessary for the State Governments to carry many of the unfortunate settlers in the Mallee by advances for seed wheat, fertilizers, horse feed, and even sustenance. In such circumstances, the Treasurer should have sounded a note of warning. As he has failed to do so, I tell him frankly that the financial health of the Commonwealth is far from satisfactory. In marked contrast to the management of public finance is that of the great financial institutions, which have the responsibility of managing the affairs of private citizens, are the bailees of their money, and the custodians of their securities. Unlike the Commonwealth and State Treasurers, they have put their houses in order. Perhaps never in the history of Australia were the affairs of these big financial undertakings so well handled, nor were they in a better position to withstand a siege. From their books the Treasurer might well borrow a chapter. TheI n the circumCommonwealth, on the other hand, has gone on recklessly from year to year, intoxicated with forced and artificial surpluses. It is no longer able to sustain the self-appointed role of rich uncle to the States. The Treasurer's estimates have not been realized, and it was fortunate for him that The House towards the end of last year, when the country appeared to be in such dire straits that nothing could save it, a downpour of rain came at the eleventh hour which saved him of the possibility of a shortage of millions of pounds. Throughout Australia there is great unemployment and there has been a shortage in the harvest. In the circumstances, the purchasing power of the people in the next twelve months will be greatly diminished, and the Treasurer cannot expect an abundant revenue from customs. Already receipts from that source are £1,000,000 below his estimate, but the other departments seem to be yielding up to expectations. Whilst we have boasted of having adopted a policy of effective protection, we must admit that no protective tariff is effective that yields the rich harvest of £43,000,000 in customs revenue. I do not propose to discuss the ethics of the protective policy beyond saying that a tariff which produces that amount of revenue is questionable as an instrument of protection. If the claims made in this House by some honourable members for higher or more effective duties are acceded to, the customs revenue must further diminish. circumstances, the«Treasurer choice of two courses; he has either to take his courage in his hands aud use the pruning knife where possible to cut back expenditure to the level of revenue, in other words to make ends meet, or he must declare frankly and honestly, that he is forced to impose additional taxation. yield is low, and prices are 20 per cent, He may be obliged to have recourse to both policies. honest or fair to the House for him, having an overdraft of £2,600,000 from last year and a deficit of £1,000,000 on the operations of the eight months of the present year, to reach forward merrily into the next year for £5,700,000 without one word of explanation as to bow he expects to balance the ledger. No manager of a private concern would dare to meet the shareholders in it with such a balance-sheet without having definite proposals for meeting the deficiency.

We have had two bad seasons in succession in some parts of Australia, and four in some other parts; and the Government has found that the well from which it has been drawing its money is not inexhaustible. In 1914 the Commonwealth Government owed no money, although, an amount of £19,000,000 was in question respecting certain transferred properties. The States at that time' owed, between them, £320,000,000, which they had borrowed at an average interest rate of £3 12s. 6d.

A burden is thrown on the the father to support this girl, and he should receive some assistance from the pensions department. numerous anomalies in the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act. Eor instance, a person who is thrifty, and saves a competence for himself, does not participate in the pension scheme at all; on the contrary he is penalized for his thrift. that old peoplebecome crochety, and cannot get on with one another. If , in such a case, a couple separates, the person in whose name the property is generally stays at home, while the other goes to live elsewhere. When the dispossessed person makes application for a pension, he or she finds that the property, which is in the name of the other party, is deemed to belong to both, and if it is worth more than £800, the division being £400 each, no pension will be paid. That is one anomaly which should be removed. I propose now to speak about the coal situation, and I desire that there shall be a few more Ministers in the chamber to listen to me. I ask you, therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, to ring the bells. a quorum present. to my constituents. I am here because the coal-miners have confidence in me, and if I did not advocate their cause on every occasion that presented itself particularly in this present crisis, I should uot feel myself worthy to represent them. There has been much side-stepping of the issues on the part of the Government over the coal situation. The Prime Minister is filling the role of the Emperor Nero, who fiddled while Rome was burning. He and the Attorney-General are fiddling over the coal situation while two-thirds of my constituents are being forced by the coal-barons to starve unless they will accept a reduction in their standard of living. The miners are abiding by an award made by the Coal Board, which was created by this Parliament. The miners have not broken the award, but the proprietors have. They have locked the men out for the purpose of reducing their wages. What would happen if the miners had broken the award? Would the There are also Prime Minister and the Attorney-General stand by, fiddling? No. Their action would be short, sharp and vicious, as it was in the case of the timber dispute. The eyes of the people of Australia are turned upon the Government to see whether it will make any move to prosecute the coalI t sometimes happens owners. The people feel that the owners have robbed the community long enough. The workers are poor because they are robbed, and they Avill continue to be robbed so long as they are poor. The present situation is one which affects the whole trade uuion movement, and concerns also all the industries of Australia. Coal production is a primary industry. The miners believe that they would not get a fair deal under the Government's proposal to have the coal problem investigated by one of three or one of six accountants selected by the president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. They are afraid that the Nationalist views which may be held by these nominees would prejudice the case of the miners. Apart from this, the miners feel that no one nominated in this way would understand the intricacies of the industry, or the inter-locking interests of the coal-owners, the private railway-owners, and the shipping companies. The miners have chosen one to investigate this problem who understands it from A to Z, one who will not allow the owners to deceive him by loading their balance-sheets with fictitious expenses. That is particularly important when we take into consideration the enormous sums allowed by the Coalowners Association and shipping companies to the Nationalist party funds. was at one time secretary of the Nationalist organization, and he should",65,Second Eeading

They are prepared to allow a representative to be chosen for the public, and to allow the owners to choose their representative; but they wish to choose a representative of their own as well. If they were allowed to do that, it would overcome the present difficulty. Because the miners president of the Coal-owners Association, who is a confidant of the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill), made this statementSo far as I am concerned, I am not prepared to consider anybody going through the books of the owners. So-called union leaders have dilly-dallied too w h i c h readslong, and have done nothing to assist the industry. I am finished with them, and w ill have nothing more to do witli them.

We will not tolerate any outside interference. Does he propose to go on the fields and search for ""scabs"" among the miners? It would be as easy for him to secure them as it is for the Nationalist party to discipline the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) or to induce the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) to discontinue the practice of wearing effeminate nightrobes. The Government has been asked to take action, and the eyes of the whole of the people|of Australia are upon it, waiting to see what it intends to do. I noticed in the press to-day the statement that representatives of the Commonwealth Government had interviewed the secretary of the lodge in which I worked as a miner until I was elected to this Parliament on the 17th November last, the object being to obtain evidence upon which a decision could be made as to whether or not a prosecution should be launched against the coal-owners. I do not know whether I am difficult to understand, but I believe that I have , already placed before this House a sufficient volume of evidence to render it unnecessary to send representatives to the coalfields for a joy-ride to obtain it, I have charged the coal-owners with having broken the award which governs the industry, and with having flouted the pet act of this Government-the Crimes Act. Section 30J of that act readsI f, at any time, the Governor General is of the opinion that there exists in Australia a serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening trade or commerce witli other countries or among the States, he may make a proclamation to that effect, which proclamation shall be and remain in'operation for the purposes of this section until it is revoked. The power under w h i c h the Government could take action is contained in the d e f in it i o n of "" l o c k o u t"" in the Common w e a l t h C o n c i l i a t i on and A r b it r a t i o n Act , "" Lockout"" includes the closing of a place or part of a place of employment, and the total or partial refusal of employers, acting' in combination, to give work, if the refusal is unreasonable, or the total or partial suspension of work by an employer, witli a view to compel his employees, or to aid another employer in compelling his employees to accept any term or condition of employment. If the Attorney-General were sincere, or if he were half as viciously disposed towards the coal-owners as he has shown himself to be towards the workers, particularly in the timber industry, he would have taken action long ago against the coal-owners. It would appear that there is one administration of the law for the rich and. another for the poor. administered differently. licity has been given to the trouble in the coal-mining industry, and I realize that the Government is anxious to get into recess so that we may not have the oppotunity to keep the matter fresh in the",66,Second Eeading

Erom the point of view of the owners that is a ""dead staff,"" because it does not produce thus incurred returns from the mines that are working. John Brown has two mines closed down, and I suggest, under the circumstances, that his should be taken as a test case. At the time of the lockout his collieries were working better, on an average, than they had ever worked before, and the reason for their being closed down should be divulged. people of Australia desire to know what -action the Government proposes to take against these rapacious coal-owners, who, I understand, make large contributions to the funds of the Nationalist party.

The selfish interests of the coal-owners Brown-has refused to submit seem to be the first consideration with the Government, whereas they should be the last.

I could have quoted many instances of children being of their mines, will bo under-nourished, prior to the present balancecrisis.

From my owu experience, over a number of years, I can say that the motive that prompted Parliament in passing the measure has been forgotten. my experience. to prove my statement to be justified in every particular. ""When a person writes to a government department on any subject, he expects, at least, that the receipt of his letter will be acknowledged. I had occasion, recently, to draw the Minister's attention, after nine weeks, to non-reply to letters. I made a verbal request on the 15th December, and, as it was notcomplied with, I wrote to the department on the 17th January, but the receipt of the letter was not even acknowledged. a State department? addressed to the Deputy Commissioner of Eepatriation, Sydney.

The could reasonably be expected to extend to Minister promised to look into the subthe general public the courtesy to which it ject, and, by a peculiar coincidence, I is entitled, and, irrespective of whether received a letter, dated the 14th February, the person concerned is a member of this in answer to my previous request, informHouse or not, when he writes to a Going me that the department would not vernment department, he should be supply the information that I desired. furnished with an acknowledgment of the Thanks to the Minister, that information receipt of his letter. was made available to me in this House, but that was due to the Minister's peradministration of a different kind, to sonal kindness, and not to any act of show that the department is lax in its courtesy on the part of his department. methods of dealing with cases brought If that were an isolated case, I would not before it. Honourable members will, I take much notice of it, but looking hope, excuse me for quoting a personal through my files, I find that I have had occasion to write to the department on several dates, asking for answers toletters. For example, on the 22nd October, I drew its attention to the fact that a letter sent on the 17th September had not been answered. I have had occasion to pass on to the Minister another letter from an ex-soldier in the cotyitry,. who asked why he could not obtain an answer to a previous communication. Apparently the departmental opinion is set out in the reply given to a request by me that the department should answer a letter from a certain local medical officer In the absence of any acknowledgment, it would seem not unreasonable for the local repatriation medical officer to surmise that his correspondence had miscarried, when doubtless a further letter to the department would solve the matter. The department excuses itself, for its delay in answering letters, by suggesting the possibility of correspondence having gone astray. I could overlook one case of this description, but there are many of them, and I have no doubt that other honourable members have had similar experiences.

246,Mr E. Geeen,"A "" c i v i l "" servantcase. On the 10th November, 1921,1 was a resident of Tamworth, New South Wales, and a letter from the Repatriation Department in Sydney was sent to Dr. Snow, the local medical officer. The department had supplied me with a warrant to go to Sydney, aud five days after I had been admitted as an inpatient at Randwick Hospital, the doctor at Tamworth received from the department a letter asking for information as tb my whereabouts. As I said, at the time. I was actually in a repatriation hospital and had been sent there by the department's headquarters in Sydney. That shows laxity of administration, such as should not occur in a government department. other instances which prove that the department is being administered in a way that would not be tolerated in a private business. The honourable member for Fawkner questioned my general statement that the repatriation administration has been harsh and callous. Let me justify that charge. Some time ago, the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr D. Cameron) succeeded in getting for a soldier back pension amounting to £700. The honourable member deserves credit for having induced the department to do justice in that case, and perhaps the Minister, also, was justified in claiming a certain amount of praise for having been able to upset the previous decisious of the department. But consider the matter from the point of view of the applicant. He was a sick man, and knew that his end was coming. He knew, also, that the disability from which he suffered was due to, or aggravated by, war' that was apparent in his reply service, and year after year he was fightto the Limbless Soldiers Association has ing for justice from a government department. Finally the matter was decided in his favour, and the fact that he was allowed arrears of pension amounting to £700 proved that he had been denied his right for years. The ultimate admission that his disability was due to, or aggravated by, war service should have been made when he first applied for a pension. The departmental officials ought to be ashamed of themselves for their maltreatment of this unfortunate sufferer. Mr R. Green. I have in mind another case. I took up the claim of a tubercular soldier, and finally the department admitted that his disease was due to war service, and he received back pension amounting to hundreds of pounds. A fortnight after the pension was granted he died. For years the .mental strain of resisting departmental injustice had been added to the physical strain caused by his illness, and the cumulative effect had been to undermine his constitution and shorten his days. Incidents like that justify me in saying that the department is callous, for obviously the pension that was granted eventually was the due of the soldier when he first apI can quote plied for it. A department that withheld from a sick soldier for years a pension to which he knew, in his own heart, that he was entitled, is devoid of sympathy and without sense of decency. The chairman of the Repatriation Board (Colonel Semmens) was chairman of the original Repatriation Branch established under the administration of the late Senator E. D. Millen. That gentleman is credited with having done good work in the administration of repatriation. There is a Latin saying, De mortuis nil nisi bonnm; but I remember attending a deputation to Senator Millen, from the Limbless Soldiers' Association, of which I was then vice-president, and he declared of two men who had lost both legs at the thigh, and, had lost one arm at the shoulder, that neither was totally incapacitated. Colonel Semmens served his apprenticeship as chairman of the Repatriation Board! under that Minister, and the harshness always characterized the repatriation administration. The department resorts to vail sorts of casuistry, and will take any little point to defeat the soldier. I have in mind the circumstances of a soldier who was wounded at Gallipoli on the 28th June, 1915, and still has a bullet in his neck. On occasions, the bullet which is close to the spine, causes trouble, and recently on account of a jar he received through the stumbling of his horse he consulted the local District Government Medical Officer, who recommended that he should go to Sydney to he examined under X-ray. He was X-rayed in Sydney, and he applied to the department for an increase of pension, and this is the callous reply that I receivedI am in receipt of your communication dated 22nd October, 1928, concerning the above-named ex-soldier, and in reply desire to advise you that Mr Williams reported at this branch on. the 2nd A p r i l last with a certincate from Dr. Gibson, of Mullumbimbi, in whicli it was suggested that ho be X-rayed, as the bullet lodged in his neck, and for which ho was receiving a pension, was giving him trouble. He was examined by a medical officer here, who noted that Mr Williams was suffering from a stiff neck, which it was stated was due to a recent accident. However, in view of Dr. Gibson's certificate, he was admitted as an out-patient to the Prince of Wales, Eepatriation General Hospital, Handwick, and a report was later received to the effect that although there was a foreign body present in the neck, the visiting surgeon was of the opinion that this had no relation to the symptoms of whicli Mr Williams was then complaining. In view of this, treatment for his condition could not be granted by this department, and his application was accordingly refused, and an increase of pension could not be recommeuded. Can any honourable member imagine a man getting a stiff neck through his horse stumbling? The department took the fine point that, because the stiffness was due to a recent accident-whic h was technically true-it could not treat him. the real cause of the stiffness was the bullet in his neck; if it had not been there he would never have sustained a stiff neck through the mere stumble of a horse. How can tlie Minister justify such lying and hairsplitting by his department? fact that that letter was written as recently as the 23rd October last, shows that the callousness of which I have spoken still persists. Honourable members will be interested to learn of my own recent experience of the Repatriation Department. Last year, I was admitted to the Randwick Hospital suffering from acute delirium with fever. My local medical officer at Manly was called in ou a Saturday night, and the following TuesdayI was removed in a delirious .condition, but later became normal. ""While I was at Manly, my local doctor called in an eminent surgeon from Macquarie-street, Sydney, to help him in his diagnosis, and I was treated for severe neuralgic pains in my amputated stump. At the Randwick HospitalI was given hot-air treatment on the stump. Diathermy was also suggested. I had had this treatment previously, but in both instances no good resulted. I was, therefore, given hot-air treatment. At the end of five weeks, I mentioned casually to the surgeon that I had a little trouble with my face which I thought might as well be treated while I was at Randwick. It was then ascertained that I had nasal sinusitis. ""When I applied for a refund of the moneys that I had paid to my medical officer and to the surgeon who had been called in for consultation, the department replied that, as I had been admitted to Randwick Hospital suffering from nasal sinusitis, which was not due to war service, no refund could be made. I have carried on a correspondence with ""the department, and I shall read to the House some of its views. I want to show how the department shelves questions, and persistently refuses to come to the point, and how it will, if possible, work a point as it did in the case of the ex-soldier who had a bullet in his neck. I wrote to the department as follows:On what grounds is it stated that my nasal My view, however, is that sinusitis is not due to war service, seeing tliat I reported same to a departmental officer in 1919, that is, before my discharge from the Australian Imperial Forces. The department repliedThe commission's considered opinion based on medical opinion, and the f u l l history of The your case was against the claim. Dr. Erancis, an ear, nose and throat specialist, reported on my case to the effect that he could not say that nasal sinusitis was not present in 1919. The fact that I had reported my trouble in 1919 was ignored despite the fact that I had made what was equivalent to a statutory declaration. Every claim made for a pension is described under the pensions regulations as being equivalent to a statutory declaration. I then asked the department what treatment had I undergone at Randwick. Although prior to the diagnosis of nasal sinusitis, I had had five weeks' treatment for my stump, the department replied that I had been given symptomatic treatment. In effect, it said that I was suffering Dot from any trouble with my amputated stump, but from a cold in the nose. I should be glad to know from the department whether hot-air treatment is usual for nasal sinusitis. suffering in a like manner, and yet have no opportunity of ventilating their cases in this House? there innst be an enormous number of them. The Repatriation Department is not only maladministered, but is being administered against the whole spirit of the act. The intention of Parliament when the act was passed was that the ex-soldier should get a-fair and square deal. Unfortunately, he is not getting it. We want not sympathy but justice; instead we are getting callous and harsh treatment in spite of statements to the contrary. What has happened in one case ftnust have happened in many others. The department must have been aware that I would seize the first opportunity to ventilate this matter in the House. Upon examining the department's files, I find that since July, 1921, when I had to undergo a rather serious operation, eight departmental officers have reported on my case. Some of the reports areSeptember, 1921 -Re-admitte d to Randwick for violet-ray and massage for stump. October, 192.1 -Stump painful. November, 1921-Pain in stump; scar tender to touch. January, 1922 -Stil l a good deal of pain in stump. August, 1922 -Stump giving trouble. April, 1923 -No improvement during past six months. February, 1927 -Sever e pain in stump of left thigh. March, 1927 Admitted Caulfield, diathermy. A p r i l , 1928 -Recommend out-patient treatment for amputated left thigh. May, 1928 -Admitted Randwick. In addition, I have medical certificates from eight other doctors, all of which are to the same effect. I have sent extracts from these reports to the department. Since 1921 I have been examined by amendment. nineteen doctors; eight were departmental officers and eleven were not. I was treated while I was on Norfolk Island and also by the ship's doctor when I was coming from Singapore on the Oascoigne. But in spite of all this, Dr. Kenneth Smith, the senior medical officer of the department in New South Wales, said, ""You have no trouble in your stump; all that you have is a cold in the nose."" The amount involved in this claim is only £5 14s. but I am fighting to maintain a principle, and I tell the Minister, frankly, that the department has put its head in the noose. Section1 of the Repatriation Act of 1920, readsFor the purposes of this act there shall be a repatriation commission which shall be subject to the control of the Minister charged with the general administration of this act. The bill for that act was introduced by Mr Poynton, who, during his second reading speech, was asked by Sir Robert Best, "" Will the Commission have the power of determining policy or will that be a matter for the Government?"" Mr Poynton replied, "" The Commission will have the determination of policy."" Later, at the committee stage, Mr E. H . Francis, then the honourable member for Henty, said, "" I hope that in matters of policy nothing can bo done without the sanction of the Minister.""
