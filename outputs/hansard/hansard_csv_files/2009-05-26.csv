One of those schools is the Mary MacKillop Catholic Community Primary School on Cassowary Drive. The school is well led by its principal, James Danaher, and the local parish priest, Father John Jegorow. On a visit to the school some time ago I was having a conversation with a staff member, Mrs Sharon Evans, about the support-a-reader program run at the Mary MacKillop Catholic Community Primary School. The program provides support where reluctant or struggling readers are allocated adult volunteer helpers who come into the school and read with the student. The student and the helper then take turns reading, using a proven system which has achieved great results in many schools. Each student receives 15 minutes of one-on-one time most days of the week. The volunteers come primarily from the school community in the form of dedicated parents and grandparents. It is worth noting that success in helping children to read is not achieved through a one-off session. It is achieved through a level of consistent trust and understanding, as provided by these volunteers, which enables children to overcome their reluctance to read. I have said before in this House that one of the most important things to young children is to be able to fit in. They do not want to feel different or inadequate and therefore alienated from the opportunities of education. Through support-a-reader, children who struggle with literacy are supported, and they are helped to attain levels consistent with those of their peers. It is a great program that works very well for the students at Mary MacKillop Catholic Community Primary School. I commend the volunteers for their commitment to our future generations at the school. In particular I commend the volunteers George Hancock, Margaret O’Keefe, Julie Powell, Julia Durack, Maris Filippis, Sally Anne Cross, Yvonne Stevens, Adrienne Grygorcewicz, Deb Harris, Eve Thoroughgood, Anne Rector, Tracey Inwood, Sharon Gayski, Bernece Vitetta, Michele Mitchell and Maria Makinson. On 18 May I visited the school and presented these volunteers with certificates of my appreciation for the great work they do as volunteers. Clearly these are the sorts of people who make this country great and our communities strong. I would also like to mention that for her work in the area of literacy Sharon Evans, the teacher, recently received an Award of Excellence from the Australian Council for Educational Leaders. I congratulate Sharon for the award and her ongoing commitment to the children at Mary MacKillop Catholic Community Primary School.

213,Mr Adams (Lyons) (4.03 Pm),"I am very pleased to hear of a grant of $50,030 to thewill promote the Australian blue mussel as part of a healthy diet. Tasmania is well known for its blue mussels, particularly the Spring Bay mussel, which has a national reputation. I am particularly partial to them myself, and many of my family enjoy dishes of mussels. Earlier this month Spring Bay mussels won the inaugural Vogue Entertaining and Travel Produce Award for food heritage and sustainability. Triabunna based Spring Bay Seafoods is one of seven Tasmanian producers to win medals at the awards, announced on Tuesday night at the Sydney Etch by Becasse restaurant. Vogue lauded Spring Bay for its groundbreaking work. It was the only Australian mussel producer with its own hatchery, which meant it was not harvesting young wild mussels, or spat, and depleting natural resources. Food producers and industry organisations such as the Australian mussel industry association make a vital contribution to the nation’s economy and to rural and regional communities. The grant is part of nearly $2 million being delivered nationally to the agriculture and the seafood industries in the first round of the Promoting Australian Produce Program. So it will help the local mussel industry to remain competitive and contribute to its success into the future. Grants have been awarded to food industry organisations to increase their industry’s marketing and promotional abilities and to strengthen links with domestic and international markets. Tasmania is recognised nationally and globally for its high-class produce and the funding will assist the mussel industry to further that reputation. Presently, Australian mussels are marketed and sold as fresh quality mussel produce. There is movement in some states to value add to the product in a variety of ways. Mussels have exceptional nutritional value, particularly omega-3, so they are very good for us. I noted recently, according to the American Food and Drug Administration criteria, that mussels are an extra lean meat that is low in sodium, low in fat, cholesterol free and high in protein and heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. When it comes to the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, mussels have more than any other shellfish: 500 grams of mussel in the shell can yield 150 to 200 grams of raw mussel meat. This is dependent upon animal condition at the time of harvest, spawning period and conditional index. As most of you would know, I bring Tasmanian salmon up for your tasting. I have also brought up oysters. Maybe mussels will be the next tasty bit that I will be able to offer. I congratulate Spring Bay mussels on their enterprise and innovation. (Time expired) Cowper Electorate: Queensland and New South Wales Floods the flood event affecting my electorate, as it has been broadcast on national television. For some areas of that electorate it is the third such flood event in recent times. On 31 March residents of Coffs Harbour, Bellingen, Nambucca and the Clarence Valley local government areas suffered a flood event. Across the region thousands of people suffered damage to their houses, businesses and farms. The central business districts of Coffs Harbour and Urunga were particularly hard hit. Many people in rural areas suffered major damage to their access roads. The impact of these floods was severe, and I have detailed that impact in correspondence with the government. Over the past eight weeks I have written to the Prime Minister on 6 April, the Attorney-General on 30 April and the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs on 7 and 18 May. I also questioned the Prime Minister in the parliament on 12 May. On each occasion I have sought the Rudd government’s one-off cash payments of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child for those families affected by the 31 March MAIN COMMITTEE",117,Constituency Statements
214,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (4.06 Pm),"Members of the House would be familiar withflood event. Seven weeks after the floods first ravaged our region, the Rudd government confirmed that one-off cash payments would not be provided to those most affected by the last event. In my view this was an appalling decision, given the assistance that was extended to residents of North Queensland who were affected by floods in February. In that instance the Commonwealth provided $1,000 for eligible adults and $400 for children. The Rudd government’s decision not to provide similar assistance shows that they are not prepared to govern for all Australians. After the flooding that has engulfed the North Coast over the past week, I welcomed the Prime Minister’s announcement in the parliament yesterday that one-off payments would be provided to those affected by the recent flood event. After detailing one-off payments to individuals, small businesses and primary producers, the Prime Minister added the following: I have also today authorised this assistance for people affected by the earlier floods in New South Wales in late March. In good faith we accepted that this meant that all of the assistance being provided to those affected by the May event would be provided to those affected by the March event. This morning the Prime Minister’s office advised me that the one-off cash payments to families would not apply to those March flood victims-that is, that the small business and primary producer assistance would go to those affected but that the $1,000 and $400 payments would not. This is an absolute disgrace. Over the past eight weeks I have spoken to many people affected by this flood event. In today’s Coffs Coast Advocate another resident detailed her anger and her feeling of abandonment by the minister for family and community services. She said: I am one of the many individuals very affected by this flood. That is the flood of 31 March. She continued: I lost all of my furniture and anything else that was below the three feet of water that went through my unit. All of the other tenants in my block of units in Sawtell were similarly affected … The minister claimed that the reason for not advancing assistance was that damage was primarily to public infrastructure. That is clearly not the case. (Time expired) Hasluck Electorate: Politician Adoption Scheme Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (4.09 pm)-Many Western Australian members of parliament have spoken about the Politician Adoption Scheme that is operated and coordinated by the Developmental Disability Council of Western Australia. The scheme arranges for a politician to be adopted by a person with a developmental disability in their family from within their electorate. The scheme provides a unique and valuable personal insight into the day-to-day lives of the family. It ensures that we become more effective advocates of the rights and needs of people with a disability. I am fortunate to have been adopted by Lisa Harris and her family, who live in Kenwick in my electorate of Hasluck. Lisa’s dad and mum, Phil and Tania Harris, have three children: Lisa who recently turned nine; Matty who is six and Lizzie who is three years of age. Through involvement in their lives I get first hand information and experience of the issues that impact on the quality of life of people with disabilities and their families. MAIN COMMITTEE Earlier this month I was fortunate to spend the morning with Lisa at her school. Lisa attends Kenwick School, which is a special ed facility. There are approximately 80 students who come on five different bus services from across my electorate, extending out as far as Byford on the fringe of the metropolitan area. The kids range in age from 4 to 18 years old and have a diverse range of support needs and abilities, with moderate to severe and profound disabilities. Some children have severe and multiple disabilities, others also have vision and hearing impairments. Twenty per cent of the student body have an autism spectrum disorder. Each class has five to 11 students with one teacher and two education assistants. Each child has an individual education plan developed by the teacher and other specialists such as social trainers, swimming teachers, nurses and therapists as well as parents. Lisa’s teacher is Marie McLaughlin. Marie is ably assisted by her wonderful education assistants, Shirley Gebhard and Rosemary Moore. There were three other students in Lisa’s class that morning. Marie led the class in a welcoming circle, a delightful singalong where each child and adult is welcomed to the room as well as identifying the date, the day of the week, the month and the season. In addition to the singing and play I was able to observe very committed teacher and education assistants working with the kids in their care. They clearly had great affinity with the kids as well as affection for them despite sometimes challenging behaviour from some of them. I had the opportunity to go with Lisa to the school’s liberty swing. It is not a light duty to secure Lisa’s wheelchair in the swing and I was grateful for Shirley’s expertise. I had the easier task of pushing the swing. The real reward was the look of sheer delight on Lisa’s face as the swing went higher and higher. I understand the P&C raised the funds for the swing and I congratulate them for that effort. Of course, I am also delighted that Kenwick School has received funding from the Rudd government’s National School Pride program. (Time expired) Paterson Electorate: Emeritus Mayor John Graham Hawley OAM Emeritus Mayor John Graham Hawley OAM who passed away on Thursday, 7 May 2009. John Hawley’s service of thanksgiving was held amongst his beloved Dungog community at St Andrew’s Presbyterian Church, Dungog on 12 May 2009. John served Dungog council from 1959 to 2004, holding the position of mayor from 1962 to 1982. John was very much a hands-on practitioner of local government and he expected excellence, professionalism and devotion not only of himself but also of those around him. John’s 45 years of service saw achievements such as: the longest serving local government councillor in Australian history; the longest serving executive member of the Local Government and Shires Association of New South Wales, on which he served as president for a number of years and as patron until his passing; and the longest serving councillor in the history of Dungog Shire Council. John’s dedication to his community through his contribution to the Lions Club, the Masonic Lodge and the RSL of Australia New South Wales Branch was more than evident. His thanksgiving service bore testament to this. Looking at John’s incredible tenure in local government one has to say that from humble beginnings he was truly a man for the people of the shire and very much a pioneer in local government in New South Wales. His outstanding achievements and commitments to his vocation were exemplary and will always be in keeping with the finest traditions of our AustraMAIN COMMITTEE",118,Constituency Statements
215,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (4.12 Pm),"I rise today to advise the House of the death oflian and rural heritage. This level of commitment does not come without great personal sacrifice, but John was a passionate advocate for the Dungog community. Some of John’s achievements forever entrenched in Dungog shire’s history are: the pioneering of the construction of Dungog Memorial Swimming Pool, the upgrading of Glendonbrook Road, the sealing of Stroud Road and the reconstruction of Bingleburra Road, to name but a few projects. John’s contribution to local government was strongly influenced by his work ethic. His most prominent mannerisms were created by friendships forged from common interests and a sense of camaraderie that manifested trust, loyalty and indeed a strong will to defend what some would call the underdog in all of us. It is no secret that John and I were on opposite sides of the political divide. However, we had a deep mutual respect for each other based on a common cause: fighting for our community above all else. When it comes to advocating for our community, it is the things that unite us that will always be stronger than the things that divide us. On behalf of the parliament, I extend to Mrs Elaine Hawley, and the Mitchell and Lyon families, our deepest sympathy and respect. John Graham Hawley OAM will be sadly missed by the Dungog community. He toiled hard for the community and now deserves his rest. May he rest in peace. Werriwa Electorate: Campbelltown Stadium Russell Matheson, threw down a challenge to Wests Tigers rugby league club to show locals the same loyalty that has clearly been shown to them by their faithful fans. On the eve of work starting on the $8 million upgrade of Campbelltown Stadium, it is not good enough for this rugby league club not to commit to more games in the region. This redevelopment work, due to commence in the coming weeks, is an important step in meeting a key election commitment made to local residents in the south-west of Sydney by the Rudd government. I worked very closely with the local community and the Campbelltown City Council to secure this commitment. This is an important investment in the future of the region and, more importantly during these challenging times, this project is expected to support 200 full-time and part-time positions. The Campbelltown Stadium is an iconic venue in the community and our commitment goes a long way to helping transform this stadium and its adjoining facilities into one of the premier sporting precincts in Western Sydney. This investment in Campbelltown Stadium warrants Wests Tigers committing to play a minimum of six home games in Campbelltown. Once the redevelopment of the stadiumwhich includes adding another 5,000 seats and upgrading player and media facilities-is complete, the ground capacity will increase to 20,000 people. Campbelltown should be given back the three home games that, in a commercial decision, were reallocated to the Sydney Football Stadium, some 60 kilometres away. Quite frankly, we are now redeveloping Campbelltown City’s sports stadium to satisfy the requirements of the NRL, not only now but also into the future. The chairman of Wests Tigers has sought to defend the club’s decision, saying that football is not just a game, it is a multi-million-dollar entertainment business, and saying further that the local fans seem reluctant to appreciate the commercial side of things. Backsides on seats at venues such as Campbelltown Stadium do not seem to count as much to a football club as the guaranteed dollars that it will get for playing games at the Sydney Football Stadium. Apparently, the football club receives more money from a game at the SydMAIN COMMITTEE",120,Constituency Statements
216,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (4.15 Pm),"Last week I, along with the Mayor of Campbelltown,ney Football Stadium if only one person decides to turn up. There is no question that Macarthur area rugby league fans have been very loyal to Wests Tigers. They pack the stadium for every home game. I would like to think the club is going to be loyal to its fans now and play more than three games at Campbelltown Stadium. Wests Tigers is a great, premiershipwinning team; however they must know that Sydney’s south-west is a big market and that loyalty is there to be earned. Wests Tigers should also appreciate that commercial businesses have clients, customers and shareholders, whereas football clubs such as Wests Tigers rely on fans. It begs the question: what game are they playing? Hinkler Electorate: Australian Prime Fibre electorate, I recently hosted the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Tony Burke, in my electorate of Hinkler. I was very pleased that the minister accepted my offer to visit a number of agricultural enterprises in the Bundaberg and Childers districts. I am sure the halfday tour I gave him broadened his understanding of such local industries as fishing, horticulture, food processing-especially chillies-flying fox control and the tertiary utilisation of sugar cane. On the latter, the minister now has first hand knowledge of an impressive enterprise, Australian Prime Fibre, operating just outside Childers. It is a great example of industry diversification. In July last year, the company opened the doors of its $10 million state-of-the-art processing plant, which is considered one of the most modern and technologically advanced agricultural processing factories in Australia. APF takes cane trash, which until recently was simply burned or ploughed back into the ground, and processes it into garden mulch and stock feed, which is available to national outlets on the one hand and agricultural outlets on the other. The company has also recently expanded its product line by processing tonnes of excess paper-print overruns, misprints and so on. It turns this into a cellulose roofing installationa type of pink batt, if you like. This has had a twofold benefit for the community. First, the company is generating a new, locally produced product for the national markets. Second, APF is providing cane farmers with supplementary income for cane trash, which was previously just wasted. So it is a very good operation. Minister Burke was quite impressed. Today, that company has seven permanent employees and by mid-year expects to grow to 11. Australian Prime Fibre is a classic example of how Commonwealth seed funding can turn a medium-sized fledgling operation into a flourishing one. An investment of around $1 million, which came from the sugar package and from the Regional Partnerships Program, was enough to get the business off the ground. As I said, it was a $10 million business. One of the important things that those grants give the proponents is leverage when they go to the banks. The fact that they have the approbation of government in doing this sort of thing is a very important part of getting the confidence of the banks, particularly in the current economic climate. Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea Mrs D’ATH (Petrie) (4.21 pm)-I rise to speak in relation to Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea. This is one of the Cancer Council’s leading fundraising events and the largest and most successful event of its kind in Australia. Over $60 million has been raised since it began back in 1994. The official date is this Thursday, 28 May, but events can be hosted anytime during MAIN COMMITTEE",121,Constituency Statements
217,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (4.18 Pm),"In the spirit of delivering greater outcomes for mythe months of May or June. Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea events have been known to be held in schools, in clubs, at work or even in the comfort of people’s homes. The funds raised during Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea go towards Cancer Council research, prevention, education and support. Last Monday, I had the pleasure of holding a community afternoon tea at which my guest speaker was the Minister for Human Services, Senator Joe Ludwig. I asked people to give a gold coin donation to fundraise for Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea. I can report that, with the generosity of the Petrie constituents who attended that event, we raised approximately $150 at that afternoon tea. I thank each and every one of those people for their voluntary donation. I also had the opportunity last Friday to attend at the home of one of my constituents, Narelle Armstrong. This was the second year that I have attended the Biggest Morning Tea that Narelle has held. Narelle Armstrong is a tireless fundraiser for the Cancer Council. Each year for the past few years Narelle has held a morning tea in her own home as part of the Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea month. This year, Narelle has held three morning teas to raise money for the Cancer Council. Narelle’s health has not been the best recently. I know that she feels that she is not contributing as much as she would like to. But there could be nothing further from the truth. Narelle has been officially recognised by the Cancer Council for her amazing fundraising efforts. I would like to place on record my gratitude and the gratitude of the community for people like Narelle, who volunteer their time, their homes and their fabulous baking and tea-making skills to raise money to find a cure for cancer. We know that the Cancer Council do many amazing things. The money goes towards their help line, Cancer Council Connect volunteers, one-to-one support, clinical trials, making life easier for carers, groundbreaking research and new and improved treatments. I would like to thank all of the people who make an effort as part of Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea. Flinders Electorate: National Australia Bank National Australia Bank in Melbourne with two local community leaders, Fergus Nutt, representing the traders of Mount Martha, and Lloyd Smith, representing the residents of not only Mount Martha but also Balnarring and Rye. The reason we visited the state manager of the National Australia Bank and a senior executive in their corporate communications and government relations centre is that the National Australia Bank has decided to close three branches on the Mornington Peninsula: Balnarring, Rye and Mount Martha. Each is a blow to local residents. Each is a blow to the workers. Each is a blow to traders who rely on the bank’s service. So we attended to protest, respectfully but clearly and absolutely. We said that it was time for the National Australia Bank to review, rethink and redetermine the outcome of each those three cases. I am not hopeful, but we will fight and fight and fight to see if we can have this decision reversed. In the case of Balnarring and Rye, it is a tragic outcome for those communities. They have the small consolation that they also have existing community banks which will remain in place. While the closing of the National Australia Bank would be a great inconvenience, the community banks do at least provide an option. In the case of Mount Martha, a town of 9,000 people, there will be no bank-not a single bank. What we said to the National Australia Bank was very clear: ‘If you pull out, there will be a community response. Mount Martha will fight back and we will push to do two things. We will push to establish a community bank and we MAIN COMMITTEE",122,Constituency Statements
218,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (4.24 Pm),"Last Thursday, 21 May, I visited the headquarters of thewill push to make sure that as many of the community members as possible move their business to that bank. Whether they are traders, whether they are residents, whether they have a second residence at Mount Martha, we will push to ensure that as many of these people as possible move their business from the National Australia Bank to the community bank.’ We will not do that out of a vindictive approach. We will do it from the position that Mount Martha needs a bank. We need to establish a bank for seniors, for mums or dads who do not want to travel too far during the day if they have childcare duties, for traders who are unable to be away from their shops in the strip. We need community support in order to establish that bank, so we shall be unrelenting and unflinching in pushing to establish a community bank. I urge the National Australia Bank to review its position. I fear that it is not going to do so, in which case Mount Martha will fight back and we will establish a community bank. Charlton Electorate: Schools When I was campaigning to be elected to parliament in late 2007, I talked to parents and teachers in a number of schools in the electorate, but I was particularly interested in an issue that the Edgeworth Heights Public School had raised. I spoke to the principal of that school, Mr Mark Stiller. It is a primary school with 245 students. During the campaign period he told me that the school had never had a school hall. School assemblies were held outside. If it rained, they were able to use, after a period of time, a covered outside learning area which was basically a metal cover only with no walls. This had become the status quo for that school. There seemed no chance of ever building a much-needed school hall. Today it is my privilege to say that this sorry state of affairs has changed, thanks to the Rudd government’s $14.7 billion education revolution. Because of that, the students and staff of Edgeworth Heights Public School are now able to await the completion of their very own school hall. The excitement of the staff and students is only one story in a much larger narrative. I am excited to be able to say that for schools in my electorate of Charlton approximately $22.3 million is now in the pipeline for new infrastructure projects. The effect of this Rudd government funding in Charlton is twofold. Firstly, the schools that have long suffered from chronic underinvestment from the Howard government will now receive vital new infrastructure. The effect on the morale of students and teachers as a direct result of that funding cannot be underestimated at all. Where does the school assembly happen on a rainy day, for example, when there is no school hall? What happens when there is wet weather and sport is on? A hall is a vital piece of infrastructure for any school, and that is what is severely needed at Edgeworth Heights primary. The second impact of this funding is that tradespeople and people working in the building and construction industry in the electorate will receive a major boost through the construction of all of the projects. This will help rejuvenate the local economy and provide job stability for many local tradespeople, and the flow-on effect of spending in the local community is equally important. Other schools in the electorate have elected to fund new libraries and gymnasiums. But no matter what the schools elect to spend their extra funding on, all of these projects will have a tangible effect on the quality of education offered by the local schools-and that is a fundamental objective, as I am sure all would agree. All of this is only possible through the funding that has been provided by the Rudd government’s Building the Education Revolution, MAIN COMMITTEE",123,Constituency Statements

Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 May, on motion by Ms Roxon: That this bill be now read a second time. establish a new statutory authority, Health Workforce Australia, to oversee clinical training arrangements across the health sector and support workforce planning. The government needs the bill passed before July so that the new authority, agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments late last year, can commence operation by January next year-a point I want to return to a little later. There is no doubt that Australia faces ongoing challenges in providing an adequate workforce in the health and aged-care sectors. A combination of factors has led to these difficult circumstances. We have an ageing population that requires greater access to medical services and we have an ageing and changing medical workforce. There has been an increase in chronic disease, community expectations have increased and some health professionals are working fewer hours. The Minister for Health and Ageing blames the woes of the health sector on the previous coalition government-of course that would be the spin of this government. The simple fact is that the former coalition government began dramatically ramping up the number of education places for health professionals almost a decade ago-indeed, from 2000. We provided for significant growth in the number of medical graduates, nurses, dentists, pharmacists and psychologists emerging from our universities. At the time, it was quite amazing that the state health authorities in particular were lagging behind in training staff for their responsibilities in terms of the provision of health services. Even more amazingly, it remained the case over the last decade or so that staff retention rates were abysmal in relation to the provision of services by state governments. Even today, that remains a continuing bugbear at many of our public hospitals and indeed in many areas around the country where health care is provided. Many health workers are working under situations of great duress. They are concerned about their work colleagues and they are concerned about trying to improve health outcomes for their patients. Indeed, many of them are working in an environment which is completely unacceptable. That has added to some of the current woes that the government find themselves facing in relation to workforce shortages, and it is something they need to continue to work on. At the last election they promised to end the blame game-and there is no better area than health for this government to demonstrate that it can provide good outcomes. But that was only an election slogan, and nothing has changed over the last 18 months. There was a massive expansion to address the needs of the health workforce under the coalition government. However, as this government will find out, it takes years to deliver the graduates of universities and colleges to the front-line of health care. The government has promised major increases across all fields of the health workforce, but after 18 months in ofMAIN COMMITTEE",124,Constituency Statements
220,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr S Sidebottom),Order! In accordance with standing or,125,Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009
221,Mr Dutton (Dickson) (4.31 Pm),"The Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009 seeks tofice its recruitment drives have been found wanting. The government’s plan to return 1,000 nurses to the workforce last year fell far short, with just 310 additional recruits. Media reports also indicated that the government had difficulty filling additional tertiary training places for nurses. The Rudd government’s budget, which will drive this nation into deficit and debt for decades to come, contained more than a score of small under-the-radar funding cutbacks in health that may hinder the development of the health workforce over the coming years. One such cut pulled $30 million from a program supporting postgraduate research into public health, which drew criticism from the Public Health Association. Its president described the decision as a worry because the program was important ‘in terms of supporting and developing the public health workforce’. This cut hardly fits with the Prime Minister’s pledge to fix public hospitals by mid this year, a deadline that runs out in just over a month. Indeed, the minister and the Prime Minister may try to paper over their promise by telling Australians that they have fixed our hospitals, but no Australian patient, no family, no older Australian believes this government when they say that they have fixed public hospitals, because it has become all too apparent that Labor state governments continue to mismanage our public hospitals and fudge the figures to pretend that everything is okay. This bill is largely technical in nature, establishing the authority in law and setting out its make-up, functions and scope of operations, but it is a scope that allows wide interpretation of its role once the agency is operative. As part of the debate it is important to highlight a number of concerns and to pose a number of questions to the government that need to be answered, not just as part of the minister’s summing up in this debate, but also, importantly, in relation to a Senate inquiry, during which we propose to put a number of questions to the government about what exactly they are trying to achieve with this bill; importantly, how they propose to address the concerns of stakeholders and industry groups; and, ultimately, how this is going to deliver better health outcomes to Australian patients. One question, of course, is: will it result in additional layers of administration and bureaucracy that will soak up valuable resources? That has been the hallmark of the delivery of health services at a state level over the course of the last decade; it is at the core of what is certainly a dysfunctional health system in this country and it is at the core of the continuing problems that this government has refused to address. Another question that needs to be asked and answered by this government is whether or not this authority will try to usurp some of the responsibility of the colleges and some of the other organisations that seek to provide professional development to the professions around this country. I would be very concerned if this authority, once established, headed down the path that Labor has taken us down at a state level over the course of the last decade. I would be concerned that, if this government’s priority were to manage the health system in a way that the states have managed the health system over the course of the last 10 years, they would head down a track where, instead of employing doctors and nurses and other health professionals, they embarked on a policy of filling the back rooms-putting extra dollars, which should be spent on patients, into spin operations conducted in media units out of ministerial offices and, worse still, out of government departments. Bureaucrats and administrators have added layer upon layer of officialdom in the nation’s public hospitals and health services. The consequences have been plain to see: failing hospiMAIN COMMITTEE tals, overworked health carers and not enough money for necessities for patients. In some cases, in that Labor jewel of New South Wales, there is not even enough money to pay for food for patients. In some cases in New South Wales, particularly in rural settings, public hospitals do not have the capacity to pay for drugs to treat patients. This is an unacceptable situation and it makes a mockery of the recent statements by the minister that she has fixed public hospitals and that the states have done enough to address the concerns that patients around the country have in terms of the services provided at public hospitals. At a federal level of government, we need to make sure that we do not embark down this same path. At the very time that this government is cutting back on a host of health programs through measures in this year’s budget, it is planning to spend another $125 million on bureaucracy in this authority-$125 million over the forward estimates, four years, is a significant amount. Many people would argue that that money could go towards helping families who are struggling to pay for their IVF treatment; those who have really received a slap in the face from this government. This money could go towards helping people, particularly older Australians, who require cataract surgery. These are debates that are unfolding and they have a long way to go, because the government has been on a huge spending splurge. At the same time that Kevin Rudd has been handing out billions of dollars in $900 cash payments, he has been taking with the other hand from Australian patients. He is cutting back cataract surgery and he is cutting back the assistance that the federal government will provide to families who are trying desperately to bring a child into this world. That is something we will be talking a lot more about, because tens of thousands of Australians really have great concern about this government’s decision to rip out of this budget the money for the very necessary cataract surgery that needs to take place for older Australians and, of course, for that support to families who are relying on IVF. The government need to refocus their attention. They need to refocus their attention onto the patient and away from the bureaucrat. If we are going to bring improvements about in the health system in this country, we need to put money into front-line services. We need to make sure that the health dollar is not being spent-like it is in Queensland, New South Wales or Victoria-on bureaucrats instead of on nurses and doctors. This government certainly has shown all the signs of going down the same health management path that those state Labor governments have, particularly in New South Wales. There is no better example than New South Wales-a better example you could not find around the country. New South Wales has a government which has squandered billions of dollars that should have been spent helping patients and helping doctors and nurses to help those patients to get better health outcomes and to help older Australians who want some sort of dignity in their ageing yearsAustralians who, before this budget, would have been able to get government assistance to have cataract surgery. They are the people we should be helping, not supporting a government at a federal level now under Mr Rudd and Ms Roxon who are adopting the same management style as Nathan Rees and Reba Meagher in New South Wales. We do not want to see the federal health bureaucracy managed in the same way that state Labor has mismanaged health over the last 10 years. I say to all Australians, particularly to those in New South Wales: look at the way that Labor has managed health in your state system and remember that this is exactly the same path that Mr Rudd and Ms Roxon are following. These people are not good for health in this counMAIN COMMITTEE try. Mr Rudd and Labor pretend to be the friend of patients in this country but they are not. Look at the outcomes in public hospitals around the country. Look at the outcomes for older Australians in aged-care facilities right around the country. Our very own Australians are suffering at the moment because the government, at both the federal and the state level, are spending more in the area of health and ageing on bureaucracy than they are on patient outcomes. That is something that we need to take the fight up to the government on because this government promised at the last election that, in the Prime Minister’s own words, they would fix public hospitals. SoI stand in the parliament today and say to the Australian people: Mr Rudd has had 18 months to live up to his promise and he has failed to deliver anything in relation to his promise to fix public hospitals. This Prime Minister has presided over a system in which many public hospitals, over the last 18 months, have deteriorated and yet he is looking the Australian people in the eye and saying that he has fixed public hospitals. If your mother, father or child is in a public hospital or in an aged-care facility at the moment, is the treatment that they are receiving appropriate and adequate? Despite all of the wonderful care that all the doctors and nurses and other allied health professionals provide to patients in this country, the answer can be and must be: no. I say to Australian mums and dads around the country who want to get into hospital when their child is sick: Mr Rudd promised you that he would ‘fix public hospitals’. They were the words he used during the last election campaign. Eighteen months later, nothing has changed; in fact, it has got worse. He is now telling you that things have improved in public hospitals over the last 18 months and, clearly, they have not. That is something that we need to remind the Australian people about. Mr Rudd promised that, if public hospitals were not fixed by mid-2009, he would seek to take them over. At every turn since then, this Prime Minister has sought to walk away from that promise. He does not intend to live up to his promise to take over public hospitals; he is now saying that public hospitals are fixed. I would say to the Australian public: go to the Prime Minister’s website, where it once used to say, ‘I, Kevin Rudd, will fix public hospitals.’ He has now removed those words from his website. He now says that he is going to ‘substantially improve’ public hospitals. And his health minister, in the media recently, said that she would walk away even from that promise. Let’s look at the facts in this debate. Let’s recognise that this government has made a number of promises in relation to improving the provision of public hospital and public health services around the country, and they have delivered on none of those. The state governments at the moment are embroiled in controversy in relation to the numbers that they have been providing to the federal government to say that they have been knocking people off waiting lists. Well, literally they have been knocking people off-not because the surgery has been performed but because either many of these people are dying before they get elective surgery or indeed these figures cannot be relied on because they are being doctored by state health bureaucrats, at the behest of Labor ministers. This is not acceptable in the 21st century. We live in Australia. We should not be told by state health bureaucracies, at the direction of Labor ministers, that they can doctor waiting list outcomes. They should not be telling the federal government and the Prime Minister that they have improved their waiting lists in New South Wales or in Victoria when they have not. Indeed, we know that many of the waiting lists have got worse-they have deteriorated since Mr Rudd has been Prime Minister. Yet Mr Rudd stands up and says to the Australian people, hand on MAIN COMMITTEE heart, that he has fixed public hospitals. He has not. That is why we need to continue this debate. We will support measures that streamline the provision of health services to Australians. We will support measures that do away with this bureaucratic nonsense at a state level. We will help Australians get better health outcomes. We will support legislation that does away with bureaucracy and provides a streamlined path to better health outcomes and the provision of better patient outcomes at public hospitals around the country. There are a lot of questions that need to be answered in relation to this bill. As I have said, we hope that at the Senate inquiry there will be the opportunity for people who have an interest in this area to come forward, to have their concerns aired. We as a coalition will listen to those concerns. We will genuinely listen to what people have to say through the consultation process of the Senate inquiry so that we can help make for a better health system in this country. We want to make sure that we can hear those concerns and urge this government to have them addressed. We do not want to see another bureaucracy created for the sake of creating another bureaucracy. That has continued at a state level for too long. We do not want to be part of this government’s media spin which says: ‘Put your hard hat or your white coat on, go into a hospital or onto a building site and say to the Australian public, “HereI am; great footage. This is me, Prime Minister Rudd, doing as much as I can; I am working hard for the Australian people”’-when in fact it is all just media spin. That is something that this government has quickly become known for. This is the government of media spin, and there is no greater example than in the area of health, where we have seen media spin at a state level over the last 10 years. So let us not fall as a country for the spin that is going on at the moment. If this government has a serious agenda of providing support to our front-line health workers then it should bring it on-and we will support that. We urge this government to spend more on front-line services than in the media units which occupy the state bureaucracies around the country. We will make sure that we provide proper assistance, guidance and support to all of those front-line health workers, who deserve much more support than they have got over the course of the last 10 years because of a failure at the state government level. We will make sure that we recognise the hard work of doctors, of nurses, of physios, of psychologists, of pharmacists and of all health professionals who are working in a range of services and who are passionate about delivering better health outcomes. As a coalition we will support those people because we believe in the services they are providing. We want to support people who are delivering health services at the front-line, as opposed to Labor, who want to support the spinmeisters in the back rooms. We want to make sure that we can help those people who are working in our emergency departments around the country, under great stress, under enormous duress. These are people who work long hours in very demanding conditions. Quite often they are abused at all hours of the day and night, yet they remain so passionate about the health that they are trying to deliver to patients in a time of need. Yet they are frustrated on a daily basis by the bureaucracy and the bureaucratic process that has surrounded them-the bureaucratic process that has been imposed on them by Labor, not because they want to help those health workers and not because they want to help those patients but because they are trying to get the media spin line out to make people believe that they are doing something. MAIN COMMITTEE Labor at a federal and state level have become so obsessed about spin and media control that they have forgotten about patients. This government have forgotten about patients. In their desire to put a hard hat on and get in front of the cameras, they forgot about the people who matter most. It has not taken this government long to adopt the same failed policies of state Labor, particularly the model that has operated in New South Wales over the course of the last 10 years, and that is going to mean even worse patient outcomes in the future. So my plea today to the Australian public is not to look at what Kevin Rudd does. Kevin Rudd is a very tricky political operator-there is no question about that-but he is not delivering better outcomes for Australian patients. We as an alternative government want to make sure that we take the fight up to this government because we believe that they do not have the capacity to improve health services around the country. One of the other concerns that this government has on its books at the moment is in relation to the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme. There is considerable concern in the medical community and in some of the patient advocacy groups around what the government has proposed in relation to national registration and accreditation. I made some comments at the annual dinner of the AMA in Parliament House a few weeks ago and I think I echo the concerns of many within the profession who believe that this government is embarking on an ideological war against those in the medical profession. This is a government that clearly wants to go down the path of the United Kingdom model, with state owned public hospitals and public provision of all health services into the future. It is certainly a case which has failed to have been made in the United Kingdom, and yet for ideological purposes this minister seems intent on taking the first steps in nationalising our health service, which would deliver worse outcomes for Australian patients. We have seen in the recent budget their attacks on private health insurance and their attacks on a range of other health spending. Rural doctors under this budget will be worse off, and some of the detail in the budget papers has been teased out since Tuesday night a couple of weeks ago. The government had a glossy headline about providing services and support to rural health but in the end provided nothing. The minister, in her second reading speech, said that under this bill: For the first time, there will be one single body responsible for the delivery, funding, planning and oversight of all clinical training in this country. If that is truly the minister’s desire, what is at the heart of this bill? If it is going to provide better outcomes, then people will be happy about that, but they will not be happy if it just adds another layer of bureaucracy which does not in the end improve health outcomes for Australian patients. So we flag all of those concerns as part of the coalition’s contribution to this debate today. We do have real concerns about patient outcomes in this country. We do have real concerns that this Labor government at a federal level under Mr Rudd is embarking on the same failed policies and the same failed health management processes that have not proven to be good for patients at a state level. We will listen to the submissions that are made to the Senate inquiry and see what amendments can be made to this legislation to improve the delivery of the minister’s stated outcome. We raise all of those concerns and we look forward to contributing to this debate in due course. MAIN COMMITTEE tralia Bill 2009, which is a bill to establish Health Workforce Australia, a statutory authority that will be established under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate, particularly after listening to the interesting contribution made by the member for Dickson. What a difference 18 months makes. Listening to the member for Dickson making plaintive pleas about the level of funding for public hospitals, one only needs to remember that just over 18 months ago he was part of a government that had busily over the last 12 years ripped enormous funding out of the public health system. The member for Dickson talks about the aspiration of the Rudd government to fix the health system in this country, and the reason it needs to be fixed is that it was broken by the Howard government. In his contribution he also seems to have an obsession about spin, and that betrays his own culpability as a member of a government which wrote the playbook on publicly funded spin. One only needs to look at the $60-odd million that was spent on Work Choices paraphernalia to see testament to that fact. Health Workforce Australia will manage a significant amount of funding around clinical training in this country. It will manage most of the initiatives which are contained in the $1.6 billion health workforce package agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments in November last year. During the 12 long years of the Howard government, the Howard government neglected the health workforce in this country. That is felt no more keenly than in regional Australia. It is felt no more keenly than in Geelong, in my electorate, where there are many private practices that have closed their patient lists and where a simple event such as the retirement of a GP has left, on a number of occasions, many patients without a doctor and struggling to find their way onto a new GP’s list. Right now it is estimated that the doctor-patient ratio in Geelong is about one to 1,500. The GP Association of Geelong estimate that we in Geelong are about 40 GPs short of achieving what they believe would be the ideal ratio of one GP to every 1,200 people. That is a reflection of the state that the health workforce has found itself in after 12 years of the Howard government. This government, the Rudd government, intends to act differently in relation to health and this bill is very much an example of that. We are providing an unprecedented level of funding for health care in this country. The $1.6 billion provided by COAG in November of last year, consisting of $1.1 billion from the Commonwealth and $540 million from the states, represents the single largest investment in the health workforce in this country ever made by Australian governments. Five hundred million dollars of the Commonwealth’s contribution will be spent on undergraduate clinical training and that will increase the clinical training subsidy to 30 per cent for all health undergraduate places. There will also be $175.6 million spent over four years in capital infrastructure to expand teaching and training places. This particularly will have a focus on regional and rural Australia where the shortage of GPs and indeed other medical practitioners is felt most acutely. What we know is that students who train in rural areas tend to practise in rural Australia. The health education sector in Geelong has become an area of enormous activity within our town. But we remain in desperate need of trained practitioners. As I stated, the GP Association estimated that we are 40 GPs short of an optimal level. There are 18 medical practices across MAIN COMMITTEE",125,Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009
222,Mr Marles (Corio) (4.54 Pm),"I rise to speak in support of the Health Workforce AusGeelong right now which are currently looking for GPs. We are also experiencing a shortage in other health professional fields-nursing being another case in point. The Deakin University School of Nursing is a fantastic example of a part of the education sector which is going from strength to strength. It is now one of the largest nursing schools in Australia. It is the largest nursing school in Victoria and it is growing. Last year across the three campuses of Deakin which do nursing training-Burwood, Warrnambool and Geelong-540 nurses graduated, and of that number 200 graduated in Geelong. Most of those 200 have clinical placements in hospitals in and around Geelong and the vast majority have a placement at the Geelong Hospital, which is becoming one of the busiest hospitals in this state and, indeed, a major teaching hospital within the state. Last year we had the opening of the Deakin Medical School. It was opened on 1 May last year by the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. There are right now 136 first-year students at the Deakin Medical School and 114 second-year students. The first year of graduation will be 2011. All of that is going to help significantly to deal with the issue of the health workforce in Geelong. But as student numbers grow, without any intervention we are going to find that the system will strain to place those students in clinical training places. That is why this bill is being put in place to establish Health Workforce Australia to manage the $1.6 billion investment in this area, and that will expand the scope of training opportunities. It will help find new and varied places for medical students, nursing students and allied health students to train. It will usher in a new era in health training within our country. Importantly, the bill will open up the private sector, such as private hospitals or private practices, to training students. It is very costly for those private practices and hospitals to take on a student and that is particularly the case when we are talking about allied health students such as physiotherapists or speech therapists. It is particularly difficult for those areas because they have never had, until now, an identified funding stream for their clinical training. Most of the training does occur in private practices and it requires time and effort. There are of course many practitioners who are happy to take on students, through their sheer love of teaching on the job, but in many cases educational institutions find themselves in the position of needing to beg practitioners to take on students in these clinical training places. Health Workforce Australia and the funding that it will administer will help cover the cost of taking on students in private practice, which is a very important and necessary resource intervention in this country. Another added benefit associated with Health Workforce Australia is that it will have a research function. For the first time it will be gathering very important data on the health workforce which can assist in informing public policy makers about how to improve the situation of the health workforce around Australia. In terms of the practicalities, this bill establishes Health Workforce Australia, which will administer the new funding and provide an overarching organisational structure. The bill provides for $125 million over a four-year period for the work of Health Workforce Australia. The governance structure of Health Workforce Australia will involve one representative from each state and territory, an independent chair and up to three independent members. That is a very important governance structure and will provide the proper advice to the constituencies that Health Workforce Australia will provide for. MAIN COMMITTEE At present, there is a division in the responsibilities for health between state governments and the Commonwealth government. Indeed, for many years this country has been experiencing a blame game, particularly under the Howard government, where blame would be shifted from one tier of government to another and, in the process of doing that, problems that needed to be solved within the health system fell through the cracks. Far from describing an extra layer of bureaucracy, as the member for Dickson was intimating in his contribution, Health Workforce Australia will provide a way of breaking through that barrier between state and Commonwealth responsibilities, it will have an overarching responsibility across the state and the Commonwealth and it will assist in removing that blame game. It will also assist in providing something of a bridge across both the education and the health sectors. In doing that, it will meet the future challenges of the health system through workforce reform. There will be put in place a mechanism which will allow health ministers around the country to direct the work of Health Workforce Australia; there will also be put in place a mechanism to allow Health Workforce Australia to report to health ministers. There is a need to get on with the business of this bill. Health Workforce Australia needs to be established from 1 July this year in order to be fully in place to administer the funding that exists for the coordination of clinical places from 1 January next year. In summary, this is a very important bill which provides for an overarching governance structure of a very important and extensive initiative to provide funding for health training in this country. I say this from the point of view of a regional MP in this place and particularly from the point of view of Geelong: we hope that through this additional funding in relation to the training of health professionals we increase the numbers of health professionals practising in regional Australia and address the current shortfall. For those reasons, I very much commend this bill to the House. Australia Bill 2009 and say the very simple word: hallelujah! If this is the moment in time when we see the Australian government, regardless of its political persuasion, step up to the plate and start to take some authority with regard to health planning generally within this country, it is a moment that is long overdue and will be welcomed by many into the future. I am sure all of my fellow local members-there are 150 of us in this place-see what I see on a daily basis when working in the electorate and working on the issues around health services on the ground: a disconnected and fractured arrangement between state and federal government in the delivery of health services and a constant passing of the buck-for want of a better phrase-between the two tiers of government in what should be the provision of health services for the greater good. If this is the moment that creates the entity that allows the various Council of Australian Government ministers to come together and start, in a very practical sense, to deliver outcomes in the public interest rather than in the state’s best interest or the Commonwealth government’s best interest, then this is a good initiative, a welcome initiative and one I strongly support. It is potentially the start of the conversation with community on some of the language we have heard from government over the last 12 months and in some of the reviews, including the Garling review, that we have seen in the last 12 months with regard to the hopefully increased role that the Commonwealth could and should take in health services in this country. If this is that moment, I place great significance on it. Perhaps in the future we will see the MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009
223,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (5.06 Pm),"I wholeheartedly support the Health WorkforceHigh Court case of 2006, called the WorkChoices case-ironically used to test the corporations powers with regard to the entity that was being created by the Commonwealth-pushing the issue with the states, who ultimately have authority in the decision-making process in workforce planning and health services generally. I do not think that is a moment that any of us in public planning should shy away from; rather, all of us in public planning should be fully supportive of a minister and a government if that is part of the agenda that we are seeing with this bill. The mid-North Coast of New South Wales is covered by an entity called the North Coast Area Health Service, whose operating budget this year has a deficit of between $30 million and $40 million. In response to this situation, it is looking to lay off up to 400 staff across the region-from Johns River in the south to the Queensland border in the north. That is a significant change in the way health services will be delivered within our region. The financial pressure on the area health service is due to the resource distribution formula. The resources are supposedly allocated on fairness and equity principles, but in reality the allocation is both unfair and inequitable. The allocation of funds to the North Coast Area Health Service under the RDF is, I am sure, a concern shared by my colleague the member for Page. Because the mid-North Coast is a high-growth area, the state government has traditionally underfunded the North Coast Area Health Service by between two and four per cent of the resource distribution formula. That might not sound like much, but in real dollar terms it means that between $20 million and $40 million per annum is going not to our region but to other areas of New South Wales on an inequitable and unfair basis. If the North Coast Area Health Service were receiving equitable funding from the state under the resource distribution formula, we would not be facing the workforce issues that we are currently facing in the Hastings-Macleay region. The CEO of the area health service is talking about laying off 40 staff in a number of different roles across the entire area health service. As I said previously, up to 400 staff are potentially going to be laid off as part of this budget deficit. If the state were providing equitable funding under the RDF, we would not be in this situation and the budget would be balanced. The area health service has been left in the extremely difficult position of having to lay off a large number of its workforce. Communities will suffer the inevitable service delivery issues within the health sector as a consequence of the state government’s unwillingness to make the hard decisions in other areas of New South Wales to establish equity and fairness in their own resource distribution formula. That is why this bill, if it allows the Commonwealth to start to mobilise in regard to workforce planning, is not just a piece of paper that we are never going to see anything more of again. It is vitally important work being done by the Commonwealth, and hopefully it will be a trigger for very real action in the future and for the Commonwealth to have significant involvement in this problem. The New South Wales government is dysfunctional, disconnected and doing a disservice to communities on the North Coast. It is not willing to make the difficult decisions that it should make, particularly about the traditional sandstone hospitals in the Sydney CBD. They are difficult decisions but that is exactly the role that governments need to and should play. We have a half-a-dozen sandstone hospitals smack in the centre of the CBD that are essentially money MAIN COMMITTEE for the region. Whenever these issues arise, the regions should have a stake in these conversations. Unless they do, we will continue to see inequitable and unfair delivery of government budgeting, which is what we are currently seeing. The government has been quite open about it. On the North Coast-and it would be a similar story in other areas with high growth rates-we are at least $20 million, and up to $40 million, per annum behind on our fair slice of the pie based on the government’s own funding formula. The area health service is incredibly frustrated, as are all the communities on the North Coast. If we only got fairness-and I stand here and ask only for fairness-it would significantly alter the workforce issues and health service delivery issues in one of the fastestgrowing regions in Australia. This is important legislation. I hope that the government’s intent in creating this entity, and the authority attached to it, is honourable, whether it be pursued through the informal processes of the COAG negotiations and the conversations between ministers and the various stakeholders or, as I previously said, used in the more legal and formal context we have seen through pushing issues such as Corporations Law and issues of a constitutional nature. Whatever it takes, health service delivery and health workforce issues can be done better in this country. I think there would be general agreement on that. I am pleased that the government has recognised that. I am pleased that we are seeing this bill go through. My request now to the government, to the executive and to the minister in particular, is to make it work practically and to use this legislation and the powers of Health Workforce Australia to create a better health system for all of us in Australia. force Australia Bill 2009. This bill establishes Health Workforce Australia, a national health workforce authority. It forms part of the package agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments in November 2008. Health Workforce Australia will be responsible for implementing the majority of initiatives under the COAG workforce package, which I will detail and outline shortly. I represent one of the oldest electorates in the country and, as chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I have a very keen interest in health issues. I believe that Australia’s health system is one of the best in the world. This is mainly due to our highly competent professional health workforce-our nurses, doctors, allied health professionals and researchers-who are among the best qualified and most professional in the world. When I was on the last parliamentary health and ageing committee inquiry into public hospitals, we saw figures that showed that $1 billion was slashed from public hospitals under the previous government. We had a decade of neglect. But this government is stepping up to the mark and is determined to deliver dramatic improvements in health care. The state of our public hospitals: June 2008 report was based on figures from when the previous government was in power. I will read out some of those figures. In 2006-07, public hospital admissions increased by around three per cent. That is more than twice the rate of population growth. When did this happen? In 2006-07. Who was in government then? The Howard government. Again in 2006-07, there were 6.7 million presentations to emergency departments. That is equivalent to a third of Australia’s population. When did this happen? It happened under the MAIN COMMITTEE",133,Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009
224,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (5.17 Pm),"I too rise to speak today on the Health Workformer government. Yet at that period of time when we asked questions all that we heard was the blame game. All we heard from the other side during question time when these questions were raised by us when we were in opposition was, ‘Blame the states.’ The number of patients presenting to emergency departments between 1998-99 and 2006-07 increased by over 34 per cent. Three in 10 emergency department patients were not seen within the recommended time. This all happened under the watch of the former Howard coalition government. At the same time, we were suffering chronic shortages and underinvestment in the health workforce. The end result of this neglect by the previous government is that there are now chronic shortages in general practice, various medical specialties, dentistry, nursing and certain allied health professions. The ageing of the population will also have significant implications on the demand for health resources and the healthcare workforce. That is why we need action now. This government has stepped up to the plate and is working collaboratively with the state governments on solutions. The government is investing in the whole health system across the whole country to deliver better health outcomes for all Australians. Despite the major challenges caused by the global recession, health and ageing remains one of the top priorities for the Rudd Labor government. We saw this the other night in the recent budget, which delivered the landmark amount of $64 billion to the healthcare agreement with the states and territories. That will provide record levels of funding for public hospitals and reduce pressure on emergency departments. It provided a $1.3 billion Health and Hospitals Fund and investment in cancer infrastructure as part of a $2 billion package focused on tackling the wide disparity in cancer treatment outcomes for cancer patients in rural and regional areas. It also provides a $1.5 billion investment to upgrade hospitals and clinical training infrastructure across Australia and invested $430.3 million in state-of-the-art research and clinical training facilities. It also provided more funding for training doctors, including a 35 per cent increase in GP training places. That is significant growth. It also provided funding for growing the nursing workforce, including through enhancing the role of the highly skilled nurse practitioner workforce. These reforms help tackle the health workforce shortages, which are the legacy of the inaction of the previous government. The budget also provided more funding for provision of health services in rural areas to address severe health workforce shortages, which again the previous government neglected over its 11 years in office. In November 2008 the Council of Australian Governments signed off on the historic $1.6 billion health workforce package. This package forms part of the National Partnership Agreement on Hospital and Health Workforce Reform. This was signed by all states and territories in March 2009. The package, comprising approximately $1.1 billion of Commonwealth funding and $539.2 million from states and territories, is the single largest investment in the health workforce ever made by Australian governments. This investment will improve health workforce capacity, efficiency and productivity. It will do this by improving clinical training arrangements, increasing postgraduate training places for medical graduates, improving health workforce planning across Australia and enhancing training infrastructure, particularly, I stress again, in regional and rural areas. A significant part of the COAG package is the establishment of a national health workforce authority-or Health Workforce Australia, as it will be known-to produce more effective, MAIN COMMITTEE streamlined and integrated clinical training arrangements and to support workforce planning and policy. The Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009 establishes Health Workforce Australia and implements a majority of the COAG health workforce initiatives. The bill specifies the functions, government and structure of Health Workforce Australia. It enables the health ministers to provide directions to Health Workforce Australia and it requires Health Workforce Australia to report to the health ministers. Health Workforce Australia will be responsible for: funding, planning and coordinating undergraduate clinical training across all health disciplines; supporting clinical training supervision; supporting health workforce research and planning, including through a national workforce planning statistical resource; funding simulation training; and providing advice to health ministers on relevant national workforce issues. The authority will also ensure best value for money for these workforce initiatives and a more rapid and substantive progression of the necessary policy and planning activities. HWA, or Health Workforce Australia, is to commence management of undergraduate clinical training from 1 January next year. This bill is required to establish Health Workforce Australia by July 2009 to ensure that it is operational within the time frames agreed to in the COAG national partnership agreement. The COAG health workforce package is a major investment in making the necessary and much-needed improvements to the health workforce through effective planning and policy development. It will work with and across jurisdictions and with the education and health sectors, and it is pivotal for the success of the COAG package. For the first time, there will be one single body responsible for the delivery, funding, planning and oversight of all clinical training in this country. This is the creation of a new single body which can operate across both the health and the education sectors and which will have responsibility in health. It is critical to devising national solutions that effectively integrate workforce planning and policy. I am proud to say that the Rudd Labor government is committed to addressing the chronic shortages which are affecting our health system and is providing support to the dedicated and hard working professionals that are the backbone of our health system. I am pleased today to be able to support the Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (5.28 pm)-I strongly support the Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009 and in fact welcome it because it will address some major gaps in health workforce planning and service delivery. I commend the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, for her good work in getting this bill to the stage where it is before the House and for the work she has done through COAG in securing those agreements, which will be vital for the operation of the HWA when it is set up. Through this bill, the Rudd government will establish a national health workforce authority. It is an example of the cooperation that is required between the Commonwealth and the states to address some of the outstanding, long-running issues around health-around demarcation, who does what where, who is funding what and some general service delivery issues. It will be called Health Workforce Australia, HWA-another acronym, I know. I am afraid every area is replete with them. HWA is part of the $1.6 billion health workforce reform package agreed to by COAG in November 2008. HWA will, among other things, manage the majority of initiatives under this particular COAG package. The character of HWA will be that of a statutory authority under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, commonly referred to as the CAC Act. MAIN COMMITTEE I now turn to why this new body, HWA, is needed. I will then move on to its specific role and comment on its salience to, and impact on, rural and regional Australia. I will then make some general comments. BeforeI do that, I would like to associate myself with some of the comments made by the member for Lyne in his contribution, particularly about the Garling inquiry. I appeared before that inquiry and gave a written submission on what the member for Lyne was talking about-the resource distribution formula. Under this formula, the North Coast, of which my seat of Page is a part, will be underfunded by a certain percentage-that is, according to the information on the New South Wales Department of Health website. This has an impact on service delivery for the North Coast Area Health Service. The figure is somewhere between $20 million and $40 million-because there is no absolute agreement on the percentage by which we are underfunded. Over the years, there has been a ratcheting-up of the North Coast in that area, but it is not enough. It would be good to see NSW Health make some announcements on corrective action in that particular area. Health workforce planning has suffered generally from a lack of targeted planning, a lack of coordination and a lack of a unitary body that can operate across sectors and jurisdictions. Over the years, I have seen some well-meaning projects aimed at securing more doctors and nurses for rural areas. Some of them have been successful and some of them have not-most often, they are in the latter category. There have been some state and territory schemes, but there is no overarching national approach-particularly over the last decade, when the need for doctors, nurses and other health professionals was escalating. There was an axing of GP training places and a big reduction in the amount of money that the Commonwealth put into the Australian healthcare agreements. The contribution from the Commonwealth went down from 50 per cent to about 43 per cent. This reduction in funding certainly had an impact on the public health system, particularly the public hospitals, to which a lot of the dollars from the Australian healthcare agreements go. We have all seen in our own local areas and nationwide a doubling in the number of presentations at hospital accident and emergency departments. All local members would be familiar with that. The numbers have almost doubled in most places. There are a number of reasons for that. It is about the lack of funding that is available, but it is also about changes in the work practices of GPs and medical health professionals in our communities. There was a time when some doctors were always on call and you were able to access them out of hours, but that has changed in a lot of areas as well. There is so much in health that needs to be redressed, addressed, corrected and fixed up. There are matters that have been left unattended by a range of governments, particularly the previous government, whose policy laziness astounds me. Since we came to government, that is one of the things I have been discovering more and more of. The creation of this new single body, HWA, will address some of the gaps that I have outlined above. It will address them in a formal sense and I hope that it will address them in an informal sense as well. That discussion needs to happen on a daily basis so that some of these issues can be addressed in our communities. HWA will operate across both the health and education sectors, sharing jurisdictional responsibilities. It is essential to have effective coordination and integration of workforce planning and policy, running in tandem with the complementary reforms to education and training. This will cover integrated clinical training arrangements and, critically, support workforce policy and planning for the future. MAIN COMMITTEE In addressing why HWA is needed, I have covered some of its role but I take this opportunity to elucidate this point. HWA will comprehensively plan, coordinate and fund preprofessional entry clinical training across all health disciplines. This training will, among other things, provide key support for coordination and supervision at regional and local health service levels. There will be new arrangements that attach clinical training funding to students in a range of settings-and they can be private or community-with payments to service providers. To support the training to universities and other accredited training providers, they can enter into arrangements with HWA so their own students are able to secure appropriate clinical training places. This has been one of those areas, one of those gaps. For the first time, we will have a national body charged with taking a national approach to health workforce policy and that will be able to provide advice to ministers on health workforce issues. We will also have improved national health workforce information and a national workforce statistical resource developed that will have some cogency and some credibility to it. Back in early 2008, when I was pursuing the matter of Lismore’s status as an area of need vis-a-vis doctors, I found that the figures that the previous government used for health workforce planning-particularly in rural areas-were based on 1991 census figures. That says it all, really. The figures were so out of date that they had no relationship to reality. Finally, and most importantly to me and the people of Page, will be the impact of the establishment of HWA on rural and regional Australia. (1), HWA will assist and improve access to services in rural areas by delivering more doctors and nurses. We know that is what we need, but we need a range of other specialties and allied health professionals as well. I hope that HWA will be able to work on these areas. (2), it will provide those doctors and nurses with better support while they train. (3), HWA will facilitate more opportunities for expanding clinical training arrangements in rural locations, and that is a good thing. (4), HWA will provide greater opportunities for skills development in the rural based workforce. I will give an example of a local issue I am dealing with, in Urbenville. The honourable member for New England and I share Urbenville. you, Mr Deputy Speaker Schultz, would know very well. ful doctors-they are a couple-and they needed particular help with the upgrading of the Tenterfield Shire Council owned facility they use. I am pleased to say that in the budget there was a grant of $295,000 for them and the council to provide the medical practice service to the local community. Areas like that will be addressed by the new HWA. not sure what it is, but everyone seems a bit excited. being on your left, but never mind! MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009

This is a very important bill because it allows for the first time proper workforce planning throughout Australia. We have heard from pretty much every contributor so far about their own local situations and the difficulties that are there. I, too, want to start with my local situation, because I think it gives a good reason as to why the HWA is so important and why we do need to actually plan our health workforce better than we have in the past. Wyong Hospital, which falls in the beautiful electorate of Dobell, happens to have the fifth busiest emergency department in New South Wales. Yet we struggle to have emergency doctors at the emergency department and rely regularly on locums. While the popular press is quick to blame the state government in terms of these issues, it is not nearly as simple as that. It is really about planning to make sure that our health workforce is there and available. Wyong Hospital has been substantially rebuilt under the state Labor government. But there is no point having a brand spanking new hospital if you cannot get fixed when you go there and there is no-one there to see you. That is the importance of making sure that we have proper planning for the health workforce. We recently at Wyong Hospital had the maternity ward close down for some months because there were no obstetricians that could be attracted to the area. This was not a fault of the local area health service. It was not a fault of the state government. There were widespread advertisements trying to attract them. There just were not enough doctors because there had not been enough planning to make sure that our hospitals are properly staffed. This is one of the key motivating forces as to why Health Workforce Australia is being established. In the end, with the maternity ward, they had to look at alternate ways of delivering maternity. In Wyong we adopted a midwifery model, which is working tremendously well. My partner and I are soon to avail ourselves of the services of Wyong Hospital, in July of this year. So we are pleased, from a personal point of view, that that is going well, too. What it illustrated was that because of a lack of planning over many years the model needed to change and we needed to plan better for the future, and that is precisely what this bill does. There is also a very different approach to the way in which the Rudd government will be working with the states compared with the approach of the previous government to these things. Unlike the previous government, we actually intend to work with the states. There cannot be a better and more important example of this than Health Workforce Australia being established. This came out of COAG, where we were able to reach agreement with the other states to make sure that we do plan properly in terms of our health workforce. There is no point setting up different regions of Australia or different states in Australia to compete for the limited pie in terms of the workforce that exists there at the moment. We need to increase the pie, and we need to do that by properly planning where they go. For too long we have seen different health professionals being lured away from one state, and there has been a temporary situation where that state or that particular region may be better off. But it is only temporary if you are not actually increasing the numbers overall and you are not taking a position that looks at the workforce needs across the country. That is precisely what this package intends to do. MAIN COMMITTEE",139,Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009

234,Mr Craig Thomson (Dobell) (5.40 Pm),"I rise to support the Health Workforce AusThe Commonwealth will provide $125 million over four years for the establishment and the operation of Health Workforce Australia. A further $1.2 billion in combined Commonwealth, state and territory funding will be administered through the HWA for the majority of the initiatives under the COAG health workforce package. Given the tight time frames to implement the COAG health workforce package, the HWA needs to be established by July 2009 so it can start managing clinical placements from the start of the 2010 academic year. Let us have a look at the background of Health Workforce Australia. In November 2008, COAG agreed to a $1.6 billion health workforce package. The Commonwealth is contributing $1.1 billion to the COAG package, with the states and territories providing $539.2 million. The COAG package forms part of the national partnership agreement on hospital and health workforce reform signed by all states and territories in March 2009. This package gives the Commonwealth greater involvement in the health workforce, traditionally an area managed by the states and territories. It means that we take a national position in terms of health workforce rather than setting states and territories to compete against each other in relation to where the workforce should be best utilised. The package includes establishing a national health workforce authority to produce more effective, streamlined and integrated clinical training arrangements and to support workforce planning and policy development. The authority will implement the majority of the initiatives under the COAG package, including funding, planning and coordinating pre-professional entry clinical training across all health disciplines; supporting clinical training supervision, health workforce research and planning, including through a national workforce planning statistical database; funding simulation training; providing a national approach to workforce planning; and providing a secretariat and research support to an independent advisory council for the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme. The authority will also ensure best value for money for the workforce initiatives, more rapid and substantive planning for future workforce needs and will provide advice to health ministers on relevant workforce issues. I can recall in the late 1990s in New South Wales when linear accelerators were first coming into hospitals to provide vital cancer treatment. We had the terrible situation of these very expensive machines in some parts of Sydney not working to capacity not because the state government had not provided the machines and the capital but because they could not get the staff to operate these machines. That clearly adversely affected the treatment and ongoing rehabilitation of cancer sufferers. That is something that we should be able to avoid through proper planning of the workforce. The Commonwealth will also fund the establishment and operation of the authority at $125 million over four years, and the authority will administer around $1.2 billion of Commonwealth and state and territory funding for workforce initiatives. Health ministers have agreed to the authority being called Health Workforce Australia. Health ministers also agreed to Health Workforce Australia being established under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act, therefore providing governance arrangements that reflect the shared funding and policy interests of all jurisdictions. The bill is required to establish the HWA as a statutory authority under the act and to specify the functions, governance and structure of the HWA. Given the functions and level of funding for which HWA will be responsible, it is essential that there is a legislative basis for its operations. The bill will also enable mechanisms for health ministers to provide directions MAIN COMMITTEE to the HWA and for the HWA to report to health ministers. The HWA will be governed by a board comprising a nominee from each jurisdiction represented on the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council and a chair, and may include up to three independent members selected by health ministers. The board’s responsibilities will include advising and reporting to health ministers and developing policies and operational plans as required. A chief executive officer will be responsible for the day-to-day administration of Health Workforce Australia and will report to the board. Expert committees and consultants will be engaged to assist with the HWA functions as required. HWA is to commence management of pre-professional entry clinical training from January 2010. This bill is required to establish HWA by July 2009 to ensure it is operational within the time frames agreed to in the COAG health workforce reform package. The Rudd government are committed to dramatically improving Australia’s health system, and setting up Health Workforce Australia as a statutory authority is just one small part of that. In the 2009-10 budget we are delivering a vital boost to our hard working doctors, nurses and midwives with a series of major investments to expand and modernise our health workforce. The Rudd government are delivering more training places for GPs, providing Medicare Benefits Scheme and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme access for nurse practitioners and midwives, and reforming support scholarships and training programs. The budget initiatives build on the government’s unprecedented $1.1 billion package of COAG reforms to expand Australia’s health workforce. The COAG package increases funding for undergraduate clinical training and postgraduate training places and establishes a national health workforce agency to drive a more strategic long-term plan for the health workforce. The budget workforce initiatives will invest $148 million over five years for additional GP training places in 2009 and 2010. It will provide training for remote vocational training scheme GP places in 2011. In addition, there will be a further 212 GP training places provided through the COAG package by 2011. This will permanently increase the number of GP training places to more than 800 per annum from 2011 onwards-a 35 per cent increase on the cap of 600 places imposed since 2004. The budget initiatives will encourage more junior doctors to become GPs by investing an additional $41.2 million over four years in high-quality supervised general practice training under the Prevocational General Practice Placement Program and will establish the first medical school in the Northern Territory with a strong focus on increasing the number of Indigenous doctors. The government will invest $27.8 million in capital funding to establish the medical school plus $4.4 million over three years from July 2010 in ongoing funding. The government will recognise the valuable role and skills that nurses bring to the health system and to the broader community through providing access to the MBS and PBS for nurse practitioners, at a cost of $59.7 million over four years. This will improve the flexibility and the capacity of Australia’s health workforce, improve patient access to services and provide eligibility for midwives to access MBS and PBS for the first time, expanding choice for women at a cost of $66.6 million over four years. These measures will improve the flexibility of the health workforce and facilitate better access to services for patients. There are currently significant workforce shortages affecting both pathology and diagnostic imaging. To address this, the government will fund an increase of $10.8 million over four years for pathology places. There will be an additional $5.7 million over four years for radiMAIN COMMITTEE ologists. The government will also introduce a mentoring and academic support initiative for rural pathologists at a cost of $6.2 million over four years. You can see that there is a significant range of additional dollars that are going from the budget to supplement and improve the delivery of health care across Australia. This piece of legislation that helps to plan our workforce is an integral part of that whole package. I recently had the pleasure of breaking the news in my electorate of Dobell on the Central Coast that a very capable and experienced partnership of doctors had successfully tendered to establish a super GP clinic in the key growth area of Warnervale. This current doctors’ partnership runs a Toukley medical practice, where there are 17 doctors working along with a range of other health professionals, and another practice at Tuggerah where there are an additional seven doctors. A shortage of GPs is a real issue in my electorate, as it is in many electorates around Australia. In fact, the most common problem in the electorate of Dobell is not about how much you pay when you get to a doctor, it is actually being able to get in to see one because many of them have closed their books. The Rudd government in relation to its program of opening up super GP clinics across the country has again contributed in a major way in my electorate to making primary health care more accessible to the people of Dobell. This, along with providing these additional training places for GPs in the coming three years means that we are going to have more doctors available on the ground to be able to see to the people of Australia and to make sure their health is better looked after. This is an important piece of legislation, because it means that for the first time across the country we are able to plan and look at the way we deliver our health care, matching up the demand for health care with the training that is required for health professionals and making sure that they are not only trained but sent to the places where they are needed in the numbers that are needed. It is long overdue in this country. We have had many commentators on the health system speaking for many years about the silos of health care that operate in this country. This is a significant step towards making sure that these silos are broken down, that we can go across state borders and that we can plan properly so that the health care of all of our citizens is better planned for and better looked after. I commend this bill to the House. Ms REA (Bonner) (5.55 pm)-I too rise to support the Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009, which was introduced by the Minister for Health and Ageing in the parliament not so long ago, and I am very pleased to have the opportunity to not just speak on it but also support it. The Rudd government was elected in November 2007 most particularly on a platform of restoring the community’s confidence in the government’s ability to deliver vital services and much-needed basic community and social infrastructure. In fact, it was elected on a platform to support the needs of all Australians. For too long the previous government had culled services, selectively funded its pet projects and underfunded very basic and vital services. Nowhere is this better exemplified than in the $1 billion that was cut from the federal health budget-an indictment on the previous government but unfortunately also a major challenge for the newly elected Rudd government to restore funding for our health system and to restore the confidence of the Australian people in our health system. This bill is a significant step in restoring that confidence. The Rudd Labor government also promised to end the blame game. Nowhere was the blame game more evident than in the debate about health and health funding across this country. We all know that we need a health system that will support all Australians, particularly MAIN COMMITTEE those who are most vulnerable and in need of public services. I come from Queensland, so I know too well how the blame game played out in that state. We all know-it is no secretthat our health system is under challenge. We all know that the taxpayer’s dollar is finite and that governments are always struggling to find a way to put more resources into all of our services-particularly in health-and to ensure those resources are spent as effectively as they can possibly be. The Queensland government has been trying to do that through its support for the public health system. It would have been nice, I think, to have had a federal government over the last 10 years that was in fact prepared to work in partnership with the state government to support our health system and to see that resources coming from both levels of government were used most effectively to ensure that Queensland has the health system that they deserve. But, unfortunately, the health system in Queensland was simply used as a political football, and those who fell through the cracks were simply considered collateral damage as far as the federal government was concerned. We know that one of the biggest pressures on our public hospital system is the lack of services in our suburbs and our local communities-the lack of trained health professionals and the lack of GPs, particularly in after-hours services and particularly on weekends and in the evenings. We all know that a baby with an ear infection does not confine it between the hours of nine and five. They get ear infections any time-in the case of my children, most often at about one o’clock in the morning. It is then that you actually need a doctor. Unfortunately, in most cases these days, the only place you can find that emergency treatment is a public hospital. So the best way to support public hospitals in the state of Queensland, and indeed across the country, is to support and resource more doctors and more GPs in our local communities. The Health Workforce Australia Bill is a fundamental part of the COAG agreement of health ministers to provide health services and health professionals to our communities where they are needed most. That is why I believe this bill is of great significance. It is a commitment of $1.6 billion in combined funding from both the Commonwealth and the states. The Commonwealth will put in $125 million over four years to run Health Workforce Australia. It will be a statutory authority established under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. It will consist of a board of directors, a nominee of each state and territory and the Commonwealth, an independent chair and may include up to three independent members selected by health ministers. It is important that the governance is right, and I believe that this representation from both the Commonwealth and the states and territories will indicate quite clearly that there is a partnership between those two levels of government to ensure that our health resources and our precious health dollars are used most effectively and most wisely. WhatI believe is so important about this authority is that its focus is on training, on planning and on policy development. Why do I say that? I say that because of the comments I have already made. If we had had a coordinated and cooperative approach from the Commonwealth and state governments over the last 10 years, we would not be in the situation we are in now. We would have had the clinical staff on the ground. We would have had the resources put into the training that is needed to build up our health professionals across the whole of the health profession. That is not just doctors but allied health professionals as well. We would have had a body that was able to identify areas like my own electorate of Bonner. South-East Queensland is one of the fastest-growing areas in the country. We would have had an independent body that understood the pressure on population growth and was able to plan MAIN COMMITTEE the health workforce and the services required to meet the demands of that growing population before it was too late. That would have happened before people could not find a doctor at one o’clock in the morning and before the emergency section of the local hospital was understaffed and over-pressured because people were waiting for routine medical assistance that they should have been able to get through their local GP-if it was not after five o’clock in the afternoon. What is also very important about this bill is that it combines the critical elements of training, planning and preparing ourselves for the needs of the future with policy development. We all know, as I said earlier, that the taxpayers’ dollar is finite. We have to spread it across many services, many needs and many demands on the government. We all know that in the health debate, if you talk to doctors on the ground and if you talk to the nurses in the hospital wards, they will tell you that money is not the only solution. They will say that, yes, of course more funds could always be used in our health system but that just as effective as more money is how the money we have is spent. That is why this authority is so important to delivering a better health service. They will tell you that the critical part of our health system is not just the bricks and mortar-that is, the hospitals, the physical structures-but the staff, the trained workforce. It is the numbers in those hospitals, the GPs on the ground, the quality of the training and the number of trained people in this country to provide health services to our community. That is why this bill is so important. It does not just say, ‘Let’s throw money at the problem.’ It says: ‘Let’s spend the money where it’s needed, in developing our trained staff. Let’s plan for the future and let’s make sure that we’ve got the right people developing the policies that we need to make our health system even better.’ I know that the good people of the electorate of Bonner will certainly welcome this. We have a small local hospital in the electorate of Bonner, the Wynnum Hospital, which of course provides an essential service to our local community. We also, as part of Brisbane, rely on the three major hospitals in Brisbane, particularly those on the south side, the Princess Alexandra Hospital and the Mater Private Hospital, to provide the much needed services that are required in the city. It is so important to that very fast growing area of Brisbane, one of the fastest growing areas in the country, that we have the health workforce and the planning and policy development that will be able to cater for that growth into the future. I also have many very good, committed and dedicated local health people working in that area-in particular, the general practitioners who I meet with regularly through the South East Alliance of General Practice that covers the Bonner electorate. They know what is needed on the ground, they know what is needed to support the health needs of our community and they know what the demands in the future will be. I am sure that they will be very pleased to see that this government has actually listened to what they are saying and has said, ‘We are prepared to put money into supporting you and giving you both the policy and the health workers that you require.’ This Health Workforce Australia Bill is also, as I said, part of the overall health agreement that has been discussed and agreed to by the health ministers at COAG-the states and the Commonwealth working together. It will be part of delivering the very important Health Workforce National Partnership. Some significant dollars will see major improvements to our health system across this country: $500 million to support the expansion of undergraduate MAIN COMMITTEE clinical training places; $86 million to provide 212 additional ongoing GP training places, a 33 per cent increase on the previous government’s cap; 73 additional specialist training places in the private sector; $28 million to help train 18,000 nurse supervisors, 5,000 allied health and VET supervisors and 7,000 medical supervisors; a $175.6 million investment in capital infrastructure to support training of our workforce; construction of new and mobile high-tech stimulated learning environments; expansion of education and training facilities at our major regional hospitals; and $264 million for other important initiatives, including the national health workforce agency. In conclusion, whilst the establishment of a health workforce authority may not get a lot of publicity out there in the community, I take this opportunity as the member for Bonner to say that this particular initiative will go a long way to supporting the health needs of the people in Bonner and fellow Queenslanders. But, more importantly, it will see the education sectors, the health sectors, the health workforce, the people on the ground, those in government, including ministers, and those working in bureaucracies for the first time in a long time working together to develop a health strategy for our country that will improve our health system, end the blame game and stop health being nothing more than a political football. 2009 to the House. With regard to my colleague the member for Bonner, who just spoke, I acknowledge the passion and the conviction that she has about healthcare services in Queensland. I totally concur with her comments and commend her passion and conviction. We have also heard from the member for Dobell and the member for Page, and we will be hearing from the member for Kingston and the member for Blair, who I know also share a deep conviction of the importance of providing top-quality health care to all Australians, regardless of wealth, position, creed or background. This bill establishes Health Workforce Australia, known as HWA, as a statutory authority under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. The principal provisions in the bill specify the functions, governance and structure of the HWA, and the HWA will manage the majority of initiatives under the $1.6 billion health workforce package agreed by the Council of Australian Governments, known as COAG, in November 2008. The Commonwealth will provide $125 million over four years for the establishment and operation of HWA. A further $1.2 billion in combined Commonwealth, state and territory funding will be administered through the HWA for the majority of initiatives under the COAG health workforce package. HWA will implement the majority of initiatives under the COAG health workforce package, which is expected to positively impact the community, including through improvements in clinical training arrangements that will help maintain the quality and safety of the future health workforce, and policy and planning directions to support the Australian health workforce. The Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009 establishes a national health workforce authority, which is part of the $1.6 billion health workforce reform package agreed to by COAG in November 2008. The package forms part of the National Partnership Agreement on Hospital and Health Workforce Reform signed by the Prime Minister and all states and territories in March 2009. The Commonwealth is contributing $1.1 billion to the health workforce reform package, with states and territories providing $539.2 million. The national health workforce authority will implement the majority of initiatives under the COAG package. MAIN COMMITTEE",140,Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009
235,Mr Bidgood (Dawson) (6.08 Pm),"I commend the Health Workforce Australia BillThe authority, to be known as Health Workforce Australia, will establish more effective, streamlined and integrated clinical training arrangements and support workforce planning and policy. Its responsibilities will include comprehensively planning, coordinating and funding undergraduate clinical training across all health disciplines. On this point I would like to bring to the chamber’s notice that the Anna Bligh state government has made a very good decision in its creative accounting to sell off the Mackay, Cairns and Mount Isa airports and to invest in new hospitals. That is good news for the people of Dawson. Particularly, a new Mackay Base Hospital will be built alongside the old Mackay Base Hospital. Because of population expansion, there is a greater need for healthcare services. There will be $405 million provided by the state government. It is good that the federal government can come in and help facilitate clinical training and turn it into a training hospital for future nurses and doctors. That is something on which we are working across different boundaries. The federal government is working with the state government-and I recognise the effectiveness of local government in providing roads and bridges around the area-to the great benefit of the local community. HWA will ensure this training occurs in the most streamlined, integrated and educationally effective manner, with appropriate support for coordination and supervision at the regional, local and health service levels. This will include new structural arrangements that attach clinical training funding to students in a range of service settings and support for clinical supervision administered through the HWA. The HWA will lead and support health workforce research, planning and policy development to inform policy decisions on workforce supply, demand, distribution, utilisation and design issues. This will include continually improving national health workforce information and the establishment of a national workforce statistical resource. Also, it will provide a coordinated approach to both the use and financing of simulation training, including the establishment and operation of simulated learning environments. Also, we will be taking a national approach to workforce policy and providing advice to health ministers on relevant workforce issues. HWA will be legally and financially separate from the Commonwealth. It will be established under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, the CAC Act, thereby providing governance arrangements that reflect the shared funding and policy interests of all jurisdictions. The bill is required to establish HWA as a statutory authority under the CAC Act and to specify the functions, governance and structure of HWA, including the interaction with ministers and ministerial committees. HWA will be governed by a board comprising a nominee from each jurisdiction represented on the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council and a chair, and may include up to three independent members selected by health ministers. The board’s responsibilities will include advising and reporting to health ministers and developing policies and operational plans as required. A chief executive officer will be responsible for the day-to-day administration of HWA and will report to the board. Expert committees and consultants will be engaged to assist with HWA functions as required. In November 2008 COAG agreed to spend $1.6 billion on the health workforce package. The Commonwealth is contributing $1.1 billion to the COAG package, with the states and territories providing the extra $539.2 million. The COAG package forms part of the National Partnership Agreement on Hospital and Health Workforce Reform signed by all states and MAIN COMMITTEE territories in March 2009. The package gives the Commonwealth greater involvement in the health workforce, which is traditionally an area managed by the states and territories. The package includes establishing a national health workforce authority to produce more effective, streamlined and integrated clinical training arrangements and to support workforce planning and policy development. The authority will implement the majority of initiatives under the COAG package, including: funding, planning and coordinating pre-professional entry clinical training across all health disciplines; supporting clinical training supervision; supporting health workforce research and planning, including through a national workforce and planning statistical database; funding stimulation, as I have said; having a national approach to workforce planning; and providing the secretariat and research support to an independent advisory council for the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme. The authority will also ensure best value for money for the workforce initiatives and more rapid and substantive planning for future workforce needs and will provide advice to health ministers on relevant workforce issues. The Commonwealth will fund the establishment and operation of the authority at $125 million over four years. The authority will administer around $1.2 billion in Commonwealth, state and territory funding for the workforce initiatives. Health ministers have agreed to the authority being called Health Workforce Australia. Health ministers also agreed to HWA being established under the CAC Act, thereby providing governance arrangements that reflect the shared funding and policy interests of all jurisdictions. As I said, the bill is required to establish HWA as a statutory authority under the CAC Act and to specify the functions, governance and structure of HWA. Given the functions and level of funding for which HWA will be responsible, it is essential that there is a legislative basis for its operations. The bill will also enable mechanisms for health ministers to provide directions to the HWA and for HWA to report to health ministers. HWA is to commence management of the pre-professional entry clinical training from January 2010. The bill is required to establish HWA by July 2009 to ensure it is operational within the time frame agreed to in the COAG health workforce reform package. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly endorse and recommend this bill to the House. Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (6.19 pm)-I am very pleased to rise to support the Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009, because there is no service in our community that is more important than health services. Hospitals play a central role in that, but health goes much further than this. In fact, primary health care also offers some very important services to the local community, including GPs, dentists, nurses and allied health professionals. I think we need to acknowledge that a healthy society requires a whole-of-government approach, whatever level of government it is. In my previous job as a psychologist, one thing that I was able to see first hand was that there is no better resource for our health services than the people who work in them; the people who work every day, and often nights, to keep the rest of us healthy, happy and safe. That is why this bill is particularly important. Australia has a very good health system. There are a lot of areas in which we lead the world. The people within this system need to be congratulated and acknowledged. We have top-quality people in our clinics, hospitals and community medical centres. These people, whether they are doctors, nurses, midwives, allied health professionals, paramedics or researchers, are truly the backbone of our health system. Yet, when you read the Productivity MAIN COMMITTEE Commission’s report on Australia’s health workforce, it becomes apparent that there is a shortage of trained personnel in this area: Australia is experiencing workforce shortages across a number of health professions despite a significant and growing reliance on overseas trained health workers. The shortages are even more acute in rural and remote areas and in certain special needs sectors. With developing technology, growing community expectations and population ageing, the demand for health workforce services will increase while the labour market will tighten. New models of care will also be required. Expenditure on health care is already 9.7 per cent of GDP and is increasing. Even so, there will be a need to train more health workers. There will also be benefits in improving the retention and reentry to the workforce of qualified health workers. It is critical to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the available health workforce, and to improve its distribution. To put it bluntly: there is now a chronic labour shortage in general practices, various medical specialties, dentistry, nursing and certain allied health professions. These shortages, combined with the inflexibilities and inefficiencies in our training and service delivery, contribute to poor health outcomes for Australians. Unfortunately, in the past we have not collected any national data about our health workforce, and this makes it even more difficult to plan in response to these shortages. I have to say that, in hindsight, perhaps this was a failing of the previous government. They did not plan for these workforce shortages and, now, when it has become critical, I am very pleased that it is this government that will take up the mantle and try and address this very pressing issue. This problem represents a real challenge for healthcare policy in this country, and I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Health and Ageing for her hard work in meeting this challenge, because it is difficult. After a decade of underinvestment in health, after the ignoring of this issue and after the ideologically driven policy of the previous government, this government really is stepping up to the plate. This bill establishes Health Workforce Australia, a national workforce authority, to produce more effective, streamlined and integrated clinical training arrangements and to support workforce planning and policy development. This authority is part of the National Partnership Agreement on Hospital and Health Workforce Reform, which was signed by all the states and territories at COAG. This agreement represents COAG at its best, with the Commonwealth and states working together to achieve real reform and direction for our health system. Because of this arrangement, there will be $1.6 billion in a health workforce package, with $1.1 billion coming from the Commonwealth government. Due to this significant investment, the Commonwealth will become more involved in supporting the health workforce, which has traditionally been an area of state responsibility. The form of that involvement is represented in this bill. Health Workforce Australia will take over from the National Health Workforce Taskforce and assume the responsibility of its work program, encompassing workforce planning and research, education and training, and innovation and reform. This new agency will have a significant mandate and will oversee the improvement of capacity and productivity of the health sector in the provision of education and training places for the health workforce. The authority will also review the system’s funding and payment mechanisms, review the roles of different professionals within the workforce and provide the MAIN COMMITTEE opportunity to develop strategies to create incentives for productivity and performance in our healthcare system. Health Workforce Australia will play a pivotal role in the creation of future health policy in this country and in ensuring that Australians are able to continue to enjoy the world’s best health system. The authority will ensure that our health dollars are spent on the best possible workforce initiatives and that our health workforce is trained, recruited and provided in a way that addresses the health needs of the community. The authority will also provide a valuable font of advice to health ministers both state and federal on relevant workforce issues. It is expected that this function will often be performed by the board of Health Workforce Australia, which I will talk about soon. The bill also enables health ministers to provide directions to Health Workforce Australia and for Health Workforce Australia to report to health ministers. The bill establishes Health Workforce Australia under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act and also specifies its governance and structure. It is necessary that this authority and its structure are determined by legislation, because of the importance of its objectives and because of the substantial budget of the programs it will be overseeing. This bill provides for a transparent and accountable governance structure for the authority that will serve HWA well. Health Workforce Australia will be governed by a board comprising a nominee from each jurisdiction represented on the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council. This indicates that the body is a creature of cooperative federalism and is as much an endeavour of the states as it is of the Commonwealth government. Hence there is a strong place for state interests to be heard on the board. The bill will also provide for up to three independent members of the board to be selected by all health ministers-not just the Commonwealth minister-which again reflects the cooperative nature of this proposal. As is normal practice for government authorities, a chief executive officer will be responsible for the day-to-day administration of Health Workforce Australia and will report to the board and to the committees and consultants that will be engaged to assist Health Workforce Australia in its functions as required. As our average population age continues to rise, there can be no better time to get serious about planning our health workforce. Australia needs to respond to the challenge of an ageing population and a shortage of healthcare professionals. I commend the Council of Australian Governments for coming together and making a commitment to address this very important issue. The establishment of Health Workforce Australia and the investment of $1.6 billion in its program show that this government and the governments across the country are serious about tackling this potential crisis in our health system. For Health Workforce Australia to commence management of the pre-professional entry clinical training from January 2010, this bill must pass by July 2009 to ensure that we can get the best outcomes operational in the time frame COAG has agreed to. A comprehensive strategy to address workforce shortage has been welcomed by electors in my electorate of Kingston. Because my seat is in the outer metropolitan suburbs, my constituents often cannot get access to services such as general practitioners, public dentistry and allied health. This is often because there is a workforce shortage. Addressing health workforce shortages will be critical to ensuring that Australians, and indeed the local residents in the southern suburbs of Adelaide, will be able to have access to the health services that they need. Therefore, I commend the bill to the House. MAIN COMMITTEE Australia Bill 2009. If Australia were to be federated today, I am sure that we would construct our federation in a different manner to that which we constructed it in at the end of the 19th century. The situation is that the Commonwealth government’s powers have been expanded through a number of different mechanisms over the years. We have seen referenda put to the Australian public, most of which have been voted down. We have seen High Court of Australia decisions interpreting section 51 of the Australian Constitution, which enumerates the Commonwealth government’s powers, and we have seen a more expansive approach-two steps forward, one step back-with respect to the Commonwealth government’s powers as a result of the High Court’s decisions in relation to constitutional matters. I think the Australian public expects us as a government, and expects governments of all persuasions, to take a more national approach to health. But the way in which the Australian federation has changed the most, I think, has been in the cooperative federalist approach undertaken by COAG agreements. That is when state, local and federal governments get together to agree on outcomes, which results in legislative and funding arrangements which change. We have seen magnificent reforms as a result of this sort of approach-for example, in the area of corporations law, defamation law and family law and also in the area of health. I really support this bill, because I think it is extremely important for my local community. I represent the seat of Blair, which is based in Ipswich and the rural areas outside the Fassifern Valley and the Lockyer Valley. In my area some years ago the Ipswich and West Moreton Division of General Practice, under the then CEO, Kevin Pittman, undertook a study in relation to the health needs of the local community. It found that health needs were great. Obesity was a challenge, diabetes was a challenge and heart disease was also a challenge. It also found that our workforce of doctors and nurses was ageing. About a third of the GPs in my local area will retire in the next five to 10 years. It found that there was one GP for every 1,609 people living in the Ipswich and West Moreton area. That is a particular challenge. We have addressed this issue of the shortages of doctors and nurses at a national level. This issue was created, I might add, by the deliberate and intentional policies of the Howard coalition government. We have addressed this with 457 visas. One of the biggest users of 457 visas, if not the biggest user, has been the New South Wales health commission. It has used the visas to get more doctors and nurses to work in New South Wales. In Queensland we also have many fine doctors coming from overseas, but we simply have not trained enough doctors and nurses and other allied health professionals. Certainly, not enough paramedics and researchers have been engaged. These people do not just form the backbone of our system; they actually form the blood, the tissue and the muscle that allow us to do what we need to do. So we need to support the health workforce not just in education but in financial support to induce people to work in these areas and to work in rural and regional Australia as well. We also need to support them to achieve the necessary outcomes in job satisfaction, familial satisfaction and also vocational development. We need to have the research and the information available to us which will enable us to work out where we need to place our doctors and nurses. It sounds like indicative planning, but it is important for us to do it, because the forces of the market have not always worked successfully, as we have seen. MAIN COMMITTEE",146,Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009
236,Mr Neumann (Blair) (6.29 Pm),"I rise to speak in support of the Health WorkforceWe need to really look at planning and research and development, and we need a cooperative approach. That is why I am very pleased that we have talked about $1.6 billion for the health workforce reform package. That was achieved by COAG in November 2008. I commend the Minister for Health and Ageing and all the various state ministers for what they have done. Coordinating planning, funding undergraduate clinical training places, supporting our health workforce and supporting research, planning and policy development are just crucial. It is amazing that the Howard government failed in this regard. The Institute of Health and Welfare in October 2008 came up with a study which the previous Minister for Health and Ageing, the member for Warringah, had to admit was correct-the Howard coalition government had failed to invest in health and hospital infrastructure and funding and the muchvilified states had taken up the slack. The states, which at that stage mainly had Labor governments, had increased their funding at the same time as the Howard government had underinvested in this area. This area is vital. People on low incomes or from low socioeconomic backgrounds simply need to have access to a good public hospital and a GP clinic where they can be treated. That is the front line of our health system. They need that, and the shortages are particularly acute in rural and regional communities around the country, particularly in the state of Queensland, where the pattern of settlement is very different from that in any other state. Workforce shortages and inflexibilities have aggravated that and mean that people in rural and regional Australia have not got access to the kinds of health care they deserve or expect-in a First World country. So this sort of funding and this sort of authority, where we can take a national approach governed by a board comprised of a nominee from each jurisdiction so no-one misses out and everyone has a place at the table, is simply a sensible way to go about a national approach to health funding, research and development. A national partnership agreement is a sensible way to ensure that we invest properly and appropriately and take into consideration not just the demography but the regional development of the country. Many speakers have gone through in detail the background, the functionality, the coordination and the membership of Health Workforce Australia. I want to concentrate on a more local aspect and make a more Queensland based response. In my electorate we have about 15,000 people who are over 65 years of age. In terms of the pension payments, we received in the first economic stimulus package a lot of money-about 44,000 people actually received either the $1,400 single rate or the $2,100 couple rate. In the budget we saw 23,505 people receive the increase in the pension. There are people with a veteran background. I have many veterans in my community because we have the RAAF base at Amberley. They like to come and settle here. We have nearly 8,000 people on disability support type pensions in my electorate. For these types of people, their GP and their public hospital are vital. The Rudd government have made a major investment in our public health system-$64 billion over five years, an increase of $20 billion and nearly 50 per cent over the previous Australian Healthcare Agreement. That is an enormous increase in health expenditure, and it is a Labor government that is doing it. Labor governments, when it comes to things like education and health, are the ones that really matter to the Australian public. We are the ones who invest for the benefit of this country. We are delivering vital reforms at a time of great economic crisis-investment in public hospitals, health infrastructure, our workforce, maternity and midwifery services and health services in rural and regional Australia. We are upgrading our hosMAIN COMMITTEE pitals. We are training more doctors-a 35 per cent increase in GP training places. It is to the absolute shame of those opposite that they actually froze the number of training places. We need more highly skilled GPs and nurse practitioners to tackle the workforce shortages left as a legacy of the previous government. That is the tragedy-they simply failed to invest. Investing also in medical and health research is simply vital. This government will invest $430.3 million to upgrade and build health and medical research and training facilities across this country. There is $596 million to expand cancer research facilities drawn from the Health and Hospitals Fund, including $14 million for a smart therapies institute in Brisbane-a collaboration between the University of Queensland, Mater Medical Research Institute, Princess Alexandra Hospital, the Queensland University of Technology and the Queensland government. That is simply vital for my constituents, many of whom travel to Brisbane for cancer treatment. That is simply the case. We are investing $1.5 billion to upgrade key hospital infrastructure across the country. For my constituents, many of whom have really challenging problems in terms of oral health, the $104 million for the oral health centre in Brisbane, which will treat 17,000 patients a year, is simply crucial. Investing in our health and hospital system is important for its lifeblood. It is our responsibility. It was the responsibility of the previous government and it is a tragedy that they did not take it up. The situation is that we will care for our people. We will provide options for women as well. One of the things that I am so happy about is what we have done in terms of maternity care, the access to Medicare and the PBS for midwives. The budget includes a $120.5 million package for measures to include choice for women and access to maternity services for pregnant women and new mothers in Australia. I have met with the local group involved in advocacy in this area, and I commend them for their work. Cas McCullough, the National President of the Maternity Coalition, lives locally in my area. I have spoken with her, and she is a great contributor to the Natural Parenting magazine. The midwifery association of Queensland has been strong in its advocacy for these types of reforms. I think this is a commendable reform, and I think it gives women birthing experiences and options which they did not have before. Surgical interventions are not always in the best interests of women, and it is not always what they want. Often they want qualified midwives with sensitivity, understanding and tenderness, someone with whom they have developed a relationship over a long period of time, to assist them in this wonderful experience for them. Women deserve to be empowered, and this reform of the Rudd Labor government is a terrific reform. The local expression of that in my electorate, of course, is the University of Queensland Ipswich campus, where you can choose to study nursing or midwifery. Ipswich campus has become well known as a campus of excellence where people come to learn how to become not just nurses and midwives but doctors also. We have taken in our first cohort this year, the first graduates from the Bachelor of Health Science. What we are going to see are doctors trained through the University of Queensland Ipswich campus. I think that is important. I have spoken to Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor Alan Rix about this, congratulated him and commended him on the work that they have done in this regard for Ipswich. I want people to actually study in Ipswich, live there and practise there. For nearly a decade I served on the Health Community Council, as an employee of the Queensland government. One of the challenges we had was getting doctors to come to IpsMAIN COMMITTEE wich General Hospital and practise locally. We did that in rural areas as well. We gave them a right of practice in places like Boonah, Laidley and Esk in the electorate of the member for Dickson. We did that. But it was difficult getting them into those rural communities. So getting them locally trained means they are more likely to live there. They study there, they live there, they make friends and they get involved in the life of the community, and that is tremendously important for my constituency. Ipswich campus also has become known as a centre of excellence with respect to research and innovation. There are a number of important things that have developed there as a result of the initiative of the Queensland state Labor government but also as a result of the Australian Cancer Council funding, and with the support of the Ipswich Hospital Foundation. What has been established in Ipswich, at the University of Queensland, is a Healthy Communities Research Centre. That has been involved in important social research undertaken with respect to the Ipswich study. It is undertaken by the University of Queensland Boilerhouse Community Engagement Centre. Allied with this, we saw the Queensland government undertake a great initiative last year. That was the establishment of the Centre of Excellence for Behaviour Support. What will happen there will be a great deal of study, innovation and research undertaken in the local area to establish what is needed for people with disability. How can we help them? What can we do to improve the health and cardiorespiratory medicine needs of the local area? What about whiplash nursing? What about people who have come from backgrounds where they were institutionalised, in, say, the Challinor Centre in Ipswich, and are now living in the community? What are their challenges? What are their needs? What are their health needs? These two research centres in my local constituency will make a big difference. That is the sort of planning and research we are talking about under this legislation. The Rudd government is committed to it. If you do not think it is accepted well by the universities, just have a look at what Professor Peter Coaldrake, the new Chair of Universities Australia, said just today, commenting about the implication of the federal budget provisions for higher education. He is the ViceChancellor of the Queensland University of Technology. He said: Vice-chancellorsthat is, the vice-chancellors of the various universities in Australiaexamined two recent studies by Access Economics and KPMG that identified education as a lead industry providing immediate economic stimulus, long-term gains in skills and productivity and contributing significantly to GDP. Professor Coaldrake commended the government for the substantial capital infrastructure funding available as part of the budget for studies and research facilities. These are the kinds of research facilities that I am talking about in my electorate, on the University of Queensland Ipswich campus, which you can imagine Health Workforce Australia will be really interested in. They will be really interested in the kind of information that comes out as a result of the research that develops there. So it is not important just in terms of the budgetary stimulation for jobs, economic development, productivity and skilling. We are really talking about caring for our community when it comes to disability and health needs as well. This bill seems as though it is about the creation of a statutory authority and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, but I can imagine that Health Workforce AustraMAIN COMMITTEE lia will be particularly interested in what the University of Queensland Ipswich campus is doing, because the studies that come from that institution will go a long way towards establishing the real needs of people not just in Ipswich, not just in Queensland, but in Australia and internationally. A coordinated approach to this type of thing is simply vital for our community. It is vital to establish what our needs are locally, state-wide and nationally. This is one of those bills that I am warmly supporting, and I commend it to the chamber. Ms McKEW (Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare) (6.47 pm)-I would like to thank all members who have participated in this debate on the Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009. I thank the member for Blair in particular, who brought together all the important strands that this bill is seeking to achieve. I am very pleased today to have the opportunity to sum up the debate on the bill on behalf of the Minister for Health and Ageing, who has been called away to an urgent teleconference with her state and territory colleagues about the swine influenza situation. As has been acknowledged during the debate, there are existing workforce shortages and factors such as population ageing and increasing levels of chronic disease that will exacerbate pressures on Australia’s health system and its workforce in the near future. I note the contribution of the member for Dickson, who seems to have some concern about the need for and the role of this health workforce agency. What the community is concerned about, I would say, is the lack of planning by the former government for the needs of the health workforce. This has left many communities around the country with shortages of doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. We know that improvements to clinical training arrangements are needed, along with strategies for maximising productivity and improving the efficiency, effectiveness and responsiveness of the health workforce to ensure that the health needs of Australia can be met into the future. The $1.6 billion health workforce package of the Council of Australian Governments-the single largest investment in the health workforce ever made by Australian governments-was developed in recognition of these issues. A linchpin of the COAG package is the development of Health Workforce Australia, HWA, a national health workforce authority that will work with and across jurisdictions and the education and health sectors to produce more effective, streamlined and integrated clinical training arrangements and to support workforce planning and policy development. Among other critically important functions, HWA will fund, plan and coordinate preprofessional entry clinical training across the major health disciplines from 2010. It is not intended that this agency usurp the functions of accreditation agencies or universities in relation to clinical training accreditation. These bodies will remain responsible for accreditation, although it is important to note that the clinical training subsidy is likely to assist training organisations with the quality of their placements. The agency will finally allow for proper workforce planning so that we can fix the longer term issues on the health workforce right across Australian governments. The governance arrangements for HWA reflect the shared funding and policy interests of all jurisdictions and provide for directions from and reporting to Australia’s health ministers. Passage of the bill is required to establish HWA and to ensure that it is operational within the time frames agreed to in the COAG health workforce agreement. Essentially, passage of MAIN COMMITTEE the bill will instigate the immediate activities needed to improve the health workforce and therefore the health system for the Australian population. I would like to thank once again all those who directly or indirectly have been involved in the development of this package and this important legislation. I have been delighted by the strong support of all governments and the health and education sectors, all of whom have recognised the significance of this package and the need to get on with the job of improving Australia’s health workforce. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Consideration resumed from 12 May. Second Reading Ms McKEW (Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare) (6.51 pm)-I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 in a number of ways. Firstly, it incorporates into the act provisions allowing the stockpiling and supply of medical devices to deal with emergency situations without the requirement for such devices to comply with the act. Second, it gives effect to a range of amendments which have been in contemplation for a number of years, and which were to have been adopted as part of the proposed Australia New Zealand Therapeutic Products Authority, or ANZTPA. Turning first to the medical devices amendments, these provisions are based on similar provisions allowing medicines to be stockpiled and supplied in emergency situations which were added to the act in 2002. It is unfortunate that other amendments made to the act that same year to deal with medical devices did not include an emergency provision from the outset. But be that as it may, the government is now acting to include these provisions so that medical devices can lawfully be stockpiled in case of a future emergency and made available in an actual emergency without having to comply with the act. In 2002 the then parliamentary secretary, in introducing the bill, explained that the amendments were necessary to strengthen the ability of the Commonwealth to plan for, and respond to, national emergencies in which there is the potential for large numbers of people to require emergency treatment. She gave as examples of such emergencies acts of bioterrorism or the emergence of a new, highly contagious disease in Australia. Exactly the same rationale applies today. The act presently operates very effectively to ensure that medical devices supplied in Australia to meet our daily health care needs meet very high standards of manufacture and quality MAIN COMMITTEE control. In general, it is an offence to supply devices that have not been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (the TGA). But in an emergency the government may need to be able to supply very large volumes of devices such as face masks or injection kits. It may need to source these volumes from manufacturers who do not regularly supply goods to the Australian market, and who have not sought to have their products approved by the TGA. The amendments in schedule 1 to this bill allow the minister to exempt devices from the requirements of the act so that they can lawfully be stockpiled and made available in an emergency. The minister can only make such an exemption if she or he is satisfied that it is in the national interest to do so, and the minister’s powers may only be delegated to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing. The minister may impose conditions on the exemption, including limiting the people allowed to import, manufacture or supply the devices, and must notify those people of any other conditions on the exemption. Breaching a condition of exemption is a criminal offence. The bill does not provide for parliamentary scrutiny of the exemption through disallowance. This is because a security consultant engaged by the government last year recommended that the contents of the stockpile should be classified as ‘confidential’ to ensure that would be bioterrorists were not able to find out what preparations Australia had made for dealing with a possible bioterrorist act. For this reason the bill also amends the act so that similar exemptions applying to medicines are not to be subject to disallowance. Turning to the deferred ANZTPA amendments, the bill deals with the ‘fit and proper person’ test, default standards for medicines, information disclosure, and the use of restricted representations in advertising. It also makes technical amendments to all offence provisions to bring them into line with the latest policy on how these should be expressed. The act currently requires the secretary, in deciding whether to grant or revoke a manufacturing licence or a conformity assessment certificate for a medical device, to have regard to whether the applicant, a person taking part in managing the applicant’s affairs, or a person ‘likely to have effective control over the applicant’, is a fit and proper person. The test in deciding such a person is at once subjective-in that there is no limit on the matters the secretary may consider, and there is no guidance on who is a person ‘likely to have effective control’-and unduly harsh in that the secretary must have regard to any conviction against any law of the Commonwealth or a state or territory, no matter what the crime or when it took place. Not only has the test been criticised by industry for these reasons, but it is also administratively problematic. The amendments in schedule 3 of the bill replace this test with a much narrower test, requiring the secretary to have regard to breaches of the act or offences against it, together with offences involving fraud or dishonesty over the previous 10 years. The amendments also replace the undefined concept of ‘effective control’ with an objective definition of a ‘major interest holder’, defined as a one-fifth shareholder of a body corporate. MAIN COMMITTEE When the act was introduced it provided that unless the minister determined standards for therapeutic goods, they had to comply with the requirements of the British Pharmacopoeia. The British Pharmacopoeia thus effectively served as the default standard for therapeutic goods. Since the act came into effect many manufacturers based in the United States or Europe have entered the Australian market. As part of the ANZFTA consultation process industry pressed for the inclusion of the US Pharmacopoeia and the European Pharmacopoeia as alternative default standards. Schedule4 of the bill contains a series of amendments to include these pharmacopoeias as default standards with the same standing as the British Pharmacopoeia. The amendments also remove references to the veterinary version of the British Pharmacopoeia, as the act no longer regulates veterinary medicines, and makes a number of consequential amendments to remove other references to the regulation of therapeutic goods for use in animals. The act sets out when the secretary can release information obtained under the act to other regulatory agencies or to the public. These provisions are unduly restrictive as they relate to the public release of information, and they have proved operationally difficult as they relate to providing information to other agencies. The government has decided to broaden the public access to information under the act. In particular, the TGA will publish a greater range of information about goods included on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods on its website to inform members of the public about the therapeutic goods and devices that are available in Australia, and assist them to make better informed choices and decisions about their use of therapeutic goods. It will publish the minutes and deliberations of expert advisory committees, as well as a greater range of information considered in, and the reasons for, making particular decisions, including summaries of the evaluation of applications for the entry of prescription medicines on the register. The amendments in schedule 5 will support this by allowing the minister to determine, by legislative instrument, classes of therapeutic goods information which may be published by the secretary. The amendments also widen the definition of information that may be released to include information held by the TGA, as well as information acquired by the TGA under the act. Other amendments in the schedule resolve the practical difficulties with the provisions relating to the release of information to other government authorities. The act currently regulates advertising of therapeutic goods. It includes a regime provided for the pre-approval of some categories of advertisements, together with limits and restrictions on the kinds of representations that may be made in advertisements. For example, advertisements to the public cannot refer to serious illnesses, or make claims that a cure is infallible. While the limits and restrictions are intended to apply to all advertisements, the current structure of the act implies that they only apply to advertisements that do not require preapproval. MAIN COMMITTEE The amendments in schedule 6 are intended to clarify that the limits and restrictions apply to all advertisements. Finally, schedule 7 contains a series of purely technical amendments to align all criminal offence provisions in the act with current policy on the expression of such provisions. The changes made by this bill do not encompass all the reforms the government intends to make to the therapeutic goods regulatory regime. We intend to introduce further legislation next year to give effect to other changes that were foreshadowed as part of the ANZTPA process, including new frameworks for the regulation of human cellular and tissue based therapies and homeopathic medicines. We will also be pursuing changes to the current advertising arrangements. The Productivity Commission has recommended that the government should streamline and clarify the advertising regime for therapeutic goods. At this stage, government intends to carry out informal consultations with industry over the next few months before releasing a formal consultation document for consideration next year. The amendments in this bill are thus the first instalment in an ongoing program of reform to the act. Australia has been well served by the TGA in the past, and it is important that the regulatory regime the TGA implements is kept up to date so that the TGA and the industry that it regulates can operate as efficiently as possible, and so that Australian consumers can continue to have timely access to safe and effective therapeutic goods. I commend this bill to the House. vices and Other Measures) Bill 2008 provides for a number of amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act and in part implements some of the reforms proposed originally for the establishment of the Australia-New Zealand therapeutic products authority. The process to establish the Australia-New Zealand therapeutic products authority commenced with the signing of a memorandum of understanding between Australia and New Zealand in December 2003. However, the process stalled in July 2007 under the pressure of domestic political conditions in New Zealand at that time. As my colleagues have noted in the Senate, with a different political landscape in New Zealand today there is an opportunity now for the government to continue with the trans-Tasman reform process initiated by the coalition government. This bill will amend the operations of the Therapeutic Goods Administration. The TGA has an important role in regulating therapeutic goods, such as medicines and medical devices, according to quality, safety and efficacy. However, it is important that any regulation is also efficient and efficacious. This is particularly the case for the TGA, which operates on a cost recovery basis for the listing of relevant products on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. It is imperative that under any cost recovery process compliance requirements and costs do not jeopardise the listing of potentially beneficial products for the Australian community. Specifically, the proposed changes in the bill provide for the exemption of medical devices under the act to allow for stockpiling and timely supply in emergency situations, the removal of the requirement that instruments allowing stockpiling of therapeutic goods be disallowable, a narrower ‘fit and proper’ test in the granting of manufacturing licences and conformity asMAIN COMMITTEE",151,Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009
237,Mr Dutton (Dickson) (7.01 Pm),"The Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Medical Desessment certificates, inclusion of the United States and European Pharmacopoeia as default standards for therapeutic goods in addition to the existing British Pharmacopoeia default, improved information disclosure by the TGA and the clarification of regulation applying to advertising. The coalition broadly supports the amendments contained within the bill, as does industry, according to available stakeholder feedback. The inclusion of the United States and European Pharmacopoeia in addition to the existing British default for therapeutic goods standards is a common sense reform, providing a degree of flexibility for organisations bringing beneficial products to market in Australia. The reforms to the fit and proper test provide workability to what is currently too broad a test. The amendments provide practical and measurable guidance as to persons who did not meet the requirements of a fit and proper person. The provisions to improve access to information held by the TGA is important in the interests of transparency, and this will provide interested stakeholders with relevant information pertaining to the details on that Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods: summaries of evaluations of applications to register new therapeutic goods and the records of the advisory committees established under the act. Advertising provisions in this bill clarify the existing regulations regarding advertising of therapeutic goods. It is appropriate that current regulations requiring pre-approval of advertisements in mainstream media be extended to other media. These amendments are straightforward reforms designed to enhance the operation of the TGA and are largely uncontentious. However, I bring attention to the concerns outlined by my colleagues in the Senate regarding the amendments to the current exemption provisions. These amendments remove the requirement that instruments allowing the stockpiling of therapeutic goods be disallowable. The provision is said to be based on advice that the contents of the stockpile should have a classification of confidential in the interests of national security and therefore should not be tabled in the parliament and not be subject to public scrutiny. Whilst the coalition considers national security of paramount importance, I do bring attention to the caution by which such exemptions to parliamentary scrutiny of ministerial decisions should be made. Nevertheless, notwithstanding these concerns, the coalition is satisfied that this bill will enhance the operations of the TGA as a fundamental institution in our healthcare system. WhilstI am on this debate in relation to our healthcare system, I want to again return to the very important issue surrounding a patient in New South Wales by the name of Pauline Talty. I want to bring to the House’s attention today the situation of this courageous young woman, Pauline Talty. As we have spoken about in the press before and also in this House, Pauline needs a lifesaving bowel transplant operation. Seven months ago-and I repeat, seven months ago-Pauline sought funding under the Medical Treatment Overseas Program to travel to Pittsburgh for this transplant. At the time, her doctors warned that she may only have around 12 months to live. Through the very long and agonising months since, she has had to repeatedly argue her case to the federal health department, which twice denied her treatment under MTOP, dismissing the advice of numerous health experts. On 13 May-two weeks ago tomorrow-the decision was reversed. Her battle with bureaucracy ended, or so she thought. The secretary of the health department wrote to Pauline to inform her that her lifesaving surgery overseas had been approved. On that afternoon, I stood in the House and praised the government for this change of heart. I had committed to do that. It was a very long, public MAIN COMMITTEE campaign but, nonetheless, the government in the end changed the decision and I said at the time that if they did that I would praise them, and I did. This is very important, Madam Deputy Speaker. the fact that whilst I am happy to give a lot of leeway, as we do in this place, you have strayed a long way from the bill, so please finish that remark. the government for their accommodation made to Pauline’s treatment. Two weeks might not seem a long time to any of us but consider someone in Pauline’s position; two weeks is a long time. She still feels that the red tape is trapping her and that she is being asked to be the middle person between the federal department and the hospital in Pittsburgh, from her hospital bed in Sydney. It is not good enough. now, please. in this particular case, because it is unacceptable that the bureaucratic process is still bogging down this particular issue. This government has this bill, which is an important bill, before the House tonight, and the government has the support of the coalition in relation to this bill. We have a health system in this country which is in crisis. The point that I make, by way of example through Pauline’s case, in relation to this very important debate, is that this government gave a commitment to this dying young woman that they would cut the bureaucratic process, but they have not. So the call, again, for this government is to make sure that they put aside the bureaucratic nonsense and provide a better outcome for Pauline Talty. the bill, and if the honourable member has forgotten the title I will help him. It is the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Medical Devices and Other Measures) Bill 2008. Thank you. that has taken place in relation to Pauline Talty. I have made my point in relation to Pauline Taltyernment does not act promptly so that this debate can be had and this woman can get on with her life. That is the call we make to the government tonight. In relation to the bill, there are some areas of concern. Those areas have been flagged in the Senate, and we have made the government aware of them tonight. In terms of the general thrust of this bill and the way in which it has been presented by the government, the coalition support the bill. As the alternative government of this country, we will continue to hold this government to account to make sure we have better patient outcomes in this country and to make sure that the government does not continue to put extra pressure on the public hospital system, which is already at-and in some cases beyond-breaking point. We renew that commitment to the Australian people tonight. Amendment (Medical Devices and Other Measures) Bill 2008.

246,Mr Bidgood (Dawson) (7.11 Pm),"I rise to speak in favour of the Therapeutic Goodsmedical centres that service the healthcare needs of 40,000 people in the electorate of Dawson, I welcome this bill. I have seen first hand the benefit of medical science working hand-inhand with complementary medicines and alternative therapies-‘complementary’ being the key word. This bill provides for medicines to be approved if they meet specific criteria, or disapproved if they do not. I welcome this because I often come across previous patients, and also people who come in for consultations at my office, who ask for amendments such as this. I know that this bill will be welcomed by many people, particularly in my electorate, who I have seen benefit from different types of therapeutic goods. Schedule1 of the bill provides for medicines to be suspended from the register-and, as we know, medical devices can already be suspended. Schedule2 requires manufacturing licences to cover single manufacturing sites, except in limited circumstances provided for in guidelines, and enables variations to licences and transfer of licences between licence holders. Schedule3 enhances monitoring powers to enable samples to be taken of any therapeutic good or any thing related to a therapeutic good on premises and to enable video and other recordings to be taken in addition to still photographs and sketches. Schedule4 establishes a framework for the regulation of homoeopathic and anthroposophic medicines to commence in July 2011 with supporting regulations to be made to commence at that time. I am particularly interested in schedule 4. Currently, many of these homoeopathic and anthroposophic medicines are exempt from the requirement under the act that they be included in the register and meet manufacturing requirements. The bill now provides a framework for the regulation of these medicines and, in doing so, implements the 2003 recommendation by the Expert Committee on Complementary Medicines in the Health System that these products be regulated. This means that we will have conditions that recognise what truly does work, and we will avoid snake oil type therapeutic goods which clearly do not work. This enables these determinations to be made. Schedule5 of the bill enables the minister to determine lists of permitted and prohibited ingredients for inclusion in listed medicines. Schedule6 makes minor technical amendments to references to orders published in the Gazette and to disallowable instruments to reflect that they are legislative instruments for the purposes of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. Finally, schedule 6 makes other amendments to improve and clarify the operation of the act, including simplifying arrangements for setting conditions on medicines and confirming that decisions of the secretary may be made by a computer program. The act presently enables medical devices to be suspended from the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, known as the register, when there are safety concerns with those goods. However, there are presently no similar provisions for medicines; therefore, if there are safety concerns with a medicine, the only option available to the secretary is to cancel its registration or listing. After addressing the reason for the cancellation, the sponsor must then reapply and pay the related application and assessment fees to re-register or relist the medicine. This is costly and inefficient. This bill provides that medicines can be suspended instead, when there are safety concerns that may be addressed within the period of the suspension. The bill provides that manufacturing licences are to cover one site per licence, except in limited circumstances to be identified in guidelines, such as when two sites are adjacent to one another and jointly manufacture the same therapeutic good. Licence holders will also be able to apply to vary their licence, and the regulations will set out arrangements to enable the MAIN COMMITTEE transfer of licences. Presently, many homeopathic and anthroposophic medicines are exempt from requirements under the act to be listed or to comply with quality manufacturing requirements. The bill implements a recommendation from 2003 of the expert committee on complementary medicine to regulate these products in the health system. The amendments will commence in July 2011 to provide time for further consultation with the industry sector to inform supporting regulations. The regulations currently provide for permitted ingredients in listed medicines; however, the arrangements for amending this list and seeking to include new ingredients are not as clear as they might be. This bill clarifies this by empowering the minister to determine the list by legislative instrument, setting out permitted and prohibited ingredients and amounts of ingredients for listed medicines. This bill also implements a number of minor amendments to clarify and improve the operation of the act. These amendments are, firstly, to clarify the arrangements for setting conditions on medicines and empowering the minister to determine standard conditions to apply to categories of medicines, with the secretary continuing to be able to set specific conditions on certain medicines; secondly, to clarify that computer programs are able to be used to make decisions for the secretary, with the secretary retaining the ability to replace those decisions; thirdly, to enable applicants to apply for a previous request to have an application to list or register a medicine that was treated as cancelled revoked so as to enable the application for the medicine to be considered; and, fourthly, to strengthen overseas manufacturing quality requirements for medicines by requiring that, before the manufacture of a medicine can be moved to an overseas manufacturer, certification must be received from the secretary that the manufacturing and quality control procedures for the proposed overseas manufacturer are acceptable. This bill makes a number of minor technical amendments to references to orders and disallowable instruments to reflect that these are legislative instruments for the purpose of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. Finally, further amendments are planned for later in the year to establish a new framework for the regulation of human cellular and tissue based therapy products, biologicals, and new arrangements for the separate scheduling of medicines and poisons to reflect recommendations from the 2001 Galbally review and decisions from the Council of Australian Governments. I wholeheartedly commend this bill to the House. Ms McKEW (Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare) (7.19 pm)-In summing up on behalf of the Minister for Health and Ageing, I would like to thank the members who have contributed to this debate. This bill amends the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 in a number of ways. Firstly, it incorporates into the act provisions allowing the stockpiling and supply of medical devices to deal with emergency situations. These provisions are based on similar provisions allowing medicines to be stockpiled and supplied in emergency situations which were added to the act in 2002. The amendments in schedule 1 to this bill allow the minister to exempt devices from the requirements of the act so that they can lawfully be stockpiled and made available in an emergency. These exemptions are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny. This follows advice, received by the then government in 2007, which recommended that the contents of the stockpile should be classified as confidential to ensure that would be bioterrorists were not able to find out what preparaMAIN COMMITTEE tions Australia had made for dealing with possible bioterrorist acts. For this reason, the bill also amends the act so that similar exemptions applying to medicines are not subject to disallowance. This bill also gives effect to a range of amendments which have been in contemplation for a number of years and which were to have been adopted as part of the proposed Australia New Zealand Therapeutic Products Authority, or ANZTPA. The bill deals with the ‘fit and proper person’ test, default standards for medicines, information disclosure and the use of restricted representations in advertising. It also makes technical amendments to all offence provisions, to bring them into line with the latest policy on how these should be expressed, and these have been canvassed in the second reading speech. So the changes made by this bill do not encompass all of the reforms that the government intends to make to the therapeutic goods regulatory regime. The amendments in this bill are but the first instalment in an ongoing program of reform to the act. Australia has been well served by the TGA in the past, and it is important that the regulatory regime that the authority implements is kept up to date, so that the TGA and the industry it regulates can operate as efficiently as possible and so that Australian consumers can continue to have timely access to safe and effective therapeutic goods. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES No. 3) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 May, on motion by Mr Bowen: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009, I will briefly address each of the four schedules within the bill, but I indicate that the opposition will be supporting this bill. Schedule1 deals with the GDP adjustment factor for the 2009-10 income year. The government had previously announced, and in fact legislated, earlier in the year a reduction of that factor in light of the current economic circumstances. That passed through the parliament, and this schedule merely repeats that exercise for the 2009-10 income year. Under the PAYG instalment system, certain taxpayers calculate their PAYG instalment amounts according to the GDP adjustment factor, which essentially is determined using GDP growth between the last two calendar years-as the explanatory memorandum outlines. If that had been the case this year, it would have meant that the GDP adjustment factor would have been nine per cent for the 2009-10 income year. This bill sets it at two per cent. The coalition has said previously that this is a welcome direction for small business. We had a varied proposal which we think provided more flexibility for all taxpayers in this situation. That was in fact announced by the shadow minister for small business prior to the government coming onto the field in this regard. The shadow minister for small business, the member for Moncrieff, will be following me in this debate, so I will not take the time of the House tonight to reiterate all of that in my contribution. I know he will address all of those issues and a range of issues relating to his shadow portfolio of small business in his own contribution in just a little while.

It allows entities that voluntarily register for GST to align their reporting of PAYG with their GST reporting. As I said, it was a measure announced by the previous coalition government, certainly in its last budget, and it will reduce compliance costs for eligible taxpayers. From my perspective as the shadow Assistant Treasurer, I am glad that the government has decided to legislate to bring this measure into being. It will reduce the compliance burden on entities that voluntarily register for GST by allowing them to report GST and PAYG together on an annual basis. Schedule3 makes very technical amendments to the petroleum resource rent tax regime. Again, this was announced by the previous coalition government in their last budget of 200607. The current government announced in last year’s budget that it would proceed with the measures with an effective date of 1 July 2008. In technical terms, schedule 3 will introduce a functional currency rule into the resource rent tax regime along similar lines to the functional currency rule used for income tax. This will allow entities to use a currency that better reflects the international petroleum market when determining their tax liability. The schedule also amends the petroleum resource rent tax to ensure that all exploration expenditure in an exploration permit area is deductible for petroleum resource rent tax purposes. Currently certain exploration may not be deductible. This amendment will ensure that the correct operational intention applies and the explanatory memorandum details that very well. The schedule also introduces, as I said, a highly technical amendment to provisions relating to petroleum sourced from within a project for refining and also extends the offshore exploration incentive. Schedule 4, which is the schedule we see in many of these tax law amendment bills, amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to update the deductible gift recipient list. In doing so, it includes three new entities which are the Royal Institution of Australia, Diplomacy Training Program Limited and the Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation. Once this bill is passed, each of those will be added to the deductible gift recipient list. The opposition will be supporting this Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009. As I said earlier with respect to some of the small business measures and the coalition’s position, the shadow small business minister, the member for Moncrieff, will be making a contribution a little later. (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009. This bill contains amendments to three areas of tax law. The first amendment concerns PAYG instalments. The bill reduces PAYG instalments for 2009-10 for taxpayers who pay quarterly instalments. It also allows eligible taxpayers who have voluntarily registered for GST and who choose to remit GST annually to make their PAYG instalments annually. Secondly, the bill makes minor amendments to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987 to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers. Thirdly, the bill lists a couple of new organisations as deductible gift recipients. I know that such a listing is always eagerly looked forward to by people who do good work in our community. I will speak firstly to the amendments concerning PAYG instalments, which are the most significant measures in this bill, as discussed by the previous speaker. These changes will deliver direct benefits to small business. Under current arrangements, the GDP adjustment factor calculated under the present income tax law would be around nine per cent. Taxpayers earning business or investment income pay quarterly instalments during the year towards their final tax liability so they do not have an unmanageable tax bill at the end of the year. These instalMAIN COMMITTEE",164,Therapeutic Goods Amendment Medical Devices And Other Measures Bill 2008
248,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (7.29 Pm),"I too rise to address the Tax Laws Amendmentments are calculated based on the GDP adjustment method. It is based on the taxpayer’s taxable income from the previous year adjusted by the GDP factor, which reflects GDP growth over the previous two years. In simple terms, as I understand it, the instalments are based on last year’s taxable income plus expected profit growth. However, these are unusual days and the GDP factor-which, as I said, would be at nine per cent-is an exaggeration of the kind of profit growth that most small businesses can expect at the moment. That might be different, perhaps, for some of those businesses that have thrived over the last three or six months-receivers, perhaps. I note that some of the major supermarket chains have also thrived. Obviously people are eating in. hire stores are also doing very well. People are obviously staying home and cooking their own meals, although I am told-not by the hairdressers that I frequent but by the hairdressers that I talk to in my electorate; I, of course, go to a barber-people are not necessarily scrimping on their hair. People are still prepared to spend their money on looking good, even if they do not have anywhere to go. They are all dressed up with nowhere to go. Apart from those specific niche businesses, most businesses have not been growing at nine per cent. Cash flow is the lifeblood of small businesses, as we on this side of the House well know. The Rudd government does not want businesses paying instalments far above their actual tax liability. In these tough times, it is more important than ever for small businesses to retain cash flow and ensure they can continue to invest in their businesses. That is why this bill will set the GDP adjustment for the 2009-10 year at not nine per cent but two per cent. This amendment will generate around $720 million in cash flow for small businesses. Small businesses in the electorate of Blair, small businesses in the electorate of Moreton and small businesses in the electorate of Port Adelaide will benefit from this government adjustment. Self-funded retirees and other eligible taxpayers will obviously also benefit. Most importantly, this measure will ensure that $720 million is not lying around in the coffers of the tax department but instead continuing to stimulate business investment, which means more jobs for Australia. Obviously, we on this side of the House understand that the current climate is all about jobs, jobs, jobs. This bill also introduces some flexibility regarding PAYG instalments. It amends the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to allow taxpayers who are voluntarily registered for GST and who choose to pay GST annually to also make their PAYG instalments annually. This will eliminate unnecessary compliance costs for taxpayers. These measures build on the Rudd government’s significant efforts to support small business during these tough economic times-times that almost every person in this room tonight has never seen in their lifetime. These are tough economic times. It is funny-we do not feel like we are in a flickering black-and-white newsreel, but I guess in 75 years time people will look back at this time and say this was a significant economic downturn. That is the reality. Obviously, we on this side of the House understand that small business is the backbone of the Australian economy. We have some 1.9 million small businesses, employing almost four million Australians. I think the member for Blair was one of those small business people. I think of the many small businesses in my electorate, which provide employment and stimulate MAIN COMMITTEE",165,Therapeutic Goods Amendment Medical Devices And Other Measures Bill 2008

250,Mr Perrett,"People are liquidating, as is suggested by the member for Blair. Videoeconomic growth. There are successful businesses like MiniMovers, which was set up by Michael O’Hagan; Michael’s Oriental Restaurant at Eight Mile Plains, where I seem to have had every second meal over the last couple of weeks; the Framing Corner at Sunnybank, which does so much work; the Inn Florist at Moorooka, which always looks after me on ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day and on my wedding anniversary, when I remember it; Chaotech, which was set up by Rex Manderson at Rocklea and which produces precision steel machine parts and is also developing a plant to produce soil carbon that will hopefully take advantage of the green vegetation in our environment and plough it back into the farms in the surrounding area; the Sunni Bakery and Sunnybank Plaza News at Sunnybank; 3E at Salisbury, which looks after the printing of my newsletters; the Mu’Ooz African restaurant at the heart of Moorooka in the little strip of Africa; the Sunnybank Oriental Restaurant; the Landmark Restaurant; any of Danny Yo’s many restaurants; and my dentist, Ken Martin, at Graceville. All these small businesses will benefit from the improvements we are bringing in tonight. The Rudd Labor government is doing whatever it can to support businesses such as these. We are increasing and extending the small business and general business tax break. We are lifting the tax break from 30 per cent to 50 per cent and extending it to apply to eligible assets acquired between 13 December 2008 and 31 December 2009. Businesses need to make sure they take advantage of this wonderful opportunity. The 50 per cent rate applies to new tangible assets over $1,000 acquired by small businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million a year. It includes items like computers, electric tools, furniture and motor vehicles, to name but a few. We are also establishing a small business support line to assist small businesses during the global recession. Sometimes a bit of helpful advice might make the difference between a business surviving or getting into difficulties. We are providing $10 million over two years to help small businesses go online and to open up to new markets through e-commerce. We are introducing a new research and development tax credit at 45 per cent for companies with an annual turnover of less than $20 million. I am proud of all these measures because I know that for some small businesses in Moreton it will be the difference between survival and bankruptcy. For some employees it will be the difference between a solid job and unemployment. These are good things to do because they are good for jobs and good for the economy. This bill also makes some minor changes to the petroleum resources rent tax. Among a range of minor amendments the bill allows taxpayers with petroleum projects offshore to calculate their petroleum resource rent tax liability in a foreign currency. This will simplify tax compliance for taxpayers who operate in a foreign currency. Finally, this bill welcomes three new organisations to the list of deductible gift recipients. Taxpayers will be able to claim income tax deductions for gifts to Diplomacy Training Program Ltd, which provides training for staff and representatives of NGOs in the Asia-Pacific region to help promote good governance and human rights. Obviously, it makes good sense to help where we can with our neighbour’s yard because that makes our yard that much safer. Also included is the Royal Institution of Australia Inc., an Adelaide based science research centre. I am sure the member for Port Adelaide would support this. The third included is the Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation. This great organisation gives young people the experience of life on the tall ship Leeuwin. They learn skills in sailing and navigating but, more MAIN COMMITTEE importantly, develop teamwork, confidence, responsibility and community spirit. This bill ensures that these organisations will be able to collect tax deductible gifts. This legislation demonstrates how the Rudd government continues to respond to the dynamic global economy and the challenges that brings for Australian businesses. It shows that we are prepared to listen and respond with practical measures to help meet the emerging needs of business. I commend the bill to the House. (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009. This bill, as happens so often, amends by schedule a number of provisions in relation to tax and a variety of different pieces of legislation. Schedule4 talks about three new organisations for deductibility for the purpose of gifts. Schedule3 amends the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act, implementing four minor measures to reduce compliance costs and provide a number of concessions for interested taxpayers. Schedule2 allows taxpayers who are voluntarily registered for GST and who choose to pay their GST annually to also make their PAYG instalments annually if they satisfy other sorts of tests for the purpose of eligibility for annual PAYG instalments, and it has the consequence of reducing compliance costs and regulation for business, and that is a good thing. I want to talk mainly about schedule 1 and the other measures that the Rudd Labor government is undertaking both nationally and locally to help small business. We are in the most difficult times for 75 years, and it is for all business, whether in the area of real estate, car sales, dentistry, floristry, banking, food outlets or recreational facilities. All those types of outlets, all those types of small businesses who are in my electorate, in small communities such as Kalbar, Boonah, Laidley and Gatton, are facing the challenges of the downturn-not just in Ipswich, which forms the heart of my seat. But it is important that we provide for small business to give them confidence for our nation’s future. We need to be able to support small business at this very difficult time. There is a great myth in Australian politics that the coalition somehow is the great saviour or advocate of small business. That is simply nonsense. The truth of the matter is that during their long tenure under Menzies they installed a Hansonite protectionist system supported by Black Jack McEwen, supported by the likes of Gorton, McMahon, Menzies and Holt, which served to straightjacket Australian business, profitability and the economic development of Australian business. They did not support small business. It was the Whitlam Labor government that brought in the Trade Practices Act and started the internationalisation of the Australian economy. It was the case that the Hawke and Keating governments internationalised our economy; made us internationally competitive; brought in superannuation, which helped so many people in this country; floated the dollar; reduced tariff barriers; and opened up the banking system-all of which was good for this country. It is the reality of Australian politics, rather than the myth, that Labor governments are the governments which are pro free enterprise, pro free trade and pro free market. It is a myth because those opposite support, invariably by their policies, big business and oligarchs. You can see it in their opposition on many occasions. They are in opposition, simply, to our stimulus package-that is quite clear-because our stimulus package helps small business. What we are doing for small business, for the many small businesses in my electorate and for the four million people that are employed by the 1.9 small businesses across the country, is to support them in this hour of need. Those opposite, the coalition-the great saviours, the great MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Therapeutic Goods Amendment Medical Devices And Other Measures Bill 2008
251,Mr Neumann (Blair) (7.39 Pm),"I rise to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendmentadvocates, of small business-oppose the stimulus package which simply was there to support and help small business, to give them a helping hand. They opposed it. They oppose every person employed, for example, at the RAAF base at Amberley in my electorate, with the $60 million that we put in there; everyone who benefits from the Defence Housing Authority’s 133 new homes; everyone who benefits from the $30 million in the BER funding in my electorate; the tradesmen, the electricians, the plumbers, the carpenters and all those people who are employed by the Rudd Labor government. That is the reality of political life in this country. Us supporting small business, supporting free enterprise, supporting economic welfare and development in local communities across the country-that is the reality of political life, not the mythology perpetrated and perpetuated by those who sit on the coalition benches. That is the reality of Australian political life, the polity of this country and the economy of this country. We are the ones who have done what we need to do to support small business. It is clear: in our budget we support it. We support consumption. Our stimulus packages helped the businesses in our area. When I went around the various shopping centres doing mobile offices in places like Riverlink in Ipswich, the Brassall Shopping Centre, Yamanto Shopping Village and Winston Glades, I spoke to many small business operators in those shopping centres which are so important in my area. I spoke to the management there. You can see how important helping small business is and how appreciative they were in relation to that. The legislation that we have before the chamber tonight is yet another example of the Rudd Labor government supporting small business, supporting free enterprise and helping businesses to maintain employment and to give people a chance. We are the ones who support family values. How can it not be a family value to make sure that you can feed and clothe your children, to have a roof over your head? That is family values. That is being pro-family. That is being pro-free-enterprise as well, because business operators are not just members of our community but consumers. They purchase goods and services in our community, which supports small business. So the people who sit on the opposite side of the chamber should have a good look at themselves and at what they do and say in this regard. I was in business for 20 years before I came to this place. I looked after my business. I built it up with the support of Matthew Turnour, the brother of the member for Leichhardt. Neumann and Turnour Lawyers employed many people. We had many staff. It was a multimillion-dollar operation. So, for those opposite who criticise those of us on this side of the House without business experience, I am not one that they can criticise because I know what it is like to have to meet the payroll, to pay the rent, to deal with telecommunications companies, to pay GST-to pay all these sorts of things, the challenges of small business. I know what it is like. I know it from personal experience. Schedule1 of this legislation helps small business in many, many ways. It is basically allowing small business to have $720 million in cash flow, to their benefit, simply from this change. What we are doing here is amending the GDP adjustment factor, which clearly does not represent the true rate of growth in income and profitability in businesses today. We are reducing it from nine per cent down to two per cent, and that means there will be more money in the kitty and the coffers of small business. It ensures that those businesses have more ready cash flow to meet their overdraft and other business requirements. It gives them a chance to MAIN COMMITTEE invest, it gives them a chance to employ more staff and it gives them a chance to retain staff in the circumstances. The last thing you want to do when you are in business is to put staff off. That is the last thing you want to do. You want to keep your skilled staff, because when the recovery comes it means that you have the people who will return you to profitability, and they are the ones who can increase their productivity all the more readily. The Rudd government is doing a lot to help small business. We are committed to ensuring small business remains viable and vibrant in all the circumstances. If we did not do what we are doing in terms of our budget and our stimulus packages, we would have 210,000 people out of work, according to Treasury estimates. That is 210,000 people effectively on unemployment benefits who cannot get access to the kind of cash which is necessary to purchase goods and services in small business, and that results in reduced profitability, retrenchment, liquidation, administration and lower corporate and PAYG tax receipts for the federal government. It is a spiral. So it is necessary to support small business. We are committed to that. We are providing more than $500 million in small business incentives and support. One of the things which has been most readily hailed in my electorate has been the small business tax break. Last Saturday night I was at the Ipswich Art Gallery speaking to a number of small business people. There was the head of the Ipswich Chamber of Commerce, Martin Corkery, and James Sturges, who is one of the leading businessmen in Ipswich and the manager of Ross Llewellyn Motors-a great place. I have bought a car or two from them over the years. They were telling me how important the Rudd government’s commitment is to Ipswich and to the economic development of the area but also to business. James waxed lyrical about the 50 per cent tax deductibility for assets costing more than $1,000, acquired after 13 December 2008 until 31 December 2009 and installed ready to use by 31 December 2010. James told me that they will sell more cars, and have been selling more cars, as a result of the 30 per cent increase. But now he thinks that the 50 per cent is a great thing for the local economy, as businesses purchase vehicles and a local car dealer in the area employs local staff and local people. This tax break will benefit small businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million per annum. But other things are really important too. Our Small Business Support Line is important and our Small Business Online initiative is also important. In my local area the Rudd Labor government is committed to small business in a practical way. We have funded for a period of four years the Ipswich Business Enterprise Centre. This helps local business in terms of mentoring, getting access to information and government services, access to finance, and access to the kind of information which will help small business to be profitable, to employ staff and to get started. I know a number of small businesses that have benefited. I spoke to Cindy Baker, who told me fairly recently in a meeting I had at the Ipswich Business Enterprise Centre how enthusiastic she was and how enthusiastic has been the response locally in Ipswich and also the rural areas outside. It is interesting that the Ipswich Business Enterprise Centre was launched in the Lockyer Valley. It is important that we have representation from various chambers of commerce on the board that runs it. SoI am pleased that the Ipswich Business Enterprise Centre is up and running effectively now and providing help for small business in the area. Why is that important? Ipswich is growing faster than any other area in Queensland. The ABS data in the last 12 months shows that Ipswich is growing at four per cent. The federal MAIN COMMITTEE electorate of Blair and its neighbour, Oxley, are just simply booming in population. The Ipswich part of my electorate will grow from about 64,000 voters to about 78,000 in the next couple of years. That is just the Ipswich part alone. In neighbouring Oxley it will grow from about 28,000 to 43,000 voters, and that is not counting children and other residents who are not Australian citizens entitled to vote. The truth is that we need a new classroom in Ipswich every week, such is the growth in population. So the commitment of the Rudd Labor government to small business in our community is simply stark. It is real, it is accessible to people, and it is very open and honest. When I talk to the principals at various schools I can see that the BER funding is also having a big impact in terms of local businesses, and they are very enthusiastic about what it can do for local businesses. The RAAF Base at Amberley, with a $1.1 billion injection of funds-$600 million in this particular year as part of our stage 3-is building new infrastructure in the local area and local jobs are being created. When you drive along the Ipswich Motorway-again, another great project funded by the Rudd Labor government-you cannot help but notice that thousands of jobs are being created and supported by an $884 million injection this year. Driving back from Brisbane to Ipswich you see so many people travelling to Ipswich to work these days from Brisbane. There are almost as many vehicles on the road coming back to Brisbane of an evening as there are returning to Ipswich from work in Brisbane. That is not what it was years ago. Business in Ipswich is booming. The unemployment rate actually went down 2.1 per cent in the last 12 months because of what is happening. So helping business in my local community is simply vital in all the circumstances. I think that this is a great bill which helps my local businesses. It is having a practical impact. I know from personal experience that this sort of PAYG cash flow relief will help lots of businesses that I was involved in as a lawyer acting for them years ago. But it is important also that we give not just to businesses in Ipswich or Brisbane or Sydney or Melbourne, but also to businesses in rural areas. So the 12-month extension of exceptional circumstances for farm dependent small businesses is warmly welcome. This will continue $20,000 non-business salary and wages exemption for exceptional circumstance relief payments, and $750,000 for non-business asset exemption for exceptional circumstances interest rate subsidies. That is really important because, as I have said on many occasions, Queensland is very different from other states. We are very regionally based. We have large rural communities and lots of small towns. Many people work on farms. They also work in these small communities in the towns. For example, we saw many types of businesses helped by the last stimulus package: 119 farming families received it. I want to thank the government for their commitment, thank the government for their help for small business and thank the government for the legislative changes in relation to tax which will help small business in my community. ment (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009. This bill, firstly, reduces the GDP adjustments for the 2009-10 financial year from around nine per cent to two per cent for taxpayers who pay quarterly PAYG instalments on the basis of the GDP adjusted notional tax method. Secondly, the bill allows taxpayers who are voluntarily registered for goods and services tax and who MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Therapeutic Goods Amendment Medical Devices And Other Measures Bill 2008

Thirdly, the bill amends the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987 to implement four minor measures to reduce compliance costs and provide certain concessions for affected taxpayers. Fourthly, the bill specifically lists three new organisations-namely, Diplomacy Training Program Ltd, the Royal Institution of Australia Inc. and Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation Ltd-as deductible tax receipts. I want to take a moment to speak about the Royal Institution of Australia Inc., which is based in my home state of South Australia. In October 2009 the Royal Institution of Australia will open its new premises in the converted former stock exchange building in Adelaide’s CBD. The institution’s mission is to bring science to the people. It will bring the findings of science to society and aims to foster informed debate about science and technology within the community. The Royal Institution of Australia in Adelaide will be the first international satellite of the world renowned Royal Institution of Great Britain, which has been the flagship of science communication in the UK for over 200 years. Partnered with the Royal Institution of Great Britain, and any future affiliated organisations, the new Royal Institution of Australia will be an internationally linked hub that will bring science from around the world to the community. The current director of the Royal Institution of Great Britain is Baroness Susan Greenfield, who was a South Australian government Thinker in Residence in 2004-05 and who played a major role in the establishment of the Royal Institution of Australia. There is another Adelaide connection with the Royal Institution of Great Britain. William Henry Bragg and his son William Lawrence Bragg were Adelaide physicists who, after returning to the UK, were both subsequently directors of the Royal Institution of Great Britain, the role currently held by Baroness Greenfield. The Braggs hold a unique place in Australia and world history as the only father and son ever to be awarded a Nobel Prize. Lawrence was just 25 years old when they were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1915, making him the youngest ever Nobel recipient. The Braggs’ contribution to science worldwide is celebrated in their home state of South Australia in many ways, including laboratories at the University of Adelaide and a state electorate both being named in their honour. South Australia has a strong scientific heritage through the contribution of people such as the Braggs, Howard Florey and Sir Douglas Mawson. The new Royal Institution of Australia will provide a permanent location to showcase this heritage and will display artifacts related to the Braggs and other items of relevance to the scientific heritage and contemporary achievements of scientists in South Australia and Australia. Science education and awareness is an area of need within our community, and I welcome the tax deductible status this bill delivers to the Royal Institution of Australia. We face the most severe global economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. We have seen over 30 banks around the world collapse or bailed out by governments. We have seen major Western economies such as the US, UK, Germany and Japan fall into recession. We have seen economies around the world fall into negative growth and we are seeing governments around the world go into substantial debt as they inject money into their economies in order to support jobs and prevent their economies from plunging into deeper recession or further productivity losses. Australia was not immune from the impacts of the global financial crisis and nor is it immune from the global economic downturn, because Australia is part of and operates in a MAIN COMMITTEE global economy. What the Rudd government has done is to act quickly and decisively with measures that will cushion Australia from the full impacts of the global economic downturn. An article in today’s Advertiser shows how those measures are working in the restaurant business in South Australia: South Australians spent a record $100 million in restaurants and cafes in March as diners defied the economic downturn. The $100 million figure was $15.1 million more than March last year and almost $20 million more than we spent in each of the preceding two months, latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show. Overall, in the six months to April, spending increased 3.8 per cent to $536.6 million compared with the same period last year ... It is good news for the South Australian hospitality sector, which employs about 32,500 people, including 15,000 in restaurants and cafes. That is clear evidence that the stimulus package which this government has embarked upon is having the desired effect of cushioning Australia against the global economic downturn. This bill is another in a series of measures the government has taken in order to support Australian jobs and the Australian economy-measures which are working and which have the support of most industry organisations and economic analysts. The measures in this bill are particularly beneficial to Australia’s 1.9 million small businesses, which in turn employ nearly four million Australians and, as I have said on previous occasions, will be critical to Australia’s economic recovery and future prosperity. Many of these businesses are finding it tough right now. Their turnover has dropped and, whereas in the past they may have turned to their bank for temporary increases in their business overdraft, even that option has become more difficult because of the global credit squeeze. In fact, had the government not introduced the bank guarantee measures early on in the downturn, the situation for many Australian businesses would today be much more dire. It was another example of the Rudd government acting early and acting decisively. Reducing the pay-as-you-go tax adjustment from around nine per cent to two per cent will assist businesses with much needed cash flow at a time when every bit of assistance helps. Pay-as-you-go provisions ensure that businesses pay income tax on a regular basis throughout the year. This is somewhat consistent-although not entirely consistent-with the requirement for wage earners to pay income tax as they earn their income throughout the year. The fundamental difference is that pay-as-you-go tax payments are based on the previous year’s income. In contrast to wage earners, business income can vary substantially from one year to the next. Particularly during this period of economic downturn, it is both realistic and fair to reduce the pay-as-you-go tax payments they are expected to make. Businesses are not the only taxpayers who pay PAYG tax. Many self-funded retirees who derive an income from their investments are also required to pay PAYG tax. As a result of the global economic downturn, the income of self-funded retirees has also been savagely cut, in many cases by more than that of many businesses. Reducing the adjustment to two per cent will also provide some relief to them. In a similar vein, taxpayers who choose to remit GST payments annually will also be provided with a boost to their cash flow if they choose to make their PAYG payments annually. MAIN COMMITTEE I have spoken on other occasions about small businesses and the valuable role they play in job creation, skills training, innovation and economic growth. For most small businesses, it is always tough, even during good times. If business is going well, new competition inevitably springs up, greedy landlords impose steep rent increases or suppliers increase the costs of their products. On Sunday, 24 May 2009, the Australian Retailers Association released a statement relating to steep rent increases: The Australian Retailers Association has called on the Rudd Government to bring retailers and landlords together at a Retail Tenancy Crisis roundtable to help restore the balance in leasing negotiation and break the retail code of silence. ARA’s Executive Director Richard Evans said the ARA had called on Federal Ministers Craig Emerson and Chris Bowen to step in and facilitate an environment where retailers, who often remain tight-lipped about unviable leasing conditions, are provided a platform to voice their concerns. And this is the critical point: ‘Many retailers, particularly smaller retailers, subscribe to an unwritten law to remain silent about spiralling occupancy costs and unfair leasing conditions out of fear they will be penalised by self-serving landlords who can refuse to renew their lease,’ Evans said. On that very issue, it was only two weeks ago that I was approached by a person who advocates on behalf of small business operators in shopping centres. He spoke to me about that very crisis which tenants in a particular shopping centre were facing-huge hikes in rent, no option but to pay the rent or lose their investment, and being treated in a way which none of us would believe to be fair and reasonable. He was looking for assistance as to how we might be able to help. Those are some of the issues which small business people currently face. As I said earlier, it does not matter whether it is good times or bad, they are doing it tough. That is what makes them very special. Small business operators are accustomed to doing it tough. They know how to get through hard times. Small business operators endure hardship from the day they set up their businesses. As someone who has been in small business for most of my life, I have associated with small business people and can speak not only from personal experience but from the many conversations and discussions I have had with small business people, particularly in Makin, the area I represent. These are extraordinarily tough times for small business. The Rudd government recognises that and has responded with a suite of direct and indirect measures that will support businesses throughout the nation. Direct benefits to small business include the 50 per cent tax concession for asset purchases and the extension of that concession until December 2009 for businesses with a turnover of $2 million; $10 million for a small business support line; a further $10 million for an online small business support service; and the cutting of December PAYG instalments by 20 per cent. These measures will directly assist with cash flow to help small business to remain viable during these very difficult times. On top of that, we have seen the funding of small business advisory centres around the country and business enterprise centres. We are also right now considering a proposal to support motor vehicle financing. This again is a proposal which undoubtedly will be a direct benefit for the many small businesses around this country. All of those measures will make a direct difference to the ability of businesses to remain viable during these very tough times. But the biggest support that the Rudd government has MAIN COMMITTEE provided to small business around the country is through the budget announced last week and through the stimulus packages announced prior to that. The Rudd government is investing in 20,000 housing units around the country and increasing the First Home Owner Grant to $21,000 for newly constructed homes and $14,000 for other homes. There is the school modernisation program, which affects the 9,540 schools around Australia. There is the home insulation program, where up to 2.7 million homes around the country will be eligible for free insulation. There are all of the national infrastructure projects, in addition to the $22 billion worth of infrastructure projects that were announced in last week’s budget. All of these measures will have a direct stimulus effect on small business because the prime beneficiaries will be locally based businesses here in Australia, the 1.9 million small businesses that I referred to earlier in this speech. This proposal will provide an additional $720 million of cash flow to the small business sector in this country. It will support up to 1.5 million taxpayers across Australia, 1.3 million of those being small business people. It is the kind of proposal that makes a difference to their viability, it is the kind of proposal that is needed in these tough times and it is the kind of proposal that I have no doubt is welcomed by the small business sector across the country. I commend the bill to the House. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (8.10 pm)-I rise to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009. I will be giving most of my attention to schedule 4 of the bill, which lists three new organisations as deductible gift recipients, or DGRs. I will also make some mention of schedules 1, 2 and 3 because they are very important reforms, particularly for the small business sector. In my electorate of Page there are more than 11,000 registered small business operators-and that is a rough figure; we know there are a lot more than that. Schedule1 of the bill relates to the pay as you go tax instalment system. The government will reduce PAYG instalments in 2009-10 for taxpayers who pay quarterly instalments on the basis of the GDP adjusted notional tax method by setting the GDP adjustment at two per cent. This reduction will provide around $720 million of cash-flow benefits to small businesses, self-funded retirees and other eligible taxpayers by ensuring that their PAYG instalments more closely approximate their actual income tax liability for 2009-10. The reduction will also provide a further economic stimulus to support Australian jobs, because taxpayers will have the use of around $720 million that would otherwise be overpaid tax. This is one of the issues that small businesses frequently complain about. SoI welcome the change, and it is a good that the government is introducing it. Schedule2 relates to annual PAYG instalments when taxpayers are voluntarily registered for GST. The introduction of the annual GST payments in 2004 without a change in the annual PAYG instalment conditions at that time has created a misalignment between the PAYG and GST instalment systems. Some annual GST payers are prevented from making annual PAYG instalments solely because of their voluntary GST registration. This imposes unnecessary compliance costs on these taxpayers-and that is the last thing we want, particularly in these times. These amendments will allow taxpayers to choose to make PAYG instalments annually when they are voluntarily registered for GST and meet the other eligibility test for annual PAYG instalments. This will reduce the compliance costs for eligible taxpayers. The amendments will apply in relation to instalments for income years starting after 30 June 2009. MAIN COMMITTEE Schedule3 introduces a functional currency rule to the petroleum resources rent tax, or PRRT. This will reduce compliance costs for taxpayers, which is again a welcome change. It introduces a modified look-back rule for exploration expenditure related to a production licence derived from an exploration permit and a retention lease. It introduces internal petroleum provisions similar to the external petroleum provisions and provides certainty by establishing rules for internal petroleum. It extends the offshore exploration incentive for designated frontier areas by one year so that it applies to the 2009 annual offshore acreage release. That will help encourage exploration of frontier areas for another year, until the release of the Australia’s Future Tax System review and the energy white paper. Schedule 4, the deductible gift recipients-the DGR-lists a number of new organisations. One of them that I will talk about in some detail is Diplomacy Training Program Ltd. I declared an interest of support, knowledge and involvement with the DTP over many yearssince its inception about 20 years ago-and I advocated the listing of the DTP to the responsible minister. Of course, Diplomacy Training Program Ltd had to pass all the tests because it is the tax office who makes the call on it, and they have deemed it to be eligible. The Diplomacy Training Progam visited our parliament last year and attended a session with the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. They do a number of things and they have an annual training program where they bring people from the Asia-Pacific region-our region-together for a threeor four-week training program. That is what they did. They were here in Canberra and they came and met the committee and the chairs of the respective subcommittees. It was such a success that everybody-that is, the members of parliament who serve on the committee-deemed that they wanted to do it again next year. For some of the program members it was the first time that they had been able to come into a parliament, into a democratic space, and actually meet with members of parliament. Some of them said that it was amazing that they were able to do that. I will give a brief history of the Diplomacy Training Program. It is an independent, not-forprofit association affiliated with the University of New South Wales. It was founded by Nobel Peace Laureate and President of Timor-Leste, Jose Ramos-Horta, hence some of my involvement and early working with the Diplomacy Training Program. It has a board of directors who are very eminent people in Australian life. I ask to incorporate the list of current board of directors into my speech. Leave granted. The list read as follows: Current Board of Directors Emeritus Professor Paul Redmond (Chair) BA LLB LLM Faculty of Law, UNSW Mr Philip Chung BEc LLB-Executive Director, Australasian Legal Information Institute (AustLII) Associate Professor Andrea Durbach, Director, Australian Human Rights Centre, UNSW Emeritus Professor Garth Nettheim LLB MA AO -Faculty of Law, UNSW Dr John Pace BA LLD -Former Secretary, UN Commision on Human Rights, Geneva Dr Sarah Pritchard BA LLB LLM -Barrister at Law Ms Louise Sylvan BA MPA -Deputy Chair, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) MAIN COMMITTEE Roewen Wishart, Development Manager, Australian Bush Heritage Fund Professor Andrew Byrnes, Associate Dean, Faculty of Law, UNSW tives of non-government organisations in the Asia-Pacific region on human rights, good governance and the rule of law. Since its inception almost 20 years ago, more than 1,400 people have participated in DTP programs from a range of countries, including East Timor, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Burma, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and many more. Several participants have also been elected or appointed to senior government positions in East Timor, Malaysia and Australia since graduating from DTP programs, so it is an organisation well worth supporting. With that contribution, I commend the bill to the House and I thank the responsible minister. Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (8.18 pm)-I am pleased to rise in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009. Amongst other measures, this bill provides for the Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation to be listed for deductible gift recipient status. The Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation’s ship, the Leeuwin, is a Fremantle icon, and the ship can regularly be seen sailing in and out of Fremantle port and along the beautiful Western Australian coastline. The mission of the foundation is to challenge and inspire young people to realise their personal potential and make a positive contribution to the wider community through the unique medium of a tall sailing ship. It is this dedication to providing a leadership and community building experience for young Western Australians that makes the Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation such a worthy recipient of deductible gift recipient status. The Leeuwin was launched in August 1986 and it is still sailing today. The ship has over 810 square metres of sail and is 55 metres long, which makes it the largest operating vessel of its kind in Australasian waters. Since being built, over 22,000 young people have benefited from participating in the Leeuwin’s sail training voyages. My brother Aaron is one such person who was a grateful participant and I remember well the joyful recounting of his 10-day challenging adventure on the Leeuwin, which included climbing up masts, setting sails and standing watch as part of a team of young people. The Leeuwin foundation provides a window into Fremantle’s vital port history by providing the opportunity for young Australians to sail on an 1850s style sailing ship. The seed funding to make the Leeuwin foundation a reality came from the Commonwealth, the West Australian state government, businesses and community groups. What is more, many West Australians made personal donations towards its construction. I am pleased that people can now donate tax-free to the Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation, which will encourage donations and help maintain the Leeuwin foundation’s donor base during the current global recession. This will be very helpful, for instance, with the Leeuwin foundation’s attempts to obtain funding for a talking compass, an instrument that repeats the compass course via a speaker so that a helmsman with visual limitations can con the ship as well as anyone. Aside from the support represented by the granting of deductible gift recipient status, the Rudd government has also supported the Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation through a volunteer grant in the latest round. The foundation received $20,000 to assist the large volunteer base who help keep the Leeuwin sailing. Specifically this grant will assist in reimbursing volunteers for some of the fuel costs which they incur as a result of their dedication to the Leeuwin. MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Therapeutic Goods Amendment Medical Devices And Other Measures Bill 2008
253,Ms Saffin,"I thank the opposition for that. The DTP provides training for representaThe community engagement of the Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation is evident in all the tasks they undertake. The ship does not just service the metropolitan area; it regularly travels as far south as Esperance and as far north as Darwin and stops along the way at Geraldton, Monkey Mia, Exmouth, Dampier, Port Hedland and Broome. When in these ports the local community are able to participate in voyages, making the Leeuwin an asset for all of Western Australia and even the Northern Territory. One example of how the Leeuwin voyages give back to the community is a voyage by the WA Navy cadets earlier this year, where the cadets stopped at Rottnest Island to participate in revegetation and clean-up projects that help preserve the fragile ecosystem of Rottnest Island. The work of the Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation is similar in spirit to that of other organisations listed in the tax act, including Ian Thorpe’s Fountain for Youth Ltd, the Clontarf Foundation and the Spirit of Australia Foundation. The Young Endeavour Youth Scheme, which does similar work to the Leeuwin foundation, has been listed for many years and I am pleased that the work of the Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation and its crew has been similarly recognised. The Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation contributes greatly to the West Australian community through its programs for young Indigenous people from the north of Australia, its programs for school students and its voyages for young people with disabilities. The contribution of the Leeuwin foundation to the broader Australian community includes running programs with schools from other states and even the international community, as demonstrated by their work with the United World College in Singapore. The Leeuwin youth explorer voyages are recognised by the West Australian Curriculum Council as an endorsed program for the WA certificate of education for students in years 10, 11 and 12. This recognises that students who participate in Leeuwin voyages gain valuable life skills in areas like self-esteem, goal setting, communication and teamwork and a sense of community. I note the member for Curtin’s ongoing support for the Leeuwin foundation, and I am sure that she and her constituents will be pleased with the government’s support for this listing. I want to acknowledge the hard work of the Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation in earning this listing. In particular I acknowledge the work of Carol Shannon, John Murray, Malcolm Hay, Terry Baker and the captain of the Leeuwin, Chris Blake. I especially want to thank the Assistant Treasurer, Chris Bowen, for his visit to Fremantle last year, where he acknowledged the important contribution the Leeuwin foundation makes to the lives of young Australians, many of whom are disadvantaged, and for his valuable contribution to the decision to grant the Leeuwin foundation deductible gift recipient status. I am pleased to be part of the Rudd Labor government, which has provided such support for this very deserving not-for-profit community foundation. sistant Treasurer) (8.23 pm)-in reply-I thank all members who participated in this debate. The pay-as-you-go amendment contained in schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009 will provide a substantial cash flow benefit to small business, self-funded retirees and other eligible taxpayers. This amendment sets the GDP adjustment for the 2009-10 income year at two per cent for taxpayers who pay quarterly PAYG instalments on the basis of the GDP-adjusted notional tax method. This will be an important initiative in this very difficult time for cash flow for small business in particular and it joins the general and MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Therapeutic Goods Amendment Medical Devices And Other Measures Bill 2008
254,Mr Bowen (Prospect,"Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assmall business tax break that the government has embarked upon as part of the government’s support for small business in these very difficult times. The amendment in schedule 2 of the bill will allow taxpayers who are voluntarily registered for goods and services tax who choose to remit the GST annually to also choose to make their PAYG income tax instalments annually, provided they satisfy the other eligible tests for annual PAYG instalments. The amendments will reduce the compliance costs for eligible taxpayers by addressing the misalignment between PAYG and GST instalment systems. Schedule3 of the bill amends the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987 to implement four minor measures, on which I will not detain the House. Schedule4 amends the list of deductible gift recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Division 30 of the tax act sets out the requirements for organisations to be granted DGR status. Organisations with DGR status can collect tax deductible gifts. Organisations must either fit under one of the existing DGR categories or must be specifically listed under these provisions. This schedule specifically lists the Royal Institution of Australia Inc., the Diplomacy Training Program Ltd and the Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation Ltd. I am very pleased that the members for Page and Fremantle were able to contribute to this debate. The member for Page was instrumental in convincing me of the benefits of the Diplomacy Training initiative, something I am sure the member for Fremantle would also support, given her extensive background in the area. The member for Fremantle, as the honourable member indicated, was very active in lobbying on behalf of the Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation and took the opportunity when I visited Fremantle to introduce me to the board of directors and senior management. I had a range of questions about the services that were available to disadvantaged youth in particular and I found their case very compelling. As the honourable member for Fremantle indicated, there are a number of precedents for this listing and I was more than happy to support it through this legislation. She deserves the acknowledgement of the House for her tireless efforts on behalf of the Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation. Taxpayers can of course claim income tax deductions for certain gifts to organisations with DGR status. DGR status will assist the listed organisations to attract public support for their activities. Again, in these very difficult times where donations are drying up, DGR status is of vital importance to many instrumentalities and I am glad we have been able to extend it to these three organisations. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Main Committee adjourned at 8.28 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Commonwealth Department: Operating Loss (Question No. 445) Mr Hockey asked the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, in writing, on 1 December 2008: (1) Did he approve any departments and agencies to budget for an operating loss in the 2007-08 financial year; if so, (i) which departments and agencies, and (ii) what reasons did each provide for the operating loss?

(6) From December 2007 to June 2008, what sum of depreciation funding was used for recurrent spending by departments and agencies? (7) For the 2008-09 Budget, how many policy proposals were costed by the Budget Group of his department; and what was the average length of time spent by Budget Group officers on costing each policy proposal for this period?

(12) What provision has been made in the Contingency Reserve of the MYEFO 2008-09 for future increases in Australia’s official development assistance? (13) Which events that were reasonably expected to affect the Budget Estimates were included in the Contingency Reserve in the MYEFO 2008-09 instead of being allocated to individual programs (Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2008-09, page 68); and what sum of money was allocated for each of these events? (14) Is there any provision in the Contingency Reserve for any expenditure for the Commonwealth in relation to the emissions trading scheme; if so, what sum of money has been made available? (1) I approved 34 entities to budget for an operating loss in 2007-08 compared to 15 entities in 200607. The reasons for the approvals in 2007-08 were (see explanations of reasons* below): Department/Agency Reason for Loss Cotton Research and Development Corporation Other Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority Other Export Wheat Commission Other Land and Water Australia Timing Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity Higher net expenditure, Accounting Federal Court of Australia One-off costs, Accounting Australian Crime Commission Timing Australian Federal Police Accounting, Timing Attorney-General’s Department Timing Australian Fisheries Management Authority One-off costs Australian War Memorial Accounting Department of Veterans’ Affairs One-off costs Film Australia Accounting Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Higher net expenditure Director of National Parks Timing Australian Film Commission Timing, Other Australia Council Timing Indigenous Land Corporation Timing Office of Commonwealth Ombudsman Timing Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Timing Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Timing Cancer Australia Higher net expenditure Australian Sports Commission One-off costs Private Health Insurance Administration Council Timing Department of Health and Ageing Higher net expenditure Centrelink Other Commonwealth Rehabilitation Services Australia Other Department of Human Services Timing Medicare Australia Other Australian National Audit Office Timing Australian Public Service Commission Accounting Australian Taxation Office One-off costs Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Accounting Australian Bureau of Statistics Higher net expenditure * Explanation of reasons: Timing Losses usually resulting from differences in timing between revenue and expenses for example, an agency may have been asked to perform additional duties to be funded in another financial year.",178,Therapeutic Goods Amendment Medical Devices And Other Measures Bill 2008
255,Mr Tanner,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Accounting Adjustments to non-cash expenses due to accounting treatments such as revaluations, write-downs or recalculation of accrued employee entitlements or depreciation are classified under this category. One-Off Costs– These are losses resulting from one-off factors, such as the spending of cash reserves to fund new systems or office relocation costs. Higher net expenditure (financial health) – These losses may be due to a number of factors and are likely to be an indicator that the erosion of equity will continue in the future. Other– Losses that do not fit into the above four categories. This may include reasons such as lower than budgeted income (eg a reduction in the total amount of levies collected from industry as a result of the drought), or higher than expected costs. (2) Yes. The following departments and agencies incurred operating losses in 2007-08 without my prior approval for the following reasons: Department/Agency Reason for Loss Australian Communications and Media Authority Higher net expenditure Austrade Higher net expenditure Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Other Indigenous Affairs Child Support Agency Higher net expenditure General Practice Education and Training Limited Other (3) Yes. As at 18 March 2008, I had approved the following departments and agencies to budget for operating losses in the 2008-09 financial year for the following reasons: Department/Agency Reason for Loss Cotton Research and Development Corporation Other Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority Other Australian Fisheries Management Authority One-off costs Australian Transactions Report and Analysis Centre One-off costs Federal Court of Australia One-off costs, Accounting Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Timing Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Timing, accounting Studies Geoscience Australia Timing Department of Transport and Regional Services Other Australian Maritime Safety Authority Accounting Australia Council Timing National Museum of Australia Timing Australian Public Service Commission Accounting Administrative Appeals Tribunal Other (4) Yes. I did not approve requests from two agencies to budget for operating losses for the following reasons: Agency Reason Office of Parliamentary Counsel As approval would have locked in higher than sustainable ex(OPC) penses, it was suggested that a more appropriate funding structure be sought. Agency Reason Australian Institute of Health and As a large percentage of AIHW’s revenue comes from the proviWelfare (AIHW) sion of services to predominantly government agencies, it was suggested that a reassessment of cost of services and levels of services provided be undertaken. (5) For the 2007-08 financial year, I have adjusted the appropriations available to agencies pursuant to section 8 (1) of the Appropriation Act (No. 1) 2007-08 and have withheld the issuing of a total amount of $3.2 billion, spread among various agencies. This amount represents annual administered appropriations which remained unexpensed at the end of the 2007-08 financial year and has effectively been returned to the budget. (6) It is generally not possible for a department or agency to use depreciation funding to increase other operating expenses above budgeted levels without incurring an operating loss. One of the key controls in the budget framework is the limits on the capacity of agencies to budget for, and incur, operating losses. The framework does not allow an agency to budget for a loss without seeking the approval of the Finance Minister. This process is one of the ways that the Department and the Finance Minister are able to examine an agency’s financial situation, including any indication that agencies are not overspending on the amount of recurrent funding they have received. In terms of expenditure, agencies are currently funded for depreciation as well as other operating costs and such funding is appropriated as a single amount for each entity. Each dollar of funding is not, however, separately tracked to determine the specific accounting line to which it relates. Nevertheless, as part of the accountability and transparency of their operations, agencies are required to prepare financial statements on an annual basis and include detailed data such as cash flow by item as well as a breakdown of depreciation expenses. (7) Neither the number of policy proposals costed by Budget Group nor the average length of time spent by relevant officers on costing each policy proposal for the 2008-09 Budget are statistics that are recorded by my Department. (8) Budget Group staff accrued a total of 5,056 hours of formal Time Off In Lieu (TOIL) from 1 January to 30 June 2008. Formal TOIL reflects those additional hours of work which are formally approved by managers and entered into a central Finance records system. Managers may also provide informal TOIL but Finance holds no central records of informal TOIL hours. (9) The amount of revenue spent by agencies pursuant to section 31 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 is not collected centrally. However, this information is available for each agency in their financial statements. (10) The Contingency Reserve (CR) includes Government decisions if they occur late in the process, and are reasonably expected to affect the budget estimates but cannot be reliably allocated to individual programs. Such estimates are included in the CR but are not published separately. This reflects the fact that disclosure of specific amounts could jeopardise the integrity of commercial-inconfidence or national security-in-confidence items included in the CR. (11) The CR includes economic parameter revisions if they occur late in the process, and are reasonably expected to affect the budget estimates but cannot be reliably allocated to individual programs. Such estimates are included in the CR but are not published separately. This reflects the fact that disclosure of specific amounts could jeopardise the integrity of commercial-in-confidence or national security-in-confidence items included in the CR. (12) The provisions in the CR for Official Development Assistance (ODA) are consistent with the Government target of achieving its target of ODA being 0.5 per cent of Gross National Income by 2015-16. The proportions relating to each of the forward estimates were published on pages 6-7 and 6-8 of Budget Paper No. 1 2008-09. Relevant amounts will be transferred from the CR into agency estimates following Government decisions to provide new funding to implement ODA eligible measures. (13) The CR makes provision for events that are reasonably expected to affect the budget estimates but cannot be reliably allocated to individual programs. Amounts allocated to those items in the CR are not typically published individually. This reflects the fact that disclosure of specific amounts could jeopardise the integrity of commercial-in-confidence or national security-in-confidence items included in the CR. As indicated on page 68 of MYEFO 2008-09, an example of an event reasonably expected to affect the budget estimates is the continuation of the Government’s support for the Northern Territory Emergency Response beyond 2008-09. (14) No. As at 1 December 2008, there was no provision in the CR for any expenditure relating to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
