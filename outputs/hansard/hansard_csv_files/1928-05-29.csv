Will the Prime Minister, before the time comes for that discussion, lay upon the table of the House the text of the proposals, so that honourable members may have an opportunity of considering it? tion very soon to lay upon the table of the House' not only the text of the communication received from the Government of the United States of America, but also the replies made to it by Great Britain, Germany and Prance. I shall certainly do so before there is any discussion of the subject in the House. Minister indicate whether it is the intention of the Government to afford this House an early opportunity to discuss the proposal to outlaw war which originated in the United States of America, and whether it has arrived at a decision as to its policy in relation to the matter? If so, will a statement as to that policy he made at an early date? mated that the Government had accepted with the utmost cordiality the proposals put forward by the United States of America. With the second part of the honourable member's question, I have already dealt. I hope to afford the House the opportunity of discussing these proposals.

NEW tion of the Prime Minister been drawn to a cablegram which was published iu the Times, London, on Friday last, to the effect that Herr Bosch had made a statement in Germany that ""particularly large strides had been made in the synthetic production of motor spirit, and that he hoped that the production for this year would be 100,000 tons of benzine, and hoped it would be doubled in 1929."" An application for the admission of German capital into Australia for the purpose of establishing an extensive plant for the extraction of by-products from coal has been referred to the Development and Migration Commission for inquiry. Has the Government yet received the commission's report on the subject? The matter is urgent because of the serious unemployment that exists in our coal mining industry. port to which the honourable member has referred, but I have received information to the effect that great progress has been made in the production of motor spirit and other by-products from coal. While in Melbourne last week I discussed this subject with the Development and Migration Commission. I hope at an early date to announce the decision of the Government. prohibition of the exhibition of the motion picture "" Dawn"" in Australia, is the Prime Minister aware that county councils in Great Britain have the power to decide whether particular films shall or shall not be exhibited in their districts, mier of South Australia has acted with and that the London County Council has allowed this film to be exhibited, with the result that long queues of people are to be seen waiting in the streets for admission to the theatres in which it is shown? In these circumstances, will the Government reconsider its decision not to allow the film to be shown in Australia? Great Britain, and that a great number of people are desirous of seeing it. As a profit-making picture I have no doubt that it is a great success. I am also aware that the system of film censorship in Great Britain is different from that in Australia, but I suggest to the honourable member that our system is superior to that of the Mother Country. I have already indicated the reasons which caused the Government to prohibit the public exhibition of the picture in Australia, and am not prepared to re-open the question. PORT AUGUSTA TO RED HILL of the Prime Minister to the following statement which was published in the parliamentary news of the Adelaide Register on Wednesday, 23rd MayMr Fitzgerald asked if the Government would consider the advisableness of constructing the Red Hill to Port Augusta railway for the purpose of absorbing the unemployed. The Premier replied that the Commonwealth Government was considering the matter. He would ask when it was going to start thp work. His Government could not undertake the expenditure of £300,000 or £400,000 on the line. Have the overtures referred to been made to the Commonwealth Government by the Premier of South Australia, and if so, what reply has been made to them? If no reply has been sent, will the Prime Minister undertake to give immediatf attention to the matter, on acount of th( acute distress that exists in South Australia ?

I should like to know whether the Prime Minister was misinformed when he made his former replies regarding the restriction of Italian migration to Australia, and if he will take the interstate conference of the Australian steps to regulate the entry of Italians? the honourable member did not intend to suggest that I have deliberately, tried to mislead the House.' There is a very definite restriction of the number of Italian immigrants coming to Australia this year, designed to maintain that proportion of British stock in our population that we all desire. The number of Italian migrants allowed into this country during the present year will be something less than half the number that arrived last year. After discussion with the Italian Consul-General and correspondence with his government, an arrangement has been come to with the utmost goodwill on the part of all concerned, and which has the co-operation of the Italian Government, limiting the number of Italian migrants to arrive in Australia during the present year to 3,000 for the whole twelve months. only female relatives of Italians already resident in Australia will be permitted to come to Australia in that jieriod, the only male Italians who may come in under the arrangement being the fathers or sons of those already resident here. have taken place between the Prime Minister and the Italian Consul as to the As a result of the restriction of Italian migrants?

I do not propose to lay upon the table any of the documents relating to those negotiations, but I have informed the House as to their result. I consider it most undesirable that negotiations of this character should be made the subject of public disgraph appeared in the Melbourne Herald of the 25th May :Claiming that £700,000 spent yearly by the Federal Government in baby bonuses was wasted, Mrs. Morris (South Australia) told Women's National League yesterday that reforms were needed urgently. The allowance was demoralizing the people, she said. It was never paid when it was most needed, so that it was ineffective in decreasing maternal mortality. It had no effect on the birth rate. The conference decided that the Commonwealth Government' be requested to re-consider the form in which the maternity allowance is spent, with a view of securing better national results. Has the Government any intention of amending the present system of maternity grants? man's question relates to the future policy of the Government. He is, doubtless, aware that it is not usual, when replying to questions, to indicate the Government's policy.

But, with the exception of the Victorian Order, no honours are conferred by His Majesty unless there has been a recommendation from his responsible Ministers. In this particular matter it is the Prime Minister-no t the Government-that is concerned. In regard to Australian honours, His Majesty acts upon the advice of the Australian Prime Minister; in the conferring of British honours, he acts upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and similarly in conferring honours on the citizens of other dominions, he acts on the advice of the Prime Ministers of the dominions concerned.

Prime Minister, upon notice1. What changes, if any, have been made during the past six years in the system of medical examinations of migrants prior to embarkation ? 2. What system is in force at present to prewith the intention of testing the mentality of vent the immigration of mental defectives (adults and children) ? 3. Has any action been taken to appoint a woman doctor to examine women migrants? 4. Have any si^ps been taken to collect and correlate statistics concerning migrants after arrival ? orable member's questions are as follow:1. In March, 1922, the system then in operation of recognizing the medical certificate of any doctor registered with the British Medical Association was discontinued, and, in lieu, special medical referees were appointed to act on behalf of all the dominions as examiners of assisted migrants. In October, 1923, Sir Neville Howse, V . C, investigated tlie system of medical examination of migrants and suggested certain improvements, whicli were adopted. In July, 1926, Dr. C. L . Park, who had had considerable experience with the Commonwealth Health Department as Director of Marine Hygiene and Chief Quarantine Officer for Victoria, proceeded to London to take up the position of Chief Medical Officer at Australia House. W it h the object of still further, improving the system, two permanent Australian medical officers were last year appointed to the staff of the Migration and Settlement Office at Australia House, and the appointment of a thir d medical officer is at present under consideration. W it h these permanent officers functioning, it is expected that the majority of the assisted migrants coming to Australia will have been examined by our own Government doctors. 2. The Immigration Act 1901-1925, prohibits the immigration into the Commonwealth of any idiots, imbeciles, feeble-minded persons, epileptics, persons suffering from dementia, insane persons, and persons who have been insane within five years previously, or persons who have had two or more attacks of insanity. All immigrants are subjected to a medical examiwealth Health Department prior to disembarkation. It is also necessary for the ship's medical officer to report to the quarantine officer any abnormal conditions observed by him in a passenger during the voyage to Australia. I would refer the honourable member to a reply I gave him on the 5th October last relative to the application of mental tests to assisted migrants. ThereinI stated that medical referees are required to give special attention during the course of their examination of applicants for assisted passages to the mental condition of the prospective migrant. Each applicant is questioned, not only in regard to his own mental history, but that of his antecedents. Mental tests are applied in the form of questions as to local happenings, local geographical knowledge, and historical events. Applicants are also tested in mental arithmetic, and in the reading of a newspaper, &c. Tests are applied by the medical referees, but the selection officers of the Migration and Settlement Office also in the course of their interviews with applicants, apply questions the prospective migrants. It may be added that at present there is an arrangement with the State Governments under which any cases are reported where migrants become charges upon State institutions on accoiurfc of suffering from insanity or other mental defects, and it is the practice, where circumstances warrant such action, to take steps under the Immigration Act to deport such persons back to their home countries, in pursuance of section 8A of the act, which provides that deportation (at the expense of the shipping companies concerned) can be effected in any cases where a migrant, within three years of his arrival in Australia, becomes an inmate of an insane asylum, or charge upon a public charitable institution in Australia. 3. This matter has recently been fully considered by the Development and Migration Commission, and it has been decided that, owing to certain administrative difficulties, no action shall be taken for the present to appoint a woman doctor to examine women migrants. 4.

(6) The departmental contractor at Wingham explains that he instructed his carter to load certain timber purchased by Mr Cameron in a truck in which departmental cross arms were being loaded. The contractor states the freight was to be charged to himself and included in Mr Cameron's account. (o) The freight (£2 8s. 6d.) was wrongly charged to this department, as the sending station has no weighbridge and the weight was taken at Sydenham, where the mixed consignment was not noticed by the postal officer who prepared the consignment note. 2. Full inquiry has been made, and the evidence is clear that Mr Cameron's arrangement with the supplier was that the freight was to be paid by the saw-mill and charged to Mr 7. The committee is composed of consultants Cameron. 3. The postal officers at Sydenham had not received from the contractor a detailed account of the number of cross arms in the truck, and in preparing the consignment note described the contents as a "" number of cross arms."" 4.

General) [3.51] -In the course of this debate, many and varied opinions have been expressed on the subject, not only of conciliation and arbitration, but also of industrial matters in Australia and generally. The opinions on arbitration may be arranged in three classes. In the first class are the few, but very few, members of the House who, if not opposed to arbitration altogether, are certainly opposed to arbitration being undertaken as a function of a federal authority. In the second class, are those who support arbitration, but appear to be unwilling to accept its logical consequences. In the third class, are those who accept arbitration as a principle, and are also prepared to accept its logical consequences. Those who come within the first class are opposed to arbitration because it involves by an outside authority, and because of the result which, it has been said, arbitration in Commonwealth hands has actually brought about in Australia.",25,Refunds

67,Mr Latham (Kooyong,"AttorneyThe industrial problem will not solve itself by being left alone. It is a very difficult one, and no solution that may be suggested will completely overcome all the difficulties that present themselves. I have already said that the Government makes no pretence that this legislation will cure all our industrial troubles. Still, these troubles will not be cured by being left alone, nor can we get rid of them by passing them by on the other side. The Arbitration Court, despite some defects in its machinery, which this bill.endeavours to remedy, and other difficulties incidental to the subject of industrial disputes, is to-day doing most useful and valuable work. Let me repeat that it is wrong to concentrate attention upon the few, though I admit important, industries in which industrial trouble frequently occurs ; we should remember the large number of industries that are working satisfactorily -under awards and certified agreements, and in which there is no industrial trouble at all. Honourable members opposite all say that they support the principle of arbitration; but I shall endeavour to show that they almost unanimously, if not unanimously, reject the necessary logical consequences and implications of that declaration. The Government on the other hand, accepts arbitration as a principle, and recognizes that the Federal Parliament is confined to the utilization of the two methods of conciliation and arbitration for dealing with industrial matters. Accepting arbitration as a principle, the Government accepts also its necessary implications. The debate would hardly give an outside and unprejudiced observer a true view of the nature of the bill. The measure contains many provisions that are almost non-contentious, and many indubitable improvements on the existing system; number of years have been asked for by one side or the other in industry, and provisions which, it will be conceded when we come to deal with the bill in committee, are Undoubtedly wise and prudent. Very little attention has been devoted to those provisions. The discus^ sion has been directed almost entirely to three or four controversial matters with which the bill deals. I desire, therefore. to re-call the attention of the House to some of the general principles that the measure contains. In the first place, our whole arbitration system, from its introduction in 1904, has been based on the acceptance of the principles of conciliation and arbitration in place of direct action. That has been its deliberate policy. Our Conciliation and Arbitration Act is distinct from, I think, all other statutes of this Parliament, in that it contains a section setting forth its chief objects. That section-sectio n 2declares the chief objects of the act to 1. To prevent lockouts and strikes in relation to industrial disputes; 2. To constitute, a Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration having jurisdiction for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. Other objects are also set forth, but that in the forefront is the prevention of lockouts and strikes. I ask my honourable friends opposite whether they regard arbitration as consistent with an unlimited right to lockout or an Unlimited right to strike? If they do not, where would they draw the limit? The act declares that arbitration is not consistent with strikes and lockouts. Section 6, which was part of the original act passed in 1904, prohibits, under a penalty of £1,000, all interstate strikes and lockouts. Although that section has been in the act from the beginning, one would not have thought so,when listening to the utterances of honourable members opposite. Now what is the opposition to this provision ? Section 6A was inserted in 1920, and, according to the interpretation of the High Court; it means; to put it shortly, that persons or organizations bound by an award; or entitled to the improvements which for a benefit of an award, must not strike against an award. Therefore; the act prohibits two classes of strikes-firstly ; interstate Strikes; that is strikes ' on account of interstate industrial disputes; and secondly, strike's against an award by persons or organizations hound by an award. Is it desired by the Opposition, or by the trade union movement; that the prohibition of strikes and lockouts should be removed ? . T have. here a pamphlet entitled "" No Compromise,"" issued by the Australian Labour party and the Labour Council of New South Wales conjointly. that pamphlet these sentences occurThe strike is the last and most powerful defence of the organized workers against capitalist aggression. Shorn of the right to strike, the workers would become the pawns of the politicians and the helpless victims of the bosses. On page 14 appears the criticism of the Australian Labour party on the bill, the first point taken being, in effect, that the measure dispossesses the trade unions of the elementary right to strike. What is the position of our friends on the other side of the House on that question? Do they stand by the propaganda of the Australian Labour party and the Labour Council of New South Wales, and say that the right to strike must be preserved ? If they do not, where do they stand? is that, in certain circumstances the bill makes strikes and lockouts legal. been given to my direct question. terrupt the Attorney-General's speech, but he is inviting interjections, and if he wishes for answers to his questions he w ill get them. to allow the honourable member to say whether he supports the views expressed in the sentences that I have read f r p m this pamphlet. tion that I made in my second-reading speech. does not answer my questiou. ask the Attorney-General to deal with what I said in my second-reading speech. this bill was introduced I had many opportunities of consulting and being consulted by all the interests directly concerned, including employers' organizations and trade unions. Among other, the Australian Council of Trade Unions has seen me on several occasions, and on the 13th August last, before the bil l was in troduced, a deputation from that body waited upon me, and an interesting discussion took place which was reported i i the press at that time. This is an extract from that reportMr Latham asked if they regarded it as a On page 3 of principle that either side in industry should be at liberty to disregard any provision in an award which it regarded as objectionable. Mr Latham asked if they said the unions sliould be at liberty to disregard awards that broke down established principles which the union regarded as vital. Mr Latham said if that were so the employers must be allowed the same degree of liberty. No system of regulation of wages and conditions could operate under a limitation of that kind. I repeat that statement. If awards are to be effective, they must bind both sides, and it is impossible for those on either side to make an exception in favour of vital principles determined by themselves from time to time. There are certain, well-recognized and vital principles of trade unionism with which this bill not only does not interfere, but which it indeed recognizes and supports. The primary principles of No direct answer has trade unionism are first, the right of association for industrial purposes-the right of the workers to band together in their own industrial interests, which is supported and promoted by our whole arbitration system-and secondly, the right of collective bargaining-the right I am quite prepared of unions to deal on behalf of their members with employers or auy other authority controlling wages and conditions. Those are the fundamental rights of trade unionism, upon which all I stand by the declarathe others depend. They are the rights for which the representatives of the workers have fought for so many years. T h a t interjection They have been obtained, and are now conserved in our legislation; not only I have answered it . I are they recognized, but their assertion is facilitated by the law of Australia. The sixth object of the Arbitration Act isTo facilitate and encourage the organization of representative bodies of employers and of employees, and the submission of industrial disputes to the court by organizations, and to permit representative bodies of employers and of employees to be declared organizations for the purposes of this act. In other words, the act is, in fact, founded upon the basis of trade unionism and its continuance; without trade unionism it is quite impossible for this legislation to function.",26,Latham

At the close of the deputation to which I have referred, I put a number of questions to the members of it. They asked me whether I was prepared to reduce those questions to writing, and I did so. The first question for which I asked consideration by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which claimed to represent all the trade unions of Australia, concerned"" the retention or the abolition of penalties on lockouts and strikes."" at the time whether it was in favour of abolishing strike penalties, and the answer was in the affirmative. I replied, "" Of course, you recognize that that would involve the abolition of lockout penalties."" To that they said, ""We should like to think it over:"" On the 30th September last, after I had written to ask whether the council had anything to say in reference to the four matters upon which I asked it to express an opinion, the secretary, Mr Crofts, wroteIn answer to your letter of the 17th instant, provisions which have been incorporated relative to the questions submitted by the Federal Attorney-General, Mr Latham, bearing on the industrial peace, I am to say that in reply to question No. 1-questio n of the retention or the abolition of penalties on lockouts and strikes-it has been decided to obtain the opinion of all unions interested in Arbitration Court proceedings. That is the last that I have heard from them on the subject. I have heard from the council on various other questions, but I have not had an answer to the question, ""Are the trade unions of Australia in favour of the abolition of penalties on strikes and lockouts ?"" There is a very good reason for that. The trade unionists recognize that the penalties on lockouts are remarkably effective, and they also recognize, too, that while the strike penalty may be an easy subject to speak about on the platform, especially before an ill-informed audience, the basis of the whole system upon which the Arbitration Court works is that strikes and lockouts are prohibited by law. Honourable members may take it that the trade union movement of Australia, whatever some speakers may say now and again to the contrary, is not prepared to declare in favour of abolishing strike penalties. It is difficult to believe thac in relation to arbitration some of the leaders of the trade unions really represent the rank and file, and in this connection I mention one of the most important trade unions of Australia, the Australian Railways Union. During last week quite a number of honourable members were waited upon by, or received a letter from, Mr Keane, the secretary of that union, strongly urging the retention of State instrumentalities within the scope of the federal arbitration law. Mr Keane, in giving evidence before the royal commisI asked the deputation sion on the Constitution, strongly urged the right of Australian railway employees to lodge plaints in, and obtain awards from, the Federal Arbitration Court. From this it would appear that the Australian Railways Union is very anxious to maintain its position with the court. Yet, judging by a matter to which I shall presently refer, it would appear that the officials of the union do not in all things represent the views of its members, who at the last annual meeting authorized the lodging of six new plaints with the Arbitration Court. There are in this measure at the direct request of the Australian Railways Union to meet the particular situations which arise in relation to the hearing of their claims. they? of the bill, and provide for extending the power to refer matters to a deputy president. On the 14th July last the press published some resolutions passed by the council of the Australian Railways Union, the text of which I shall quote, and then ask honourable members to compare those resolutions with what I have just said about the expressed desire of the chief executive officer of the union to allow State instrumentalities to remain within the jurisdiction of the court. One resolution readsThat the perpetuation of arbitration is to the detriment of the organized workers of the Commonwealth, and Australian Railways Union workers in particular, and, with a view to bringing about some measure of social justice, that the efforts of the Australian council be directed towards placing before members their real economic position.",28,Latham
78,Mr J. Fbancis,What provisions are,29,Latham
79,Mr Latham,"They are at the endAnother readsThat, with a view to uniform propaganda in relation to collective effort on the part of the working class in opposition to the chloroforming effects of arbitration courts and other wage-fixing tribunals, a committee of three be appointed to prepare and disseminate such propaganda. Those resolutions are followed by others dealing with such niatters as the elimination of the capitalist state, and the control .of industry by the workers. It would appear, therefore, that in the matter of arbitration these alleged leaders do not really represent the views of their supposed followers. The trade unionists of Australia, as a whole, approve of the arbitration system, and do not agree that it is to the detriment of organized workers of the Commonwealth. When Mr Keane waited upon me, he asked me to include in the bill the provisions to which I have referred. I asked him if he would be good enough to send me a copy of the resolutions which had been passed, and which I had seen in the press. As I have Mr Keane's letter with me, forwarding to me a copy of the resolution referring to the perpetuation of arbitration being to the detriment of the organized workers of the Commonwealth, there can be no doubt as to the authenticity .of what I have read. This is clearly a case in which men who happen to be in charge of a big union do not represent the views of its members. I believe that trade unions as a whole are prepared to accept arbitration and its logical implications provided for in the principal act and in this bill. The principle of our arbitration legislation is the prevention of strikes and lockouts, but in addition to providing means for the prevention and settlement of disputes, our legislation has also provided penalties for those responsible for strikes and lockouts. It would be possible to have an arbitration system without the power to impose penalties, on those responsible for strikes and lockouts, but so far as can be discovered neither side wishes these penalties to be removed. In Australia to-day employers and employees are unfortunately divided into two hostile camps, not universally, but too frequently,entitled to the benefit of an award may apply and they are engaged in contests on either the legal or the industrial plane. As to the contests upou the legal plane we might application. Afr. Latham. just as well recognize the facts without pretence or cant. The penalties that can be imposed on employers for a lockout are very effective; but those that can be imposed upon organizations are largely ineffective. Personally I can not see the justice of taking proceedings against a private member of a union for doing something which it was known he was compelled to do; but the omcers of an organization are in a different position. How can a case of job control or a sectional strike, when one employer out of a number is separately attacked, be dealt with under the present act ? The imposition of penalties is quite ineffective as against large numbers of private individuals who are members of a union; but if the evidence justifies it, penalties should be enforced against an organization or its officers. As the remedies now provided in the principal act are often ineffective, clause 7 has been drafted to cover these cases. In addition to the penalties provided by the act, there is the cancellation of an award or the deregistration of an organization. In some cases all these are quite ineffective. Clause7 therefore provides that where other methods are found ineffective the employers may approach the court for a declaration that a strike exists, so that their hands may be freed and they may be able to fight on the industrial plane by means of a lockout to the extent permitted by the court. Self help may be allowed, under the control of the court, in cases where the other side is already breaking the law. I invite honourable members' attention to the fact that in making a declaration the court has discretionary power. Some honourable members seem to be under the impression that the clause means that whenever there is a strike there must be a lockout or vice versa; but if honourable members will refer to the clause they will see that the word "" may "" and not "" shall"" is used in each of the first four sub-sections of the proposed new sub-section. The power is purely permissive or discretionary. The proposed new section sets out that(1) Any person or organization bound by or to the court for an order to be served on persons interested. . . . (2) The court may require notice of' any (3) Where a declaration is made under this section the court may make an order: . ' . . (4) The court may at any time revoke a declaration. . . . The intention-and the words express the intention-is to vest a discretion in the court, and not to make its action merely automatic. In some cases the only way to deal effectively with a dispute in which one party is breaking the law is to restore freedom to the other side. If that is done, many disputes which, under present conditions last for some time, will be settled in their early stages. Employers know that although they are unable to counteract job control by any form of lockout, job control is itself an illegal strike. There is every reason, therefore, for equipping the court with power to restore this measure of freedom to one side when the other side is deliberately breaking the law. Under present conditions such freedom cannot be exercised. This provision is, of course, limited to the industry in which the dispute is in progress. Some honourable members have spoken as though there will be power under this provision to cause a general lockout or a general strike. That is not the case. The words are quite clear on that point. A good deal of misunderstanding has occurred as to the meaning of clause 48, which amends section 60 of the principal act, which deals with the position of a deregistered union. In my second-reading speech I explained that at present the legal status of a deregistered union is obscure. I repeat that to-day no one is able to say with certainty whether a de-registered union exists as a corporation or not. It is desirable to clear this up, and for that reason this new provision is introduced. Much misapprehension has occurred through the use of the word ""dissolution "" at the beginning of proposed new sub-section 6, of section 60 of the act. I point out that an ordinary trade union prior to registration is called an association. ""Wheni t becomes registered it is called an organization. Under section 58 of the act an organization is a corppration. A corporation is an artificial legal person above and beyond the natural legal persons of which it consists. When a corporation is dissolved it ceases to exist as an artificial legal person, and the natural persons who constituted it become merely an association of individuals. The object of clause 48 is to provide that an organization so de-registered shall no longer be a corporation by reason of anything contained in the act, but shall return to the status of a voluntary association. In order to clear up misapprehensions that have arisen in respect to the meaning of proposed new subsection 6 of section 60,1 propose, in committee, to move that it be' omitted with a view to insert the following:Upon cancellation of the registration of an organization, the organization shall cease to be an organization and a corporation under this act, but shall not by reason of the cancellation cease to be an association. The property of the organization shall, subject to any order which the court may make with respect to the satisfaction of the debts and obligations of the Organization out of that property, be the property of the association, and shall be held and applied for the purposes of the association in accordance with the constitution and rules of tlit. organization in so far as they can be carried out or observed notwithstanding tlie deregistration of the organization. This bill deals not only with the matters to which I have already referred, but also with our general conciliation policy. It contains provisions which, if agreed to, will considerably extend the scope and methods of industrialconciliation in Australia. Very little attention was paid during the debate to this aspect of the measure, although quite a number of honourable members spoke of the desirability of our having more conciliation and less arbitration in industry. That is one of the objects of the bill. Some honourable members have suggested that the Industrial Peace Act provides a better scheme for the control of industry than the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and have advocated the appointment of shop committees and local bodies with power to deal with disputes on the spot. That is provided for in our existing legislation. In addition to the judges of the court, there is a conciliation commissioner. To substitute the Industrial Peace Act for the Conciliation and Arbitration Act would, I am sure, lead to unintended and unexpected results. It must never be forgotten that the power of the Commonwealth over industry is limited to dealing with interstate industrial disputes. If the Industrial Peace Act were applied to industry generally, it would break down, for if the representatives of either side on a tribunal constituted under it were to absent themselves from the meetings, the tribunal could not function. In the coal industry, and in some of the callings associated with mining generally, tribunals have been set up composed of an equal number of employers and employees; with a chairman chosen by the Government. This method of dealing with industrial affairs has been practicable hitherto only because both sides have been content with the determinations which have been made from time to time. It only occasionally happens that these disputes are of an interstate character. Buti f a board of this description were set up to deal with an interstate dispute, and its decision was subsequently challenged, serious results would follow. The great majority of the decisions which have so far been given by such boards might be declared invalid. On the one occasion on which it was overruled such a determination was challenged. To introduce such a system with the object of settling interstate industrial disputes would be most unwise, for it would have far-reaching consequences of a totally unexpected nature. The chairman of such a tribunal really decides all questions which come before it upon which there is a difference of any such memorandum if it is of opinion that opinion between the employers and the employees. To apply the system generally to industrial disputes would involve appointment by the Government of a chairman as arbitrator for every industry in the Commonwealth. That, on the face of it, would be impracticable on a continental scale. The scheme involves considerable difficulties, even when confined to separate States. The wages board system of Victoria has in many cases worked very well, but it would break down if it were applied to industry all over the Commonwealth. Honourable members should never forget that this Parliament is labouring under severe constitutional restrictions. were not so, it would be possible for us to deal with the subjects which come before us in a very different way. We have to do the best that we can within the limits of our Constitution; and under the powers conferred upon us we can only deal with interstate disputes. ilr. Latham. One of the objects of this bill is to overcome the difficulties caused by the overlapping of Commonwealth and State awards. It is desirable to have one source ofindustrial regulation in the case of each single industry. A number of provisions in the bill are designed to achieve that end. I shall invite the attention of honourable members to these when we reach the committee stage. I shall also when the bill is in committee, deal with a number of suggestions which have been made for the appointment of arbitrators, boards of reference, inspectors and so on. Proposed new section 25D, has provoked a considerable amount of discussion. It readsThe court shall, before making any award or certifying any agreement, and in proceedings for the variation or cancellation ' of an award or agreement, take into consideration the probable economic eifect of the agreement or award in relation to the community in general and the probable economic effect thereof upon the industry or industries concerned. Honourable members should read this clause in conjunction with the proposed addition to sub-section 1, of section 24 of the principal. act. This is contained in clause 21 of the bill and is as follows:Provided that the court may refuse to certify the agreement is not in settlement of an industrial dispute or contains clauses which the court has no power to insert in awards, or that it is not in the public interest that it should be certified. These provisions have been criticized upon the ground that they strike a blow at the principle of the basic or living wage, in that they direct the court to reduce the living wage if it is of the opinion that an industry cannot afford to pay it. Nothing of the kind is intended. I have been surprised that some honourable members appear to be of the opinion that the principle of the basic wage is not economically justified. The Government, and I as a member of it, If it regard the principle as economically sound and this is the view of the Arbitration Court. A living wage properly determined, is a minimum wage which, to give a concise abridgment of the language of the court, provides for the support of an employee in accordance with the standards of a human being entitled to live as tbe head of a family under decent conditions in a civilized community. The provision of such a wage is not only ethically just, but economically sound. Indeed, upon any view which looks beyond to-morrow, it is economically necessary. The payment of a properly fixed living wage merely complies with the minimum requirements of civilization as we understand it . A most interesting and informative book was published recently, entitled A Study of the M in i m um Wage, by J . H . Richardson. In it the author, having stated his conclusion that the best basis for the fixation of minimum wages appears to be the capacity of industry in general to pay them, says-the passage is to be found on page 69This conclusion is in agreement with that reached in the chapter on the living wage, namely, that at the basis of tlie wage system there should be a minimum wage determined by the general productivity of the community as a whole without taking account of the prosperity of individual establishments or industries. The result of fixing a minimum wage, he j u s t i fy its existence. considers, would beAs a consequence of this a number of ""the proved to be in that position, it is the least efficient workers might lose their emduty of the community to take steps to ployment, certain inefficient employers be make it possible for it to pay a living forced out of business, and a few sweated inwage.

Referring to necessarily be preserved. the South Australian definition of a livin g wage His Honour is reported in the South Australian Industrial Returns. volume 1, 1916-1S, page 122, as having saidThe statutory definition of the living wage is a wage adequate to meet the normal and reasonable needs of the worker. In other words, the conception is ethical rather than economic. The court has not to determine the value of the services rendered, but to determine what is necessary to meet normal and reasonable needs. It should be obvious that in the interpretation of reasonable needs the court cannot be wholly indifferent to the national income. The reasonable needs of the worker in a community where the national income is high are greater than the reasonable needs of the worker where the national income is low. Buti t is not a valid objection to a general basic wage that a particular employer cannot pay it , or even that a particular' industry caunot pay it . Human values are greater than material values, though it must be recognized that human welfare is conditioned by economic facts. An industry that cannot, under proper conditions, pay a decent living wage cannot If an industry which is necessary to the community is basic wage having been fixed for unskilled labour, higher wages must be paid for In the absence of a sufficient supply of skilled workers, inA general basic wage must quent great f a l l in the general standard and, indeed, necessitate the But other principles come into consideration when we approach subjects other than wages, such as the hours and conditions of labour, piecework, bonus work, travelling time, and other allowances additional to normal wages. In these matters, when f u l l weight bas been given to considerations of health and sanitation, it is proper to consider the economic circumstances affecting the industry concerned, and the relation of the industry to the community as a whole. Suppose that a claim is made for a based, not upon reasons relating to health, but upon other reasons. Such a* claim may, therefore, properly be considered upon strictly economic grounds in the narrowest sense, to determine whether the specific industry to be affected can or cannot afford to give its workers full wages for a 40-hour week. Again, in an industry which has provided a basic wage and proper margins for skill, and whose conditions satisfy all requirements of health and sanitation, if a demand is made for additional payment for travelling time, or for a substantial reduction of hours, that demand should be dealt with in relation to the position of the industry and of the community. The present practice of the Arbitration Court concerning the basic wage, and the fixing of margins for skill, is in accord with the principles that I have outlined. The practice of the Arbitration Court in relation to the basic wage may be summed up in three propositions, of which the first is that it must be sufficient to provide for the normal needs of the average employee regarded as a human being living in a civilized community. The next is that the basic wage so fixed varies with the cost of living. Lastly, the basic wage should, as a practically universal rule, be paid by all employers whether prosperous or not. In 1909 Mr Justice Higgins, in deciding a case, saidFirst of all, is an employer who is poor to In the case of the Amalgamated Engibe -ordered to pay as high wages as an emneering Union v. Adams and others, in ployer who is rich? Now without laying down a rule absolute and unconditional under all 1924, the then President of the Arbitracircumstances, I strongly hold the view that, tion Court made the following pronounceunless the circumstances are very exceptional, ment :the needy employer should, under an award, pay at the same rate as his richer rival. It would not otherwise be possible to prevent the sweating of employees, the growth of parasitic Mr Latham. industries, the spread of industrial unrestunrest which it is the function of this court to allay. If a man cannot maintain his enterprise without cutting down the wages which are proper to be paid to his employees-a. t all events the wages which are essential for their living-it would be better that he should abandon the enterprise. The bill does uot interfere with these principles. They are sound economically and sound socially. But apparently some honourable members appear to doubt that the basic wage is in principle economically sound. On that point, the Govern40-hour week and that it is ment has no doubt at all. We are, however, determined to remove any uncertainty about our position in relation to this matter. Therefore, in committee, I shall propose the insertion after proposed new section 25D, of this provisoProvided that this section shall not affect the practice of the court in fixing the basic wage. There remains to be discussed the other subject to which I have referred; hours and conditions of labour regarded apart from the requirements of health and sanitation. Upon this subject an opinion is held in some quarters with which the Government does not agree, and for that reason proposed new section 25D has been included in the bill. The view has been expressed, even in the court itseK, that the court is not concerned with economic possibilities in relation to these matters; that the court should award such hours and conditions as it may think proper, leaving it to Parliament to make it possible for industry to comply with the awards. But a result of the application of that principle to conditions of employment is that Parliament may be forced to give assistance to an industry, in the form of bounties or customs protection, in order to make it possible for the industry-no t to pay the basic wage or margin for skill -bu t to provide conditions as to hours and other matters which have been fixed by the court without regard to the economic condition of the industry. Parliament must, in my opinion, be left to protect industries from overseas competition to the extent and in the way it thinks advisable, to enable them to pay wages according to the Australian standard. Parliament has already appointed the Taritf Board to ascertain how far further protection is necessary to enable industries to be carried on profitably under Australian rates and standard hours, and to recommend' to Parliament what it considers necessary for that purpose. The court's duty, in my opinion, is to fix fair wages and fair conditions for the work to be done by members of unions in Australian industries. The court w i ll not, therefore, in this case, fix any hours solely on the ground that the employers claim that the industries are not sufficiently protected to enable them to carry on profitably. Neither will the court in this case fix any lower basic wage or margin than it would if all the industries were paying good dividends, and on the ground that the respondents claim that the manufacturing portion of the industry cannot compete with the overseas competition without further protection. That must be proved to Parliament-no t to this court. order. I draw your attention, Mr moreover, not supported by humanitarian Speaker, to the fact that you are permitting the honourable gentleman to do something that would be objected to if done by honourable members on this side of the chamber. He is not making a speech; he is reading a lecture. Groom) -The Standing Orders provide that an honourable member may not read a speech; but it has not been customary to enforce this rule strictly, and on both sides honourable members have been given some latitude in the matter. As in the present case, they have been permitted to refresh their memory, by referring to notes which they have prepared. was not reading a prepared speech: I was quoting an extract from a judgment. That pronouncement means that the court is to make its award independently of economic considerations, and to leave it to Parliament to alter economic conditions, if necessary, to fit the award. It is proposed to change the practice of the court in relation to these matters by the provision of proposed new section 25D. The view of the Government is that, subject to the provision of a basic wage, with the provision of margins for skill which are necessarily involved, and attention to considerations of health and sanitation, the court should make its awards within the limits of existing economic possibilities. After the award has been made, it will be for Parliament to determine whether it is desirable to make provision whereby the industry shall pay higher wages or give better conditions. These are essentially problems of economic policy which should be determined, not by a court, bid by the representatives of the people ir Parliament. Moreover, the represents tives of the people should be unconstrained, so far as is possible, by any awards of the court in determining these matters. Un to the present the maintenance of a fair basic wage and the preservation of a margin for skill have presented no economic difficulty; but the other matters to which I have referred ought to be regarded in their relation to the economic capacity of the industry aud of the community as a whole. Unless that is done, an artificial and unreal standard will be set upa standard, or social considerations. What is the alternative to the view which the Government commends to the House? In its report on the iron and steel industry, the Tariff Board pointed out that the measure of customs protection was determined largely by the gap between Australian wages and those, paid by our oversea competitors; that that gap was necessarily widened by any advance in Australian wages or conditions made without reference to the economic capacity of the industry concerned; and that further demands for protection inevitably followed the granting of higher wages, which, when conceded, resulted in further applications being made for still higher wages and better conditions. The board stated that while manufacturers and merchants engaged in the iron and steel industry had undertaken not to make any advance in prices, the industrial unions had given no assurance that they would not apply for increased wages. I propose to read from the report of the Tariff BoardThe Tariff Board desires to place on record in this report its firm conviction that without some such assurances from the industrial unions to this effect, the granting of the recommendations the Tariff Board is making will in a l l probability be of no avail to the industry, and w ill simply result in a still wider wages gap, and an ultimate paralysis of the industry. The board desires to make clear that it does not reflect in any way in",29,Latham

82,Mr Latham,"When interrupted, Ithis statement on the high standard of wages maintained in Australia; rather as Australians it takes pride in such, hut it has considered it a duty to point out without possibility of misinterpretation its opinion as to the inevitable trend of concessions granted without consideration for the capabilities of the various industries, and the conditions existing overseas. The Government considers that it would be lacking in a sense of responsibility if it failed to pay heed to these obligations and to the facts which lie behind them. The policy to be adopted in economic matters should be determined by this Parliament, not by the court. Any other course threatens disaster to our present Australian standards, which we are anxious not only to maintain, but also to improve. Parliament is asked to give a legislative indication to the court that, subject to the preservation of the principle of a basic wage, which involves the retention of a.margin for skill, the court should take into consideration economic facts when making its awards or when dealing with agreements submitted to it. We have only to consider for a moment what might take place in our transport industries to realize the necessity for a provision of this nature. within Australia is free from foreign competition. The conditions in the transport industry are of the greatest significance to all other industries. be possible for employers and employees in the transport industry to combine together in such a way as to leave only the poorest profits to all other industries together with high prices to the community as a whole. not be made a means to such an end. The possibility I have mentioned illustrates the principle contained in the proposed new section, 25D, and the new proviso to section 24 [Extension of time granted.] Eor the reasons I have mentioned, it is proposed to indicate to the court that it shall expressly consider the public interest iu making its awards, certifying agreements, and determining questions relating to the variation or the cancellation of awards. Some honourable members have suggested that a reference to economic considerations or the public interest is too vague to be embodied in a statute. that provisions of this character already Mr Latham. appear in the existing act. The definition of "" industrial matters "" concludesand includes all questions of what is fair and! right in relation to any industrial matter, having regard to the interest of the person, immediately concerned and of societv as a whole. That is the principle which the Goveniment desires to express in the most explicit terms in relation to the particular matters with which the proposed new sections 24 and 25n deal. Another matter to which a good deal of time has been devoted during this debate is the provision in the bill for the taking of a secret ballot. Apparently, all honourable members agree that the secret ballot is sound in principle, and that there are many matters in connection with industrial organizations which their members should determine by means of a secret ballot. The rules of every industrial organization are filed in the Arbitration Oourt. At my direction the officers of the court searched those files, and succeeded in finding that only seven unions provide expressly for a secret ballot. I "" do not suggest that secret ballots are not taken by the other unions; but there are, so far as can be discovered, Transport no general provisions in their rules for the taking of secret ballots. It would the power to take a secret ballot. members appear to agree that the principle of a secret ballot is sound, there are some who appear to believe that it is a bad thing that the Government has disThe court should covered that principle, and embodied it in this measure. the view expressed by honourable members on this side. by honourable members opposite was not directed against the principle of the secret ballot, but against the machinery proposed to give effect to that principle. This matter is, therefore, essentially one for consideration in committee. I wish to make it clear that the bill does not enable the Government to force a union to take a secret ballot; it enables the members of a union to make application I remind them to a judge of the court to direct the union to take a secret ballot.

86,Mr Latham,"The criticism offeredafter the court has considered the application thus made to it, and decided that the application affects a matter which is of substantial importance to the union, that its members are given the opportunity of expressing their views by means of a secret ballot. It is difficult to see what objection in principle can be raised to that provision, although honourable members doubtless will make suggestions for improving the machinery for the holding of such ballots. The Government is satisfied that these provisions have the support of the community as a whole, including the great majority of trade unionists, who have no objection to their right to manage their own affairs being secured to them by a Commonwealth statute. In conclusion, I desire to refer to the penalties provided for certain offences. In some quarters strong exception has been taken to the penalties said to be contained in the bill, whereas many of them are contained in the principal act, and have been in force for many years. It ia unfortunate that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Blakeley), the honourable member for Beid( Mr Coleman), as well as the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) with all his experience, should have stated that penalties which have existed since 1904 are to be imposed by this bill. man claimed that they had been remitted. of the Opposition ( Mr Blakeley) said in an article published under his name that this bill introduces a penalty of £1,000 for the commission of a strike. That is not so. It is true that both the existing legislation and this measure contain provisions which are obnoxious to certain persons; but no law-abiding union or trade unionist need fear them. Some of the misstatements on the subject of penalties have been most extravagant. I desire to refer again to the official publication of the Australian Labour party and. the Trades and Labour Council of New South Wales, in which, under the heading "" Savage Penalties,"" the following passage appears, on page 9:Careful note should be taken of the savage penalties which are attached to almost every clause of this infamous bill. These penalties the'working conditions in/any industry, it range up to £1,000 and various terms of imprisonment. I remind honourable members that the provision for a penalty of £1,000 is contained in section 6 of the act passed in 1904, and that, although since that time the Labour party has been in power in the Oommonwealth more than once, no attempt has been made to repeal it. The publication referred to states furtherThe following are a few of the many penalties which it will impose. Then follow eleven examples of penalties which, it is stated, may be imposed under the provisions of this bill; but unfortunately for the case put by the organization responsible for the pamphlet, only two are correctly stated. A ll the others are inaccurate, either in whole or in part. This is the sort of propaganda which is being indulged in by the Australian Labour party in New South Wales. Does the Opposition agree with it or not? Let us consider some of the new offences which are provided for by the bill, and see to what extent they constitute au "" in vasion,"" to use the phrase employed by the honourable member for Beid, of the privileges of trade unionists. Proposed new section 86A providesNo person shall(a) by violence to tlie person or property of another person; (ft) by any threats; (c) by any pecuniary penalty or in j u r y ; (d) by intimidation of' any kind to whomsoever directed; (e) by abusive or insulting language; ( f ) by declaring or joining with other persons in declaring goods or -places or persons or undertakings or positions "" b l a c k "" ; or ((/) by any other form of boycott or threat of boycott-preven t or endeavour to prevent any person from offering or accepting employment or working in accordance with the terms of an award or order of the court. Has it ever been pretended that hitherto it has been the privilege of trade unionists to prevent by violence, intimidation or threat any person from working in accordance with an award or order of the court? I still have to meet the trade unionist who is prepared seriously to argue that this proposed new sub-section takes away any of his privileges. The inclusion of this new section is absolutely justifiable in every particular. If Parliament sets up a court to determine surely is also the duty of Parliament to",36,Latham

109,Mr Killen (Riverina) [5.25],"Ithe end of the committee stage. My proposal is as follows:After clause 3, insert the following new clause:3A. Section4 of the principal act is amended by inserting in the definition of industrial matters after the word "" includes second occurring, the words ""piece-work, payment by results, and similar systems of payment."" AmI in order in speaking to that now ? The honourable member may move only one amendment at a time. The honourable member may move a new clause after the consideration of clauses and postponed clauses has been completed. Clause agreed to. Clause4 (Penalty for lockout or strike). Clause4 amends section 6 of the act, which deals with the penalty for a strike or lockout. In his reply to the second reading debate, the Attorney-General was at great pains to explain that the only effect' of this clause was to reduce the penalties which might be imposed on unionists. I differ from the Attorney General. Section6 of the act provides for a penalty of £1,000 against an organization in the case of an illegal strike or lockout, but in the bill there is a differentiation between organizations and individuals. The penalty in the case of an organization is still £1,000, but the bill provides for a reduction of the penalty to £50 in the case of an individual worker. ganization or an employer is £1,000. The honourable member has stated the position wrongly. that in the case of "" any other person "" the penalty shall be £50. The Attorney General tried to lead the House to believe that the penalty clause in relation to strikes and lockouts had not been altered to the disadvantage of unionists. I call the honourable gentleman's attention to the fact that in this bill there is a wider definition of a strike, or rather that which may be termed a strike. tion of a strike in the bill. finition in the bill, but clause 8 widens the area of the definition given in section 8 of the principal act. That section defines those things which may be described as a strike or lockout, and this clause widens the scope of that definition. ber reads section 6, he will see that the offence is not a strike, but the doing of "" anything in the nature of a lockout or strike"" so that there is nothing in the nature of an extension. able gentleman, reads clause 8, he will see that, for the purposes of this section, an organization will be "" deemed to have ordered, encouraged, advised or incited its members to refuse to offer or accept employment"" if certain things are done. Those things apply to the definition of an industrial dispute, and to actions which may be construed as "" doing something in the nature of "" a strike. This wider definition of what constitutes an offence against the strike clause will bring in a vast number of people never contemplated in the original act. ginal act deals only with organizations, and any amendment of that section can deal only with organizations. that section is amended so as to cover the acts of "" a member of the committee of management."" An organization is thus to be liable to a penalty of £1,000 for the act of an individual. Hitherto that has not been the case. statement as to the effect of clause 8 is inaccurate. A.n organization was previously liable for the act of an individual, if he was an officer of the organization, and it will still be liable for the act of an individual if he is an officer, but not otherwise. 6, the organization would not have been liable to a penalty of £1,000 for the action of an individual member of a committee of management. It could not have been adjudged guilty of .an offence under that section because a member of its committee of management had encouraged or incited members of the organization to strike. clause 8 necessary?",39,Paibs

In such a case the sponsibility of an organization that orders its members to refuse to offer or accept employment. Sub-section 2 of section 8 is proposed to be deleted, and a new subsection is to be inserted, the effect of which will be to hold an organization liable to a penalty of £1,000 if even a solitary act of an officer or a member of a committee of management could be construed into being "" something in the nature of "" a strike, or if he could be regarded as counselling a strike. That is the point that the Attorney-General has not made clear. It is true that the proposed new sub-section 3, of section 8, provides that where the court is satisfied that, after the commission of an offence to which this section applies, the organization or branch has bona fide removed from any office or position held by them, and, where they are members of the organization, has expelled from the organization the persons by reason of whose acts the organization has been found guilty of the offence, the maxisuch tremendous disciplinary control over mum penalty which may be imposed on the organization in respect of that offence shall be £100. But there will still be a penalty applicable to the organization for an act committed by an officer or a member of a committee of management over whom the organization as a whole may or may not have control. about getting control. honourable member to suggest that the unions take dictatorial powers and act as autocrats; but it is not an easy matter for a union to put such powers into practice. Let me cite a case that may serve as an example. Take a federated organization, say, the ""Waterside Workers Association, which seems to be held up to execration by honourable members opposite. That body has branches in nearly all ports in Australia, and those branches are more or less loosely bound together by the federation. That system of organization does not repose complete and autocratic powers in the hands of the central committee; no organization in Australia can confer that power on such a committee. Assume that some member of a branch committee, possibly in Tasmania, Western Australia, or Queensland, advises or incites men not to accept employment in an industry in whole organization would be liable to the penalty of £1,000 provided under section 6. that man. him it would still be liable to a penalty of £100, and, if it re-admitted him within a' certain period to the organization after having expelled him, it would be liable to the original penalty of £1,000. That is not a rational mode of disciplining a union. It would not add to the power of the Government or the prestige of the court in upholding the principle of arbitration""; but rather would it bring the arbitration law into ridicule and contempt. Cases can be cited where the responsible officers of unions do their level best to help carry on industry in a peaceable way, and honorably observe the awards. . But it would be impossible for them to exercise individual members as to be answerable for every act of every member of a committee of management or other officers of the organization. Yet the Attorney General requires that an organization making default in this respect shall, for the individual acts of a member of a committee of management be liable to the heavy penalty provided. The Australian Workers Union has 140,000 members distributed throughout Australia. Its officers and members of committees of management number thousands. Is that organization to be threatened with penalties amounting to £1,000 for the act of every individual officer who may advise members of the union against acceptance of employment under terms of an award ? That is an absurd penalty to provide against an organization, and that is why the bill is so objectionable to the unions. honourable member place the responsibility, and how would he do it? the responsible bodies should carry it.

I have referred to clause 8 only because of the bearing it has upon the clause under discussion, and because it introduces the new words "" doing something in the nature of "" a lockout or strike. Some of the acts against which penalties are provided are not acts that can be construed as strikes or lockouts except by applying legal definitions. For instance, an officer of a union who counsels a body of men against accepting employment is not, according to the ordinary interpretaclause. It deals with one thing, and with tion of words, doing something in the nature of a lockout or strike. But the Attorney-General proposes that those words shall be construed in that way. the law. seems to be emphasizing it in this case, for some reason or other, just as the ostensible reduction of the penalty in the case of individuals is likely to be more harsh to individuals than was the original penalty which was not enforceable. score on that matter. He tried to make out that in that case he had been generous, and had actually reduced the penalty. would admit that his intention was not to reduce it, but to make the enforcement of the law more effective by Pplying a penalty where no penalty a was previously applicable. That, I think, penalty. How many times has the fine of £1,000 .been enforced against the individual since the passing of the act in 1904? Can any such case be cited? Actions have been taken to enforce penalties against individuals; but no honourable member can recall a case where action has been taken against an where the individual was concerned in a thinks that a £50 penalty against the individual can be more easily applied than a £1,000 penalty. Therefore he widens the area of application in order to rope in all those to whom he thinks the punishment can be applied. He intends to use those who may be concerned in industrial disputes-agains t all those who may offend the Government's sense of propriety.

It reduces the strike penalty from £1,000 to £50 in the case of members of trade unions. That is all that the clause does, and the only point that arises in connection with it is whether the strike penalty should be left at £1,000 in the case of employees, or whether, on the other hand, it should be reduced to £50. The honourable member is opposed to the reduction. But I recommend it to the committee, because it appears to me to be a fair proposal. The observations of the honourable member have been entirely directed to clause 8. The Attorney-General tried to which we shall have an opportunity of considering when we reach it. At the present time, however, all we have to decide is the amount of the penalty.

General explain what is meant by the words "" any other person,"" as distinct from "" an organization or employer "" ? to a member of an employees' organizationa worker-as distinct from an employer or an organization, being either anemployers' or employees' organization. quite true that this clause, on paper, reduces the fine in the case of an individual Attorney-General intends to try, at the committee stage, to do what was done during the second-reading debate by the Prime Minister, who endeavoured to prove that the bill actually reduced the penalties that may be inflicted upon the workers of this country, then he is using an argument which would be better received by a body of people not so intelligent as are the members of this committee. scope of the penalties. Labour party cannot oppose this clause, because, on paper, it does reduce the penalties to the individual, but we are entitled to refer to other clauses, which show that this measure provides not for a reduction, but actually for an increase in the number of offences with which an individual may be charged. The original act provided a penalty of £1,000 in the case of an individual or an organization concerned; but this measure provides for a penalty of £1,000 in respect of an organization and £50 in the case of an individual worker proceeded against under section 6. The magnanimity and the generosity of the Government in proposing not to extract £1,000 from any working man is certainly wonderful, but how could that sum be collected? party leave the original penalty in the office. I congratulate the Attorneyact? was liable to a fine of £1,000 meant little. It meant no more than a fine of £50 as is now proposed. This provision is evidently to be rigorously enforced in the future, and it shows the frame of mind of its sponsors. I do not now wish the Attorneyto debate clause 8, because that can be debated when we reach it ; but it is only fair that I should refer to it if only to show that the scope of the offences is to be extended and particularly those relating to organizations. The original penalty is to stand, but it is proposed to include in the act an infinitely larger number of offences than it is possible for an organization to commit. I propose to direct my criticism to the extension of offences, and when clause 8 is under consideration we worker; but if the shall fight every line of it right up to a division. We do not intend to oppose clause 4, not that we think it does any good, but subsequent clauses are certainly harmful. right that honourable members should discuss this clause, if only to make clear to the public that, so far as the proposed amendments to the Arbitration Act are concerned, the statements that have been constantly made outside this chamber, that increased penalties are provided, have no foundation. Section6 of the act provides that any person who commits an offence under its provisions, whether it be in connection with a strike or lockout, is liable to a penalty of £1,000. I understand that that is the maximum penalty only. been provided in our legislation for the last twenty years. During that time there have been strikes and lockouts, and I know of no instance in which an organization, either of employers or employees, has been mulcted. There have been instances of individuals being fined. In one case a man named Walsh was fined £100, but, according to the press, no attempt was made to collect it.

I do not know whether the Attorney General or the Court should take action. At present a small organization or section of it can prevent the trade and commerce of this country from being carried on. We know perfectly well that if the shipping company concerned in the present dispute employed a non-unionist as a cook, the trouble would extend throughout Australia. I wish to make it clear that penalties have been provided in the act for the last twenty years, but little effect has been given to them. If the act continues to operate in this country, I hope that the Government will insist upon its provisions being observed. To me it is absurd that one small coterie should be able to do grave injury to the trade and commerce of this country. An immense bill of costs is amounting up because of the obstruction of industry, and it must ultimately be met by the people of this country. the penalties make a difference? it will. I have no faith in the Arbitration Court, but I wish to feel satisfied, when providing these penalties, that efforts will be made to compel the employer and employee coming within the scope of the act, to abide by the decisions of the Arbitration Court. derstand that the object of the bill is to cure all the ills of this country that result from lockouts and strikes; that it is necessary to reduce the evil so far as possible, and that this Government is seeking to counteract that evil by reducing, as it alleges, the penalties imposed for offences against the act. Let us examine the provisions of the bill to ascertain how generous this Government is to the industrial malcontents. The bill, instead of previous Attorney-General atreducing the offences, actually increases them. The act provides for a penalty of £1,000 upon any person or organization guilty of causing a strike or lockout. That penalty has never been imposed, because, in the first place, employers are never guilty of a lockout! If they are, they do not come under the term "" employer "", and the penalty cannot be collected. There is a distinction. They, apparently, are not "" persons"" because the bill makes it clear that a "" person "" is not an "" employer,"" and an "" employer "" is not a "" person."" placed by the honourable member on the bill is new, and highly original. cannot convince me that the changes provided in the. bill favour the working man. This bill is the result of clever drafting by shrewd lawyers. The act, as it stands, provides that any person found guilty of causing a lockout or strike shall be liable to a fine of £1,000. . It was never intended that that fine should be imposed upon any individual. It would be absurd to conceive of collecting £1,000 from a unionist, and we can take it for granted that the court, in interpreting the act, took that view. That penalty is to stand in respect of an organization or an employer, but a new provision is to be inserted imposing a penalty of £50 on any individual member of a union found guilty of doing something in the nature of causing a strike. Under the bill, the organization shall be deemed to be guilty if its members refuse to offer or accept employment on the advice of the committee, a member of the committee, an officer, or a person in control of the organization or a branch of it. The fine imposed on the organization will be £1,000, and upon each individual member concerned, £50. I trust that I have made the position clear to the people of Australia.

It is out of all pro-, sider that the penalties provided in this portion to the offence, because, after all, a workman doing anything in the nature of a strike has not committed an offence of a criminal nature in the generally accepted meaning of the term. In addition to the imposition of a penalty of £50 the union is invited to expel a workman who strikes. the union he cannot possibly pay the fine. ments of honourable members on this side of the chamber to the effect that the bill is savage and coercive can easily be justified by a reference to the penalties provided, and which are closely interrelated. Its provisions are contrary to the accepted principle that a man shall not be punished twice for the same offence. This bill enables the union to inflict a penalty upon a man who has done something in the nature of a strike, although the court may have already done so. As lin) has said, we are unable to vote against this clause because in a specious manner it purports to reduce a penalty whilst it does not do so. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. surprised that honourable members opposite have expressed so much opposition to the imposition of penalties. . If the law is to be enforced, penalties are necessary. The great majority of honourable memhers opposite have definitely told us that they believe in compulsory arbitration. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) said that if a person supported compulsory arbitration he should be prepared to obey its awards. I agree with Obviously it would be him. The imposition of penalties is the only way in which we can ensure that has awards will be reasonably well obeyed. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) said "" It has been the sincere desire of the Opposition to improve our system of compulsory arbitration."" I suggest to him that penalties are essential if the system is to be improved. It appears as though the Opposition desires to have a system of arbitration under which the workers may strike when the awards are not acceptable to them. We must ensure that that shall not be done with impunity. I conclause are necessary. [8.3] The Attorney-General( Mr Latham) made it clear that this amendment is being inserted in the act with the object of reducing and not increasing penalties. The reduction which we are being asked to accept is more favorable to the employee than to the employer. member really believe that the object of the clause is to reduce penalties! it is or is not the intention, it is certainly the effect. The opposite number to "" employer "" is naturally "" employee"", but what is the opposite number to "" organization""? It is, as shown in the memorandum of the alterations which are being made, "" association "". Yet, under this clause, the penalty of £1,000 is provided in the case of an organization or employer, but not in the case of an employee. Under this provision a small employer-sa y a barber-wh o gives work to only two men might, in the event of a lockout occurring in his establishment, become liable to a fine of £1,000.",45,Paibs

It would then be provided that the fine of £1,000 could be imposed only on an organization or an association. clause is agreed to in its present form great hardship may be inflicted upon an individual employer. It has been suggested by the honourable member for Bourke that there is never a lockout and that therefore the eventuality that I am indicating will never arise, but in framing an Act of Parliament we should endeavour to cover every possible contingency. If the amendment that I have suggested is accepted, the penalties will be imposed evenly in respect of each side, and the clause will be fairer than it is at present. have no doubt that the honourable memis inspired with the desire to improve the clause. fairer. capable of being made fairer; but the alteration that has been suggested would not be an improvement. An association is already defined in the act, and it includes trade unions. Seeing that ""organization "" means all organizations registered under the act, the term covers organizations of both employers and -employees. It would not make the clause any fairer to draw the distinction which has been suggested. the imposition of these penalties to combinations of employers or employees. that the intention of Parliament, when it passed the original act in 1904, was that the heavy penalty of £1,000 should be applied to individual workers engaged in an industrial dispute. It was intended to apply only to organizations representative of the workers on the one hand, and of the employers on the other. In the course of my second-reading speech, and also earlier in our discussion on this clause, I made this clear. I also pointed out that the Attorney-General( Mr Latham), by securing the agreement of the committee to this alteration, would person may be fined make it harder and not easier for organizations of workers to carry on their operations. This is one of the ways in which the Government is endeavouring to tighten up the penal provisions of the measure, with the object of using them If the as a weapon against the organized workers. Honourable members opposite have inquired whether, seeing that compulsory arbitration is the settled policy of the country, provision should not be made for the enforcement of awards. Those who advocate compulsory arbitration acknowledge that awards should be complied with; but cases occur in which either real or fancied grievances of employees are not met by the awards, and they take the law into their own hands. If such individuals could be disciplined, it might be a good thing; but it is not fair that, in order to discipline one or two men, persons 1,000 miles away, the organization should be made to suffer. Yet that will be the effect of this clause. It makes possible the imposition of penalties upon individuals who have not participated in a strike, and had no intention of doing .so, and upon organizations which have not disobeyed the law and had no intention of doing so. That is one strong objection that I have to the clause, and I am sure that many honourable members opposite do not appreciate how serious it is. They appear to be prepared to allow this measure, with its ill-considered clauses authorizing heavier and more severe penalties, to go through merely on the ground that compulsory arbitration is the accepted policy of the country; but they forget that they are forging a weapon which may be used to coerce and threaten the workers and their organizations. I am amazed that they should pretend that they represent the workers of this country. The Attorney-General told us seriously this afternoon that he felt that he was speaking for the majority of trade unionists in Australia when he urged that the bill should be accepted. There is little or no justification for such a claim. As a matter of fact, the Government seems to be actuated by the desire, on the one haud, to do everything it can to curb, if not entirely to take away, the power of",46,Paibs

General [8.11] -The suggestion of the can-Hughes) is that the clause be amended to provide that the maximum penalty of £1,000 shall be imposed only in the case of organizations and associations, and that individuals shall in no circumstances be liable to it. The proposal in the bill is that in the case of an employer or an organization, which means registered associations of employers or employees, the maximum penalty shall be £1,000, and that in the case of individual trade unionists or employees the maximum penalty shall be only £50. ployers are as big commercially as some corporations. not accept the suggested amendment, because the maximum penalty must be regarded in relation to what may be described as the maximum offence. It is readily conceivable that lockouts may be caused by individual employers in respect of which the only adequate penalty would be the maximum fine. Such a case could not be met by the imposition of the relatively small fine of £50. Some employers employ hundreds of hands, and must be considered in that light. introduction of the word "" association "" into the clause would add little to its value. All organizations which are registered associations are corporations, and as such are artificial legal persons, and are liable if their officers or certain other words, it may act in the only way that persons mentioned in section 8, as proposed to be amended, do certain things. This is specifically provided for in clause 8. An association is not a legal person, and it would be very difficult to impose penalties upon it, but the members of it who act illegally would be liable individually. It is in that way that provision is made to meet breaches of the law by associations. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr mittedly provided in the principal act. Theodore) in some general remarks that he made on the subject of penalties showed that he did not draw a-proper distinction between the act and the bill. He said that individuals who did not participate in a strike might be held liable for strike penalties. That is not the case. be held liable as members of organizations. cussion upon the clause turns upon the difference between an organization and an individual, I suggest that there was no foundation for the statement which the honourable member made. An organization is a corporation, just like a company, and a company is liable only for the acts of certain natural personsordinary human beings. If an organization is to be held liable at all, it must be merely for the action of certain identifiable human beings. These must be the officers or persons in control of it. Those are the persons referred to in clause 8. Their acts may make their organization liable, but there is no provision, either in the principal act or in the bill, which proposes to amend it, under which any individual person can be penalized for taking part in a strike unless it is proved that he participated in that strike. Surely the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) recognizes that the whole scheme of arbitration is based upon the rights and responsibilities of organizations as against those of individuals. The honourable gentleman also surely recognizes that an organizaThe tion, independently of its members, as an organization, may render itself liable under this act. It may affirmatively, through its authorized officers, take some definite official act as an organization. In other an organization is empowered to act, under its rules, according to the powers which the law gives it-as the Attorney General says, as a corporation. In such circumstances nobody would object to an organization suffering penalties. The question whether a penalty of £1,000 is excessive or not does not, perhaps, arise immediately, because a similar penalty was adThe extension of the penalty to the organization by reason of the acts of an individual is a matter for subsequent consideration, under a later clause in this",47,Paibs

I rose principally to register my opinion, which I think is consistent with that of other honourable members, upon the clause w i th which we are now dealing, which, for the first time, fixes a penalty of £50 upon individuals, and retains the penalty upon organizations and employers at £1,000. It has been pointed out in this chamber and elsewhere that the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) and the Attorney-General have endeavoured to tickle the ears of their supporters by declaring that this Government, being a benevolent one, for the first time reduces the penalties in connection with arbitration. More than once the reply has been forthcoming that this is not intended as a reduction of penalties, but designedly to make the penalties effective. It has been repeatedly and truthfully pointed out that the old penalty of £1,000, so f a r as it was applicable to individuals, from its very absurdity was allowed to sink into disuse. The Attorney-General, while he was still in his political infancy, conceived the thought of making penalties in arbitration what he was pleased to call "" effective."" The way to make penalties effective is to make them bite to make them hurt, to apply them, and that is being done. This clause must not therefore be urged in extenuation of what the Government proposes under other clauses. The Attorney General spoke in this House on the enforcement of Commonwealth laws on the 9th July, 1925. He then moved a resolution which w ill be found reported at page 874 of volume 110, Parliamentary Debates, in these wordsThat, in the opinion of this House, means lar intention of the legislature that it should be provided for the effective enforceshall be given effect to in a way in which ment of all the laws which Parliament places it wa3 never previously given effect to. or allows to remain upon the statuteThat is the sinister meaning underlying book I shall not read the whole of the resoluthe clause which is now under consideration, which continued at some length, but tion. it concluded with these words. . . . and of enforcing the provisions of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitraclause at this stage, so that we shall hear tion Act. The honourable gentleman went on to set itself out, as allegedly no other GosayMy mind was brought to this subject more ties on trade unionists. particularly by reason of what occurred in, I think, January last, when the general president citing persons to strike, or for some offence of who is the learned and distinguished that nature. At the time very strong protests member for Boothby, in spite of his legal were made by the friends and associates of that gentleman, because, as action of that kind had not previously been taken, it was felt that the prosecution was a political one. It is unfortunate that the enforcement of the law should have been allowed to get into such n condition that there was room for the genuine belief, on the part of a large section of the community, that it had been, as it were, exhumed for a particular purpose. That quotation serves to bring out in the very clearest light the purpose underlying this alteration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Frequently when it comes to a question of penalties or the interpretation of a statute, we hear in argument in courts of law the phrase, "" What was the intention of Parliament?"" While this penalty remained at £1,000, while, as the Attorney-General himself .admits, it had fallen into desuetude, it could not be effective; but now it is clearly the intention of the Government to provide for the severe penalty which it is intended shall be imposed-no t necessarily the maximum penalty but a substantial part of it , according to circumstances. I cannot allow the Prime Minister to ""get away "" with that grotesque picture which he presented to the House on another occasion, nor can I allow the Attorney General to "" get away "" with the suggestion that this "" benevolent"" Government is now endeavouring to make the penalties on unionists less than they were before. This clause may well be read witb the clause dealing with the probable economic effect of an award. When we come to that clause, I shall point out, as I do on this, that its object is to direct the attention of the court to the particuboth that clause and, to a large extent, I wish to register that view upon this no more about this Government having vernment has done, to mitigate the penal-",48,Paibs

202,Mr Anstey (Bourke) [8.25],"M ylearning, appears to be somewhat at sea as to the eflect of this clause. He seems not to understand the difference between an organization of human beings and an association of human beings. He faih to distinguish that an organization of human beings is not an association of human beings. But I feel quite confident that, notwithstanding his forensic knowledge, after having listened to the explanation of the Attorney-General, he understands the position just as clearly as he did before the honourable gentleman made his explanation. I am prepared to wager all my worldly possessions against one-tenth of the worldly possessions of the honourable member for Boothby that, in spite of his legal training, he cannot explain the explanation of the Attorney-General on this matter. orable member explain it? pected to explain the conundrum when the honourable member, with his ability and legal training, could not comprehend it. The culture is there; the lack of training and illiteracy here. How could I be expected to understand that which, notwithstanding his wisdom, is incomprehensible to the honourable member? The act as it existed was quite clear. It made a distinction between an individual-a n employer-and an organization of employees. It did not recognize the individual workman as an individual, but as an integral part of his organization. with both persons and organizations. imagine that the founders of our arbitration law, who, as the honourable gentleman has said, were not members of this party, but of his party, flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone, soul of his soul, men allegedly of understanding, of sympathy, ever contemplated imposing a fine of £1,000 upon an individual workman? Does the honourable gentleman dare to say that the men who brought this law into existence ever imposed a fine of £1,000 on an individual workman? the-kind. It was never understood from their speeches or from the law, and there is no court in Australia that ever applies to the provision the interpretation that this Government desires to have applied. man is prone to interject, but he always objects when subjected to interruption, and claims the protection afforded by the Standing Orders. The intention of Parliament was quite clear. Not even in the Nationalist party could there have been a body of persons so insane as to lay it down that a penalty of £1,000 should be imposed upon an individual workman. The intention of Parliament, as understood by all the courts of the country, was that ""person"" should be the employer as distinct from an organization. It is wrong for the Government to claim that it is endeavouring to reduce penalties. It is superimposing new penalties upon the old penalties. The old law provided if an organization defied the awards of the court or took direct action, it was liable to a penalty of £1,000. I quite admit that, under the old law, an organization could dodge its responsibility by throwing the onus of the action upon individuals, who did what it dared not do as a "" corporation,"" "" association,"" or ""organization."" I also clearly understand that the individual employer was able to dodge the law when he caused a lockout, so avoiding a fine of £1,000. This bill does what the old law did not do. It imposes a fine of £50 upon any individual member of an organization of unionists who dares to refuse work, either by himself or in conjunction with other men, in certain conditions. The Government should either withdraw the provision or make some attempt to cover its hypocrisy. I refuse to let it announce publicly that it does not intend to impose fines without raising my voice in protest. I do not think, that the fines will be imposed; this legislation is introduced only to delude the electors into supporting the Government. Nor do I ask that the penalties be reduced by even one penny, for to the extent that individual workmen may be fined to that extent will the Government sow the seeds of its own destruction and the seeds of Labour's growth. When the Attorney General says that this bill does not increase the fines, I can only say that he is what he 13.",49,Paibs

The honourable member apparently believes that the existing act imposes no liability upon any individual, particularly an individual workman. ber appears to be under the misapprehensou that section 6 of the principal act in no way penalizes an individual worker for taking part in a strike. ment never intended that an individual should be penalized. refer to the case of Tom Walsh, who was convicted under that section or section 6A, which is in similar terms; and although on appeal to the High Court one conviction was set aside on certain grounds, another conviction was upheld. There has never been any contention as to the applicability of the original section in reality been lockouts. In my own electo an individual employee. law was £1,000, why was Tom Walsh fined only £100? He was not fined under section 6. able member does not understand that under the Acts Interpretation Act, the penalties provided in section 6 and section 6A, under one of which Walsh was convicted, are in all cases the maximum penalties. The penalties imposed by this legislation are therefore the maximum penalties which may be inflicted. The honourable member speaks with a high degree of inaccuracy when he says that the original section was never meant to apply to individuals. Not only does it expressly apply to individuals, but it has also been so applied both in the lower and in the higher court3. This clause deals with penalties for lockouts and strikes. I hold a different view regarding this matter from that which has just been presented to the committee. My objection to the penalties is that they are not equitable; they can be applied to industrial unions and individual employees, but it will be very difficult to apply them to employers. I ask honourable members how many lockouts have taken place since the principle of arbitration was established in this country. proved. cipal act no penalty has ever been imposed upon an employer for causing a lockout; and this bill will not remedy the position. that there have been no lockouts. the definition of "" lockout"" makes it very easy for. an employer of labour to avoid committing an offence. He need It . is sumcient to not close his establishment, or unreasonably suspend its operations: he merely has to change the conditions under which his employees work. If they refuse to accept the altered conditions they are guilty of having done something in the nature of a strike. Hundreds of so-called strikes which have occurred in this country have torate numbers of miners are now unemployed, not because they do not want to work, but because they are unwilling to work in a mine where their lives may be endangered. Some years ago an explosion took place in an adjoining mine; but the effect of those explosions on the mine in which they are expected to work has never been investigated. The possibilities of accident are so great that until the mine has been thoroughly examined the men are afraid to work in it. They are out of employment because they value their lives. Yet they may be held guilty of having taken part in a strike. Until this Parliament amends the definition of "" lockout"" so that there can be no alteration of the existing conditions of employment unless mutually agreed upon between employers and employees, or by direction of the court, the penalties provided by this legislation will continue to fall only on the employees. It does not matter whether the penalty for the breach of the act by an employer is £50 or £1,000, he will never have to pay the fine. I have brought this matter forward on many occasions since I have been in this House because I realize that so much depends",50,Paibs

In order to hold the scales fairly .between the two contending parties the -definition of ""lockout"" should be .amended. Although since 1904 there has never ""for a lockout as defined in the act, no one will be foolish enough to congirls employed in Murdoch's, in Sydney, tend that during that period every employer has obeyed the law. I could cite many instances of breaches of the law by employers, yet they have not been charged with an offence. But let the workmen resist changed conditions and they are accused of having done something in the nature of a strike. Under this legislation their orga»izations will be liable to a fine of £1,000. under section 9 ? that referred to in section 9 has ever been lockout ? dealt with by the court. The honourable member for Barton( Mr Ley), with his legal training, must know that the definition of ""lockout"" makes it easy to bring about changed conditions. about the employer would be liable under section 9. with section 9 at this stage. In these matters experience must be our guide; and our experience is that up to the present no lockout has ever been proved. There should be power to prevent the alterations of working conditions except by mutual consent or by direction of the court. If the workmen are to be liable to penalties, their employers should also be liable. nition of "" lockout"" remains, so long will employers continue to escape. I suggest that there should be a better definition o ""lockout"". f That the penalty of £1,000 provided in the principal act for certain offences was not intended to apply to individual employees is clear from the fact that in only have to go to the police court to prove a very few cases has a fine been inflicted on an individual, and then only when he was one of the principal officers of a union. Hunter( Mr Charlton) has pointed out, no employer has ever been fined under this legislation, although there have been cases in which fines should have been imposed on them. fined for breaches of awards, but not for having caused lockouts. before the committee the case of some who, out of a wage of 35s. a week had to pay 10s. 6d. a week for their midday meal. Other expenses necessarily incurred left them with only 2s. 6d. a week to clothe themselves and provide medicine in case of sickness. Yet because those girls gave evidence in the Arbitration Court regarding the conditions under which they worked, they were brought before their boss, Colonel Murdoch, M.L.C., who is a fervent Nationalist Some of the girls Avere denied the bonus and one was dismissed. Was not that a missed for the reason stated? missed. It ill becomes the honourable member for Riverina, with his half a million sheep, to gay anything in defence of the way in which Colonel Murdoch has treated some of these unfortunate girls, many of whom can earn only sufficient for a bare existence. Let me show how the penalties can be imposed, if this bill is passed as it stands. The cooks on the Jervis Bay had a difference with the management as to the interpretation of an award, and they were advised to appeal to the police court. One of them did so, and the magistrate gave an award in his favour. So long as the present defiOne would have thought that the management would then treat all the cooks alike, but, instead of doing that, they informed the cooks that every man would have to appear before the court to prove his own case. The cooks quite properly deeided to strike. Under this bill they would' each be liable to a fine of £50. It is absurd to suggest that every man should his own claim.

They took the stand that they were paid to study and look after the comfort of passengers. Because they declined to act as warders to lunatics they were dismissed, and a strike occurred. this bill each man who took part in that strike would be liable to a fine of £50. It is no use for the Prime Minister ancl the Attorney-General to tell the people that, because the maximum penalty has been reduced, in the case of individuals from £1,000 to £50, the measure will benefit trade unionists. The maximum penalty in the original act has never been enforced against the individual. I am strongly opposed to the whole bill, and especially to those provisions dealing with the penalties. Notwithstanding what the Attorney-General has said of the letter written to The Worker by the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley), I am firmly convinced that every word in it is true. which will be inflicted upon individual trade unionists under this bill will be extremely harsh. I see no necessity for the measure, and I shall vote against every clause. It will not bring about industrial peace.

The plain reading of the law is that a person who does anything in the nature of a strike is to-day liable to a fine of £1,000, I believe that the penalties and under the bill the maximum penalty is reduced to £50. It is very difficult, therefore, to understand the reason for the objection of honourable members opposite. Certainly they will find it extremely difficult to convince the people that the penalties have not been reduced.

If they are at issue on this point it should be taken to the court.' That is the whole object of the law. The honourable member has no right to complain of the definition of a lockout, merely because of the possibility of an alteration of conditions that are not the subject-matter of an award. member explain why there has never been a "" lockout"" in the history of our arbitration system? honorahle member ia right. has admitted that there has never been a prosecution for a lockout. That is the point I wish to make. there has not been a prosecution for a lockout; but I would not presume to say that there has not been a lockout. conditions in an award the employee has his legal remedy, and if there is any variation of conditions outside an award the employee can appeal to the court. I cannot follow the honourable member's argument that we should insert in the clause a definition of a lockout merely bebeen complaining about faulty lamps. cause people who are aggrieved will not a Ppl.y to the court for redress. The penalty has been reduced, and there is no justification for an amendment of the defipump was put on to them ten lamps nition of a lockout. Obviously a fine of £50 is less than a fine of £1,000. The honourable member for Barton( Mr Ley) has apparently been stressing the obvious, in the belief, possibly, that honourable members who obsion that a fine of £50 is more than a fine I invite attention first to clauses 4 and 5, vernment considers that that amount is unreasonable in the case of an individual person. It therefore proposes to amend the act by providing that the penalty shall be £1,000 in the case of an organization or employer, and £50 in respect of any other person. It is a mistake to provide penalties which cannot be recovered, or which arc out of proportion to the gravity of the offence. It is of no use for honourable members supporting the Government to hypnotize themselves into the belief that the bill is more acceptable to trade unionists than the act is. The heavier penalties provided for in the act have never been enforced against the individual; therefore, it is only a specious argument to say that the penalties have been reduced. Under the bill a fine of £50 against individual members of a huge organization like the Australian Workers Union would amount, in the aggregate, to an enormous stun if the penalties were enforced. I agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Hunter with regard to the definition of a lockout. In his second reading speech the Attorney-General said it was difficult to prove a strike but easy to prove a lockout. His statement was an admission of complete ignorance regarding industrial matters. I regret that the honourable member for Barton( Mr Ley) is not, at the moment, in the chamber, because I wish to give him some information on this point. Not long ago the management of a mine in my electoral division wished to close down to have the machinery attended to. The men had Contending that the lamps were dangerous, they demanded that they be examined. This was done. When the went out one after the other. And he condemned the lot.

252,Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [8.57],"and the result was that a strike occurred. The Attorney-General would call that a strike, but I maintain that it was a lockout. The same trouble is likely to occur as the result of varying conditions in mining. The men may be working under an award, but in one or two mines, because of local conditions, the earning power of the men is reduced. The honourable gentleman says that they should go to the court and apply for a variation of the award, but before they could obtain the variation normal conditions might be restored, and the men would have no redress for tlieir grievances. By refusing to comply with the men's request for more pay in such cases, the owners may deliberately cause a strike. In the metal trades recently there was a lockout when the employers sacked 30,000 men in order to avoid paying them for the Christmas holidays. Technically, it was not a lockout, because the men were no longer in employment. an award of.the court. somewhat similar case occurred when the seamen, obeying the award of the court, held a stop-work meeting on the day following a holiday. In this case the Monday was a holiday, and the award sets out that when the day set apart for the monthly stop-work meeting falls on a holiday, the men are entitled to hold their meeting on the day following the holiday. They did this, and their pay was stopped. Yet no proceedings were taken against the ship-owners for locking the men out, and refusing to take them back unless they were prepared to sacrifice the pay to which they were entitled. The employers at the abattoirs also deliberately flouted the award, and though a few of them were fined, the others continued to break the award, and the men had to go on strike in order to obtain their rights. I am opposed to the imposition of any penalties in connection with arbitration, because all penal clauses are one-sided in their operation. For instance, it is pracby the Attorney-General that, in the case tically impossible to prove a case of victimization against an employer. If an employer, for any particular reason, wishes to be rid of two or three men, all he has to do is to say that he is reducing his staff, and he can then dispense with these men's services. When the staff is increased again, they are not taken on. That kind of thing is done even on Government works. the worse offenders. member for Maribrynong has said, governments frequently offend in this way. I am convinced that it is impossible to apply the penal clauses in this bill in the same way in which the criminal law can be applied. For that reason I intend to vote against this clause, as, indeed, I shall vote against most of the other clauses in the bill. The penalties provided are harsh and unreasonable. That is why every labour organization in the country is opposed to the measure. The Attorney General said that it was very easy to prove a lockout, and very difficult to prove a strike. I think it can be shown quite conclusively that the very opposite is the case. It should be remembered that ever since 1904, our industrial legislation has provided for a penalty of £1,000 against associations of employers, labour unions, and individuals convicted of certain offences. Since that time a Labour government has been in power, and if it was thought desirable to repeal that penal clause there was ample opportunity to do it. it was a dead letter. bers of Labour Governments did not desire to remove the penal clauses. Possibly they regarded the penalties as operative only against the employers, and, therefore, permitted them to remain. The Attorney-General has pointed out one aspect of this matter which was previously to a large extent overlooked. That is, that a penalty of £1,000 is the maximum which can be imposed, and the court is not obliged to inflict a fine of £1,000 in every case. It was pointed out of Walsh, who was prosecuted under this section, the court imposed a fine of £100. I maintain that the act will be improved by the fact that the penalties, in many cases, have been reduced. Surely honourable members opposite will not vote",54,Paibs

259,Mr Parkhill,"Apparently , memagainst this clause which will reduce a penalty from £1,000 to £50. I propose to be perfectly frank, and to state that I welcome this reduction, because it will make the penal clause operative against the unions, which previously it was not. Personally, I wish that the Attorney General would make the penalty £25 instead of £50, because in that case the penal clause would be still more effective. This amendment, if passed, will make the penalty effective so far as individuals are concerned. I wish to refer to the case of Murdoch Limited, of Park-street, Sydney. This case was mentioned during the second-reading debate by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), and it has been referred to to-night by the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr McGrath). The speakers saw fit to cast aspersions on Colonel Murdoch, the proprietor of this establishment. no hesitation in saying that there is not an establishment in Sydney to-day order. If the honourable member had listened to the earlier debate, he would know that this case was cited as providing an instance of a lockout. The honourable member for Warringah is in order. honourable members have done something wrong does not make it right for the honourable member for Warringah to do the same thing. I submit that the honourable member is not justified, when discussing this clause, in making excursions into the affairs of any business in Sydney. I submit, further, that reference to the speeches of honourable members during the second-reading debate on this bill is not in order. member for Warringah is in order. the fact that reference had been made to that firm, ancl it was claimed that because employees of the firm had given certain evidence they had been dismissed. member for Ballarat said that they were dismissed, and I remarked that none of them were dismissed. member repeated his assertion, and I am now replying to it. I submit that I am entitled to refer to it, because it has been claimed that unionists do not get a fair deal from their employers. The firm in questiou treats its employees more favourably, probably, than any other firm in Australia. It has about 1,000 employees. The girls who gave evidence in the Arbitration Court had been in the employ of the firm for eight years, and the man had been employed for four years. I am quoting from a statement that I took the trouble to obtain from the firm, because a union secretary named Carter had gratuitously sent a circular to me, among others, giving his version of the matter, and this had been mentioned in this chamber. I may say, parenthetically, that I strongly resent the attitude of the Opposition in trying to prevent me from presenting my view of the case, although I have it has placed the statements of the employees on record. It is reasonable to hear both sides of a case. It was stated, in the course of the evidence, that the manager was a nigger driver, that the forewoman should be driving cattle, that the employees were allowed no time to get a drink, that the lavatories were always out of order, and that the apprentices were not taught. As a matter of fact, for years this firm has endeavoured to conduct its business on model lines. member is now going beyond the particular matter to which reference has been made. ruling. The statement that these employees were dismissed is entirely untrue. Only eight out of 1,000 were prevented from getting their bonuses. The amount of the bonus paid by this firm last year greatly exceeded the sum received by the The honourable shareholders in dividends. That shows that it is a model firm. I was referring to The clause under consideration is a reasonable one. I repeat that when penalties are provided under industrial legislation, they must be of a reasonable character if the law is to be effective. If this provision has been inoperative for years, it should either be expunged from the act or should be made effective. The clause has my support because it will make this The honourable part of the act effective by reducing the maximum penalty from £1,000 to £50. That is the reason why the Opposition",55,Paibs

I have before me a declaration, signed before a justice of the peace, which strengthens the case presented by me. The statutory declaration, to which I refer, statesAccompanied by the said Maggie McLauchthis way by their so-called gentlemanly lan, Catherine Ellen Dickinson, and Mary employer. Ellen Kenny, I then went to the oflice of Mr Drummond, the secretary of the 3aid company, and interviewed him. Just before I spoke to him Mr Dodds came in, bent down and whispered something to Mr Drummond, mond, ""We have not got our bonus; if we are not going to get it will you give us the reason?"" He said, ""What section do yon belong to?"" I told him. He then opened a drawer in his desk and took out some papers, and went through them, and took out one paper from the remainder. I saw this paper, which contained a lot of names, and near the end was my name and the names of the said Maggie McLauchlan, Catherine Ellen Dickinson, and Mary Ellen Kenny, with a black line through each of the four names. I shall substitute There was also some writing at the side of the names, but I do not know what the writing was. Mr Drummond then said, ""The chief, Colonel Murdoch, has decided that you are not getting it I have already for being disloyal and telling lies."" I said to him, "" In what way did we tell lies ?"" He said, ""You went to court."" The said Mary Ellen Kenny then said, ""Well, if we told lies you had your remedy."" He said, ""We had, and we brought the judge through."" The said Mary Ellen Kenny then said, ""To put it baldly, it is a mean revenge."" To this remark Mr Drummond made no reply. ber said that they were dismissed. they were penalized for giving evidence in the Arbitration court. I read out a list, I withdraw the in my second-reading speech, showing how the 35s. a week, which the girls reoeived, was spent. They paid 12s. 6d. for rent, The 2s. 6d. for tram fares, 10s. 6d. for mid-day meals, and 7s. for other meals, leaving only 2s. 6d. for clothing, medicine, &c. I did not think that industrial conditions were as bad as that in New South Wales. I thought that conditions such as that had been remedied long ago. This treatment was received by the girls because they were forced to go to the Arbitration Court. The honourable member for Warringah does not deny that they were compelled to forego their bonus. That was a mean and petty revenge on the part of Colonel Murdoch. If Murdoch's Limited are ideal employers, I do not wish to see any bad ones. All that I said was true.

He represents the wealthy section that put up what he calls a little joke at the last election. He can perpetrate any act that suits his political ends. He has no sympathy for girls receiving a paltry 35s. a week, who, in a legal way, seek to have their wrongs redressed in the Arbitration Court. Because they pleaded their cause in the only way available to them in this so-called free country of Australia, their bonus, the repetition of the same offence. honourable member admits, was denied them. One of these girls was dismissed. That should be a satisfactory answer even to the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill). My statement has beeu verified to the hilt. This firm declared a lockout, and action should be taken under the laws of this country to place Colonel Murdoch on his trial for the victimization of these unfortunate girls. I submit that I am entitled to place before this chamber the other side of the subject under discussion. The honourable member for Ballarat has made use of much hot air and many irrelevant remarks. He has made references to myself which are utterly untrue, and which I hurl back with scorn. I do not propose to reply to his suggestions. I represent a with, and I certainly shall not sit idly -class of people whom I am proud to represent. I represent no moneyed interests. I am as free as any honourable member in this House. The honourable said that these girls were dismissed, and had I not pinned him to that statement, it would have appeared in Hansard uncorrected. I informed him that, according to sworn evidence these girls were denied the gift, or bonus, given by Murdoch's to its employees. The honourable member then changed his ground, but he still used his abusive tongue on the person controlling that firm. Colonel Murdoch is the most humane employer in Australia to-day. What are the facts ? These are the words of Colonel Murdoch himselfI t is true the officers of tlie union made n had not participated in the Christmas bonus. It is also true that after asking them questions, taken from the transcript of tlie evidence, I expressed the opinion that they were either lying or deliberately disloyal to the firm. given on oath? in this case. Colonel Murdoch continuedDespite this they were not dismissed, but their leader, Miss Scrivner, who had previously been detected in incorrectly booking her work, has recently been dismissed for n All this talk about these girls earning only . 35s. a week is entirely incorrect. The facts are that a number of employees, among whom were the four girls who gave evidence, agreed to make five garments in excess of the ordinary work for an increased weekly wage of6s., making the wages £3 for a week of 43$ hours. That agreement is still in force. Those facts are very different from the so-called facts presented to this House by the honourable member for Ballarat. I do not wish to add anything further to my remarks. This firm has treated its employees in a most exemplary fashion and Colonel Murdoch is the most humane employer in New South Wales to-day. This subject, since it has been opened up, should be adequately and fully dealt by while the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill), with his characteristic ferocity, which may easily by the unthinking be mistaken for eloquence, attacks the honourable mema man who has given many years of useful service to this Parliament, and whose character, I am happy to say, is as unblemished as his eloquence is",57,Honourable Members Withdraw

This is a proper provision. In the case of any ordinary organization or corporation, the law is that the organization is liable for the acts of person occupying position in which it is [200] part of their functions to perform certain acts. For example, a company may employ an oflicer who performed a certain act which made the company liable. If other officers of the company had entertained different views or had endeavoured to prevent the performance of the act, the liability of the company would not be reduced. The liability of the corporation is absolute; a corporation is responsible for the act of its officer or other agent. In industrial matters there is sometimes a difference of opinion on certain matters, and occasionally persons in positions of responsibility do not fully realize the seriousness of the trust vested in them. But it is considered that this matter ought to be looked at as a whole, and that the strict rule of law should not apply in the case of an industrial organization. The strict rule of law under which a corporation is held responsible for anything done by its officials has been relaxed in the case of an industrial organization. Accordingly, if an oflicer or a member of a committee or In accordance with a some members of a committee of management have tried to prevent an act which has resulted in an organization being held responsible for the commission of an offence under sections 6 and 6A, this clause provides that in fixing the penalty that fact shall be taken into consideration. I submit that the provision is a fair one, and should meet the requirements of such cases. clause is supposed to mitigate the penalties imposed on organizations; but it implies that an organization is responsible for the act of those for whom it cannot be responsible. As that issue will be debated on clause 8, I suggest that we ought not to discuss it on a preceding provision. The question of making the organization responsible for the act of other persons and not for its should not have any connection with section 6 or 6A. If we were to disregard clause 8 and endeavour to retain the principal act as it has stood since the inception of compulsory arbitration there would be no suggestion that a union should be held responsible for other than its own act.

After section 6A of the principal act the following section is inserted:"" 6B. Where an organization has been found guilty of any offence against section 6 or section 6A of this act the court before which it has been found guilty shall, in fixing the penalty to be imposed in respect of the offence, take into account any bona fide efforts which the organization satisfies the court have been made by members of its committee of management or by any of its officers to prevent the commission of an offence against this part of this act."" If an organization satisfies the court that its committee of management has made genuine efforts to prevent the act with which it is charged, that should be evidence that the organization is not responsible. committee of management as a whole can prove that it is not responsible. somewhat ambiguous. If an organization satisfies a court that members of its committee of management have in good faith made a genuine effort to prevent action being taken, and J the court admits the evidence, it should be taken as proof that the organization is not responsible. bers of the committee of management were plainly implicated ? cipating clause 8. There is nothing in this clause and sections 6 or 6A to that effect. We cannot have something in proposed section 6B relating to section 6A which, I suggest, is foreign to that section quite relevant to clause 8, which honourable members on this side will endeavour to delete from the bill. We do not wish to pass something with an implication relating to clause 8. If clause 8 were not in the bill, and section 6 were to operate as in the past, this, by implication, would be entirely new. zation satisfies the court that its representatives acted in good faith the organization should not be responsible. General) [9.55] -Unde r sections 6 and 6A offences were created and penalties fixed. Section8 does not in. the early part of it I am not now referring to the proposed new sub-sections 3 and 4-im pose a penalty. It is a purely evidentiary section. Sections6 and 6A relate to persons doing something in the nature of a lockout or a strike, and under them penalties may be imposed upon organizations as well as upon persons for certain acts. Section8 provides that an organization which defies the law or incites the commission of certain acts in the nature of a lockout or a strike shall itself be deemed to be guilty of an offence the penalties for which are found in section 6 and 6A. Proposed section 6B makes provision for the mitigation of penalties when an organization has been found guilty. If some members of a committee of management or some of its officers have been trying/to prevent the commission of the offence, that action is to be taken into account in fixing the penalty. If the secretary of an organization has full power to perform the act he has performed, and the court finds that that act is. the commission of an offence, an organization may be found responsible for the action of its secretary. It may appear, however, that a number of the members of the committee of management, considering that the secretary was wrong, may have tried to prevent the commission of the act for which the organization had been convicted. In such a case the organization should be convicted, because the authorized officer had acted contrary to the law; but this clause provides that in such a case where there is no doubt that some members of the committee of management tried to prevent it, that fact shall be considered in fixing the penalty. been inserted if clause 8 were not embodied in the bill? remembered in dealing with an organization of this class that an organization is no more real than a company, but is equally so. The liability of an organization as a corporation depends upon the acts of the persons who are in a position to act with real or apparent authority on its behalf. Outsiders are entitled to judge a corporation by the apparent authority which it confers upon its agents in accordance with a well-known principle of law.

304,Mr Latham,"Yes. It must behave been possible to take proceedings against an organization for an offence under earlier provisions. ""When a prosecutor contends that an organization has been guilty of an offence, it is necessary to ascertain the facts, and who committed the acts complained of. .Some individual would have to be discovered upon whom to fasten responsibility, and if he were proved guilty, the question would arise as to the nature of his authority. I point out to honourable members that the latter part of section 8, which appears in italics in the memorandum, was only inserted in 1920. Section 6A also was only inserted in that year. I assure honourable members that their acceptance of this clause will not in any way compromise them in relation to clause 8, for it would be quite a proper provision irrespective of what is contained in clause 8. I therefore ask the committee to equip the court with power, when an organization is convicted of an offence committed by its omcers or committee of management, to take into account the endeavour of other officers or members to prevent the committal of the offence. This is an extraordinary clause, and the Attorney-General has not justified it. A Gilbertian situation may arise under it. We are asked to agree, in the first place, that an organization may be found guilty and be liable to a certain penalty because one or more of its officers have committed an act which may be held to be in the nature of a strike. Then we are asked to provide that because some other officer or officers have disapproved of the action and made a bona fide attempt to prevent it, the court may consider their action in mitigation of the penalty. Could anything be more absurd or more unworkable ? This clause must be considered in conjunction with clause 8, under which an organization may be involved in a penalty for an act which does not even involve a cessation of work. Eveni f only one of its officers advises members to cease work, it will become liable to heavy penalties. An organization which has been found guilty of an offence, of which 10,000 of its members disapprove, may be penalized. On the other hand, if the great majority of the members of an organization favour a strike, and it can he shown that even one member was against it and made a bona fide attempt to prevent it, the court may, on that account, reduce the penalty. The provision is absurd, unworkable, and ridiculous; but it is typical of the whole bill. The Attorney-General must realize that the whole scheme of this bill is irrational and Gilbertian. If it can be shown that even one member of a committee of management has endeavoured to prevent a strike occurring the court may inflict a lighter fine than otherwise; but if an organization has amongst its members even one irresponsible officer or uncontrollable member in a remote branch and he commits an act which constitutes an offence, the organization may be held responsible. We cannot consider this clause separately from clause 8. I am quite convinced that though he attempted to justify this provision, the Attorney-General realized its absurdity. Who could logically argue that the mere fact of an irresponsible person committing an act in the nature of an offence is sufficient to involve the whole organization? It would be just as ridiculous to argue that the fact of one member attempting to prevent a dispute is sufficient reason for absolving a whole organization. We are living in a time of supposed freedom and liberty. But organizations are, after all, only aggregates of human beings. It cannot be expected that they will ever have complete control of every member or be able to discipline every officer. That would be a state of perfection. It should not be expected either that organizations should be relieved of their responsibility simply because one officer has attempted to prevent a breach of the law. left for a judge to determine. in any judge, magistrate, or authority to extend leniency to an organization if an offence has been proved. nominal fine. member believes that a nominal fine would be sufficient in such instances it is unnecessary to provide for a maximum penalty of £1,000, and the Attorney General should amend the clause and provide for only a nominal fine.

The Attorney-General has justified the action of the Government in holding an organization liable for the acts of its members. Possibly an organization might be embroiled through the action of a small section of recalcitrants refusing to accept arbitration as a policy, individual employers are to be punished. men of the type of those whose actions are exaggerated by honourable members opposite when they are criticizing unionism. Through their activities the organization is penalty. The Attorney-General has urged that this clause provides for the mitigation of that penalty; that if the organization can prove that it used bona fide efforts to prevent the commission of the offence the court may exercise its discretion and reduce the amount of the penalty. But the organization cannot secure the dismissal of the plaint! The whole proposal is harsh and is unjustifiable, and the statement of the Attorney-General in explanation of the elause is the strongest case that could be made out against it. I agree with both the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) and the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) in their opposition to this clause. I believe that it appears in the wrong place, :and that it should have been taken before we dealt with clause 5. Provision is already made in section 6A of the principal' act for the imposition of a penalty -of £1,000. It has been urged that, if an organization can prove that it has endeavoured to bring about a settlement of .a dispute, that may be taken into consideration and the penalty mitigated.

It is also unjust that, instead of the whole, of an employers' association being within the jurisdiction of the clause, only employers could be punished, if found guilty. the working of the clause will be inequitable. Provision is also made in clause 5 that any section of an organization that participates in anything in the nature of a strike shall be liable to £1,000, irrespective of the number of men concerned. 8 now, but the honourable member knows that actually, that is not so.

He should not endeavour to throw upon the Opposition the responsibility of rejecting a clause the object of which is to mitigate penalties. The clause should be postponed and, if necessary, redrafted in order to make it clear that it provides for the mitigation of a penalty without there being any implication of guilt in regard to a union when it is not guilty. The Attorney General is willing to withdraw this clause; but will he or the Prime Minister show the same willingness when we come to clause 8 ? Will they say that it is not wanted, and can therefore be withdrawn? The clause with which we are now dealing clearly provides for the mitigation of penalties; but there is also the implication of a union's guilt. That will influence the judge when trying the union under section 6. Rather than make the position clear, the Attorney-General suggests the withdrawal of the clause. No honourable member can accuse the Opposition of having been unreasonable today; but we will fight for the repeal of clauses 7 and 8 and others.
