I understand, however, that a letter was sent to the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, when he was Prime Minister, and was supplemented afterwards by a memorandum stating that the Orient Company -was not being conducted at a profit, and that, therefore, it was necessary for them to ask for an increased price for the carriage of the mails.

37,Mr Dugald Thomson,"The listscollected on the former occasion were considered-to guide us approximately, at any rate, as to the number of electors within each electorate. Therefore, it would be undesirable to incur the very heavy expense of printing the rolls, which would prove to be wasteful, if a redistribution afterwards had to take place. Minister of Home Affairs a* question, which arises out of the answer given to the honourable member for Yarra. Is it the intention of .the Minister to take steps for a redistribution of seats in the various States, and, if so, how soon? the canvass made by the police is complete in all' the States, it is found that the discrepancies in the numbers of electors are far larger than are sanctioned by the Act, it will be the duty of the Ministry, in my opinion, to take Jsteps to appoint Commissioners in the States where the discrepancies occur, in order that a scheme of redistribution may be prepared and placed before Parliament at the earliest date possible in the following session. Minister whether, in view of the fact that no rolls are to be printed, any provision will be made to enable electors to ascertain whether or not their names are on the roll. Mistakes are frequently made in the process of collecting the roll, and I wish to know how these are to be made known to the electors. point out to the honourable member that, unless an election were anticipated at an early date, even the Revision Courts would afford no guarantee that the rolls were complete. course, the rolls are posted up for the scrutiny of electors. how careless electors are about ascertaining whether or hot their names are on the roll when they do not anticipate' an election. I would point out also that when the previous distribution was made, the canvass made by the police was considered to afford a sufficient basis for that work. Furthermore, the general experience shows that when a canvass is carefully made -as in the present instance-it results in the collection of a more complete roll than can be secured by any other method. Therefore, I think the lists will afford a sufficient lists are completed, every means will be indication of the numbers of electors in each division. one of the replies made by the Minister. I should like to know whether it is the policy of the Department not to hold Revision Courts at fixed periods each year? I mention this in view' of the necessity of having some means whereby electors who object to certain names remaining on the roll can state their case before the tribunal provided for under the Act. pressed no intention to ignore the necessity for holding Revision Courts, as provided for under the Act. Revision Courts will have to be held from time to time; but first of all, I think it is desirable, especially on the plea of economy, to define the electorates for which the rolls have to be prepared, and for which the Revision Courts will have to be held. The object of the questions which have been addressed to me has been to ascertain whether there is to be a revision held in connection with the rolls for the present divisions, prior to the printing of the rolls for the whole of the Commonwealth, or whether an attempt will first be made to re-distribute the seats. press for a reply to my question. I wish to know what provision is being made to enable electors to ascertain whether or not their names are on the roll-whethe r they have been struck off, as has frequently happened ? I had made very clear my present intentions in the matter. Electors can at any time go to the electoral officers and ascertain if their names are on the lists. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I desire to ask a question with regard to one point upon in the ordinary which the Minister has furnished only a partial reply. When I was Minister of Home Affairs, the great difficulty experienced in the Department arose from the fact that electors would not take the trouble to ascertain whether their names were on the roll. It was found desirable to issue provisional lists, which were made as complete as possible, and displayed at every post-office or other public office in the Commonwealth. By this means a great many names which otherwise would have been omitted from the rolls, were included. I desire to ask whether some such course will be taken upon the present occasion ?",14,Elector Al Administration

48,Mr Dugald Thomson,"When theadopted to ascertain whether they include the whole of the electors. , In view of the fact that the seats in certain States are likely to be re-distributed, the printing of the rolls at present would involve a waste of money. Any course that has been found of assistance in the past in completing the rolls will be again followed. Home Affairs has suggested that a redistribution of seats may be necessary in some cases. the event of its being found that Queensland is entitled to an extra member, it will not be found necessary to have a redistribution of seats through the Commonwealth. I have already informed the honourable member, in reply to a question on a previous occasion, that that matter would be inquired into. also been informed that the Prime Minister has referred the question to the Attorney-General. of the questions involved in the redistribution, and before any action is taken it will have to be considered.

A number of cases of this kind have come under my notice.

The question which we have to consider is chiefly one of ways and means. How are we to raise the necessary money for the payment of old-age pensions? As honourable members are aware, under our Constitution the Commonwealth is empowered to retain only one-fourth of the total Customs revenue collected in the different States. The balance of three-fourths must be returned to them. This is a question which has puzzled the profoundest economic thinkers of England. The greatest statesmen of. the world are now endeavouring to find a solution of this problem. Honourable Joseph Chamberlain is one poor man upon this earth who is "" undeof them. that he is problem. mission, child was a member, failed to find any speciallv wish to combat. It is the purest solution of it. Notwithstanding that in moonshine to talk about granting pensions proportion to its population there are more only to the good man who has walked the poor people in England than there are in path of Canaan all his life. It is not because any other country upon earth, up to the . an individual has walked along the oppopresent time no relief to them has been site path that he is poor ? What is poverty ? forthcoming c..v.ep,t by way of charity. In my opinion poverty is the social . and Our desire in this Commonwealth is to physical condition of individuals engendered destroy the whole semblance of charity. by insufficient means of support, which must Charity and pauperism must be absolutely be supplied either by charity or by force abolished, and an old-age pension must be in violation of law.

74,Mr Kingo ' Malley,"In discussingthey should be placed in these institutions, and treated by the best physicians until they are cured. If drink be a disease, why should the man who all his life has made his mouth a funnel, and his stomach a receptacle for liquor, and who has thereby contributed to the revenue of this country, be deprived in his old age of a pension ? If there is one individual more than another who is entitled to an old-age pension it is the unfortunate man who, throughout his life, has made a beer barrel or swill tub of himself. That is why I claim that the State ought to take over the whole of the liquor traffic, as it has done in South Carolina and Russia. We should make it a State institution, and out of the profits derived from it we should be able to save from starvation in their old age those 1 who have sacrificed themselves upon the altar of their country. My objection to the Danish system is that it provides pensions only for the deserving men and women. I do not wish anybody to understand that I desire the people of the Commonwealth to be other than good, honest, and sober citizens. But we have a duty to perform. We owe an obligation to our fellow men. It was laid down 2,000 years ago by the greatest moral teacher who ever appeared upon this planet that the strong should bear the burdens of the weak. That is the duty of the Commonwealth. drinks to excess, or who destroys his constitution by any vice, is not a responsible agent, and it is the duty of the State to come to'his aid. In France a system obtains which is known as the ""hospice."" There, homes have teen established in various country villages to which the poor are sent from all parts of France. In these institutions they are well cared for in their old age. Of course they are confined to a greater or less extent. They do not possess the liberty which is enjoyed in Australia by recipients of old-age pensions. They are under comparativelylittle restraint, however, and their prospects are indeed bright, cheerful, and hopeful. If the old people are able-bodied they are compelled to work in the gardens. Should they fall ill , they are placed in the hospitals, where their needs are well attended to. In fact, these homes are conducted very' much upon the lines of the State farm system, which obtains in Some of the American States. Unfortunately, in America they allow a contractor to take charge of the State farm, and while his treatment of theold people is more or less kind and sympathetic, the fact remains that he has to make some little profit out of the undertaking. The average American does not like to do much unless he can secure a profit from his labour, and these contracts must give some return. The old-age institutions of New York are situate on Blackwell's Island, where there is also a prison. The occupants of the homes are fairlv well -cared for, but the objectionable feature of their treatment is that they are deprived of their liberty. In Germany they provide for the aged poor by means of an insurance system, and the employ^ and the employer must contribute a certain propotion to the insurance fund. That system, however, would not be suitable to Australia, because we have not a military police force. If an emplove in Germany fails to give his usual contribution to the fund he mav be followed by the police, arrested, taken before a Court/ and compelled to pay. In a British community such a thing would not be tolerated. Mr G. B. EDWARDS A small sum could be deducted from a man's weekly .wages. but if an employee in Germanv fails to pav his usual contribution he mav be followed and arrested. They have also an elaborate system by which a man out of emplovment The individual who may be traced to any part of the counfv and forced to pay. I do not think that the German system would work in Australia. I have made a careful examination of the various systems in operation in the world, and have come to the conclusion that the best two are those of New South Wales and New Zealand. They are the most up-to-date to which we can point. I am sorry that in the matter of the care of the aged poor the United States of America are thousands of years, behind. I regret to confess that under the trust system in vogue there, a man is of no use after reaching the age of forty-five years. He is thrust aside, just as old machinerv on the mining field is discarded. Thaipractice must prevail wherever capital dominates the country. Where caoital and labour are not equal, there is always the danger of the capitalistic power doing as it pleases. I shall not further discuss the American system, because I do not tfiink much of it : but I would remind the House that even in Iceland the aged poor are cared for. The people there are numbered every year, and all the poor are distributed among the homes of the rich.'whr",17,Telegraph Linemen
75,Mr King 0 ' Malley,"That is so,have to contribute towards their maintenance. That is a better state of affairs than prevails even in Great Britain, for there we have in force no system of caring for the poor. In Holland, the municipalities look after the aged and destitute, and no one can starve. There is also a system in force in Sweden, while in Austria, under Joseph II . , a system of old-age pensions was established under which no man who has lived in the country up to the age of sixty years incurs any risk of starving. The one'country which boasts of its civilization -the mother of the English-speaking race, and the mother of Parliaments-ha s yet failed to do anything for her aged poor. A great mamy conferences on the subiect have been held in England, and I have before me the report of Lord Rothschild's Committee. Three schemes were submitted to its consideration-Hardy's , Booth's, and Chamberlain's schemes-and the Committee reportedi . That not one of the schemes submitted is feasible or desirable. a. That neither the Committee itself nor any of its members can suggest any scheme which would be workable,or beneficial, or other than objectionable. The Committee also reported thatThey had gone through the evidence, and report of the previous Royal Commission on the aged poor, and had examined and considered more than a hundred schemes, but had been reluctantly forced to the conclusion that any one of them would certainly injure rather than serve the best interests of the industrial population. A plan originating from the Committee itself was that any person aged sixty-five who had an income of as. 6d. a weekThis has always been the curse of good old England. The people of Great Britain always start on the dollar. In this respect they are as bad as the Americansbut less than 5s. should have it made up to 5s., partly by the State and partly out of the rates. But it was estimated that this munificent assistance House, some interestingfigurescompiled by alone would swallow up ^2,250,000 yearly, without allowing anything for the necessarily heavy expense of distribution; and it is urged that such a plan would encourage thriftWhat a remarkable hold the word ""thrift "" has upon our people. They even dream of it at nightup to saving enough to produce 2s. 6d. per week, but discourage it beyond that point. It will thus be seen that our good friends in gteat old England, which has bossed the earth for 1,000 years, talk about a man's thrift to the extent of 2s. 6d. per week. A poor man in Australasia would think nothing of giving a half-crown to a beggar Mr King O'Malley. at his door, and yet we have this talk about discouraging thrift. The average worker, who has but a limited degree of employment, and has a large family to support, cannot make provision for his old age. It is absurd to suggest that' he can. Working men cannot follow,, their usual employment on a wet, or a bad day. The clerk, the boss, and the manager are paid by the week, the month, or the year, but the one man who is paid by the hour is the labourer-the pick and shovel hand-and whenever there is a storm he has to knock off work and go home without pay. I do not think the average labourer in Australasia earns more than jQSo a year. The men employed at the Mount Lyell mine for a while were better treated than are most working men, but I know that whenever a storm occurs they have to knock off work. Can any honourable member tell me how a poor man earning 5s., 6s., or 7s. per day, and having eight or ten mouths to fill, can make provision for his old age when we are starving on £400 a year? It is ridiculous to think that he can. to hear the honourable member say "" Hear, hear."" I believe that if it were necessary he would contribute half his income to an old-age pension system.

I am not a proud manI do not know what. pride means; but I would rather bury myself than draw the charity or pauper's dole that Victoria gives in the name of an old-age pension. There are men in the destitute asylums of Australia who have been worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. In the Adelaide Destitute Asylum, I understand, there is a man who, thirty years ago, was a squatter in South Australia, and could write his cheque for £100,000. Bad times and bad seasons broke him up. ment, perhaps. Scotchmen are bad managers. When lhe honourable member for Fremantle, who presided over an old-age pensions coromir.sion, speaks on the subject, he will surprise honourable members. There are similar cases in New South Wales and in Tasmania. I have lent money to men who, when I came to Australia fifteen or sixteen years ago, could write their cheques for thousands of pounds. One such man died recently without enough to bury him. I mention these cases to show that old-age pensions are needed, not only for working men, but for men who have failed in the struggle for existence, or have been crushed out by monopolies. I am sincere in this matter. This is what Mr Johnston says on the subjectTo illustrate the financial aspect of the question of "" Old-Age Pensions,"" so far as the Commonwealth Treasurer and Commonwealth Taxpayer are concerned, I have prepared a table for you, showing :1. The cost of the New South Wales scheme. 2. The cost of the Victorian scheme. 3. The cost of the New Zealand scheme. From the experience of these States, as revealed in their latest statistics, valuable information is afforded as a guide to what may be expected to be the cost to the Commonwealth Treasurer, accordingly as the method adopted follows one or other of the three States referred to. Thus, if the method adopted followed that of New South Wales, I estimate that the immediate cost to the Commonwealth would be about ,£1,520,000 yearly ; if by Victorian method, which can only be regarded as an extension of the common "" out of door relief "" system, the cost annually would be about ^566,751; by the New Zealand provision, the cost would be, approximately, ,£1,045,950. I am inclined to think the latter the more practicable form to both the pensioner of sixty-five years o i age, and over, and to the general taxpayer. The Victorian restrictions"" make its pension provision too much of the nature of a charitable dole. I am strongly of opinion that an "" old-age pension"" scheme should be free from the taint of a charity. It should be regarded as a tontine system of insurance for old age. It is found to be the general experience that about 1*39 to 1 ""58 per cent, of the total population would require to be supported by a pension after the age of sixty-five years. I have therefore made a calculation that all persons who have for the period of twenty-five years contributed to taxation for poor rates, a sum equal to is. iod. per annum are fairly entitled to obtain a pension at the age of sixty-live, provided that their total income does not exceed with a pension the sum of £52 per annum, and that the maximum pension for one person, as in New South Wales, does not exceed £26 per annum. The expectation of life for a person sixty-five years old may be taken roundly as eleven years. Zealand scheme provides for those. Mr Johnston continuesA sum of 15.32 pence per nead per year, paid as a tax for twenty-five years, should also, on the Tontine system, secure for the needy survivors a pension equal to that provided by New Zealand. These calculations of mine were based upon assuming interest at 3 per cent. It might be well to establish a special reserve fund for this purpose, to which annually would be credited the is. iod. or is. 5d. tax or premium per head, levied by way of charge on Customs and Excise. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -That is an insurance system. Johnston is a man of many parts, and is giving us the benefit of his ideas. He continuesThis method would l if t the pension scheme into a bond fide insurance, not tinged with the "" charity "" aspect, which would touch the tender susceptibilities of the better class of people. I hope those figures and observations may be of service to you when touching upon this very important matter. I have read this letter in order to show honourable members that there are other'ways of settling this question. I desire to read a few remarks uttered by Mr Seddon, whom I regard as the greatest statesman in the Southern Hemisphere, so far as the old-age question is concerned. He has solved the problem. He saysI said I should refer to what has been done in Victoria. The evidence tendered before that Committee enabled it to come to conclusions which, in effect, are as follows :Many who have borne the heat and burden of the day have to face want-mor e the result of want and insufficient remuneration than thriftlessness. He there refers to the old-age pension system in Victoria, which is a charitable dole. The Commission in Victoria years ago recommended the payment of a reasonable and substantial old-age pension; but, unfortunately, matters were allowed to drift, and eventually Members of Parliament failed to take a sufficiently broad view of the question.

From that stand-point the honourable member for Darwin was justified in declaring that such a scheme would expenditure gested. South Wales and Victoria some of our most enterprising citizens have been disqualified from receiving an old-age pension because they have not continuously lived in either of those States for a sufficient length of time. I am not aware of the numerical strength of that class, but I claim that it represents a sufficient number to justify the statement that the matter is one of urgency. I am aware that some time ago the New South Wales Government communicated with the Victorian Government upon the subject, with a view to entering into an arrangement to deal with cases of that description. But owing to the reluctance of Victoria to incur any further liabilities, nothing tangible has resulted. Although the Government of this State have since had a surplus at their disposal, no provision has been made by them for granting this class of individuals a reasonable old-age allowance. I hold that the Commonwealth can deal with this matter in a better way than can the States. honourable members are unanimously favour of this motion, I wish it to be clearly made should be distinctly in the nature of a pension, so that its recipients may feel that they are under no obligation to any one. We ought to pay pensions to our poor in the' same way that we grant them to our Judges upon retirement from the Bench. The recipients should be made to feel that they have earned the pension by their contributions to the revenue. spite of the unsettled conditions which are incidental to the development of new countries, Australians have shown that they are not a people who neglect to exercise what is known as ""thrift."" the friendly societies movement as an example. I find that there are 137 societies registered in the Commonwealth, with a membership roll of 270,825. cumulated funds amount to Then, again, I find that, as regards life assurance, there are 414,296 policies in force, covering a risk of Ir is evident, therefore, .that the masses Mr Spence. of the people cannot be charged with What we have to establish is the neglecting to provide for contingencies in the shape of sickness, accident, or death.

We have to accept human nature as we find it. Whilst we may regret that a person should give way to influences which lower his character and reduce his stamina, the fact remains that every person is entitled to live under reasonably comfortable conditions. According to Coghlan, there are 14,000 persons in our hospitals for insane, and nearly an equal number in our benevolent asylums. The total annual provision made by Australians towards the support of the helpless and indigent, represents u s . 6d. per head of its population. Consequently, we cannot be charged with having neglected to adopt humanitarian measures. In this Parliament we are called upon to devise the best method of consolidating some of these forms of relief, thereby easing the claims which are at present made on benevolent asylums, hospitals, and various other charitable institutions. I maintain that AlthoughI am aware that we can provide those who have attained in a certain age with a pension, without materially adding to the burden which is understood that the allowance at present borne by the community. The honourable member for Darwin spoke of some deserving individuals, who at one time were exceedingly wealthy, but for whose future some provision now requires to be made. I would remind honourable members that at the time of the bank crisis, many were ruined who had never anticipated the possibility of such a calamity. In Many individuals who are poor to-day have been very wealthy. They had supposed themselves to be independent for the remainder of their lives. In new countries, however, the conditions which have proTake the case of duced these results always exist.

My idea is that every person at sixtv-five years of age £108,123,705 if not earlier-shoul d be granted a pension.

It may be true that the system in operation in New South Wales is open to abuse, but to my mind, the only ground on which it can be justly attacked is that its administration is too costly. If the States systems were consolidated, the cost of administration would be materially reduced, and I think that the Commonwealth might wisely deal with the whole question.

The Chairman of the Select Committee on old-age pensions, who has made this subject a life-long study, is absent, owing to ill-health, and I should not like him to learn to-morrow when he opens his newspaper that we have taken the matter out of the hands of the Committee by passing this motion. The honourable member for Gwydir poses as a philosopher when it suits him to do so, but there are occasions when he loses his head, just as does any other honourable member. I think that the honourable member for Darwin has made out an excellent case for the establishment of a Commonwealth system. Every one admits the necessity for such a scheme, but we have to consider, among other things, at what age a person should be entitled lo receive a pension, and to what class of persons the pension should be confined. I was a member of a Select Committee appointed by the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, which dealt with this question some years ago, and which recommended a tax on amusements to provide the necessary funds. the Government are showing that they favour the establishment of a Commonwealth system? shown that they are anxious to assist the movement by agreeing to the appointment of a Select Committee, and I have only to repeat that to pass this motion this afternoon would be to insult members of that body.

This Bill calls into exercise the powers conferred by section 51, paragraph x i v . , of the> Constitution, which provides thatThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, I have known the honorder, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to. . . . Insurance other than State insurance; also State concerned. The measure purports to deal only with part of the law relating to life assurance. L if e assurance generally has been dealt with by the legislation of the States, but the particular measure which I am submitting for the consideration of the House deals with a branch of life assurance which has not been regulated by any State Act. It deals with what is known as industrial' life assurance, a class of assurance which is used almost entirely by the working classes, under which lives are assured for small amounts, the premiums being paid at weekly intervals to collectors, who go round from place to place to get the money. It is a form of assurance which has been brought into existence solely by the needs of the workers-. The Bill does not deal with all the branches of industrial life assurance"", but only with the assurance of the lives of children under the age of ten years. This class of business is, in Australia, not subject 10 any legal regulation, except for a regulation governing the action of Friendly Societies, to which I shall presently refer. In agreeing to the second reading, of the Bill, honourable members will be affirming the desirability of limiting the sum for which the lives of children under the age of ten years may be assured.

Pil l provides a safeguard against that. It is based on English experience, and I think that I shall be able to show that the limitations which it imposes completely prevent anything improper from being done. Industrial life assurance originatedin Engby a Select Committee, and in 1850 it was land in 1854, when the Prudential Company took the matter in hand. In 1875 it spread to the United States, and in 1887 was established in Australia. The manner in which it has since extended, and the fact that it 1 has been adopted by the leading nations of the world, shows that it meets a natural want, and the legislation of other places is a recognition of the fact that the business is a legitimate one. The number of policies in force in Great Britain and Ireland, according to the latest returns furnished by the Board of Trade is 22,518.046, covering assurances on lives of all ages, from that of the young child up to the person of seventy years. These policies are held by persons belonging to the working classes, and equal in number more than one-third of the population of Great Britain and Ireland, and they represent a value of £221,137,641. adopting the system, followed the English example, and one large company took over from Great Britain about 2,000 omcers, with their wives and families, in order to more nearly follow English methods.

In Australia, the policies, number 312,143, and represent a yalue of £6.712,597. The policies which coyer children in the United Kingdom number 4,000,000. Those figures relate, I think, to 1896.

The question of allowing assurances to be effected on the lives of children has been before the British public for a great many years. So far back as 1829 a FriendThe ly Society's Act was in force, which prevented minors from becoming members of such societies. In 1846, however, another Act was passed, limiting membership and insurance to those over the age of six years. The subiect was investigated in 1849 enacted that friendly societies might assure children under the age of ten years for limited amounts, the payment to be made only to undertakers. That Act was repealed in 1855, when the British Parliament allowed the assurance to be increased to £ 6 for children up to the age of five years, and to £ 1 0 for children up to the age of ten years. In 1875, assurance was again permitted, but it was enacted that the money should be paid to parents or personal representatives of parents only. In 1896 the matter was again the subject of legislation, and the law was re-enacted in the P'riendly Societies Act of that year. Honourable members will see that the principle of permitting money to be paid upon the death of children, even from the time of birth up to the age of ten years, has become firmly embedded in the legislation of the United Kingdom. Therefore, The United States, in we have a very safe precedent to proceed upon. We find, further, that the principle has been affirmed by the Parliaments of the States. In New South Wales and Queensland legislation,' based upon principles the same as those in the Friendly Societies Act of i8g6, has been adopted, and I believe that a similar statute is in force in Western Australia. In Tasmania and Victoria, -money is permitted to be paid upon the death of children under ten years of age,' but the principle of paying the undertaker is adhered to The question of permitting assurance companies'to undertake'this business",25,Second Reading

In 1890 or 1891 a Bil l was introduced and referred to a Select Committee. The object of that measure was to accomplish the end held in view in connection with the Bil l now before us, namely, to limit the amount of money that might be paid over upon the death of a child. A Committee of the House of Lords' sat. and investigated the whole question, and in 1891 reported that the Bil l should not be proceeded with: However, in 1896, an Act was passed, practically without any debate, whereby the principle was affirmed that assurance companies which undertook this particular class of business should be limi--amount for which the children's lives are ted as to the amounts to be paid over. for imposing limitations? ject was to prevent the possibility of parents, custodians, or guardians of children having a motive for their destruction. A good deal of evidence was adduced upon that point, and the argument based upon the presumption that the motive referred to might be brought into play was answered. I think it can be shown conclusively that no such evil existed in England. I do not believe that any such thing exists here. It was, however, regarded as a proper thing to limit the amount, in order to safeguard the lives of"" children. If the amount be limited there cannot be any motive for the destruction of child life. To prohibit the assurance of the lives of children, because such a motive might exist in some cases, would be no'more justifiable than to prohibit fire assurance because one or two cases of arson were recorded. At the same time, it is advisable to legislate to prevent persons from taking improper advantage of the system of assuring children's lives. and learned member tell us anything with regard to the average amount for which children are now assured by the companies undertaking this particular class of business in Australia? cies in existence, and they vary in amount according to the age of the child.

It is practised to some extent, but there is no legal basis for it. The experience in the mother country, and in America, has been productive of so much good, and the volume of assurance business has grown so enormously, that I think we may safely support this measure. The very fact that business has so rapidly increased, shows that it supplies a public want, and I imagine that it will be under right auspices if it be placed under the direction of the great assurance societies in our midst. leading assurance companies have approached me with a request that I should use my influence to get this Bill passed as speedily as possible. tation whatever in giving that undertaking. In supporting the Bill, I must express the hope that the House will be able to see -its way .to place it upon the statute-book this session. it? useful feature to the scope of assurance operationsa feature which will be of service to fhe general community, and especially to the poorer classes. orable members are aware, I have taken a very great interest in the auestion of State life assurance, and it might, therefore, be supposed that I am an opponent of this measure. But, as I have stated upon more than one occasion, it seems to me that the State cannot very well undertake industrial life assurance as generally conducted at present. upon to discuss that issue in connection with this Bill. As the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, has very properly pointed out, at the present time there are no regulations affecting industrial life assurance, and therefore I welcome a proposal, which, though it does not absolutely prevent assurances being effected upon the lives of children, surrounds the practice with wholesome conditions under Act of Parliament. Under these circumstances, I am I suppose the fact a supporter of the Bill, and I trust that it may shortly become law. When I asked what was the reason for the introduction of this B ill , I was ignorant of the motive of its author. There is nothing upon the surface of the measure to indicate This the evil it proposes to cure. If the only reason for its introduction be that which has been furnished by the honourable and learned member, I think that his statement in reply to an interjection by the honourable member for Bourke absolutely cuts the ground' from under his feet. If , as is affirmed, the average of the assurances now in force is less than that contemplated by this B ill , there ' is no need for its introduction. instances in which the amount of the assurances effected is very much higher.

148,Mr Mccoll (Echuca),"I congratulatein America assurance has frequently been undertaken by companies which were in anything but a stable financial position, with the result that many families have been ruined. This measure will remedy abuses of that sort. It constitutes a move in the right direction, because it will be the pennies of the poor which will be paid under its operation. The measure also limits the amount of the assurance which may be effected. Whilst that amount is lower than that which is fixed in the Bil l at the present time, companies are not prevented from incurring larger risks if they choose to do so. This Bill will prevent that. I have no doubt that industrial assurance will be the assurance of the future. The days of large assurances are past. I trust that before long the whole question of assurance will be taken over by the Commonwealth. Certainly, this House should encourage the system of life assurance, which probably exercises one of the most beneficent influences of modern times.

But what is easier than for a depraved woman to put her hand over a child's mouth and to stop its breathing ? Another means of destroying infantile life which is often adopted is to give the child a little piece of chamois leather to suck. It is first dipped in water, and sweetened with sugar. When the child has sucked this into its windpipe and has ceased to breathe, the piece of leather is withdrawn.

Its value, to my mind, is rendered nugatory by clause 5, which provides that it shall not apply to any insurable interest. A t the present time a life assurance company need not pay moneys due under a policy, unless that policy expresses an insurable interest, so that the Bill really provides that a life assurance company shall not pay what at present it need not pay.

But it is not in South Australia, nor in some of the other States, whose laws more closely approximate to what legislation now-a-days ought to be.

It can do no harm, if we allowed insurances on children's lives at all, to place a law on the statute-book, except that, in the eyes of there are persons outside Australia who study our institutions-it will suggest that it was passed because similar conditions to those which justified the passing of like legislation in England existed in Australia. In these circumstances, I regret that some honourable members think that necessity exists for the passing of such a scare measure. wish to say a word or two in reply honourable Angas. From my own experience of what has taken place in South Australia, I agree with the honourable and learned member for When Darling Downs that the B ill is highly necessary. I have known infant life to be sacrificed in a wholesale way in that State. I saw no less than four funerals of children leave the one house within six weeks, and on making inquiries, was satisfied that it was a case of baby-farming. Whether, the lives of these children were assured' I do not know; but I communicated my suspicions to the police, and asked them to make inquiries. sure the life of a child in her care. of a child handed over to a baby-farmer might be ""assured by the parents in the interests of the baby-farmer herself.

184,And Learned Member For Mr Webster,"Whilst we must giveprovision for the expense of burying children who die young, we must foe careful not to allow a system to grow up which may provide an incentive to persons to dispose of their children in a manner which is not uncommon in the older countries of the world, and is not unknown in Australia. known here every day. we find that not only working class parents whose employment is irregular and whose wages are small, but other parents', are unwilling to take upon themselves the burden of rearing large families, and the honourable member for Angas has referred to the frequency of ante-natal infanticide, which is well known to honourable members who have studied this question. It becomes, therefore, all the more important that we should not pass legislation which, by allowing the assurance of the lives of children under the age of five years, might provide an incentive for their destruction. As the honourable member for Hunter has pointed out, it is so easy to dispose of children of tender years, that those who are ill-disposed are greatly tempted to destrov them. When children arrive at the age of five years they near the time when they will be of use to their parents, and consequently become a prospective asset to their families. We should do nothing to encourage the destruction of children, which is so prevalent in other countries where population is congested, and should do all we can to encourage our population to undertake the responsibility of parentage. I trust, therefore, that in Committee the honourable member for Darling Downs will accept an amendment which will make it illegal to assure the life of a child who is under the age of five years. have not considered the scope of this Bill, but it seems to me that if we are going to interfere at all in regard to child assurance, we should interfere in the direction of preventing persons from assuring children of tender age. Child life assurance is to a great extent a swindle. The parents of the children assured as a rule get nothing from the assurance. numerous. of cases in which parents have assured three or four of their children, and have paid the premiums for a time, but in the end have found the payments to be such a drag upon them that they have been compelled to let their policies go. I am inclined to allow persons to assure the lives of their children for endowment policies, but certainly not for the payment of the sum assured at death. The number of parents who get an advantage from the present system of child assurI t is becoming more ance is very small compared with the number who get no advantage from it. remedy in their own hands. member knows anything about assurance canvassers, he knows that there are few women who can resist their appeals. If the parents went to the offices themselves, and took out the assurances, it would be a different matter. Honourable members know how, in their own cases, if they wish to take out assurances on their lives, they are pestered' by agents who tell them all sorts of things. Assurance agents do not tell the truth. They make representations which are absolutely false. saying is a fact. I tried a bit of canvassing myself once, but I had to throw it up.

His statements are absolutely accurate. I do not go so far as to say that the lives of children under six years of age should not be assured, though I would do so if the Cbmmonwealth wereas wise as (certain European countries are, and was ready to bury its own citizens, removing the reproach which the present system of pauper burial puts upon Victoria, and, I think, the other States as well. I hope that the wisdom of the Federal Parliament will ultimately remove that disgrace upon our civilization as the Federal Parliament of Switzerland has removed it from the I know of a number twenty-two cantons, and the two half-cantons of that little country.

I hope that the statesmen of Australia will in time provide a national system of life assurance similar to that in force in New Zealand. If that were done, it would remove from the Commonwealth the stigma which now attaches to it for allowing human beings fashioned in God's likeness to be buried as paupers. I would not go as far as the honourable member for Hunter in preventing the assurance of children of tender age, because I know what a serious thing the expense of a funeral is in the homes of the poor.

241,Mr Thomas (Barrier),"I desire'toremoved from the metropolis. Many matters arise which require immediate attention, . and these cannot be properly dealt with under present conditions. The cost of sending an inspector out from Sydney Cliffs or Milparinka is excessive, and the delay entailed in travelling precludes the prompt settlement of any difficulty which may demand his attention. I trust that the Postmaster-General will cause inquiries to be made into this matter, and that he will 'see his way clear to bring about a change whichwill confer a great benefit upon those who are living in the outlying portions of New South Wales. I am very glad that no tender has yet been accepted for the conveyance of the English mails. Entirely apart from the White Australia question, I am opposed to the Postal Department granting subsidies to steam-ship other than those in connection with the carrying of mails. I understand that subsidies have been granted for various other reasons connected with trade and commerce, and that the Post Office has had to pay the piper. We have been told-that if we do not grant subsidies to the English mail companies, the German and French companies will gradually outstrip them, and probably drive them out of the trade. It may be desirable to pay a substantial subsidy in order to insure the maintenance of a good service between the Commonwealth and the old country, but I object to its being debited to the Post Office. It is unfair that the general public, who pay postage, should be called upon to contribute directly to a subsidy which is paid to the steam-ship companies in order to inbecome so popular that it will be in every duce them to provide facilities for the carhouse, in just the same way that we find riage of butter and other produce. If it be necessary to give subsidies in order to induce the steam-ship companies to provide refrigerating chambers, they should be paid by the Customs, or other Departments affected. The Post Office has been unduly weighted in this respect in the past, and in the days of the telephone industry there were many cases postal and telegraph facilities have been refused on the ground that the Department was not paying. However desirous the Postmaster-General mav be to help the producers, I trust that he will see by the message, and a similar method of charging that his Department is not unduly burdened with charges of the description I have indicated. The honourable member for Gwydir referred to the necessity of improvsystem of Guernsey charges exclusively by the ing our. telephone system. half years ago, when the Postand Telegraph Bill was under consideration, I suggested that an arrangement should be made by which subscribers would be called upon to pay in proportion to the extent to which they used the telephone. It would be a to a place like White good thing if we could have a meter or indicator attached to each instrument, which would show the extent to which it was being used, and enable the Department to rate the subscriber accordingly. I find thai the foil system, mentioned by the honourable member for Gwydir, is now being almost universally adopted. Lord Stanley, the Postmaster-General of Great Britain, in a recent official communication, after stating that under a message-rate plan, the London telephone system had rapidly grown to about 70,000 exchange telephones, saidThe proper method of charge for an exchange service is that under which the payments of the companies forpurposes subscribers are fixed in proportion to their user. In the United States, where, during the last few years, the telephone exchange system has been largely improved and developed, methods of charge of this kind have been widely adopted, and have proved an effective means of increasing the number of subscribers. A plan under which subscribers pay in proportion to use was introduced in Manhattan and The Bronx (old New York City) in 1894. There were then less than 10,000 telephones in the city-. In the same area there are now more than 133,000. I desire to direct honourable members' attention to a statement contained in a book written by Mr Herbert Lawes Webb, who seems to be an authority upon the telephone service. He is very strongly in favour of the adoption of the toll system. I am very anxious that the telephone shall gas and water laid on at present. .1 do not suggest that the Government should popularize the telephone at a loss. Mr Webb saysThe message rate system of telephone charges is by no means a recent invention. Very early in acute observers who saw the evils of the flat rate, and suggested that to base the tariff on the traffic would be the more equitable method of charging. For a good many years there have been telephone systems in America where the charge has been made has for some time been in force in Switzerland, and, partially, in Sweden and in Germany. In this country also, message rates have been introduced during recent years; the States telephone message, and has no flat rate. In the case of Two and a Guernsey, the rapid development of a system which has grown in six years from 200 or 300 stations to over 1,200, is chiefly attributable to the -idoption of the message rate system of charging, tn England the adoption of message rales generally has always been opposed by the large users of the service, who have felt that such a system of rates would cause their telephone service to cost them more than it now does. The conferences of local authorities, occasionally held 10 pass resolutions on the telephone question, invariably advocate flat rates; the delegates to these <:cnf erences are presumably business men who *ise the telephone service largely, and naturally think 'hat the most desirable arrangement is a low rate for unlimited service. This, however, is a short sighted view. It is true that under a message rate tariff some very large users would pay more for telephone service than they now pay, but they would get greater facilities, and an improved service, as with message rates special arrangements for large users are made, which enable them to get much better results from their telephone service than they get by overworking a single line. On. the other hand, the adoption of message rates, by making a low minimum rate possible, opens the gates to a wide development of the telephone service, and so makes the service much more valuable to the whole community. The best example I can give of the fructifying effects of message rates is from across the Atlantic. Up lo 1894 the telephone tariff in New York was a Hat rate tariff, and in seventeen years the system had slowl-/ grown to about 10,000 stations. In 1894 the first message rate tariff was tentatively adopted. The tariff is now exclusively message rate, and the system has grown in nine years from -0,000 stations to over 100,000. Nine years of message rate development have done ten times as much to popularize the telephone service as seventeen years of fiat rates. The same writer goes on to sayI f the flat rate for telephone service were abolished altogether, and an exclusively message rate taiiff adopted, coupled with an efficient service and a free development of the business, public dissatisfaction with telephone rates would very scon disappear. The fairness of the message rate principle appeals to the common sense of the majority of the telephone users. It would not be practicable, of course, to abolish the flat rates now in force at one swell swoop. That would naturally arouse much resentment. But after a certain date no new flat rate orders would be taken, and as flat rate contracts expired new contracts would be made under message rates. Thus the change would come about gradually and give rise to little friction. With a scientifically arranged message rate tariff, the small user and the large user are both systematically provided for ; the small user gets the amount of service he wants at a rate which he can afford to pay, and the large user gets facilities to deal with his telephone traffic in such an effective way that he usually admits that the improvement is well worth the money. I hope that the Postmaster-General will take this matter into very serious consideration. I am not asking for a system which is novel. As a matter of fact, it is now being adopted in every place which is possessed of an up to-date telephone service. Iri other respects, too, we are behind the times. For instance, Mr Thomas. the manner in which subscribers are required to ring up the exchange and to ring oif is antiquated. An up-to-date telephone system obviates the necessity for the use of a bell. I shall be very glad if the Minister can see his way clear to adopt the message rate system, and also if he will make inquiries with a view to ascertain whether it is not possible to dispense with the services of operators in the exchange room. From what I have read, I gather that in many places in the United States automatic switch boards are now being used. The Bankers' Magazine for last month contains a very interesting article, upon this subject. It i's written by Mr G. G. Turri, a patents agent in Victoria. The article in question is headed, "" The World of Invention,"" -and in it the writer statesThe automatic switch board, although it does away with manual labour, is no more complicated, and is less liable to get out of order than a manual one. The manual system of telephony is prolific of many annoyances and delays due largely to the carelessness or poor articulation, either of the switch board operator, or the person asking a connection. These imperfections cannot be remedied in manual practice, and they can only be eliminated by the introduction of a device which places the calling and connecting processes entirely in the hands of a machine. This is just what the new system does; it instantaneously connects the subscriber with the person desired, and gives to them a secret, or private line, over which to talk. Numerous exchanges now in operation are proof of its complete success. The writer goes on to sayThe frequent delays and mistakes of common telephony are entirely unknown to the users of automatic. The latter never makes errors, never gossips, is never tired or. sleepy, is not interested in the subscribers affairs, is never impudent or saucy; and there is a refreshing absence of responses from the central office, such as ""What number did you say?"" "" T a l k louder."" "" D i d you get him?"" ""Are you through ?"" & c , &c. The same number of switches are always at work in an automatic exchange, whether the hour be night or day.. In the common practice the number of operators is increased during the busy hours and decreased when the night comes on, and the volume of business is lax. Mr Turri claimsthat the machine can be appliednot only to the larger cities, but to the smallest village, or even to the squatters' homestead, the factory, or any other place where a number of telephones have to be in connection, and where it is desired to work at the very minimum of expense, both for original equipment and for maintenance. To-day I called upon Mr Turri, and asked to be informed where any of these switchboards are in use. In reply, he has forwarded me a communication, stating that they are being used by over 51,000 subscribers in twenty-three cities of the United States, varying from villages having n o telephones-only, to Chicago, where six months ago over 8,000 subscribers were connected by' the automatic system. The Postmaster-General should certainly inquire into this matter. there at the present time making inquiries into the telephone system. do not act upon the reports which are supplied by our officers. We all know that constant applications are being made for the establishment of telephone exchanges in various parts of the Commonwealth. I think it would be wise for the Postmaster-General to secure one of these automatic switchboards, and to instal it in a small country town by way of experiment. In connection with the Post Office, I should like to see a Committee, consisting of three or four persons outside of the Department, appointed to report to this House every three or six months as to what improvements ought to be introduced' in regard to telegraphy, telephony, or letter deliveries. slaves of red tape and sealing-wax in the Post Office. mittee of skil led men appointed for the purpose. this House? other matter to which I should' like to refer, and that is the necessity for the introduction of a Commonwealth stamp. that the book-keeping provisions of the Constitution interfered with the issue of such a stamp, but surely after nearly four years of Federation we should be able to find some means to overcome the difficulty. -When the States entered the Federation it was certainly thought that we should have one stamp common to Australia. Those who live in the capital cities do not realize the inconvenience which the present system entails on travellers and residents iu the border towns. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -A Commonwealth stamp would be a convenience in the matter of the exchange of small sums of monev -of his predecessors, I must say that since master-General may remain in office for a long time, or for only a short period; but if he succeeds in providing automatic switchboards, in seeing that the telephones are paid for by those who use them, and i.i introdiucing a Commonwealth stamp, I am sure we shall all admit at the end of his term that he has done good service. hardly say that I have very little fault to find with the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department, either by the present Government or by those who have pre-' ceded them, since the establishment of the Commonwealth. It is undoubtedly a great socialistic institution. If there is a fault to be found with it, it lies in the circumlocution which obtains throughout the service. There are many complaints from residents of the more remote States of the Commonwealth with regard to the delay which takes place in attending to their requirements Under the present system, they have first of all to send their request to their representative, who refers it to the Postmaster-General or the Secretary of the Department. It is then .sent on to the Deputy Postmaster-General of the State in question, who refers it to an inspector, and that officer interviews one or two prominent individuals, to whose interest it is perhaps to allow things to remain as they are. He then reports to the Deputy Postmaster-General, who in turn reports to the Secretary of the Department. The Secretary informs the Postmaster-General of the nature of the report, and the Postmaster General, after two or three months have been spent in this way, communicates with There is only one the representative of those making the request. By this time the Postmaster-General has probably forgotten all about the nature of the request.

I think we have legitimate cause for complaint in this respect.

I am continually receiving communications from'settlers' and farmers' associations inquiring what has been done in regard to their complaints, but owing to the delay shown by the Department in dealing with correspondence,, I am unable to give them any information. I recognise, of course, that the Minister has been busily engaged in preparing his estimates, but he is not always occupied in that way. honourable member refers relates more particularly to the officers of the Department. able member writes to the Minister, he naturally expects to receive a reply. mental officers. circumlocution, not only in the Post and Telegraph Department, but in most of the Commonwealth offices. The present state of affairs may be satisfactory to the representatives of New South Wales and Victoria, but it is not to the representatives of the other States. Complaints which, prior to Federation, were attended to in the course of a few days, are now delayed for riionths. The people, naturally blame their representatives, and although we are badgering .the Minister and' the Secretary of the Department to which the business relates, our constituents say, "" It' is your fault."" Too many of these matters are referred to inspectors who have got into the old groove, and are administering .the Departments as they were conducted by the States, and not as they should be conducted by the Commonwealth. It would be wise to make a change in some cases by transferring officers from Queensland to Victoria or New South Wales, and vice versa, and calling upon them to report upon things as they are, and not as they are represented to be by those who have had the ear of the authorities in the past. Many conveniences which might legitimately have been supplied to growing settlements in Queensland, have been denied simply because inspectors have prejudged the requests of the people concerned, and have reported against them. would have been not only a convenience to the people, but a source of revenue to the Department, have been refused in this way. Postmaster-General has been endeavouring to obtain information for me with respect to the cost of carrying on this Department in Queensland, prior to, and since the establishment of Federation. I desired to deal with the question on these Estimates, but unfortunately the necessary statistics have not come to hand. I know, however, that shortly before Federation.. the cost of carrying the mails in Queensland was largely increased. Let me quote an instance to which I have previously referred. The Queensland Railway Department was paid £40,000 per annum for carrying the mails up to the end of 1900, but under the Estimates for the following year that payment was increased by £10,000. It was known that the Federation would be established during that year, and that the Post and Telegraph Department would be taken over by the Commonwealth. In other words, the State allowed the Railway Department £50,000 for carrying a smaller volume of mail material than if had been carrying for many years. As a matter' of fact, we were then suffering from a period of depression, and the volume of mail matter was not anything like SD large as it had been. But the vote for the carriage of these mails by the railways was increased to £50,000, and that'has become a charge on the Commonwealth. ment does not pay. this point should be emphasized. The Commonwealth is being decried on all sides, on the ground of its extravagant expenditure, and I do not think sufficient notice is taken of the fact that we have now to pay for services rendered to the transferred Departments which were previously carried out free of cost by other Departments of the State. I should like the Postmaster-General to tell us, for example, where our mail bags are made, and also where our postage stamps are printed. .In pre-Federation days, the mail bags used by the Queensland Post and Telegraph Department were made by the prisoners at'St. Helena, and the Department obtained them without cost. Nowadays, however, we have to pay for them. Then, again, the vouchers and returns that are enclosed in the mail bags were also printed by the State Government Printing Services which Office, and no charge was made against the Department. The Commonwealth, however, has a charge made against the Department in respect of all these services, For nearly a fortnight the and the consequence is that the cost of ad-",44,Postmaster General S Department

As the honourable member must know, a great deal of the saddlery and harness made by the prisoners was put on the open market to compete with the product of free workers. For all these services the Commonwealth has now to pay, and the same remark applies to the printing of Customs returns, entry forms, and other documents for the Customs Department. able member has made a mistake. The Department always paid for these services. making bookkeeping entries did not obtain until a Board of Commissioners, consisting of Messrs. Mathieson, Johnston, and Gray, was appointed in 1889, and insisted that every service rendered by the Railway Department to other State Departments should be credited to it. In the same way, other Departments began to charge for services rendered by them to the Railway Department of the State, but it was not until the advent of these Commissioners that the practice was initiated. We have to pay for all these services, and the outside public think that because these entries' are made against our administration, we are increasing the cost of carrying on the business of the Department. It is not fair that that impression should be left on the public mind. It may be the case in regard to some of the States, but it is certainly not the case in regard to Queensland. Reference has been made to a system of charging special fees for late letters posted on railway stations. That is an especial hardship for country people. Every resident of Victoria enjoys the advantages of the penny postage system within the State, while those living within so many miles of the capitals and chief towns of the other States enjoy a similar privilege within their particular area; but other country people have to pay 2d. on every letter, and an additional penny for late fee. The brought experts from Sydney and other places to devise means to more expeditiously collect the city mails, and forward them by early trains to the country, and, in short, every facility is given to those who live in the city and suburbs. If any should be favoured, however, it is those who are facing the hardships of pioneering life, the people who have denied themselves the It was not, nor pleasures of society, and the conveniences which are to be obtained in large centres of population, in order to develop the back country. We pay officers to travel on the mail trains and sort the let'.ers en route, and I think that it is altogether unjust, when a man, after his day's work, has ridden several miles to post a letter at a railway station, to charge him an extra penny in addition to a 2d. stamp for the privilege of posting, it on the train. I give the Postmaster-General credit for desiring to improve and cheapen our I think the honormeans of postal communication. Whether his . ideas can be successfully carried into effect remains to be seen; but he The system of is working on the right lines in trying to devise means whereby small centres of population may more readily communicate with larger centres, and thus more easily > find a market for their produce. Only those who have lived in the back country, and have borne the burden and heat of the day there, know how much country people have to put up with, and how entirely they are at the mercy of those in the city. The revelations of the Butter Commission show howthey are exploited by the middlemen. Therefore the Postmaster-General deserves the thanks of honourable members for his attempts to cheapen communication. I hope that he will persist in his attempts to cheapen telephonic communication by running the wires along the fences, or by supporting them, from trees, or by means of wireless communication Finally, I wish to say again that I think that there is too much delay on the part of his officers in replying to communications addressed to the Department by honourable members. have listened with attention to the remarks of the honourable member for Barrier, who takes a great deal of interest in postal matters. In New South Wales we used to call him the local Henniker Heaton. No doubt he is to be complimented upon the attitude which he takes in regard to the Post Office. I doubt, however, that the introduction of the new arrangements which he Postmaster-General has recently suggested would of itself overcome all the trouble connected with our present administration.

262,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"Imembers, have to complain of the circumlocution and delay which occurs in the Postal Department in connection with the transmission of ordinary business. It seems to me that the best thing one can do after addressing a letter to the Department is to forget all about it, and then, when the matter is quite forgotten, a reply may come unexpectedly, as a pleasant surprise. The remedy for the present state of affairs is to leave matters of detail to the administrative heads in the various States. Under the present system it is almost impossible to fix the responsibility for delays. The honourable member for Moreton complained that ttojy are the fault of -the inspectors; but the delay is caused by referring matters to Melbourne, while the Central Office blames the States officials. We all know that the Postmaster-General wishes to remedy these matters, and I think he should therefore lay down some definite rule of administration, which will fix the responsibility for dela'y upon the heads in the various States. A little while ago a case was brought under my notice, in which a postmaster, whose window was broken by a storm, so that the wind was blowing all over the office, had the pane replaced without consulting the Head Office, but he received a fine rap over the knuckles for spending money without referring the matter to Head-Quartets, which means to Melbourne. Postmaster-General for the State. method is unbusinesslike to the last degree. I do not think that the introduction of automatic machinery would very much alter things in connection with the Post Office. Our greatest trouble is the wrong attitude of mind assumed by the officials in the Department regarding the business to be transacted. me to be to block rather than to encourage business. The Postal Department, however, is essentially a business concern, and its officers, like other business men, should try to attract rather than to drive away business. At present, if one makes a suggestion to them, it is immediately loaded with objections, some of them absurd in the extreme. I give a case in point. About two years ago I endeavoured to get Seven Hills, a small fruit-growing centre in my electorate, connected by telephone with Parramatta, and to have an automatic telephonic bureau established there. The cost of the work would have been about £ 9 0 , but at that time the Department in such cases required"" the locai residents to guarantee nearly the whole of the cost. The first estimate which was prepared showed that the probable revenue from the line would come to about 8 or 9 per cent, upon the expenditure, and when I mentioned that fact, the Department had the estimate revised to bring the profit down to 3 or 4 per cent., and finally it showed that there would ibe a loss on the line. The people of the district, however, would not agree to make the deposit which the Department asked for, and the matter remained in abeyance until the new arrangements came into force, when the Department was asked to carry we are told in the States that out the work, those interested consenting to find the cash deposit' and guarantee asked of them. On this second occasion the Department wished to impose charges which were prohibitive, so that the matter was hung up again.

I trust that when the Postmaster-General has time, to look into the Pacific Cable question, he will see if something cannot be done to make better arrangements for facilitating business over that route. I can scarcely believe that, with the resources of three Governments behind the cable, the present loss of £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 per annum is unavoidable.

I have never seen anything so unbusinesslike or so absolutely idiotic as the action of some of the States Governments in connection with the Pacific Cable. I have repeatedly pointed out that we should never have had the Pacific Cable but for the way we were treated by the Eastern Extension Cable Company. They would make no concessions to us, but the moment arrangements were completed for the construction of the Pacific Cable the Eastern Extension Cable Company rushed in, and by a bribe-for that is what it amounted to -in the shape of reduced rates, they obtained concessions that have enabled them to relegate the Pacific Cable to the background. It was no part of our duty to put this weapon into the hands of our opponents to enable them to flog us as they are now doing. We are paying the piper to the extent of £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, and I cannot believe that it is impossible to do anything to reduce this heavy debt. I believe that all the great cable services, such as the Pacific Cable, should be owned by the Governments interested.

The honourable and learned member for Wannon, and the honourable member for Corangamite, and other honourable members representing country electorates, have advised the postal authorities 'to alter their regulations in regard to the construction of telephone lines in country districts to the extent of dispensing with guarantees. It is very strange that those honourable members who are always preaching economy, and complaining that Federation is costing more than was expected, should now seek to pile our expenses. I am quite willing that the question of the construction of telephone lines shall be left entirely in the hands of the Postal Department. Judging from the experience we have had in Victoria, the guarantees relating to the construction of public works are absolutely useless. As soon as the works are constructed, the guarantors snap their fingers at the Government, and refuse to pay. The Victorian Government have had to wipe off large sums-ove r £1,000,000 in one instance-for which residents in the country districts made them, selves responsible. It would be better to dispense with guarantees altogether, and leave the postal authorities quite untrammelled in the matter.

The honourable and learned member for Wannon asked that the town of Hamilton should be connected with Melbourne by telephone vid Ballarat. In view of the fact that the telephone line has been constructed as far as Warrnambool, I do not know that any great harm would be done by extending it toHamilton, provided )the postal authorities consider that the amount of business would justify the extension.

The right honourable member for Swan told us last evening that his colleagues in the Deakin Ministry were upon the wrong track when theyagreed to insert in the Post and Telegraph Bill the clause prohibiting the employment of black labour upon mail steamers. If he does not approve of that provision, why does he not endeavour to induce the Prime Minister, who thinks with him, to-Introduce a Bill to repeal it? He would then see how it would fare at the hands of members of this Parliament. It iswell known to honourable members that the principal reason why the mail companies did not tender, was that they were indisposed to comply with the conditions exacted with regard' to the carriage of perishable products. The prohibition of the employment of black labour was not the real obstacle, and yet honourable ing their constituents that the companies would not tender upon the old terms because of the socailistic white-labour condition to which they were to be subjected. I do not know that there is anything socialistic about the prohibition of black labour, in fact, many say that this condition is opposed to Socialism.

I wish now to say a few words in regard to the matter which was brought forward yesterday by the honourable member for Grey. I desire to know what are the intentions of the Postmaster-General in that connection. As honourable members are aware, Mr 'Vines actually sublet a group of fortv-three mail contracts in the Ballarat district -By doing so he broke one of the conditions of his contract. I claim that this Parliament has a right to know the individuals with whom it is dealing, and who are responsible for the carrying of our mails. We do not wish to pay £ 2 , 0 0 0 or £ 3 , 0 0 0 annually to a person who does nothing beyond putting his signature to certain contracts. We all know that, after the discussion which took place in this House in reference to the matter -whe n it was shown that honourable members were unanimously of opinion that the terms of the contract should be adhered toMr Vines was notified by the Postal Department that he must transfer the contracts which he held to the sub-contractors. I think that every honourable member will applaud that decision. Mr Vines complied with that instruction by handing' over all the contracts with two exceptions. I preton, "" This is the man who put me away, and I will make him suffer for it . "" Consequently he approached him, and stated, "" I am prepared to hand over these contracts to you, and to pay you £ 1 0 8 a year for performing the work, conditionally that you give me . an authority to collect your money monthly from the Department."" This Parliament has no right to tolerate conduct of that character. trust that the Postmaster-General will let the"""" Committee know what his intentions are in this connection. I desire to'see justice done to Mr Leviston. To mv mind, it is very singular that the remainder of the sub-contractors, were so ready to accept the work. Isi t possible that they were required to sicn agreements authorizing Mr street Vines to collect their money and to deduct from it so much per month? When we have a provision in our contracts prohibiting sub-letting, we ought to see that it is enforced. As the honourable member for Grey has pointed out, Mr Vines has forwarded a lawyer's letter to' Mr Leviston, informing him that he is to be sued for breach of contract. T claim that it is the Postmaster-General who took the contract away from Mr Vines. Why, then, does : the latter not proceed against the Department? I believe that upon this matter the Committee will unanimously endorse the views which have been urged >by the honourable member for Grey. that some representatives of metropolitan constituencies would, if they could have their way, prevent anybody from living in the country. ' I desire, however, to say a few words on behalf of some of the pioneers of Queensland who have not seen the metropolis during the past twenty years. Surely the least that we can do is to give .them a reasonable share of this world's comforts, if that' be possible. Some time ago I saw a paragraph in the newspapers, intimating that the Postmaster-General intended to provide the people of the country with a cheap telephone service by running the wires along fences, and on trees. I trust that he will do no such thing. If we erect a shoddy telephone line, the cost of its maintenance will be enormously increased. Moreover, \vhen once a line has been erected, the subscribers will demand an efficient service, which they will be unable to obtain under the system suggeste'd. In my own electorate, at Stonehenge, which is distant from the coast some 700 miles, the residents are anxious to obtain a telephone service. Manyowners of stations along the Barcoo are already connected by telephone with Longreach, the wires running along their own fences. If the Postmaster-General is to dispense with a guarantee from persons resident in the more favoured parts of Australia, the least he can do is to extend the same facilities to the settlers I in the far west of Queensland. So far as the working of the service is concerned, some of the criticism which has been levelled this evening against the Department reminds me of the Sunday-afternoon and Tuesday-night generals, who were to be met with at the time of the South African war. On almost every corner in every town of Australia, one could find a man ready to show General White how to get out of Ladysmith. "" Why does he not do this?"" or ""Why does he not do that?"" were the questions that were heard on every side. It is an easy matter to criticise such a great' State Department as this, but the organization and administration necessary to provide for its satisfactory working involve .much care and",49,Postmaster General S Department

They cannot be relieved, because the cost would be enormous. They remain in these positions year in and year out without a murmur, and yet the Public Service Commissioner has cut down their Department allowances. I should like to send Mr McLachlan to these distant stations for six months, and learn what allowance he would Queensland ask, in respect of the increased cost of living. At Urandangie, on the South Australian border, there is an officer on duty communication, who will remain there until he dies.

These aie cases with which I am personally familiar, and I hope that the Postmaster-General will interview the Public Service Commissioner, and endeavour to have the allowances continued on the old scale until the classification has been adopted. the debate proceeds the Postmaster-General's notes must be becoming very voluminous. The matter referred to yesterday by the honourable member for Grey is one that demands something more than passing reference, and I think that we should have some definite statement as to the intention of the Minister in regard to it. The Minister should have taken action yesterday if he were satisfied as to the accuracy of the statements made by the honourable member in regard to Vines' contract. It appears to me that this man has not only broken the law, but that, after being told that he must transfer his contract, he attempted to unduly punish one of his subcontractors, simply because He would not sign a new agreement, accepting £ 1 0 8 per annum instead of £ 7 2 , as before, and allowing Vines to pocket the balance of the sum of £ 1 6 0 . for which the contract was let. It is one of the worse cases of which I have heard, and if the statement to be made by the Minister proves unsatisfactory, I shall have something more to say in regard to it. I have waited here hour after hour, for two days, expecting to hear the Minister deal with the question, and I do not think that he should allow it to stand over untilthe close of the general debate. It must be dealt with by the House, and we ought to be in possession of all the facts. There may be mitigating circumstances, but I have not heard of any, and if there be none I desire to know what action the Minister has taken since the case was brought under his notice yesterday. The honourable gentleman should at once make a statement on the subiect. Sir LANGD ON BONYTHON (Barker). vidual rendering those services, and to no -The telephone system in South Australia is fairly satisfactory; but, judging by a telegram which I have received from Adelaide, the residents of the important suburb of St. Peters have a distinct grievance. It seems that they have no local telephone exchange, and the result is that subscribers have to pay £ 8 instead of £ $ per annum for the service. Some one may say that the explanation of there being no local exchange is that there is not the requisite nurt ber of subscribers.' That is not a fact, forI learn from this telegram that there are fifty-six. Those who avail themselves of the telephone service at St. Peters would not complain of their having no local exchange -becaus e it is just as simple to communicate with the city exchange as it. would be to ring up a local one-bu t their grievance is that they have to pay £ 8 per annum, whereas with a local exchange they would have to pay only £ 5 a year for the service. I bring the matter under the attention of the Minister in the'hope that he will look into it, and that if the grievance be as I have represented and believe it to be, he will do what ought to be done in the circumstances. with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that the case of sub-letting by the contractor Vines deserves, not only the serious, but the immediate consideration of the Postmaster General. The case is so serious that it devolves upon the Department to take action to protect the sub-contractor from the contractor, who, I understand, is suing him for breach of a contract which the Department itself insisted should be broken. Some months ago I drew the attention of the Postmaster-General of the day to the evils of sub-letting mail contracts, and gave him several instances, but none of such magnitude as the Ballarat case. According to the statement of the honourable member for Grey, a firm styling themselves Cobb and Company, a name very well known in connection with mail contracting in Australia, have been in the habit of threatening and bringing all kinds of pressure to bear to prevent others from tendering for mail . contracts, subsequently sub-letting these contracts at a profit of thousands of pounds per annum, and rendering no service to the Department themselves. The Minister must agree that whatever the Department pays for services rendered to it should be paid to the indione else. I join with other honourable members in asking him to take immediate action in this case, and, so far as he can, to apply the regulations of the Department and the law to these individuals who are possessed of plenty of money, as in the past they have been applied to individuals who have not",51,Postmaster General S Department

289,Mr Chanter (Riverina),"I agreehad much money. The honourable member for Yarra to-night spoke as though he thought the guarantees required by the Department in connection with telephone extensions were never enforced, but, to my knowledge, they have been enforced in several cases in New South Wales, and if enforced in one case should ""be enforced inall, or else abolished altogether. The Committee ought to be informedby the Minister as to the real position in connection with the English mail service. The public have been given to understand that the reason why the two companies which have hitherto been performing that service have not tendered for -it again is the requirements of the Postal Act in regard to the employment of white labour. But. it has been stated in this Chamber, in regard to one of the companies, that what really prevented it from -lodging a tender was the cost of altering its vessels to comply with the demands of the Department for the provision of better accommodation for the conveyance of frozen produce. The public should be given the fullest information on the subject. In the past we have, been paying the Peninsular and Oriental -Steam Navigation Company and the Orient Steam Navigation Company large sums of .money for -the conveyance of our mails to England, and I should. like to know whether those companies have relied entirely upon the subsidies for their profit. As a matter of fact, : is it :not the case that their profits have been derived from the conveyance of goods, and especially from the conveyance of passengers, and that the mail subsidies have been a subsidiary'source of revenue? An honourable member told us last night that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company had not tendered for the conveyance of our mails because it is not paying; but if honourable members will jefer to the balance-sheet put before its directors at the last meeting in London, they will see lhat 9 per cent, was earned upon the whole of its paid-up capital. vice. That has been carried on temporarily at a loss, in the hope that, later on, it will -prove profitable again. All companies occasionally meet with bad times. 'statement to whictv I have referred applies to the whole of the company's trade; but no company would carry -on a service at a loss. ' I am hr agreement with the Department in this matter. I do not think 'that we should go down on our-knees to any company, and ask it to carry our .mails. If my information be correct, these companies will continue to trade to Australia whether they are subsidized by the Australian Government or not. I understand that, under an international agreement, they are bound to take our mails at poundage rates, and deliver them at the ports at which they call, which are the ports at which they called when they were. receiving a subsidy. We should not allow the shipping companies to control our policy in regard to the conveyance of mails. If necessary, Australia could .find sufficient money to provide a service of her own for the conveyance of mails and. the carriage of frozen produce. I hope that the Minister will give the Committee as much information as he can on this subject, so that the public may know the true position of affairs, and may not be misled by statements made for party purposes. I wish now to deal with the living allowances referred to by the honourable member for Maranoa. The Riverina district is in many respects similar to, though smallerthan, the Maranoa district, and many officers who are sent into it have to live under conditions to which no one should be subjected for long periods of years. Yet, when such officers apply to be removed to cooler -districts, because ""their health is suffering, they are told that they must arrange exchanges with officers in the coastal districts, which means that they must stay where they are, because officers in more favoured districts would be mentally deficient if they agreed to such exchanges. I cannot understand the discrimination which has been made in regard to the granting of living allowances in the back-blocks, where men do not live in the proper sense of the term, but merely exist. In New South Wales, just north of the Victorian border, there are the four townships of Tocumwal, Finley, Berrigan, and Jerilderie, of which the last-named is the most northerly, and the nearest to the State capital, and Tocumwal the most southerly, artel furthest from it . But whereas the officers at Jerilderie and Tocumwal receive living allowances, the officers at Finley and Berrigan, the intermediate townships, do not. They are far worse off in many respects than are '.those officers who are receiving the living allowance. They have I take it that the asked for it again and again, and have given : adequate reasons why it should be granted, but so far their .requests have not been complied with. I hope that the Minister will inquire into this matter, and satisfy himself that living allowances are",52,Postmaster General S Department
290,,Mr KELLY No t on the Australian ser,53,Postmaster General S Department
291,Mr Chanter,"granted to all omcers who are entitled to them. The living allowances were designed for a specific purpose, and all offioers who have to live under similar conditions should be placed upon an equal footing. Some time ago I directed attention to the fact that prior to Federation the States Governments did all they could through the Post and Telegraph Department to aid in the preservation of life and property. In the large pastoral and wheat-growing areas, where the population is sparse, the danger arising from bushfiresis very great, and the people have in many cases banded themselves together in fire brigades. Under the States regime telegrams were allowed to be sent free of cost to the officials of the brigades, notifying them of the outbreak of bush fires. Under the Federal Administration, however, the Postal Department appears to be looked upon as a'purely commercial institution, which must in all cases exact payment for services rendered. I made representations upon this subject, and I am glad to say that the concession has been restored for the time being. I only mention the matter now in order to impress upon the Minister the necessity for continuing the present arrangement. Where settlers band themselves together at their own cost with a view to prevent the spread of bush fires, which are so destructive to life and property, it seems to me that we may very well consent to allow emergency messages such as I have described to be despatched free of cost. My remarks also apply to messages conveying warnings of floods. It is important that those who live upon rivers, and who require to be forewarned in order to enable them to' remove their stock to a place of safety, should be offered every facility. In the days prior to Federation, the Postal Department sent information from post office to post-office along the rivers, and gave matter might be dealt with in a liberal the settlers timely warning. That practice has now been abandoned, and I trust that the Minister will come to the conclusion that it is desirable to resume it. We should not look upon the Postal Department as one which should be made to pay upon ordinary commercial lines. It is the great socialistic Department of the State, and is designed to promote the convenience and comfort of the people. pay? may not pay in hard cash, but the public the point of view of the Department, and are amply compensated for any monetary from that of the general public. The 11 o T loss that may be incurred by the immense benefits which are conferred upon the community generally.

The Department has not paid since it was taken over by the Commonwealth. management of the Department under the Commonwealth has not proved successful, even though charges are being made for services which were formerly rendered free of cost. In connection with the weather reports which are posted at the metropolitan centres, I think that the Department is displaying a cheeseparing disposition. RecentlyI made a request that weather, reports should be sent in from a certain centre, and I was told that as reports were already being received from two centres on either side of the district referred to, and fifty miles apart, it was not necessary to record the weather experienced in the intervening area. In view of our variable climate, and patchy rainfall, it is ridiculous to assume that the records in that case were sufficient. I think that this spirit by the Minister, without consulting the States authorities. On looking through the Estimates, I find that very large sums of money are appropriated for the hire of bicycles, and typewriting machines. Surely the Department are in a position to purchase the bicycles and typewriters they require, and I hope that a change will be made in this direction.

These telephone lines act as feeders to our telegraph system, and are of great assistance in facilitating the despatch of business. I would direct attention to the fact that there is a want of ' uniformity in the arrangements for closing telephone and telegraph offices in New South Wales. The telegraph offices are kept open until 8 o'clock in the evening, whereas the telephone offices are closed at 6 o'clock. I think that the telephone lines should be kept open until 8 o'clock, so that messages may be forwarded by telephone up to the hour of closing of the telegraph offices. Recently, fwhen the Postmaster General accompanied me on a visit to Koondrook, we found the telephone office closed, and I had to send a special messenger to the nearest telegraph office in order to secure the despatch -of a message to the Sydney Morning Herald, in time, for publication next morning. which I have referred may appear very unimportant to some honourable members, but they are of vital concern to residents in the country districts, and I trust that the Minister will do his best to remedy any grievances that may now exist. have, no intention to enter upon any general criticism of the Department. we have reason to congratulate ourselves upon the general excellence of our postal and telegraphic system. We know the Postmaster-General great energy, and to be prompted by an ambition to remedy any abuse which he may know to exist. I am sure that he will do as much as any other Minister has ever tried to do to distinguish himself. number of suggestions that have been made to him to-night should furnish him with a programme sufficiently comprehensive to engage his attention during the short time that he is likely to occupy his present position. I wish now to refer to the question of the cairiage of our mails between Australia and Great Britain. For some time. I have been waiting to hear a statement form the Postmaster-General as to what steps the Government propose to take in this connection, after the expiry of the present contract.with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company and the Orient Steam Navigation Company. It is generally understood that resort is to be had to what is known as the poundage system, and I take it that the Government have been endeavouring to devise the very best means of carrying out their obligations to the Commonwealth under that system. Of course it is easy to declare, in a general way, that our mails can be placed on board any steamer which happens to be voyaging to the old country. But we desire to insure that there shall be some regularity in our mail service, and I believe that we can do so. We have in office a Prime Minister who has openly declared his antagonism to section 16 of the Post and Telegraph Act, to which has been attributed the alteration in our system of mail carriage. Of course the statement has been denied again and again, but nevertheless it continues to be made. Seeing that we have in office a Prime Minister who has openly avowed his hostility to that particular provision, and who has expressed his intention of repealing it as soon as he gets an opportunity to do so, we may be pardoned' for suspecting that when the Government get away from the reThe matters to straining influence of this Chamber they may possibly do something which honourable members would strongly condemn them for doing. Consequently, it is all the more necessary that the Postmaster General should give the Committee a clear idea of what the Government propose in connection with the carriage of our mails oversea. Last night, the right honourable I think that member for Swan delivered one of those breezy utterances to which he so often treats honourable members-. He possesses a happy knack Of saying harsh, blunt things to be a man of very in a breezy, pleasant way, and if the reports of his speeches could only convey his accompanying smile they would not appear quite so stern as they do. But as they are published minus the smile, they The may convey a different meaning from that which the right honourable member intended. able member wanta post-office? is allright. The right honourable member for Swan told us last night that two years ago we could have secured an extension of .the existing mail contract. Personally, I am very glad that no extension under existing conditions was agreed to. From my",54,Postmaster General S Department

301,Mr Watkins,What does the honor,55,Postmaster General S Department
302,Mr Carpenter,"My post-officepoint of view, it would have been a mistake. There is no doubt that it would have been very much to the advantage of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation and the Orient Steam Navigation companies. As a matter of fact, I believe that they wished to enter into a new contract for a period of seven, if not ten, years. the advantage which the "" other fellow "" would get, we should never strike a bargain. Australia began to look to her own interests. We have been the servants of these two companies for many years. While.we were unable to resent the conditions which they chose to impose, we were compelled to hold our peace. But I would point out that in the shipping world to-day competition is very much keener than it was ten years ago. The number of vessels available for the carriage of mails has very considerably increased. time there are ships coming to our ports which are in every way equal to those belonging to the companies which have hitherto carried our mails. It was well for Australia that the Deakin Government did not assent to an extension of the existing contract. I have asked the official head of the Postal Department to furnish me with a statement as to what would be the cost of carrying our mails under the poundage system, and he has very courteously supplied me with that information. I hold in my hand a statement showing the amounts which would be payable (a) at Postal Union rates for the sea conveyance of mail matter from Australia to Europe, including the United Kingdom, vid Suez. I may explain that the Postal Union rates refer to the amount which is paid for services rendered by vessels carrying mails under contract with any country which is within the Postal Union. The regulation poundage rates are those prescribed by the Department, which have to -be paid for services rendered by vessels which are not under contract to any country within that Union. I find that under the new system the annual cost to Australia would be as follows :1. Sea transit at Postal Union ratesLetters, 90,000 lbs. at 3s. yd. per lb., ,£16,125 weekly service that our exporters are reper annum. Parcels, 76,000 lbs., at 2d. per lb., ,£633 6s. Other articles, 600,000 lbs., 4 1-3CI. per lb., ^10,833 6s. 8d. per annum. Total, ^27,591 13s. 4d. II O 2 The regulation poundage rates are very much less. They run as follow :2. Sea transit at regulation poundage ratesLetters, 90,000 lbs., at 2s. per lb., ^9,000. Oilier articles (including parcels), 676,000 lbs., at 4s. per cwt., ^1,207 4s. Total, ^10,207 4s. Compared with the sums which we have been paying to the shipping companies If we always looked at under the contract system, these figures seem ridiculously low. If we pay .to the Peninsular and Oriental Company, which It is time that is contracting with the British Government for the carriage of mails one-half the postal union rates and pay another company at the regulation poundage rates, we shall still be spending less than £ 2 0 , 0 00 per annum for the carriage of our mail matter. those vessels to deliver mails in London? them very much longer than it does at the present time. The shipping companies At the present will find it to their advantage to make the voyage home as expeditiously as possible. speed for a vessel of 15 knots, is about 12 knots, as a rule. there is a speed at which the lowest consumption of fuel takes place. As against uiat, however, we have to take into consideration the increased trade which a ship will derive by reaching port a day or two sooner than she otherwise might. tralia, will the Peninsular and Oriental Company be bound to land them at Mar seilles, if they are addressed to London? right to expect that we shall secure the same regularity in the matter of the conveyance of our mails as we have obtained under the contract system. As evidence of that fact, I have only to mention that the newspapers to-day contain a report to the effect that negotiations are in progress between a committee appointed by the butter exporters, and the representatives of the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Companies. It appears that the Australian managers of these companies, after conferring with the committee in question, were prepared to recommend the acceptance of a contract which provided for the same ceiving under the present contract. I gather from the statements published in the press,' that there is to be no alteration whatever in the time-tables of these companies. The",55,Postmaster General S Department

Then the right honourable member did what I think he ought not to have done. He endeavoured to revive a scare which ha.s been raised again and again, by suggesting that under the poundage system the mail steamers may not call at Fremantle. I am sure that the right honourable member does not wish anything of the kind to happen; but he knows that some politicians for political purposes have mooted this question again and again. The suggestion was first made when section 16 of the Post and Telegraph to operation. peatedly that the steam-ship have not increased their rates in consequence of that provision, and attempts are now being made to make it appear that there is some reason to fear that their vessels may not call at Fremantle because of the adoption of the poundage system. I do not think this Government would favour any steam-ship company which did not equally serve all the ports of the Commonwealth; I feel confident that they would rather give a preference to any line of vessels which would call at the same ports that are touched at now, and, if possible, go further north and make Brisbane a port of call. As long as there is any trade at Fremantleand there is still an enormous trade to be done there-we shall have the mail steamers calling at that port, and I do not think that the right honourable member should voice the suggestion that there is any fear of their not doing so. Let me repeat, in conclusion, that such an important matter as the question of the oversea mail should be dealt with before the House goes into Mr Carf enter. will tell us that he is still nego tiating with any of these companies we shall be prepared not to interrupt his overtures, The very fact, howbut if he is not, and the Government have determined what action they will take, they ought to give the Committee the. fullest information.

I believe that the MinHe deister has a knowledge of its working, which distinguishes him from several of his predecessors, and enables him to recognise the The figures which I have quoted needs, not only of the large cities, but of the £50,000 rural districts; and I desire to bring under upon the existing contract, his notice some anomalies which should be removed. One of the great complaints in New South Wales with respect to Federation is that since this Department has been under the control of the Commonwealth its treatment of the people generally has not been nearly so liberal as it was when it was administered by the State. This is a Department which more closely touches the community than does any other service, and we were led to expect that some of the principal benefits which the people would derive from Federation would filter through it. The people of New South Wales, however, have been considerably disAct came inappointed. Many of the facilities which It has been shown rethey enjoyed under the State system were companies withdrawn by the Commonwealth, on the plea that the Department must be conducted on sound commercial principles. We have to judge by the results whether it is so conducted, and I think it can be shown that the socailed unsound commercial system under which free weather telegrams and other services were rendered to. the people of New South Wales, prior to Federation, gave better results than have been shown by the Department since its transfer to the Commonwealth. If we remove some of the restrictions which have been placed on the extension of postal and telegraphic communication since the establishment of the Commonwealth, we shall confer a real benefit on the community, and lead to increased returns being secured. In some cases advantages have been extended to the people, and have not resulted in the loss to the Department which some of its controlling officers predicted. It was thought that one of the results of placing the Departservice ment under central control would be the establishment of a uniform system of penny recess. If the Minister postage for Australia. So far, however, we",56,Postmaster General S Department
311,Mr Brown (Canobolas),"I do not prohave not been able to secure that great boon. Shortly prior to the transfer of the Department to the Commonwealth, the penny postage system"" was introduced in Victoria, and the advantages which have resulted from that reform are so great that it should be extended to the whole of the people of Australia. £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 a year as the result of it. there are penny postage zones, which embrace the big cities and towns, but the system does not apply to the whole State. The returns quoted by the Treasurer, in the course of his Budget statement, clearly show that the postal returns of New South Wales are larger than are those of any of the other States, and I think, therefore, that we have some claim for consideration. The finances of the Department are gradually improving, and we have reached the stage ai which we should seriously consider the wisdom of giving the Commonwealth the great boon of penny postage, and of bringing it into line in this respect with New Zealand and other parts of the British Empire, including Great Britain itself. All progressive countries are showing a tendency ro cheapen their postal and telegraphic services, and to bring them more f u l ly within the reach of the great masses of the people. The introduction of the penny postage system would be one of the best means of popularizing the Department and extending its sphere of usefulness. Although the introduction of the system in Victoria may have resulted at the outset in a loss, as the honourable member for Grampians has indicated, I am sure that as the reform became known and appreciated, the initial losses would disappear, and that it would be largely instrumental in placing the Department on a paying basis. One of the disadvantages under which New South Wales more particularly labours is the curtailment of postal facilities, so far as Sydney and the outlying rural districts are concerned. Prior to the transfer of the Department to the Commonwealth postal articles might be lodged at the General Post-Office up to nearly 8 p.m. for transmission by the out-going mail for the Western District, but partly as the result of alterations made in the railway time-table, it is now necessary to post them not later than 5.30 p.m. There was a delay of a day, or, at the end of the week, two days, in getting the mail matter out. was remedied, greatly by the strong representations which I made to the present Postmaster-General, and a late bag was made up and placed on board the express which leaves Sydney at 9 o'clock. That arrangement, however, only partially meets the requirements of the west, and there is still ample scope for improvement. I ask the Postmaster-General to ascertain if it is not possible to arrange for the later collection of letters posted in Sydney for transmission to country districts. The Redfern post-office is within half-a-mile of the central railway station; but a letter must be posted there at 3 o'clock in the afternoon to catch any of the mail trains leaving for country districts in the evening. Having found that it was too late to post at Redfern, I have gone to the late post-box at the central station, and, finding that that was not open, have proceeded another mile to the General Post Office, and there posted in time to catch the mail. The city people suffer a real hardship from the present closing arrangements, which I think could be remedied at small cost. It would be of great advantage, both to cify merchants and to those in ,the country with whom they do business, if they could post replies to their morning mails by the evening trains. I have been informed by country storekeepers that serious loss was entailed upon them at first by these early clearances, and that they still find them very inconvenient. Although the mail train now leaves Sydney for the west at 9 o'clock, whereas it previously left at 8 o'clock, the mails close an hour earlier, instead of an hour later, so that the public gets no advantage from the arrangements, so far as the mail is concerned. Another matter to which I wish to refer to is this: During the recent severe drought, many places which had a mail three times or twice a weekwere reduced to a weekly mail, it being promised that, when the drought was over, the old arrangement should be restored; but in many cases the reduced service still takes effect. I do not contend that the Department should carry on services at a great loss, but wherever a service will pay, it should endeavour to meet the convenience of the community by expediting the transmission of mails. Very often the possibilitieso f a' district cannot be properly tested until adequate mail facilities have been provided. The granting of these facilities, too, often creates reThat state of affairs venue, which is a phase of the question",57,Postmaster General S Department
312,Mr Skene,They are losing about,58,Postmaster General S Department
313,Mr Brown,"In New South Waleswhich the Department should"" study. It must be remembered that the people in the back country are engaged in pioneering work. country more habitable, and telephones and telegraphs are necessary to keep them in touch with the more closely settled districts been. The Department, by exercising a nearer the coast. City people can scarcely appreciate the advantages of these means of communication to isolated districts. Many districts are now endeavouring to have their mail services supplemented with telegraphic or telephonic communication. A number of outlying stations have gone to the cost of connecting themselves by telephone with the nearest telegraph office, which in some instances may be twenty or thirty miles away, and in .this way the revenue from telegrams is being considerably augmented. When the honourable member for Macquarie was Postmaster General in New South Wales, he did a good deal to assist this improvement of communication, and the lessening of facilities under Federal control was felt to be a very real hardship. To show what this hardship is, and how more enlightened methods may be adopted with advantage to both the Department and tiw» community, I will instance a case. On behalf of the residents of a small settlement in my electorate known as Yeovil, I asked for a statement of the conditions under which the Department will provide telephonic communication. I was told that the Department considered that it would not be revenue-producing, . and that the estimated cost of constructing the line showed tliat it would be necessary for the resfdents to place £ 1 6 8 to the credit of the Postmaster-General in the Savings Bank to cover possible losses extending over a period of five years. The people naturally refused to negotiate on such terms, which seemed to me to be ridiculous. I approached the then Postmaster-General with .a view to have the rules revised. They were revised, and twelve months afterto pay for them-. ' The sum of two guineas wards I re-submitted an application. I was then told that the Department could see its wayto construct a telephone line on a guarantee of £ 5 2 18s. Here was a difference of £ 1 15 between the two estimates. It is now disclosedthat the total revenue which is required to place the line upon a paying basis is something like £ 2 6 per annum, and that the guarantee will only be.drawn upon, in the event of the revenue in any one year falling below that Mr Brown amount. Those facts indicate how the Dei partment, by prohibitory charges at the out? set, block the extension of postal facilities They are gradually making the in the country districts, and they also show how it is that Federation has not been so acceptable to the people as it ought to have little common sense, and by dealing with its clients from a commercial stand-point, can Both extend its operations and increase its revenue. Another matter which I should like to bring under the notice of the Post* master-General is in regard to the regulations dealing with postal affairs. In many country towns in New South Wales and other States, newspapers are published. The present regulations require that the telegraph"" reports sent to those journals shall be paid for on the delivery of the messages. This causes a considerable amount of inconvenience both to the proprietors and to the postmasters. The old arrange-^ ment was that payments were made at stated periods. It appears to me that the Department should arrange to have payments made weekly or monthly. I never heard that serious losses were incurred under the old arrangement, and certainly the Department is in a position to prevent losses under a reasonable arrangement of 'this 'character. I would ask the Postmaster-General to consider the advisableness of altering the regulations so as to enable payments to be made on the part of the country newspaper proprietors at stated periods, instead of when the messages come to hand. Another matter relating to postal business is of interest to country districts. It often happens that country postmen, in travelling from one centre to another, have to effect a consider-able number of intermediate deliveries.' It is convenient to mail contractors, and to the public, to have their mail matter kept together. The system of private bags, has been introduced, but the charges are so excessive that small settlers cannot afford per annum is charged in many cases for private bags. The Department might reasonably reduce the charge to ios. per annum. It is for the convenience of mail contractors tnat small bundles of letters and other postal matter should ibe made up for delivery. I have made representations to the Department on the'subject, suggesting that ios. per annum should be the charge made.' It would not entail much'more work upon' the Department if the mail-bag' system were extended, or if parcels of letters were tied together with twine. It would increase the revenue, and be of great assistance to the mail contractors, who would thus have their bundles of letters and parcels securely fastened, instead of being loose and apt to get lost. Very often mail matter is overcarried through packets and letters becoming disarranged. If the plan I suggest were adopted, greater facilities would be afforded to wayside settlers, and also to country mail contractors, and' at no great inconvenience to postmasters. the consideration of the Minister. I hope that he will see his way to adopt such measures as will popularize the Department and make it more profitable. matter to which' I desire to direct the attention of the Minister. Prior to Federation the post-offices of Victoria were opened at 8.30 a.m., whereas at present the public are not admitted until 9 o'clock. It seems ridiculous that the public should have to wait for one hour after the work of the world has started in order to transact business with the Post and Telegraph Department. notice of the authorities some little time ago, and I was informed that the Department could not see its way to make any change. No reasons were given upon that occasion, and I should like the Minister to inform honourable members why the present arrangement is adhered to. Unless some very good reason can be advanced, I hope that the offices will be opened at an earlier hour. upon the Minister the desirability of extending as far as possible postal and telegraphic and telephonic communication in the country districts. I had an opportunity of speaking to the Minister upon this subject very soon after he assumed office, and I gathered from what he said that his sympathies were .very strongly in the direction I have indicated. I trust that he will now. -make a public declaration of his views. The establishment of communication between the more remote country districts and the metropolis is of the very highest importance, and it would not be a mistake for us. to conduct the business of the Postal and. -Telegraph Department upon purely com-mercial lines. When we consider the struggles of our settlers and the hardships, they have to endure, owing to their being deprived of the conveniences provided by the State for dwellers' in the cities and' towns, we should be impelled to do everything we can to meet their requirements. We should not look necessarily for an immediate return, but should, deal generously with them. It is a difficult matter to decide exactly upon what basis this should be done. I presume that every case will have to be dealt with on its merits. Regard should be paid to the future development of our country districts, and we should not ask for guarantees in cases where the population is more or less scattered, I commend these suggestions to and men are naturally in doubt as to How far the burden' may fall upon single individuals. I hope that the Minister will see that the Department is conducted upon generous lines, because the welfare of the Commonwealth to a. large extent depends upon early and regular communications reaching those who are dwelling in distant localities, and are helping to develop the country. dially endorse the remarks made by the honourable member for Grey with regard to the sub-letting of mail contracts. I hope that the Minister will not permit any sweatI brought this matter under the ing in connection with his Department. I think that it is undesirable that one man should be permitted to contract for so many services. I have no personal knowledge oif the conditions which prevail in Queensland, but I should think that the remarks which have been made with regard to that State : would apply also to other parts of the Commonwealth. Under the State rigime sweating of the vilest description was carried on in the Victorian Postal Department. I went' into figures with one contractor, who used to deliver mails in a most difficult part of the country.. T .visited that district it) the winter time, and I wondered how he had the courage to make his horses face the road. I ascertained that the contractor, who had to use a trap and two horses, was paid at the rate of 4£d. per hour.. I think that the Minister should consider what would be a fair price to pay for the work performed, and not necessarily accept the lowest tender. himself in great difficulties if he did. certainly avoid treating our contractors upon the contemptible lines followed by the Victorian Government. I cordially support the remark of the honourable member for Parramatta with regard to the Pacific Cable. It is highly desirable that our means of communication with the old world should",58,Postmaster General S Department
