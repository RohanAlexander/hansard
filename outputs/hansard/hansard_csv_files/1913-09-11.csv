Enough, Mr Speaker, To Inform The House When The Opposition Will Have The Use Of The Room In This Building That Has Always Been Used By Opposition Members? Course, To Meet The Convenience Of Every Honourable Member, As Far As Practicable, In This Matter. I T Has Been Represented To Me By Those Who Are At Present In Occu","pation of the room on the ground floor, usually known as the Opposition room, that they wish to remain there, but I have tried to get the Whips of the two parties to come to an agreement as to the disposition of rooms. The suggestion has been made, and I think it is a very good one, that the members of the Ministerial party might occupy the room on the ground floor which has hitherto been the Opposition room, and of which they are now in possession, and that the members of",12,Setup

3,Mr Speaker,"My desire is, of the Opposition party might retain the room on the floor above, taking in addition the room on the ground floor that was last session used by the Independent party, and which I am informed has generally been regarded, and sometimes used as a Ministerial room, the Independent party being no longer in existence. If it is not agreeable to members of the Opposition to keep the room that they now have, with the smaller, room on the ground floor, the Ministerialists will take the upstairs room, and the smaller room on the lower floor will be allotted to the member for Eden-Monaro on account oE .his physical disability to move freely up and down so many stairs. I do not propose to disturb the present arrangement if it meets with the general approval of members. that the members of the Opposition party are not to use the room that has always been known as the Opposition room, unless the members of the Ministerial party consent ? my wish to meet tlie convenience of honourable members of both sides, but any conflict of opinion on this matter makes it necessary if somewhat difficult for me to come to a decision. If the members of the Opposition desire tli8 ground floor room now in possession of the members of the Ministerial party, they are at liberty to take it , but if they do so, they must give up the small ground floor room occupied for some time by what was known as the Independent party, because there is one member of the Ministerial party, at any rate, who has informed ms that he cannot, on account of severe physical affliction, go up ancl downstairs frequently, and accommodation must be found for him on the lower floor. I propose, in the circumstances, that if the present arrangement is not continued the floor shall be set aside for him. Later : very much, Mr Speaker, for the way i u which you have attended to the comfort of honourable members, and especially for your desire to meet the wishes of the Opposition. I wish now to ask whether, if the Opposition desire to have the use of the room on the ground floor, which has always been at their disposal, you will facilitate their getting it? jection, but I wish it to be understood, in that case, that the room adjoining will be reserved for an infirm member of this House, who is unable to go to the upstairs room. statement that has been made in regard to these rooms. You stated, sir, that you had been informed that a certain room had always been used by members of the Ministerial party. I wish to inform you that when the first Parliament met members of the Labour party had no room at all, save one in the basement which was shown to us. We were then permitted to use the room on the ground floor, to which reference has just been made, and we used to meet in that room. We continued to do so, at least during A m I to understand the life of the first Parliament, if not afterwards. There were only twenty-four of us at that time-sixtee n members in this House and eight in another place -and we held all our meetings there; so * that you must have been misinformed, As I have said, it is Mr Speaker, as to that room having been used always by members of the Ministerial party. The Ministerial room was then, as now, upstairs. That being so, there is no precedent for members of the Ministerial party using the room in question on the ground floor. If the room were placed at our disposal, it would be a very great convenience to those members of my party who are not too agile in getting up and down stairs. ber of this House has informed me that it is physically impossible for him to go upstairs owing to the stroke of paralysis he suffered some time ago. I must provide accommodation for him, and, if the present arrangements are unsuitable, and no other accommodation is available, I shall have to retain for him the use of the smaller room to which I have referred. small room on the ground Under the existing arrangement there is no necessity for the honourable member for Herbert to have his room upstairs, as the I desire to thank you extra room oil the lower floor is at present available for his use. reply, sir, have you considered that it is well known that members in another place, and members occupying seats in this Chamber use a room at times for joint deliberation ? And has it been considered that giving the Ministerial side",12,Parliament

10,Mr Webster,"In view of yourthe large room in conjunction with the small room means giving forty-five members larger accommodation, while refusing to sixty-six members that accommodation which had practically been set aside for them by the rules? fact that those occupying the Opposition benches in conjunction with members of another House required more accommodation that suggested the idea that they should retain' the largest room available. That was the main guiding principle that led me uot to disturb the present arrangement, because I recognised that the large room upstairs was certainly the best for large gatherings. I was desirous of meeting the convenience of honourable members. I recognised that the larger room upstairs was best adapted to meetings such as the present Opposition members were likely to have, and that the room below does not confer anything like the accommodation the room upstairs gives in this respect. small room downstairs always been regarded as a Ministerial room ? also like to know, sir, whether you deem it an imperative part of your duty to provide accommodation on this side of the building for senators for purely party purposes ? first part of that question, from inquiry I am informed that the small room below is properly a Ministerial room, and was at one time occupied by the Ministerial party, and that not very long ago. Deakin and Reid Administrations, l t has been used for various purposes, but has been used as a Ministerial room. It was almost exclusively used by the late Sir William Lyne as his room for some time; but, by courtesy of Sir William Lyne, other members were permitted to go into it for the purpose of writing their correspondence. I am not laying this down as a statement from my own knowledge, but I have made inquiries on the subject, and, so far as I can learn, it was so. As to the other portion of the Prime Minister's question, as I have said, while it may not be my duty to provide accommodation for members of another place, still it is my desire to meet the convenience of members as far as possible. .

Later : question put by the honourable member for Yarra, I desire to ask the Honorary Minister whether, in the event of such a book' being published by the Commonwealth, he will consider the desirableness of furnishing in it statistics relating to the value of the estates of deceased persons in groups, and the same figures in relation to income tax ? orable member's request.

I should have asked, Isi t intended to import such a locomotive for any of the Commonwealth services? If it is the intention to i m port such a locomotive, will the Minister, in view of our Protectionist policy, consider the advisability of first calling for tenders throughout the Commonwealth ? an experimental internal combustion engine for use on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta line has been under consideration for some time past. Tbe Engineer-in-Chief for Commonwealth Railways has reported that an estimated saving in constructional cost for water conservation of over Â£250,000 can be effected if we can procure a satisfactory type of internal combustion engine. That saving would be apart from the saving that would result from the use of such engines instead of steam engines for the ordinary working of the line over country where there are difficulties in obtaining water for boiler purposes-difficultie s due, not to scarcity of water, but to defects in the water.

MrM c DONALD (Kennedy) [2.54] It would be much better for the Honorary Minister to fix some day next week for the second reading of this B ill instead of proposing that the House shall proceed with its consideration to-morrow.

The Government did not introduce the B ill last night for reasons of its own, which do not concern in the least my honourable friends opposite. If they want to know these reasons I invite them to come to our next Cabinet meeting. time, may I suggest that a debate of this kind is unprecedented in this Chamber? gentleman and his party were in Opposition ? has never been done in the history of this Parliament. MrJ . H . CATTS -Evidently the honourable gentleman did not know everything when he was on this side of the House. not know anything of these unworthy tactics. MrJ . H . CATTS -This is rich from the Prime Minister. honourable members opposite to allow busiuess to proceed in the ordinary way, and to extend to the Government tbe time honoured privilege of shaping its own business in its own way. That, I think, is a reasonable request. am inclined to the view that the Prime Minister is correct when he says there is no precedent for the procedure now being followed. No doubt that is due to the fact that no Ministeri n the past was so f r i g h t f u l l y inept as to bungle matters as anxious to introduce the measure, and the Ministeri n charge of this Bill has done. It is, perhaps, a matter for regret that the very first B ill which it was his honour to introduce to the House should have been so badly bungled. That, however, is a matter which concerns only himself and his colleagues. In a direct sense the Opposition have nothing to do with it . We have something, however, to do with the procedure, and the right to ask for information. Of course, the Government have the right to withhold the' information, but we are entitled to ask that the ordinary procedure be observed unless there is something to justify an irregular procedure. While the action of the Honorary Minister in moving the first reading [41] of the B ill during question time is not out of order, having strict regard to the Standing Orders, it nevertheless is somewhat irregular. If the honourable gentleman proceeds in an irregular way, though not necessarily out of keeping witli the Standing Orders, it is not fair on the part of the Prime Minister to complain if the ]3rocedure becomes irregular because of the irregular conduct of his own Ministei. In the circumstances, the Prime Minister's Meancomplaint falls to the ground, in that, if the procedure is in any way irregular, it is entirely due to his Minister, possibly for Governmental reasons, adopting a particular course. However, the Prime Minister seems to have taken some credit to himself on one point. He says that the B ill was withheld from honourable members yesterday for Governmental purposes. I hope I did before us is whether the second reading sliall be made an Order of the Day for to-morrow. and tlie statement. I am making leads to the question whether the B ill shall be I must ask discussed to-morrow or postponed, say, unti l Tuesday. I know of no honourable member on this side who desires any unnecessary delay; but we certainly ask that we shall be treated with ordinary courtesy. If the practice to be adopted is to be irregular, a courteous intimation of the fact might be vouchsafed to us. It is regrettable that the Prime Minister and one of his colleagues should differ materially. Yesterday evening the Ministeri n charge of the Bil l repeatedly assured the House that he was that it was only because of the discussion that he was unable to do so. Now we have it from the Prime Minister that the B ill was withheld for Governmental reasons only. Here we have a distinct' difference of opinion, which, of course, those two gentleman can settle between themselves. It is necessary, however, that attention should be called to the point, in order that we on this side may not be put in a wrong light before the constituencies. The course adopted by the Honorary Minister results in the B ill being put back at least twenty-four hours, and in placing honourable members on this side in a very unfortunate position.

115,Mr Brennan,"In adopting theJfco the scope of the Bill, although he conveyed the impression to every member on -.this side that he would be most happy, immediately the discussion closed, to afford us every information. I know, because I was here, that when the discussion closed the Honorary Minister dramatically, and obviously with great self-satisfaction, because he thought it was a 40up, sat down after simply moving the motion in his name. In those circumstances, I think it is due to enter a protest in discussing whether the second reading should be made an Order of the Day for to-morrow, and I shall be glad if the Minister will inform us that no member of the Government conveyed to the press the contents of this Bill. If he can do so, it will be a satisfaction to us, who are interested in maintaining the privileges of the House, and in discussing this matter in an ordinary way. wish to appeal to the Prime Minister, and .enter my protest against the second reading of this Bill being made an Order of the Day for to-morrow. Many members are away from the House with the approval of the House, and next week many members will be away also with the approval of the House. The circumstances of their absence are well known to every member. Therefore, I ask that this question be put down for consideration no earlier than Wednesday or Thursday next, when every member will have the opportunity of being in his place and dealing with this important measure to the best of his judgment. There is no necessity for the Government to push on with such haste as to put it down for -consideration to-morrow, because to-morrow is an off day. The Ministry will lose no time if the Prime Minister will assure the House that the measure will not come on until Thursday next. If he will give that assurance, this matter can pass without further trouble. [3.28] I add my plea to those already put forward. I have glanced through the Bill, by the courtesy of the Clerk, and I notice that it contains a number of pages, so that if we are to follow the second-reading speech intelligently it is absolutely essential that tbe B ill should be in the possession of members for a considerable time. Postponing the consideration of the second reading does not cause any loss of time between the introduction of the Bill and its final exit from this House. The second reading ought not to be proceeded with almost immediately, because it will be tomorrow morning before any member can be in possession of copies, and as the measure contains a number of pages, on each of which, I presume, a vital principle is affected, it seems a very fair request to make that the second 1 reading should be fixed for some day next week. I am making my protest quite apart from any party spirit, because I consider that if the progress of the Bill is to be expedited, it is absolutely essential that members should have the chance of conning it and extracting from it some idea of what its provisions are. If they have this opportunity they can more intelligently follow the remarks made by the Honorary Minister in moving the second reading. I hope the Prime Minister will accede to this exceptionally moderate request. As remarked by the honourable member for Grey, many members are away, and it is well known that if a member hears a second-reading speech he is in a much better position to grasp the principles of a measure, and to take part in the succeeding discussion. order. This is the day set apart for private members' business, which should come on immediately after the questions. This discussion has now been going on for nearly an hour, and can scarcely be called "" questions."" Is it competent for time to be taken from private members' business for the discussion of the principles of a Bill? Mr J. H . CATTS -On a point of order. I submit that this is Government business, and that Government business cannot be introduced to take precedence of private members' business on private (Maribyrnong) members' day. Upon the introduction of this Bill the House is entitled to debate the proposition, and the discussion may go on for the whole afternoon; but whether there has been discussion or not, the Government have deliberately introduced Government business on the day set apart for private members' business.

The procedure is perfectly in order, and I have quoted a precedent of not later than November last, on which date a similar practice was followed. This motion could have been taken as formal, and there is no obligation on any member to discuss it unless he so desires. Usually such a motion is taken as formal, and without debate; but if honourable members themselves desire to occupy the time which otherwise would be devoted to private members' business, it is their own concern, and not the Speaker's, Mr J. H . CATTS -Was the precedent you quoted, sir, an occasion on which Government business was introduced on private members' day? to say. It makes no difference to the principle, even if it were not so. There have been several such occasions. [3.33] -There are many reasons why this Bill should not be considered in such a hurry. It is evident the Government intend to make this measure the great piece of legislation of the short session they are likely to have. I am an unsuspicious character; but knowing the deep guile of gentlemen on the Government side, and the fact that they are quite capable of taking advantage of any opportunity to put their case in a very good way before the public, I am rather suspicious that they are after something on this occasion. As Ministers have control of the House, so soon as this Bill is settled we may have to go away. as a party we are deeply concerned as to the contents of the measure. Further, we would like to consider it deeply before we address ourselves to it in the House. It is no great stretch of imagination-and you, I am sure, Mr Speaker, will agree with me-to think there may be something deep in this Bill, because, so far, we have heard of nothing but dissolutions and alterations of the Electoral Act to suit one particular party. ber is not in order. whether the second reading shall bet made an Order of the Day for to-morrow. show that it is the Bill of all Bills to be presented to the House in the present situation, and that it is one which should receive deep consideration. Both inside the House and outside, at pleasant Sunday afternoons, political meetings, and smoke nights, nothing but the alteration of the Electoral Act has been considered by the Ministerial side of the House.. This is an undoubted fact that can be read in every newspaper, and heard at every meeting they hold; and it is my only reason for saying that, before the Bill is considered in the Chamber, members should peruse it. Yesterday we were charged with obstructing business,, but we are not quite innocent on this side, and we know that the gun is loaded. We are just as capable of looking after ourselves as are members opposite. They taunt us. That is why I believe the Government have something up their sleeve, and that is why I desire to have the time to consider the Bill. It certainly cannot be sufficiently considered in time for us to go on with it to-morrow. I hope Ministers will not wipe out private members' business altogether, and 1 trust they will agree to let this matter be postponed until Wednesday next. I have looked upon private members' day,, and the words "" precedence until 6.30 p.m.,"" as a shibboleth of truth. Whether it is any malign influence or the intention of the Minister to get at me directly or indirectly, I do not know; but I appeal to my friends of the Opposition not to cause me to lose the whole of the time for dealing with the motion I have upon the notice-paper. So rary Minister) [3.36] I shall say only one word. There are one or two suggestions to which some reply should be made.

189,Mr Joseph Cook,"Afte r whatfor appointment to the mechanical branch is an obstacle to many capable men, and is one reason for the present shortage of permanent mechanics, I am informed by the Public Service Commissioner that such an asseveration has no foundation in fact. The educational examination is merely qualifying, is of the simplest character, and is imposed to guard against the introduction of men who are wholly illiterate, and who could not even write to the small extent required of some mechanics in their everyday work. I have here copies of the papers set at the educational section of the last examination held, and I do not think I have ever before seen more elementary tests. I can only say that the statement that has been made that "" a University education "" is required of candidates at these examinations is quite incorrect. I have here figures for these examinations, which should convince any one that the educational test does not produce the results claimed against it. At all examinations held for appointment as mechanic, 468 candidates from outside the Service presented themselves, and, of these, only twelve failed in the educational examination. Of these twelve, ten (10) also failed in the practical section of the examination, leaving only two who were debarred appointment by the educational examination. These two were foreigners, who could scarcely write a word of English. Coming to the examination for junior mechanics, I find that 703 candidates have been examined, of whom thirty-three could not pass the educational tests. But of these thirty-three twenty-nine also could not pass the practical examination, which leaves only four out of 703 to whom the educational test meant failure at the examination. It will be seen, therefore, lhat of 1,171 candidates who underwent examination, only six were failed by the educational tests, and, taking into consideration the easy character of the examination-papers and the leniency exercised in judging candidates' efforts, I am driven to the conclusion that these six must have been so illiterate that their rejection was an advantage to the Department.

This has not yet arrived, and in its absence no oflicial action can be taken in the matter. Before the Act can be proclaimed it will be necessary to frame regulations covering a very wide range of subjects, and many of them of a highly technical character. To carry out this work a nucleus staff of expert officers must be appointed, and in connection with this, preliminary inquiries are now being made. When the draft regulations have been prepared it will be necessary, in accordance with a promise given by the late Government to the Imperial authorities, that four months' notice shall be given of the intention to bring them into effect. A large amount of work will also be necessary in the way of arranging for the f u l l staffs required in various States, and for their housing, &c.

That, in the opinion of this House, the time has arrived to take tbe necessary procedure to remove the evil of unemployment from the States of Australia. 2. That, contingent upon the preceding resolution being carried, it be taken as an instruction to the Government of the day to appoint a Royal Commission to report upon the best methods of relieving the community from the evils of unemployment. The question upon which I propose to speak to-day is one that I have studied during many years. pertains to no party, but in which every party is interested. happy and contented if its people are out of work and their potentialities unemployed. first public meeting that I addressed after I had been elected to Parliament. I was speaking to a body of unemployed, and I was wise, or unwise, enough to say that I did not know what hunger was, but I knew what thirst was, and if hunger was as bad as thirst I would take-le t people call it what they w ill . Next morning I found myself famous, or infamous. The newspapers called me an Anarchist, a Nihilist, a Socialist, and I was the butt of many thoughtless people. But one kind individual wrote to the Argus saying that he did not think that I had erred in very bad company, because the great Cardinal Manning had used almost the same words, saying that "" necessity knows no law, and the starving man has a right to his brother's bread."" Evidently my constituents held the same views as I did, because that statement was on my card at the next election, when I obtained the largest majority for a single electorate that has ever been obtained in one of that size. I maintain that more misery has been caused by want of work and unemployment than by anything else since the world began. Following the Paradise of the golden time, we read of crucifixions when the conquered were too numerous to be used as slaves, of whippings, of brandings on the face and hand, even in Merry England, of men who, unable to work on the land, were forced by hunger to beg, much unemployment being caused by what were known as the Enclosure Acts, which robbed the common people of free land to which they were entitled. Then came all the horrors of the French Revolution and the disturbances of the Chartist movement, and the miseries caused by the Vagrancy Acts. The man who is unable to obtain work soon gets down on his uppers, and loses the virile impulses of humanity. When a man has to ask for assistance, either in the shape of money to keep a roof over his family, or in the shape of food to still the cravings of his stomach, he loses a certain part of his manhood that, perhaps, can never be recovered. There is no thinking person but will agree that that land will be the happiest whose people are engaged in usef u l employment on works of benefit to the It is a question that whole community.

"" I hope that that intelligence will be devoted by honourable members here to making this beloved Australia of ours the one continent in the world in which no man or woman shall be out of work through his own fault, and in which all will be assisted to obtain work, and protected from an abasement by poverty that no human being should be subjected to. 1 do not propose to quote too freely from books, because I wish to make my remarks as concise as I can. The opinions I shall cite will be those, not of Democrats, but of some of the most conservative men whose names stand on the roll of English statesmen. orable member but will agree that there is an hiatus between our school education and practical employment. question that comes to every mother and father when a boy or a girl has terminated school life?

I , than too, shall compliment this Governmenb if it will follow the advice given in to-day's Age. I recognise that every one of the seventy-five members of this House is a lover of Australia, and wishes to raise the country to the highest pitch of civilization. Disraeli has stated the aphorism that "" the happy progress of a nation depends on the health and strength of its individual units."" I ask you to apply that aphorism. It has a practical bearing on unemployment. We all know that if a man who looks weak applies for work his services will not be accepted, the boss not taking the trouble to ascertain the causes of his pallor and weaknessaud There is no honnaturally choosing the strongest applicant. A book called The.

That would payall the doctors, commencing at the rate in which the of Â£ 1 5 0 a year, and going up to Â£1,000 behindhand. a year, or, in some cases, to a still larger amount, as an emolument to those in charge of administration. But as only Any one who has seen the one-third of the medical men of Great Britain are brought into contact with the workers, a much smaller contribution The would be sufficient. It is a contribution is going into the of this kind that is at the base of the 'Of all the bootmakers splendid measure that the British Government have introduced, namely, the National Insurance Act 1911, which will help on the nationalization of Tohealth. I say, without fear of contradiction, that the pallid faces of the British workers which I and my friends as, say, a saw on our recent visit to the Old Country will get colour, not only by reason of the medical assistance that will be given, but also by reason of the constant work which But will be provided by means of the unemployment f u n d . The nations whose youth are technically educated are amongst r,he strongest and most competent. The late Lord Playfair spoke of "" trained in t e l l iFor instance, where wheat is greatly grown, gence,"" and there could be no better definition of technical education. He said bhat technical education means that those who are engaged in industry should have for the special industries in which they enter as bread-winners. We all hope that the terrible evil of war will be abolished; that tlie Peace Congress at the Hague will increase its beneficent power u n t i l the nations have become as wise as the individuals in civilized where the duel has been abolished. But tliere will still be the friction of competition. There will still be wars in the making of commercial products, and in them the best trained technical intelligence will win. Therefore, I say that we should fill up the gap between the school age and the adult age, so that our people may be equipped for the work of earning their living. All should have the highest trained intelligence that technical schools can give. I am sure every honourable meinber will agree as to that. Kelvin, than whom no greater brain ever tried to solve the mysteries of electricity, said that technical training not only offered facilities for earning a livelihood, but offered knowledge which made life worth living. man, go whistling to his work-ma y be, even humming. We know that, with health pulsing his heart, and with hands that know how to carry out the ideas of his brain, he is better equipped to face the difficulties of the world than the man who has not been trained, or who is troubled with ill-health. To show how this is carried out in Prussia, the largest Statei n Germany, and whose K in g is the Emperor of that mighty nation, I may point out that in that State there are eleven mining schools; at Crefeld, a dyeing school; at Hanover, thirteen weaving schools, and eight weavers' apprentice shops. there are technical schools for the metal industry. In the North Sea and Baltic ports there are fourteen navigation schools. maintain 294 trade schools for painters, decorators, locksmiths, blacksmiths, joiners, &c. I do not mean that the district continuation and industrial schools should be confined to the leading industry of the district, but they should certainly have it as tlieir predominant feature. and we have our farming schools and agricultural colleges, a young boy who would like to follow a farming life can attend and get a technical training. a trained intelligence Country members, and members like myself who are residents of the city, must agree that the greatest asset any country can have is an intelligently-trained scientific farmer; occupying not a big area, but well-cultivated blocks where the highest intelligence, readily obtainable from public countries Departments, can be applied to the raising of food. To my mind, that is worth all the minerals, save coal and iron, that have ever been garnered out of the earth. I consider that primary subjects common to all industries, which are necessary as a groundwork, should be taught in every district school, such, for instance, as drawing, mathematics, geography, more particularly technical drawings to suit a useful purpose, and such necessary subjects as industrial bookkeeping and knowledge of business affairs. These are subLord jects that are now taught, I understand, in our agricultural colleges. I do not wish drawing to be devoted to the fine profile of a handsome face or figure, or to a landscape. I want the drawing a man can show another workman to We all know that a healthy teach him what to do. A friend of mine, a highly trained mechanic, will whose name I am not permitted to mention, but to whom I owe a great meed of gratitude for assistance in many points, has said that if there be one universal language in the world, it is sketching. You can show a German or a Frenchman by a few lines how a house is to be built. Some one has said that the harmonious sound of music is the universal language, but I lean to the other view. I do not know any person gifted with eyesight, and with brains to tliink, to whom a pencil and a piece of paper cannot explain a great deal. Certainly, the apprenticeship question should be thoroughly threshed out. I should like to see the employer taking Also, in Westphalia, his apprentices from the technical schools, so that there would be continuity of employment, thus assisting to remove the evil of unemployment. Housing, adulteration The trade unions of Germany of food, and environment also enter into this question. I cannot give a better example of environment than what we saw at Port Sunlight, which we visited iu the Coronation year. complete big body of healthy men and women working that we saw in England, Ireland, Scotland, or Wales. There was no body of workers there compared with the men at the Newport Factory; I never saw tlieir equal; but at Port Sunlight, not on charitable lines, but on business lines, the proprietor, in order to get healthy workmen, built this place. One instance alone must appeal to every one. The death rate in these little cottages and homes was but half of what it was in the suburb of Birkenhead, a few hundred yards away. Of those whom the reaper Death gathered, only half fell by the way uuder healthy surroundings, and in the absence of slums, compared with the numbers that were gathered by him in the town alongside, called Birkenhead. their homes? on a basis of 3 per ceut. rangement all through, and the employer says it pays well. slums become mere waifs on the sea of adversity.

In the forties the height for entrance to the British Army was 5 f t . 6 in. In the following decade it was reduced to 5 f t . 5 in. In another decade it came down to 5 f t . 4 in.

I take the privilege of making a long quotation from his remarks. He paid a high tribute to Australian character, and the efforts being made in this country to elevate mankind. He declared that we were gradually, but surely, evolving the noblest sentiments of humanity, and he observed that there was a tremendous difference between Australia and America, where, amidst splendid national wealth, are to be found starving girls in sweating shops. The learned professor was particularly impressed with the system of Wages Boards in Australia. He saidTheir establishment was the victory of a great principle. The principles of humanity in d equanimity have been introduced into industrial life, where formerly we had brute force. You have also adopted the principle of protecting those who, through sex or age, or other reasons, are unable to protect themselves. This great principle, you may say, is the principle of Christianity. I would call it the principle of humanity. I am quite overwhelmed with the working conditions which I have seen in your factories. I have a certain acquaintance with the clothing trade as a result of my journeys round the world. I know that in Vienna young women and girls work eleven hours a dav for Ss. a week of your money. That is not the exception, but the rule, for girls of sixteen and eighteen. Tuberculosis and other diseases run through their ranks, and the degeneration of the race follows. In New York, not in factories, it is true, but in the sweating systems known as home industries, 1 found a worse condition of affairs. In the great progressive country of America, in the slums in the east end of New York, women are working fourteen to sixteen hours a day for half-a-dolfar, and the same degeneration follows. Here, in your establishment of Foy and Gibson, I found a splendid well-ventilated room, with 250 young girls working, not by their own shining in their eyes. And there was the law that every adult was to be paid 20s. for a week of forty-eight hours. If I compare that with my experiences in Europe and America, I congratulate you heartily on what you have done. You have accomplished a splendid thing in the preThe slums, their sursent workers and in the future of the race, for the well-being of the children depends upon the well-being of the mothers, and these girls will be mothers of the future generations of Australians. I will tell my friends in France of your wonderful work, 'and I hope France will follow your example.

Drunkenness is one of the causes of unemployment of which men may r i d themselves. I come now to the question of strikes. I hate war as I hate hell, and my hatred of strikes is second only to my loathing of war, since behind every striker, as behind every soldier, I see the woman and the child who suffer. Strikes entail suffering on innocent people who have had nothing to do with them. A t the same time. I must admit, as Frost shows, that strikes have been productive of far more good than harm. There is one way of ssttling strikes which may not appeal to honourable members, but is certainly worthy of consideration if we are going to make Australia firm and strong. Some time ago there was a lock-out in connection with the collieries in Westphalia and Silesia. Some little disturbance occurred, and the masters, who had locked out their men, refused to meet in conference delegates appointed by the employees. The men asked that their hours of labour should be reduced to ten per day, and L e t us hope, .at all that they should be granted a slight increase of pay in their wages. William of Germany at last intervened, and issued aproclamation in which he said, in effect, to the workers, "" If you keep peace I w ill see that you get justice; but if you create riots I shall have you shot down likedogs."" Then he said to the mine owners, "" If you do not appoint representatives to meet the delegates of the workers; within twenty-four hours I shall appoint Alcohol, for them for you, and you will have to abideby the result."" Delegates were appointed. The request of the men was granted, and the whole trouble was over in forty-eight hours. I wish to see our Conciliation and Arbitration Court made so strong and powerful that it will be able to say to the one party, "" Thou shalt not strike,"" and to the others, "" Thou shalt not lock out until we have seen how Then, justice can be done."" such a situation, it would be a very good thing. be able to do so, and I am sure the honourable member would be glad if we could You are now a healthy reach such a stage of civilization. Timewas when there was no justice, but we now have a fair amount of it in our Courts of The Lara Institute can Law. The Inter-State Commission should be able to do much good in the matter of water conservation. We all recognise that President Roosevelt was right when he told an Australian native that we should fill up our empty spaces. Mr Elmslie, the Acting Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, assures me that although a large sum of money has been spent in advertising Australia in the United States, only five Americans have come here as settlers. Let us make it easier for our people to get on the laud, and when, instead of hundreds of applicants for one block of land, we have hundreds of blocks offering for every one applicant, let us welcome with open arms every one of the white races. In addition to improved water conservation facilities, I hope to see the time when every farmer will be within reach of a Government tank and a Government silo, so that in time of drought stock will not suffer. We all remember the splendid lines of the Australian poet, in whicli he pictures the unfortunate cattle lowing for want of water, and dying for what man had not provided for them.

If he belongs to a trade union, in many cases he is able to draw from an out-of-work fund. But whilst the unions do a lot of good in that way, they cannot long withstand such a drain upon their resources. may be generally defined as an unskilled worker, having little hope of obtaining a fixity of tenure, and who is harassed by the uncertainty of the future, and the difficulty of finding his next job. Despite all that the State Parliaments have done in the great public services, such as the railways, the call is for more organization ancl more regular and fewer relatively casual workers in the ranks of industry. When men aud women are "" temporarily"" employed by a Government for ten or twenty years, it surely is a sign of management that is not too good, for if they are worthy of being employed year after year, I see no logical reason why they should not be given permanent positions. I cannot do better at this point than quote from Mr Cyril Jackson's book, Unemployment and Trade Unions:Since trade unions are the established form of working-class organizations, it will be better to work through and with them. Briefly, four problems have to be solved. Stated as follows :1. In some trades and occupations the total number of men engaged is permanently in excess of those for whom regular work can be found. These men are, therefore, casually employed; behind me-namely , that it is for the trades and though their daily or even weekly earnings are quite adequate, their yearly earnings are not sufficient for remuneration for any kind of employment. That a decent livelihood. corrected by decasualization, which concentrates work on tbe ablest men. 2. In many trades annual spells of unemployment are inevitable. The wage earned during the other months may be ample, but unless machinery of thrift is organized the slack season brings penury and deterioration. 3. I'n most trades the cyclical depression of the world's commerce brings periods proposition which the Government have put beof unemployment too long to be met by unassisted thrift. These must be met by collective action. 4. Throughout industry the supply of unskilled labour exceeds the demand, because the occupations of boys and girls are such as to produce neither the skill nor the character necessary for the higher grades. When a This must be corrected by better technical training. Mr Jackson goes on to strongly urge the utilization and development of the machinery of the trade unions of Great Britain to effect his purpose, and then quotes from Mr Arthur Balfour's speech in the House of Commons, on the 9th April, 1910, on the Prevention of Destitution Bill, which was moved by a Ministerialist. there will not have preference to unionists. question, and I do not wish party politics introduced for a moment. The motion was seconded by Mr Balfour, at one time Leader of the Conservative party in England, and, in the course of his remarks, he saidI t is a most intolerable thing that we should permit the permanent deterioration of those who are fit for really good work. Putting aside all considerations of morals, all those considerations which move us as men of feeling, as flesh and blood, and looking at it with the hardest heart and the most calculating eye, is it not very poor economy to scrap good machinery? In a properly and scientifically organized system of industrial life in such a progressive Democracy as Australia, it should not be possible, unless in a. period of a great national calamity, and certainly not in normal times, for any citizen to become "" scrapped."" The great work performed by the trade unions in Great Britain was referred to in the House of They may be Lords on 30th August, 1909. The Leader of the Conservative party, Lord Lansdowne, observedThe sound principle in all these cases is surely that which was laid down by the noble Lord themselves to combine and fix, by their own efforts, what shall be the recognised rate of This must be is,_ I venture to say, the only really sound principle. We have, of course, recognised, and recognised in f u l l , the right of trades to organize and .to combine, in any way they think proper, for the purpose of bringingabout the principles of a living wage. Lord Salisbury, in the same debate, saidI confess that I see no way out of the main fore your Lordships' House. As far as I myself am concerned, I assent to the establishment of Trade Boards, whose principal function is to fix a minimum rate of wages. I do so, because the ordinary trade remedy appears to be impracticable. I mean the union of the workers.

Mr Gladstone, whose words ought to be written in diamonds, said that unionism was not "" a conspiracy against freedom, but a healthy combination, and one of the greatest hopes of the workers."" recognise the great good that trade unions have done for Australia, and I only wish that the casual workers, who are not trained workers, could be formed into some association which would benefit them as unionism has benefited the expert worker. trade societies throughout Australia take up the question of unemployment. certain that the every-day evidence-which collect would be of incalculable benefit to the cause. I should here like to say a word of praise of our splendid Statist, Mr Knibbs, and his able staff. scholarly American, much versed in statistics, assured me that he considered that the Commonwealth with the limited amount of money supplied for its maintenance, would hold its own with any to be found in the world. I should now like to quote a few figures just to show that wealth sometimes bears an arjpearance which acquaintance with the real conditions removes. I am informed that during the past five years the highest note circulation in Victoria during the quarter ended 31st December was that in 1910, namely, Â£934,291. On the same basis, the note issue on the 30th June, 1913, would be Â£1,008,958. Notes held in the banks are not counted; and for the March quarter, 1913, the average amount of Australian notes in the hands of the public was Â£4,047,446, representing Â£1,181,826 for Victoria, if the Commonwealth average be assumed to apply to this State. If , however, we add to this the number of notes actually out of the Commonwealth Treasury, the figure is Â£2,717,000, as against Â£934,291 in 1910. In the matter of our old-age pensions, invalid pensions, and maternity allowance, I trust that our Dr. Moloney. policy will tend to remove any stigma of poverty or pauperism. These three But, unfortuactivities of the Government must be brought under more scientific control; and there is the germ of a great idea in national insurance. In this connection, I cannot do better than quote Viscount Milner, who wrote a preface for Mr Cyril Jackson's book, from which I have already quoted. Viscount Milner saysThe State is now definitely committed to an active policy with regard to unemployment. One important step has already been taken in the establishment of Labour Exchanges supported by public funds. Another step, even more imI portant and more difficult, is likely to follow soon, viz., a State-aided system of insurance seeking to provide for the workman during spells of unemployment, and to prevent such periods from causing a permanent deterioration in his condition or in that of his family. A system of insurance would mitigate the evils of unemployment, but it would not prevent their I should like to see all the recurrence. There are other remedies striking more directly at the root of the evil, such as the better distribution and organization of work, I am and an improvement in our methods of indusevidence-practical, trial training, and of our educational system they could generally. Those words have my full approval, and, I hope, the approval of every member of A this House. It is true that in the Middle Ages the guilds sought to guarantee work for all their members, and some Department, trades unions do so even in our own day. It is to the friendly societies, however, that the greatest credit is duo for aid of this kind, though we know that thoso friendly societies are composed of thethrifty, the skilled, and the saving. It is when we have to deal with others who are not so well blessed with this world's goods, that it becomes our duty as politicians to afford help. I see that my time has about expired, and I must draw to a conclusion. I should like to see instituted some place under an attractivename, say "" The Farm of Hope,"" wheremen out of work could go and earn, not a wage calculated to interfere with private enterprise, or large enough to cause them to wish to remain, but sufficient to tide them over a difficulty, and enable them to lead a pure and healthy life, with good food and shelter, and, perhaps, to givo them a taste for country pursuit*. So, too, with the womenfolk. But I desire that the conditions of such a Homeshould not be in any way degraded.. Notwithstanding the good intentions of the State Governments, the labour farms have not been carried on' altogether as they should be. of Hope are established in the Federal Capital Territory, or in the Northern Territory, or by the States, I do not want to see the dignity of those who go to them abased. Nor do I desire that trades and callings shall be taught there. is that the men and women who go to these Homes of Hope shall be taught how to live on the land. and wife with their family may be sent to one of these homes at a time when unemployment is rife, and set up in a little house on the farm. The woman would have chickens to tend, and the man vegetables to grow. I can picture such a woman, without the fear of the landlord's knock oa Monday morning, without the dread of the butcher's, the baker's, the bootmaker's bill, saying to her husband, '' John, this life is better than the town l if e ; let us stay longer, and t r y to get a little block of land of our own on which to bring up our children in a healthier atmosphere than that of the to w n .

I have just been settling a list of questions for submission to the friendly societies of Australia, whose co-operation I , as the M in ister in charge of the social insurance project, solicit. This list of questions My idea will, I trust, be handed to the press this afternoon, so that all in Australia who desire to further this great reform may A husband help us to find the best method for doing what is needed. I have also a tentative outline of a scheme of social insurance which will cover many of the matters on which the honourable member has touched, among them unemployment. We all recognise that we cannot allow society to d r if t by adhering too strictly to what may be termed the tenets of the old economic school. It was laid down by Bentham that justice was the end of government. We may all admit that, but the difficulty is how to apply it . Following him came Herbert Spencer, par excellence the in dividualist writer of the last f if t y or sixty years. He considered pure in d i v i dualism the salvation of society, and thought that the test to be applied to all legislation was"". D i d I have seen it allow each man freedom of action so long as he allowed equal freedom of action to others? That test he would have applied to almost every legislative measure. But its application would put outside the sphere of legislation factory laws-for which I admit that trade unionism has done so much-education , sanitation, and many other measures regulating human activity, whicli have greatly improved the condition of the masses. It almost shocks us now to think that when the Ten HoursB ill was introduced i h 1858, even a man of so kindly a temperament, so clear a head, and such intense humanity as John Bright-fro m a too strict and pedantic adherence to the old Radicalism, which I very much respect, because I trust that I am somewhat of a Radicali n the best sense of the term-shoul d have been led to doubt, as I think Macaulay did, too, the efficacy of the measure. It is the desire of this Government that, so far as unemployment is capable of being mitigated, if not altogether removed, by legislation, no I give him the abstract principle of individualism, Liberalism, or Conservatism shall interfere with the placing of a measure on the statute-book which will lead to that end.

Their opinions may be exceedingly valuable, but experience has shown that they are not infallible. Let us look at the way in which votes for public works have been passed from year to year in this Parliament. As a rule, the Estimates are kept back until the last week of the session, Ministers intimate their intention of forcing them through within a certain time, we have an all night sitting, and expenditure amounting to millions of pounds is agreed to very often when only five or six honourable niembers are awake in the chamber. company that attempted to carry on business in such a way would soon have bankruptcy, if not fraudulent bankruptcy, staring it in the face. member suggest that the personnel of the Committee sbould be drawn from both sides of the House!

MrM c WILLIAMS less this Committee is to be of a wholly non-party character it must f a i l . would far rather withdraw the motion than run any risk of having a Committee that was not strictly non-party. Committee of New South Wales comprises only one out-and-out Liberal and two Independents; all the rest are members of the Labour party. MrM c WILLIAMS The r e are some points in respect of which we might make a departure from the New South Wales system. My own idea is that the Committee should consist of seven members, five members of the House of Representatives and two senators, and that .the representation of both parties should be as evenly divided as possible. W it h such a Committee, the practice of agreeing to works involving an expenditure of millions of money, with practically no information before us, and after very little consideration, would no longer be continued. Then, again, the Government of the day, knowing that the Committee would take evidence with open doors, would not dare to bring down any proposal which it A t present departmental officers thought would not bear the light of day. I am sure that our experience would be that of the States which have adopted this system. I am informed by some who have followed the proceedings of the Public Works Committees of New South Wales and Victoria that, as the result of their inquiries, enormous sums have been saved to those States. MrM c WILLIAMS S o I have been told. member think it would be better to have A a Board consisting of experts drawn from outside Parliament altogether? MrM c WILLIAMS No . I think there is too great a tendency to hand over the privileges and responsibilities of the honourable this Parliament to Boards and Commissions. If the Parliament is not competent to appoint a Committee of its own members to deal with the public works of U n d e r the New the Commonwealth, it had better make way for experts, and hand over to them the charge of the public affairs of Australia. No matter what experts were appointed, such a Board would be open to In Victoria, both sides are exactly the same criticism that is levelled now at departmental reports. My experience both in this Parliament and in Q u it e so. U n the Legislature of Tasmania has nqt been such as to make me an absolute believer I iu departmental reports. I think it would be well to have a Public Works Committee, before whom the departmental officers could appear, and which, if necessary, could take evidence from outside to determine whether or not the views expressed by the departmental experts were quite correct. Departmental officers are no more infallible than are others. the present time, the Public Works Committee is in direct conflict with the Railways Commissioners as to a certain proposal. MrM c WILLIAMS If the work is an important one, it is not a bad thing that there should be a conflict of opinion, because in such circumstances there must' be a fuller inquiry. I have no intention of labouring this question. The subject is one which I think honourable members have f u l l y considered, so that it is unnecessary to elaborate it .",40,Public Works Committee

Unless the Committee is to do its work well and thoroughly, it would be better not to appoint it.

Whether or not that is due to the fact that, of recent years, the Minister of Defence has occupied a seat in another place, I do not know, but we have had less information regarding the Defence Estimates than any other. The Defence Department has grown to be the largest spending Department in the Commonwealth. Under Admiral Henderson's scheme, the expenditure to which we are pledged amounts, roughly, and, of course, the House should be supplied with the fullest and most complete information. I am not in favour of the New South Wales principle of exempting defence work from such supervision, and every motion in this House, whether for a new work or the continuation of a work, should be referred to the Committee. before a work, such as a naval base, got before the Committee. of the naval bases are concerned, it would have been a good job if they had been referred to a Committee. In this matter, we have the choice between a waste of time and a waste of money; and, up to the present, we bave had both. We have confronting us the enormous expenditure I have mentioned; and, in addition, there are works in the Federal Territory to which we shall be asked to consent almost immediately. Practically, this House has no knowledge, and no means of obtaining knowledge, of tbe works proposed. There is no reason why this Committee should prove very expensive; and, in any case, a muddle in one of the large publio works would cost more",41,Public Works Committee

There is no necessary relation between the two matters, and it sets up what appears to be a quite vicious principle. The Auditor-General is an independent officer, his sole function being to review the financial expenditure and financial conditions of the other Departments. In himself he does nothing. He, as public auditor, guarantees to the public that everything is as the Ministerial heads declare it to be. -Government are now proposing to make him the head of a Supply and Tender Board. Sir JOH N FORREST -No. orable member's pardon. That must be the position under the A u d it Act. Such -a position ought not to be created, because if it is, the Auditor-General will have to review the acts of his own officers. He should not do that. His duty is to review the actions of officers of other Departments. The object which the Government have in view can be secured in one of two ways. It is open to them to create -a Departmental Board, such as exists in New South Wales-wher e the Under-Secretary to the Treasury, and two other Departmental heads, are constituted by departmental regulation or arrangement a Supply and Tender Board-o r they can create such a Board by special Statute. To these courses I have no objection. Either course would give the Government what they want, whilst, at the same time, it would give the Auditor-General that power to review, as an independent officer, the actions of this Board, which he will not have if he has to review, as he would have to do under this B ill , his own acts. The right honourable member says, "" No , "" but he will permit me to state my own view of the position. Clause2 of the B ill is entirely acceptable to the Opposition) but there is a difference of opinion as to whether, under clause 3, there should be created a Supply and Tender Board, or whether that Board should not be created either under a separate measure or by regulation. by StatuteI do not know that there is any particular reason for doing so-o r it may be established by regulation. think the Treasurer would be well advised to withdraw this clause, so that the B ill w i ll deal w i th one particular matter in stead of two that are entirely unrelated. Clause2 will really give the Parliament power to grant Supply for thirteen months instead of twelve. The two matters should not be embraced by the one measure. That, shortly put, is our position. The difference of'opinion relates to a matter of procedure rather than of principle, and the desire of the Government toestablish a Board should be carried out in the way I have suggested. The ThisB ill was practically thrown at us at the end of last week by the Treasurer, who, for all practical purposes, acknowledged, in the course of his remarks, that he did not understand it . That, perhaps, is not surprising; nevertheless it I beg the right honwould have been only ordinary courtesy on the right honourable member's part to make himself acquainted with the provisions of the B ill before presenting it to the House. A t the very first breath of reasonable criticism, he admitted that the B ill did not contain a very important provision whicli should have been embodied in it , and he has since emphasized that admission by himself providing for a substantial amendment. Whilst the right honourable member was moving tbe motion for the second reading of the B ill , it was interjected that the B ill did not provide that payments made uuder it during the month of July should not be in excess of the appropriation for the previous year. He replied, "" I think there is such a provision in the B ill . "" He did not know, and presumably had not looked at the measure, or taken the trouble to see that it contained such a provision. The right honourable gentleman subsequently found that it did not, and at this early stage we have had circulated by him a very important amendment, which would not have been necessary had the B ill been reasonably considered before being thrown on the table of the House. TheB ill , as introduced, and without the amendment that has now been circulated, would have made it possible for a Ministry defeated at the polls to have indulged during the month of July, without calling Parliament together, in an expenditure altogether out The Board may be created of proportion to the appropriation made during the previous year, when the House was in session. That is scarcely I permitted in the case of an ordinary SupplyB ill , granted when a Ministry holds oflice by virtue of even a large majorit y and the House is in session.",46,Forrest

How, however, we have the Treasurer throwing a Bill at honourable members which, had they not carefully looked at it-fa r more carefully than did the responsible Minister-woul d have meant that next July, for instance, the Government need not have called the House together, and would have been able to indulge in any form of expenditure which the House would have no opportunity to consider. As a matter of fact, such expenditure would practically have to be condoned, and, doubtless, would have been condonocl. Mr J. H . CATTS -And the Government complain that the Bill did not go through in one sitting. ture worth noting. complain that the Bill was not hurried through in one sitting; but it needed a mere interjection from this side to show the right honourable gentleman the necessity of practically withdrawing the Bill in order to frame an important amendment. It will scarcely be believed by the people outside, who have been misled by those references to the necessity for the Bill going through in one sitting, that in no circumstances can it come into operation until July of next year. we are past July now. the Treasurer, or the Prime Minister, suggest that we on this side wasted time in discussing the Bill for a moment, and urging that it was not a measure of urgency ? Such painful attempts to mislead the community ought to be reprimanded and severely condemned, because they are becoming regular. First of all, the Bill cannot come into operation before next July, and, in all probability, it will not be brought into operation until the July following a general election. It is inconceivable that, unless under the latter circumstances, the Ministry would delay calling the House together until after the first week in July. After an election there might be an excuse for its doing so, and then only would the Bill be of the slightest use, in so far as its main features are concerned. As the Prime Minister dealt with this particular feature of the Bill when speaking at Dandenong a day or two ago, it is permissible to refer to what he there said. Again, we have a direct and deplorable misrepresentation of the situation, as will be seen from the Prime Minister's words, as reported in the Argus of 9 th September. The honourable gentleman saidThe Opposition said, "" Bring along non-contentious Bills, and we will help you: if you will only keep ' preference' out of the way, and the postal vote out of the way."" In the first place, such words were never used by the Opposition, although the Prime Minister quotes them as actual expressions from honourable members on this side. We did invite the Government to bring along non-contentious measures, and promised to help them; and we are prepared now, and always have been, to deal with business of that description. But we made no stipulation about keepThe Government ing "" preference "" or any other subject out of the way. However, the honourable gentleman proceededLast Friday the Ministry took them at their word, with an AuditB ill and a Bill to provide an agricultural bureau. The last Government hung on to office so long that when the present Government took office it could not get the money to pay salaries, except by a stratagem, not quite legal, and which Parliament would have to indemnify. There, again, the statement is incorrect, and a distinct misrepresentation; no stratagem had to be resorted to. The House met on the 9 th July, and then, practically without discussion, the Government were granted Supply. The Bill was put through the other branch of the Legislature with equal rapidity on 10th July, four or five days before the Public Service salaries were due. There was no necessity for any stratagem, much less one which Parliament, to use the Prime Minister's own words, would have to "" indemnify."" Perhaps honourable members on the Government side are so accustomed to stratagems and methods that many honourable men reject that the idea occurs to the mind of the Prime Minister. The Government had not, and did not, resort to any stratagem, because, in the first place, thc necessity never arose, salaries not being payable until the middle of the month; and, in the second place, a Supply Bill passed both Houses long before that time, the Government having been given a clear intimation by the",47,Forrest

338,Sir John Eorkest,That is all right;,48,Forrest
339,Mr Roberts,"Then why shouldLeader of the Opposition that there would be practically no opposition to Supply before the salaries became due. these statements, puerile in themselves, though of a deceptive character, are made to a public, the members of which, by reason of their various avocations, cannot possibly know the details of the business of this House, and who are likely to accept statements coming from gentlemen holding high and responsible positions, although those gentlemen themselves must know that tbere is no justification for them. sayThe AuditB ill was to provide that in any and the Government submit this B ill as, year they could get supply without waiting for Parliament, so as to tide over the first few weeks. Mr Hughes said that it was a far-reachto raise the agricultural community to a ing reform, and it was not allowed to pass. Again, in this sentence there is a distinct and deplorable misrepresentation. It is made to appear that the A u d it B ill , in so far as it provides for tiding over the first few weeks of a new financial year, was referred to by the honourable member for West Sydney as a far-reaching measure. What the honourable member did say was that the innovation which the Government endeavoured to make by tacking on a Supply and Tender Board provision was far-reaching. So far as the B ill dealt only with the means of tiding over the first few weeks of a financial year, it was regarded as non-contentious, and we were prepared to pass it practically without a word. In that speech, liowever, it is made to appear that precisely the reverse was the case, and I am justified in calling attention to this deplorable conduct in the hope of having some effect in checking it . The Prime Minister went on to sayThe Agricultural Bureau Bill was a measure to assist the farmers and others. But these two Bills were talked about the whole day, and when the House rose on Friday they were no further forward than when it began. Here is another distinct misrepresentation. Certain speeches had been made on' both Bills, and the discussion of one had been adjourned because, at the first breath of criticism, the Government found that they knew nothing about their own measure, and had to withdraw it in order to submit an important amendment. The debate on the second B ill was adjourned when practically the ordinary hour for the adjournment of the House had arrived, after two speeches had been delivered, one by the Prime Minister, who admitted [42] that he was taken at a disadvantage, for he knew really nothing about it , and anYet other by the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs. member knows that, under ordinary circumstances, the B ill would have been in troduced by the Minister of Trade and Customs. it was for that reason that we allowed the Prime Minister, practically without criticism, to wander on in his remarks. The Prime Minister went on to We knew that he was taken at a disadvantage, although he is Prime Minister, according to the honourable member for Wannon, their supreme measure, which is standard that could never be reached by the poor members on this side, and which w ill stamp the present Government as one deserving the permanent occupancy of the Treasury benches. We know why the Minister of Trade and Customs is absent, and on that score no objection can be raised. The notes prepared for that honourable gentleman at the Customs House were sent up to the Prime Minister, who did his best. In view of this predicament of the Government, why should the Prime Minister and others go to Dandenong, or any other place, and make statements intended to convey to the public that we on this side are deliberately delaying measures, and taking undue advantage of the forms of the House to prevent the Ministry getting their business through? When we come to debate the Agricultural BureauB ill we shall be able to show very clearly that, not only the Prime Minister, but practically the whole of the Ministry, are taken at a disadvantage at the present moment. In reply to a question a day or two ago the Prime Minister had to admit that the Government had not considered the B ill in any shape or form, and really did not know what the financial provisions were to be. However, we shall deal with all this when the B ill is before us. It is reasonable to ask the Treasurer to explain what, stratagem he indulged in in order to paysalaries in the early part of July. strategy. honourable gentleman's statement.

343,Mr Roberts,"I accept the rightdistinct difference of opinion between two responsible officers wben it comes to the facts, and they are brought face to face with honourable members, whose duty it is to give attention to details. Treasury did not use any stratagem. that his Department, the paying Department, had not to resort to any strategy. But out i u the country, at places like Dandenong, before cheering crowds of Liberal supporters, the present Prime Minister said the opposite. The honourable gentleman has a right to indulge in post-prandial speeches, but he should not use the occasion to slander those on this side, and to mislead the community. Had not the Treasurer told us the truth we should have had to ascertain it by direct inquiry. I take no exception to clauses 1 and 2 of the B ill , the provisions of which are reasonable. In the month of July, particularly after a general election, it may not be convenient to call Parliament together unti l perhaps ten or twelve days after the beginning of the financial year, and the Ministry, even though defeated at the polls, would be justified in paying salaries for the transaction of the ordinary business of the country. TheB ill would permit that, the payments being in accordance with the previous appropriation. But the Acting Leader of the Opposition has properly drawn attention to -,a provision which, in my opinion, should not be retained in the measure. Clause3 provides for the establishment of a Supply and Tender Board. I do not take exception to the establishment of (not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act) such a Board, but I say that it should be for carrying out the provisions of this Act, and provided for by a separate B ill . should know, too, what the composition of the Board will be, what its functions will be, and whether its members w ill be new appointments or officers already in the service. Under the B ill the Government could appoint new men at any salaries they chose, and we have just had a message from the Governor General recommending an appropriation for the purposes of the B ill . I do not know what the amount of the appropriation will be. is intended, but it was thought that the B ill could not be introduced without a message. possible for last July. The message need not have been brought down until later. Under clause 3 the Government could establish a Supply and Tender Board, and; by regulation give it practically any powers they thought fit, without Parliament having an opportunity to criticiseI mean that the what had been done. The deletion of clause 3 is not proposed by way of an attack on the Government, and it can be agreed to without loss of dignity. Honourable members on this side feel that theprovision is not in its right place, and that the Board, if established, should be authorized by a separate B ill . Clause3 amends section 71 of the principal Act which provides for the making of regulations-by adding a new paragraph; b u t it is a matter for consideration whether the establishment of a Supply and Tender Board would be consistent with the original Act. TheA c t deals with the auditing and keeping of accounts and the proper expenditure of the appropriations of Parliament. The establishment of a Supply and Tender Board is an entirely different thing. Section 71 gives power to make regulations "" not inconsistent, with the provisions of this Act "" ; but itmight be found that regulations for the creation of a Supply and Tender Board were inconsistent, and, therefore, they would go for nothing. The Auditor General himself might say, "" Notwithstanding your amendment of the Act to provide for the establishment of this Board by regulations, the regulations are inconsistent with the Act, and, therefore, your action is ultra vires."" Section 71 readsThe Governor General may make regulations, We in particular for(a) the collection, receipt, custody, issue, expenditure, due accounting for, care, and management of all public moneys, and the guidance of all persons concerned therein; (i) the more effectual record, examination, inspection, and audit of all receipts, and expenditure, and the keeping of all necessary books and accounts; (c) prescribing the necessary forms for all books and documents whatever r e quired under the provisions of this.

That sort of thing has not been the practice in our legislation. It is only when you appoint Railways Commissioners, or some great functionaries of that kind, who are not permanent heads of Departments, that you prescribe their powers in an Act . In other cases, general powers are given. For instance, we hand over to the Public Service Commissioner the power of classification and selection of officers, and so on. Similarly, in this case it is proposed to give to the Treasurer by Act of Parliament power to appoint a Supply and Tender Board. Surely we can entrust him with the constitution of that Board as long as we define the general powers. Those powers can extend-and , as a matter of fact, they do extend in the States where they have more of these operations It is not proposed than we do-to the control and purchase of material as well as the disposition of I am prepared to put material. power to review what the Supply and Tender Board does?

The Auditor General of no State to-day has the enormous amount of work to supervise that the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth has. The whole of the time of our Auditor-General is consumed by his present duties. He is in a different position from that which this Tender Board will"" occupy. The Auditor-General presents his report to this House. He is responsible to Parliament, and not to the Government.

By adopting that course now the public finances would be protected in a way that they cannot be protected under this Bill.

He is well acquainted with the fact that Parliament was deliberately called together very late in that year, and that it was for that reason that at the end of the previous session a SupplyB ill was passed authorizing expenditure for the first two months of the next financial year.

Mr W. H . IBVINE -There is no such proposal. cipal Act, which clause 31 of the Bill proposes to amend, gives the Governor General power to make regulations, and that is the Act which controls the Auditor-General, and with the assistance of which he, in turn, controls the accounts of the Departments. Mr W. H . IBVINE -That is right. the principal Act tbe Governor General may make regulations, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act, for carrying out those provisions, and in particular for(a) the collection, receipt, custody, issue, exsional lawyers, and the balance bush penditure, due accounting for care and management of all public moneys and the guidance of all persons concerned therein; (i) the more effectual record, examination, inspection, and audit of all receipts and expenditure, and the keeping of all necessary books and accounts; {c) prescribing the necessary forms for all books and documents whatever required under the provisions of this Act or the regulations; (d) requiring omcers, holding positions which in the opinion of the Treasurer ought to be guaranteed to contribute to the Guarantee Fund; (e) providing for the control and management of the Guarantee Fund. In my opinion it is dangerous to allow regulations to govern business of that description ; but, in any case, it is now proposed that the Auditor-General shall be empowered to make regulations governing the purchase, custody, control, and issue of public stores, which, I contend, cannot be considered relevant to an Audit Act. Personally, I am not at all opposed to some sort of tribunal to insure a more effective examination of tenders, and exercise control over the purchase of stores made by the Departments, because such a body would be particularly useful. In my opinion, however, this is the wrong Bill in which to provide for such a tribunal. It would be much more satisfactory to provide for this control in a separate Bill, which can be criticised here, and not leave it to regulations. I shall give a general support to the first part of this measure. I have no desire to impede its progress; but I must commend the points I have raised to the attention of the Treasurer. ber say that he will go so far as to support the first clause, which provides, "" This Act may be cited as the Audit Act 1913 ""I commit myself to support anything with which the honourable member might be even conceivably associated. of order. It was the practice in the House of Commons, probably hundreds of years ago, to introduce Bills embodying possibly half-a-dozen subjects; but time and experience showed that it was desirable to confine a measure to one purpose only. One might have expected, with a Ministry consisting of five profeslawyers waiting to hear the point of order. Treasurer got permission to introduce a Bill to amend the Audit Act; and an audit, as honourable members know, is something quite different from the regulation of the purchase, custody, control, and issue of stores. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, kuow that a clause is not in order which exceeds the order of leave, as I submit clause 3 of this Bill does. I direct your attention to May, eleventh edition, page 465, in which we are toldIn preparing Bills, care must be taken that they do not contain provisions which are not authorized by the order of leave, that the prefatory paragraph prefixed to a B ill , which defines the object thereof, known as the title of a B ill , corresponds with the order of leave, and that the Bill itself is prepared pursuant to the order of leave, and in proper for m ; for, if it should appear that these rules have not been observed, the House will order it to be withdrawn. I presume that honourable members are not going, for political purposes surely nothing to do with the point of order. "" the order of leave.""

TheB ill is one to amend the A u d it Act , and the clause to which the honourable member takes exception is a clause to amend a section of that Act . I can see nothing in the clause inconsistent with the B ill , nor anything in the amendment in consistent with the original Act. MrW . H . IRVINE (Flinders-Attor ney-General) [9.38] I wish to address myself shortly to the point raised by honourable members opposite, that the clause referred to is one that ought not The question is not whether it might not form part of another B ill , or form a B ill by itself, but whether it properly forms part of a B i ll to amend the A u d it Act. pretty well defined at law, and known to men of business. They involve not merely accountancy, but also the investigation of all the affairs and finances of the company, corporation, or government for which the audit is made. Auditing involves the examination of vouchers for all payments, the ascertaining of the existence of the property alleged to have been purchased with money spent, and other things. The duties of an auditor are stated clearly in the Encyclo-pcedia of the La vis of EnglandAn auditor may be described as a person whose duty it is to examine the accounts of a, company, firm, or person, so as to ascertain the exact state of affairs financially at a given moment. This involves, not only a scrutiny of the figures, but also an examination of the form and substance of the accounts, in order to see that they truly represent the state of affairs purporting to be represented by them. Although the duties of an auditor are not usually construed to extend to valuation, they include the ascertaining of the existence of the goods for the purchase of which money has been expended. A general supervision of stores, and the ascertaining where they are, what is l e f t of them, what has been issued, and what has come in , fal l within the scope of an auditor's duties. MrW . H . IRVINE siderable doubt has been expressed from time to time, b u t I think it is now the I think generally conceived opinion that an auditor's duties do not strictly cover valuation, unless there is depreciation such as I should like to elaborate must be patent to every ordinary man of business. It is not the duty of an auditor, I am in in auditing the accounts of a company holding mortgages on properties extending over a wide area, to visit all those properties, to find out whether they are correctly valued. depreciation of stores. MrW . H . IRVINE If stores had been destroyed, it would come within the duty of an auditor to ascertain that fact. The auditor must be able to say that money supposed to be represented in goods is so represented; but it is not his duty to to find a place in the B ill . make valuations. Among the duties of an auditor is the ascertaining of the existence of, and the supervision of the dealing with , stores. The honourable member for Denison says that we wish to make The scope of an auditor's duties is the Auditor-General .an inspector of stores, but that is expressly provided for by the A u d it Act. the clause mixes up the purchasing of stores with the auditing of stores. MrW . H . IRVINE T h a t is not so. Regulations imposing the conditions under which stores may be purchased, used, kept, and controlled are essentially within the purview of the matters over which the Auditor-General ought to have, and has expressly been given, jurisdiction. This is the title of the A u d it Act An Act to make provision for the collection and payment of public moneys, the Audit of Public Accounts, and the Protection and Recovery of Public Property, and for other purposes. The main duties of the Auditor-General are therein set out.

I am merely showing that the purchase, issue, and control of stores naturally come within an Act dealing generally with the duties of public accountants, and of the Auditor-General, who is given a particular kind of supervision over these things. Under paragraph e he mustexamine whether the proper quantities of all such stores are remaining in stock in the proper store or building. It is his duty, not merely to supervise and see that conditions imposed by law or regulation are complied w it h , but also to satisfy himself that stores representing the money that has been paid out are where they ought to be. The general conditions under which public stores may be kept and issued come within the scope of those matters over which the Auditor General is given supervision. Auditor-General that supervision at the present time? MrW . H . IRVINE are contained in the Act from whicli I am quoting. The first point tliat I want to make is that the general supervision of stores-no t as a purchaser, not as a M in isterial head-is under the auditorial supervision of the Auditor-General. The next point that has been made is that this measure, if carried, will give the Auditor General power to purchase, control, and issue stores. It will give him nothing of the kind . tended. The contention merely is that the Government Auditor-General with men who are purchasing stores. MrW . H*. IRVINE as I shall show. I am now showing that this is not a regulation which will necessarily, or even any additional powers to the Auditor General. Whati t will do has to be read in connection with the section to which it is an addition. That section is number 71. What does it provideThe Governor General may make regulations (not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act) for carrying out the provisions of this Act, and in particular, for(a) the collection, receipt, custody, issue, expenditure, due accounting for care and management of all public moneys, I have not imand the guidance of all persons concerned therein; (b) the more effectual record, examination, 4 inspection, and audit of all receipt* and expenditure, and the keeping of all necessary books and accounts; (c) prescribing the necessary forms for all' books and documents whatever required under the provisions of this. Act or the regulations; (d) requiring officers holding positions, whichs in the opinion of the Treasurer ought to be guaranteed, to contribute to theGuarantee Fund; (e) providing for the control and management of the Guarantee Fund. None of those duties, except indirectly,, imposes any powers whatever upon theAuditor-General, but some of them mayimpose conditions which he wil l have to see have been complied with before hecan say that a proper audit has been madeof the affairs of the Treasury officers, who are conducting the actual receipt and expenditure of money. It is only incidentally that they affect the Auditor-General.. General will have to see have been complied .with. That is all. ThisB ill , then, merely imposes another condition. It is Yes ; the powers not an enabling measure. It does not enable the Auditor-General to do anything. It merely says that the Governor General may make regulations affecting the control and issue of public stores. Auditor-General. MrW . H . IRVINE D i c t a t in g to him certain conditions which he must comply with . MrW . H . IRVINE The House must judge of that. I am only explainare associating the ing what is being done. We have to read the A u d it Act generally. First, there are the provisions for the safety of the public, laying down conditions under which T h a t is not so, public money can be issued. Over all those the Auditor-General is given control. He must find whether the money probably, give has been properly appropriated by Parliament. Those are all provisions relating to his duties.

He has to see that particular moneys whicb have gone out of the Treasury have received the appropriation of Parliament.

Under section 71, if the Governor General does make those regulations, the Auditor-General may have, and probably w ill have, other duties imposed upon him-namely , to see that these regulations have been complied with. But he is still in exactly the same position of complete independence as a high official charged with the duty of seeing whether the law has been complied with, and whether the money of the Government is intact in the shape of funds or stores.

625,Mr Laird Smith,"The PrimeM i nDepartments. Before attempting to show why they were so late in furnishing to the Auditor-General the necessary accounts, may I ask the Prime Minister to agree to leave being granted to me to continue my remarks to-morrow, since I gather from a nod by the Minister that he is anxious to close for the night? We were here until midnight yesterday, with the result that some of us did not get home until 1 or 2 o'clock this morning. We shall have to meet again at 10.30 tomorrow morning, and I , therefore, ask the Prime Minister for leave to continue my speech to-morrow. honourable member that we have been here all the week, and have done no business ? Prime Minister will admit that I have not been guilty of any unnecessary opposition. the honourable member's request at this time of night, seeing that no business has been done. any honourable member, in order to make himself good with the public outside, should question the ability of officers whose ability is really beyond question. Commonwealth took over the best officers of the State Departments, and we have at the head of our Departments capable men quite able to look after the interest? of Australia. The Prime Minister casts n reflection upon them when he says that the Auditor-General is unable to f u l f i l his tor-general of stores. It is an unfortunduties owing to tbe neglect of some person. The system is responsible for the delay. The financial year closes on the SOth June, and the accounts have to come from, say, Western Australia, or southern Tasmania: or auditors have to be sent to those places. How is it possible for the Auditor-General's officers to audit the accounts more quickly than hitherto? The Departments have grown much within the last few years, owing to the fact that the late Government were a Government who did something, and, in doing that something, they created new work. I question very much whether the present Government will be able to furnish the accounts to the Auditor-General any earlier than did the previous Government. I do not think that the Honorary Minister would intentionally mislead this House; and, in my simplicity, I believe statements made from the other side. should wait u n t i l he knows the Honorary Minister better! that it was in my simplicity, as a young member of the House, that I took it for granted that neither the HonoraryM in ister nor the Prime Minister would mislead honourable members. We were told that this was a simple little B ill ; and I had no intention to speak unti l I heard four honourable members on the Government side give four different interpretations of the measure. The only honourable gentleman opposite who, in my humble opinion, after my twenty-one years' the experience of the making out of requisitions for stores for a big Department, presented the B ill to us in a way that I I think the could grasp was the Attorney-General; and I feel deeply grateful to him for the information he has imparted. I do not know that, after only three years' experience as a member here, I am quite at liberty to adversely criticise the Treasurer, with his many years of parliamentary life behind him,"" and his reputaI regret that tion as a financier; but I must say that, after having listened attentively ifco him when he introduced the B ill . I find the views I then formed as to tbe object of The the measure entirely changed by the explanation of the Attorney-General. I am in agreement with this B ill up to a certain point, because undoubtedly the A u d it A ct needs amendment; but I fail to see the propriety of imposing on the Auditor-General the duties of an inspecate fact that there is a different system of storekeeping in each one of the States, and each Department has its own Stores Branch. The Post Office, the Department of Home Affairs, and the Defence Department, each has a Stores Branch, and the work in this connection must increase as the years go on. My idea is that we ought to have an expert inspector-general of stores, and that the machinery suggested by the Government will, if created, clog before long. An inspectorgeneral would bring about a uniform system throughout the Commonwealth, and this would be of great advantage. I question very much whether it could be ascertained now what stores there are in stock in any one of the Departments, and there is practically no expert supervision over their issue.

656,Mr Fenton,"The Prime Minister,Last session the Prime Minister complained that the Auditor-General's report had been presented to Parliament only in the dying hours of the session. No matter what Government has been in power, it seems to me that the Auditor General's report has always been presented during the closing weeks of the session. I recollect one year in which the Treasurer represented this country in Soutli Africa, and that may have caused some delay, and also in another year this Parliament did not meet until September, because the honourable Wide Bay and other members attended the Imperial Conference in London and arrived here late. Minister ought to realize when he is making these complaints-whethe r he is reading from a report of the Auditor-General or not-that he is throwing a certain amount of odium upon leading public servants of this country, especially tliose who are associated with the making up of our accounts. Last session, after the honourable gentleman had made complaints similar to those which he made here tonight, the ex-Prime Minister spoke as follows: The statement of the honourable member for that the duty of the Auditor-General is Parramatta is so far from what I sliould call to analyze the accounts and vouchers just a judicial criticism regarding the presentation as any auditor deals with the vouchers, of the Auditor-General's report as to be of no accounts, and balance-sheet of a company. value whatever. To say that there is no control over the finances because the Auditor-GeneI hold in my hand a certificate as to ral's report has only just been presented is not what an auditor does under the Comwithin measurable distance of fact or truth. panies Act in Victoria. I take it that The Auditor-General's report is in the hands of the auditor to a public company or a honourable members, and the position of the Government can be tested, if not in this House, big concern acts in relation to the comelsewhere. appointed as an impartial critic of the finances, monwealth. and yet we have not been allowed to know until now what his opinion of the public accounts is. withdraw the remark that my statement was not within measurable distance of fact or truth. It was most offensive. to the honourable member, I withdraw it, and with a l l the more pleasure, because his objection indicates that he did not know what his language conveyed. Like other honourable members on this side, I was under the misapprehension that he had made the allegation that the Government had delayed the presentation of the Auditor General's report to prevent the Opposition from criticising. our financial administration, and had conveyed the suggestion that there is no control over the finances. covers the honourable member's statement. Auditor-General acquits the Treasury of any intention to do other than facilitate the presentation of accounts. He says that the Treasury officials showed every desire to bring matters Mr Fenton. before him. If there is one thing that I should like more than another, it is the presentation to the public of the results of a f u l l investigation of Commonwealth affairs since we took office, and such a statement will be presented to the public. That is a manly, truth f u l statement, which ought to iiave prevented honourable members when seeking election, or trying to secure the election of comrades, making many of these diatribes against the financial conduct of the Commonwealth. That is unpatriotic conduct, in my opinion. I am not here to defend member for the honourable member for Wide Bay. There is not the slightest doubt that had he been here to-night he would have ably The Prime refuted what the Jfrime Minister has said. I think it is about time that we laid aside the reports of the Auditor-General, and ceased to quote them ever and anon, in the hope that in throwing a lot of mud some of it may stick to a poUtical party. While1 congratulate the Attorney-General upon the lucid exposition he gave of this B ill , for which we are very thankful, I do say that he has wrongly apprehended the duties of an auditor. 1 believe that I am a little at variance with some of my honourable friends on this side. 1 take it pany in the same way as the AuditorA n auditor's certincate in this State reads as follows: I report that I have examined the books and accounts of the . . . . company for the year ended 30th April, 1913, and that I have obtained from the officers of the company all the information and explanations I have required. In my opinion the accompanying balance-sheet is properly drawn up, and exhibits a true and correct view of the state of the company's affairs, according to the best of my information, and the explanations given to me, and as shown by the books of the company. If we saddle the Auditor-General with extra duties-the functions of inspectorgeneral of stores in the CommonwealthI did say that. we shall take him out of the position for my remark clearly which he was appointed, and charge him The with certain duties which ought to be performed by an expert.

Such a thing would be physically impossible. I trust that a vote will be taken which wil l confine the Auditor-General to his proper sphere, and so relieve him from the duties of comptroller or inspector of stores. It is quite likely that to-morrow I shall havo some observations to make on the S ill in Committee. I trust that the Treasurer, as well as his colleagues and their supporters, will take kindly any hints that may come from this side. The complaint made by the Opposition in the last Parliament was that the Labour Government would never take any hints or suggestions from them, but I sincerely trust that any hints from the present Opposition regarding this measure will receive fair consideration. I hope that when the B ill is brought on for consideration in Committee, one of the first announcements made by the Treasurer will be that he intends'to relieve the Auditor-General of the duties of comptroller of stores. of that portion cf the B ill which deals with the expenditure of money on the public services and other items, but I consider that the purchase of stores, and the consideration of tenders, are matters which ought to be dealt with in a separate measure. surer) [11.15] I do not think that I shall be prepared to take tlie honourable member's advice and to alter the Bill in the way that he suggests. It seems.to me that if we did nothing, we should have no trouble; but that when we desire to do something that will be of advantage to the Parliament and the country, we are met with a host of objections. A good deal of care has already been exercised in connection with the purchase,-custody, and control of stores. The work has not been allowed to proceed in a haphazard way. We have used, up to the present time, the Tender Boards of the States with great advantage. complete set of regulations with regard to the purchase, custody, and control of public stores, and, with the concurrence of the State Government, to whom we are much [44] obliged, we have availed ourselves of them. There has been, however, some want of Is any one prepared to tell me organization on our own part, and we are now trying to perfect the system. Even at the present time it is open to us to make Treasury regulations dealing with the subject, but they would not have the force of law, and, perhaps, would not be as binding on the Auditor-General as regulations are. The reason for the insertion in this B ill of a clause giving the Governor General in Council power to make regulations for the purchase, custody, control, and issue of stores is that we desir9 that regulations having the force of law, instead of Treasury instructions, -shall be framed. I am quite surprised that any exception should have been taken to this B ill . The first part merely makes provision for a convenient arrangement. It will be, no doubt, of assistance to the Government and to their successors. It is a machinery provision, which has been much talked of, and which, it was thought, would readily meet with the concurrence of the House. The only object that we have in view in connection with the second part of the B ill is to t r y to afford greater security than at present exists. The objection that has been taken I am in favour that clause 3 is in the wrong place-that such a provision should not be in an A u d it Bill-ha s been shown by the Attorney General to be without foundation. In every State, I think, the purchase, control, and custody of stores is provided for by regulations made by virtue of a section in the A u d it or some other Act. It is not covered by a separate Statute. Nothing but good can result from this proposal. We are not seeking under it to make our path easier. We are really imposing morerestrictions upon .the expenditure of public money, and taking upon ourselves, as administrators, more burdens. Honourable members opposite have been good enough to approve of tbe principles of the B ill ; but they seem to disapprove of the form it takes. The speeches made to-night should rightly have been made, I think, in Committee, for they have not dealt with the principles of the B ill .
