(2) What definition of transaction is used to determine these figures. (3) What proportion of these transactions were or are expected to be conducted online. (4) What was the total cost of administering these transactions for each agency in (a) 1998–99 and (b) 1999–2000 and what is the estimated cost for (c) 2000–01, (d) 2001–02, (e) 2002–03 and (f) 2003– 04. (5) What was the total cost of administering the online transactions in (a) 1998–99 and (b) 1999– 2000 and what is the estimated cost for (c) 2000–01, (d) 2001–02, (e) 2002–03 and (f) 2003–04. (1) to (5) The Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business has an extensive and complex online presence which provides a variety of services to the public. All of these services could be classed as transactions of a sort but some are rather different to the classical definition. For example, these transactions vary from the availability of information/advices, electronic publications and static information, through to the functionality that exists on the Australian JobSearch site allowing users to search for a vacant position online, and the services the department provides for registering and searching for an ABN on behalf of the Australian Taxation Office. The number of these transactions is difficult to quantify and forecasts don’t exist. Indeed the type of online transactions are difficult to quantify and not comparable. While statistics exist for the usage of a particular website, these are based on the number of pages viewed by an individual visiting the site. I refer you to my department’s recently completed Online Action Plan: http://www.dewrsb.gov.au/department/keyCorporateDocuments/onlineActionPlan/default.asp. The Online Action Plan outlines our achievements and future directions in online service delivery. It contains details of all the services currently offered via our websites and extranets, and how these will be enhanced. The Action Plan has identified that over 90% of the department’s information is now available online. The table below sets out the websites operated by the department: Service Beneficiary Group(s) Area Consultative Committee Business, Community Organisations, Individuals Australian Jobsearch Individuals, Business, Community Organisations AJS Indigenous Service Individuals, Business, Community Organisations Business Entry Point Business, Individuals,Government ABR Online Business, Government IES Community Work Coordinator CWC Providers Reports IES – Centrelink Centrelink IES – Job Network Job Network Providers Job Network Individuals, Business, Community Organisations Seacare Authority Individuals, Business Work for the Dole Individuals,Community Organisations Wagenet Employers, Employees WomensWeb Individual, Business",121,Roads To Recovery Bill 2000 That Transportation Of Coal By Road Is A Real
261,Mr Reith,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:These services have been well-received by the public. Our achievements include over 500,000 Australian Business Number (ABN) registrations received via the Business Entry Point website – over 15 per cent of the total registrations – and over 100 million page views on the Australian JobSearch website during 1999–2000. Page views for all departmental websites total in excess of 135 million for the same period. Alternatives to online service delivery are provided where required. For example, the Australian JobSearch site lists vacant positions, but these are also available through Job Network member offices. Similarly, registration for an ABN is available via the Internet, but it is also available directly from the Australian Taxation Office or from accountants via their electronic lodgement systems. The total cost of administering the services provided in this environment has not at this stage been fully assessed, however there have been significant savings achieved by the Commonwealth in bringing services online. For example, with the introduction of the Australian JobSearch system (both web and touchscreen units) there has been greater public access to jobs, with over 50,000 jobs online and over 500,000 actual searches performed per day. The overall costs involved have also decreased even though the number of physical sites has increased from 500 (under the Commonwealth Employment Service) to over 2100 (Job Network). These savings would not have been possible without the use of online delivery. Given the nature of their services, some of the department’s portfolio agencies have been able to provide more specific answers. These are set out below.

In this context, its dealings (transactions) are with parties who appear before the Commission. The vast majority of parties before the Commission are either registered organisations of employers or employees, or, employers or practitioners acting on behalf of employers or employees. Similarly, adopting a definition of transaction as the selling of goods and services (such as publication sales), the AIR primarily sells publications such as awards, orders and decisions of the Commission to the parties noted above, as well as to educational institutions and Government departments. The AIR does not keep any records on individual transactions with individual members of the public, under either definition of transaction.

These costs would be a small component and difficult to isolate. Department of Veterans’ Affairs: Transactions (Question No. 1692) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 26 June 2000: (1) How many individual transactions with individual members of the public were conducted by each agency in the Minister’s portfolio in (a) 1998-99 and (b) 1999-2000, and if available, what are the forecast figures for (c) 2000-01, (d) 2001-02, (e) 2002-03 and (f) 2003-04. (2) What definition of transaction is used to determine these figures. (3) What proportion of these transactions were or are expected to be conducted online. (4) What was the total cost of administering these transactions for each agency in (a) 1998-99 and (b) 1999-2000 and what is the estimated cost for (c) 2001-01, (d) 2001-02, (e) 2002-03 and (f) 2003-04.

Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The very detailed information sought by the honourable member’s question is not readily available in consolidated form and it would be a major task to collect it and assemble it. I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure of time and money to do so. (2) See answer to Question (1) above. (3) See answer to Question (1) above. (4) See answer to Question (1) above.

Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs: Airport Costs (Question No. 1998) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: What has been the cost each year since 1995, including 2000, of providing immigration services and processing at each airport where those services are provided. 1995/96 1996/97 1997/98 1998/99 1999/00 2000/01 NSW 3,194,226 3,901,817 3,519,770 3,166,519 3,887,715 989,585 VIC 1,123,000 1,168,579 1,103,267 1,246,328 1,317,301 488,046",122,Dewrsb Corporate Site Individuals Community Organisations Business
262,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:1995/96 1996/97 1997/98 1998/99 1999/00 2000/01 QLD 1,223,758 1,290,824 1,322,108 1,470,288 1,499,039 407,753 WA 918,375 918,628 882,402 847,745 915,173 224,842 SA 151,607 104,587 99,101 113,989 133,230 39,208 TAS 7,237 4,569 4,569 495 515 0 NT 290,894 322,819 205,420 305,974 362,279 108,850 ACT 2,296 2,552 2,835 3,150 3,500 1,155 Total 6,911,393 7,714,375 7,139,472 7,154,488 8,118,752 2,259,439 Notes: The costs set out above: are only those incurred by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) directly in providing immigration services and processing at airports, broken down on a regional basis. encompass salary costs, general administrative expenditure and estimates of related state/territory corporate support costs. do not include costs such as central office and legal support, visa systems and other related expenditure. do not equate to the costings used in the past in determining the amount of the Passenger Movement Charge– specifically, they do not factor in the costs of short stay visitor visas which are not part of the immigration services or processing which takes place at airports. The Australian Customs Service (ACS) also conducts immigration processing on behalf of DIMA. Those costs are incurred by ACS and are not included in the figures set out above. All states except Queensland and Western Australia have only one international airport and therefore the figures set out above relate to the airport in that state. Queensland’s costs include airports Brisbane, Cairns, Coolangatta and Townsville, at which immigration services were provided for all or part of the period covered by the question. Western Australia’s costs include airports in Perth and Broome, at which immigration services were provided for all or part of the period covered by the question. For Qld and WA: Overall costs for 1995/96 are estimates costs specific to airports are not accessible for this period. For NT: Costs for administrative expenditure from 1995/96 to 1997/98 are estimates because compliance and airport operations were combined in this period and no airport specific figures have been retained. For ACT: Because flights are infrequent, ACT does not have resources dedicated directly to airport operations. Costs are estimates based on a nominal allocation of resources to the task of airport operations. For year 2000/01: Covers period from 1/7/2000 to 11/10/2000 only. Vietnam Veterans: Honours and Awards (Question No. 2050) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 October 2000: If, as stated, the ASM with clasp Vietnam 1975 is only cancelled once eligibility for the AASM has been established, why has the Director Honours and Awards, Air Force Medals Section, Defence Personnel Executive, advised recipients that the ASM with clasp Vietnam 1975 is no longer recognised under the Australian Honours System and must therefore be cancelled. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: On 18 August 1998, the Governor General revoked the Instrument of Declaration and determination for the ASM with Clasp ‘Vietnam 1975’ and approved a similar Instrument which established the AASM with Clasp ‘Vietnam 1975’. This was as a result of a Defence Review which changed the service in Vietnam at the time from non-warlike to warlike. As the AASM and the ASM recognise warlike and non-warlike service, respectively, they cannot both be awarded for the same operation. As the Instrument for the ASM with Clasp ‘Vietnam 1975’ has been revoked, it is no longer a valid award. It should be pointed out that this change was effected following representations from those veterans claiming that their service should have been recognised by the AASM, not the ASM. To receive the AASM with Clasp ‘Vietnam 1975’, recipients of the ASM with Clasp ‘Vietnam 1975’ are required to surrender their award when applying for the new award. The ASM with Clasp ‘Vietnam 1975’ is then individually cancelled once entitlement to the AASM with Clasp ‘Vietnam 1975’ is established. East Timor: Australian Troops (Question No. 2075) Mr Rudd asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 October 2000: (1) Does he regard the current practice of providing Australian troops serving in East Timor with one free telephone call to Australia each week of 5 – 10 minutes as adequate. (2) Has he, his Department or the ADF received complaints from Australian troops in East Timor about the adequacy of this service in terms of the ability of these troops to maintain contact with families and loved ones back in Australia. (3)What are the current charging rates for calls from East Timor to Australia on commercial mobile phones provided by OPTUS and Telstra that are available to Australian troops and are these rates comparable to other international mobile rates over similar distances. (4) Does he intend to take any action to encourage OPTUS and Telstra to provide more affordable charging rates for soldiers in East Timor. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) No. (3) Both Telstra and OPTUS have satellite pay phone facilities in East Timor for the use of Australian troops. Only Telstra operates a mobile telephone (GSM) network. (a) Calls made on Telstra pay phones are charged at $1.00 per minute. (b) Calls made on OPTUS pay phones are charged at $1.20 per minute. (c) With respect to Telstra mobile telephone calls, East Timor is treated as a part of Australia for billing purposes. The call costs will vary depending on the individual plan that soldiers have selected and the location that is called. Indicative estimates are between $0.30 to $1.20 per minute. These rates are excellent in comparison to international roaming rates which would otherwise apply, which vary between $5.50 and $6.50 per minute. (4) No. War Widows Benefits (Question No. 2088) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 30 October 2000: In correspondence to one of my constituents, MrsM Goodenough, did his Senior Adviser estimate the cost of reinstating War Widow’s pensions to widows who remarried prior to 1984 at $65 million over four years; if so, on what basis was this figure calculated. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: My Senior Adviser advised Mrs Goodenough by letter dated 28 August 1998 that the cost of recommencing payment of a war widow’s pension to widows who had remarried prior to 1984, and thus relinquished their pensions, would be $65 million for the first four years. This estimate was calculated on the basis that there were some 4,500 former war widows alive on 28 May 1984. The average age of war widows on 28 May 1984 was approximately 64 years of age. By applying the average mortality rates drawn from the Australian Life Tables 1990-92, the number of surviving widows in 1997 was estimated to be about 4,100 with an average age of 77 years. The estimate of $65 million over a four year period was based on providing war widow’s pensions to these 4,100 former widows. The calculation took into account that most of the widows would already be in receipt of age pension and Pensioner Concession Cards. The average value of these benefits was deducted from the costs of providing war widow’s benefits. Chinese Government: South Pacific Nations (Question No. 2097) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 31 October 2000: (1) Is he able to say whether the Chinese Government recently agreed to pay US$13m to Papua New Guinea and sent a military delegation there in July? (2) Is he able to say whether the Chinese Government has a military training regime with Tonga? (3) Is he able to say whether the Chinese Government has a missile tracking station in Kiribati? (4) Is he also able to say whether the Solomon Islands is on the verge of terminating its relationship with Taiwan and that its Foreign Minister was recently in Beijing? (1) A delegation from the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) visited Papua New Guinea (PNG) in early July 2000. Following the visit it was announced that the PLA would provide logistic aid to the PNG Defence Force. This was to include the provision of basic stores and non-lethal equipment. The value of the Chinese logistic assistance is in the order of $3 million. (2) The Tongan Government announced this year that a Memorandum of Close Cooperation had been concluded in July between the Tongan Defence Service and the PRC’s People’s Liberation Army. Tonga will receive military clothing, gym equipment, training, and the services of an expert in martial arts instruction. (3) Press reports announced the opening of the China Space Tracking, Telemetry and Command Station in Kiribati on 6 October 1997, which will be operated by the Chinese Government as part of its monitoring and control network for supporting satellite and carrier rocket launchings. (4)The Solomon Islands Government has announced it will maintain its relationship with Taiwan. The Solomon Islands Foreign Minister recently visited Hong Kong SAR, not Beijing. East Timor: Australian Troops (Question No. 2104) Ms O’Byrne asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 1 November 2000: (1) How many Australian service personnel contracted dengue fever while serving in East Timor. (2) Were Australian troops provided with appropriate preventitive medication for dengue fever. (3) If so, was this medication provided prior to arrival in east Timor; if not, how many personnel were not provided with medication until after their first day of service in East Timor. (4) If medication was not provided, why not. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) As of 1 November 2000 there has been a total of 227 known clinical cases of dengue fever. (2) No. (3) Not applicable. (4) There is no preventive medication effective against dengue.",125,Dewrsb Corporate Site Individuals Community Organisations Business
263,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Illegal Immigration: Pyrton Site (Question No. 2132) Mr Stephen Smith asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 6 November 2000: (1) Has there been communication between the government and the WA Government over the possibility of part of the Pyrton site at Eden Hill in Perth being used as a detention centre for illegal immigrants. (2) Has there been communication between the Government and the WA Government about the use of that site, other than as a women’s prison. (3) Does he have, or is he considering, proposals for the site, other than as a women’s prison. (1) to (3) There are no plans to develop an Immigration Detention Centre at Pyrton or to locate such a facility within a Western Australian State Prison or rehabilitation centre. The Commonwealth Government has Immigration Reception and Processing Centres for unauthorised boat arrivals at Port Hedland and the RAAF Base at Curtin. The Government also has a small immigration detention centre located at Perth Airport. The only plans for the construction of a new immigration detention centre are for a larger centre at Perth Airport in a few years time.",128,Dewrsb Corporate Site Individuals Community Organisations Business
