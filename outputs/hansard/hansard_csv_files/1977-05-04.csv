In November he spoke of: 'also significant number of migrants lacking in fluency in English and suitable work skills'. In April he had elaborated; 'This office continues to be faced with significant difficulties in placing the majority of its adult clients, mainly because a large number of them are hard core unemployed because of their work habits and choice i.e. entertainers, those on the fringe of the service occupations, and those seeking non-manual occupations'. That same April the manager had mentioned less employers in this area and the numbers going down. Also noted that employers in other areas are reluctant to accept applicants from this office-becaus e of the reputation of the area. See also city of Sydney town planner's survey ofjobs in Chippendale. The overall ratio of unfilled vacancies to unemployed may be 1-1 6 at this office but a closer look reveals that for unskilled manual work rauo is one vacancy for eveiy 229 males, for semi-skilled work it is one vacancy for every 35 adult males, for service occupation it is one vacancy for every 380 adult males.
