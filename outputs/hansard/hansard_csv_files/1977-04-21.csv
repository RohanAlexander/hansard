In other words, that inquiry will deal with the The Government has taken constructive steps very question raised in this House by the honourto deal with the situation of the imbalance in the able member for Gellibrand on 11 September labour market. Firstly let me outline some of the 1975. A related inquiry which has been instituted important changes which have been by this Government is the Myers inquiry into unimplemented in the National Employment and employment benefit policy and administration.

In January 1976, shortly after The terms of reference for the inquiry require it the present Government took office, some 7300 to examine the adequacy in present circumpersons were training with assistance under stances of the underlying concept and NEAT.

At the end of will bring forward recommendations as to February 1977 NEATtiaineesnumbered 15 500 whether the system requires modification and, if as against the 7300 I mentioned earlier. That so, in what respects, to adequately express the represents the highest level of trainees obtained Government's basic policy of directing assistsince NEAT began in October 1974. Thus, under ance to those most in need. The inquiry is also to the present Government in just over one year assess, in the light of any policy changes it may general labour market training under NEAT has recommend, the extent to which present admindrastically increased.

These claims are, as I himself, that he ought to have been so satisfied and that in understand them, essentially two.

Thus Manual's use of the phrase 'as a general rule', repeated in paragraph 7.303 reads: the standard form of letter to school leavers, the application of the general rule to the plaintiff contained no suggestion of Where a student claims that he has terminated his anything other than an inflexible rule, a rule which studies more than 28 days before the end of the official prevented her from being considered for unemployment school year and that he intends to join the workforce, it benefit at anytimeprior to 22 February 1977.

Before going to this question, there are two related matters the Director-General's state of satisfaction of mind will to which I should briefly refer. First, I do not regard this case accord with the truth of the matter in the case of those applias involving the introduction of irrelevant factors into a cants, surely only a small proportion, who seek to deceive decision-making process; the fact that a purported school him when they say that they do not intend to return to leaver appliesforunemployment benefit during the school school; as to them his refusal to be satisfied until the end of holidays will bear upn, though it can hardly be at all conthe holidays will ensure that he is not deceived. But he has clusive of, the quesuon whether he is truly an intending enonly attained this result at the cost of being wrong in case of trant into the work force or is, on the contrary, merely seekall those other applicants who have truthfully told him that ing unemployment benefit during a holiday interval they have ended their school days but whose statement he occurring in the course of his continuing school career. The has refused to accept until proved correct at the end of the type of error involved in employing that fact as a conclusive school holidays. In the case of all these, unemployment test will not be that of permitting irrelevant factors to affect a benefits will have been denied them during the school holdecision-making process. Secondly, in saying this, I have idays and this because the Director-General will erroneously adopted as correct what was implicit in the arguments of have failed to be satisfied as to their true position. Those, too, both parties, namely that a person is not unemployed within who at the beginning of the school holidays intend perthe meaning of s. 107 either when actually attending school manently to leave school but later change their minds, or tertiary institution or when on vacation before returning to perhaps because of the lack of job opportunities, will also be school or other institution. The term 'unemployed' is not treated erroneously by the Director-General; so long as they defined in the Act and it would, in my view, be inconsistent retain their original intention they must, I think, be regarded with ordinary usage to describe such a student as unemas 'unemployed' but they will nevertheless be denied eligiployed in the context of this legislation's provision of benefits bility to unemployment benefits. Any method which for the unemployed. On the other hand, one leaving school produced erroneous results of this magnitude is clearly unacwith the intention of not returning to his studies but, instead, ceptable as a means open to the Director-General in satisfyof seeking work and who begins to seek employment ing himself as to the subject matter of s. 107 (c) (i). appears to me thereupon to answer the description of one who is unemployed. He will conunue to do so so long as he This must be the more so when other, conventional means remains out of employment and retains his intention of of learning of applicants' intentions are not only open to entering the workforce. This said, I return to examine the him, but are in fact used by him; the 'Record of Applications question earUer posed. made for Employment' issued to school leavers itself contains a form of declaration to be made by applicants that ' I In doing so, it should be remarked that the function of the will not be undertaking fulltimeeducation or training in Director-General under s. 107 is to be distinguished from 1977'; in the present case, the plaintiff made such a declarthat of tribunals, such as licensing justices, which, in their exation. Such declarations the Director-General presumably ercise of discretionary powers to grant or refuse licences, may disregards. In addition to such declarations, he could have give effect to some general policy that they see as desirable so regard also to the nature of the efforts by the school leaver to long as in doing so they do not preclude themselves from seek employment. The present case provides an example, the considering on its merits the exceptional case. The Directorplaintiff s record card maintained by the Commonwealth General is not concerned, in his administration of s. 107, Employment Service discloses that the plaintiff was seeking with the carrying out of any policy. No general discretion is employment in itself quite inconsistent with an intention to conferred upon him; instead specific criteria are laid down resume studies in the succeeding school year, employment as by the Act and all that is left for him to do is to decide an apprentice cook. whether or not he attains a state of satisfaction that the cirThe second criterion, that in sub-paragraph (iii) relating cumstances exist to which each of these criteria refer.
