The Act has always deleted in the Senate when the Senate conprovided, by section 131, that a bankrupt is sidered this matter some hours ago. able to retain income for his or her benefit, Nonetheless, we make that stand part of our subject to any order to the contrary. What this second reading amendment because it was the has meant in practice is that, if the bankrupt Government's original intention to single out has income, an application must be made to business bankrupts and to subject them to the court and the court must make an order special punishment by removing access for that that income become available for the them to early discharge.

For the Government to put them maintaining a high standard of life whilst out of business and then to say, 'We will creditors go barren.
