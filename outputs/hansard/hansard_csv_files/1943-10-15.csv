Minister) -by leave-Towards the end of last year a special Constitution Convention was summoned at Canberra to deal with proposals to extend the powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth in order to enable the problems of post-war reconstruction to be dealt with effectively. Those who attended comprised representatives of both Houses in the Commonwealth Parliament, including the party leaders in each House. The States were (Premantle-Prime",8,Appropriation Act 1943 44 No 56 Op 1943

2,Mr Curtin,"represented by tbe Premiers and tbe Leaders of tbe Opposition. It was unanimously agreed that additional powers in relation to post-war reconstruction were lequired by the Commonwealth. However, it was considered more practicable, in order to avoid a referendum during the war, that the additional powers should be conferred upon the Parliament of the Commonwealth by reference from the State legislatures under section 51 (xxxvii) of the Constitution. Accordingly, fourteen heads of power were defined and agreed to by representatives of the Commonwealth and by tbe Premiers of the six States. In order to give effect that, unless the substance of the Canberra to the arrangement, a draft bill was also agreed upon. The present position of the draft bill is as follows: The State legislatures of New South Wales and Queensland have passed the bill. South Australia and Western Australia have passed bills, but in each case the powers granted are less than those agreed upon at Canberra. Victoria has passed the bill, but has imposed the condition that it shall not operate unless the other five States have previously passed a bill in substantially the same form as the Canberra draft bill. In the State of Tasmania the Upper House has shelved the bill. All State governments had their legal Premiers. advisers at the Canberra convention, and the point was not then raised that it was not constitutionally competent for the State legislatures to refer the matters to tbe Parliament of the Commonwealth for Minister) -by leave-Adopting the sugthe time agreed upon, namely, a period gestion of the Leader of the Opposition to terminate five years after the cessa( Mr Menzies), the Government will tion of hostilities in the present war. appoint, in collaboration with him, a However, legal opinions were subsespecial parliamentary committee to exquently obtained by several State Goamine the pay-as-you-earn taxation plan vernments, to the effect that, under secand alternative proposals. tion 51 (xxxvii) of the Constitution any references of matters by the State legisconsisting of Messrs.

This rest where it is. It might, of course, be particular inquiry is directed specifically possible for the Commonwealth to pass legislation on post-war reconstruction to operate only in those States that have passed the Commonwealth Powers Bill. This would probably be detrimental to the interests of those States which, not having passed the bill, would necessarily be excluded from the scope of Commonwealth legislation on certain aspects of post-war reconstruction. However, such Commonwealth legislation could not be regarded as satisfactory from an Australian point of view. For these reasons, I am in agreement with the Attorney-Oeneral arrangement be carried into effect in all six States, it will be necessary to submit proposals for the alteration of the Constitution to the electors of tbe Commonwealth by referendum. Admittedly, additional powers are required by the Commonwealth Parliament for post-war reconstruction purposes. The present intention of the Government is to deal with these important matters of Constitution alteration at the next session of the Parliament. By that time we should be acquainted with the final decision of the State legislatures as to whether or not they intend to carry into effect the arrangements made at the Canberra convention by all six State PAY-AS-YOU-EARN TAXATION .

24,Mr Forde,"On the 13th October,could be made to determine tbe truth of the statements which he is purported to have made in regard to his service in the front line in New Guinea. I have made inquiries, and now desire to inform the honourable member that it is not proposed to make any investigation of the nature suggested by him, as there is no evidence to indicate that Lieutenant-Colonel Fleay made any such statements. Allegations have been made that the award of the Distinguished Service Order to this officer was associated with such press statements, and in order to assure the honourable member that such was not the case, I quote from the citation of his General Officer Commanding at the time he was recommended for this awardLieutenant-Colonel Fleay was in charge of Kanga Force when I assumed command of New Guinea Force. Up to that stage his commando operations had been distinguished by vision, enthusiasm and the utmost determination to hamper the enemy to the greatest extent possible in the Lae and Salamaua areas. Although it was not possible to reinforce Kanga Force before fresh enemy troops arrived towards the end of August, LieutenantColonel Fleay continued his offensive tactics with such force as was available. As a result little, if any, fresh penetration was made by the enemy. Lieutenant-Colonel Fleay'6 general outlook, his personal gallantry and his powers of leadership combine to make him an inspiration to the troops who have kept going in spite of very great difficulties. The award of the Distinguished vice Order to a commanding officer of a unit is regarded as a mark of commendation, not of the commanding officer alone, but also of tbe valuable and gallant services rendered by the whole unit. To those who are aware of the outstanding performances of the individual bers of the special force which was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel there can be no doubt that the award in this instance was a well-deserved recognition of the unit as a whole. Commander-in-Chief Military Forces, with whom I have consulted, has confirmed this view, and, in addition, has stated that he was in constant Fleay during the period that he was in New Guinea, that he was visited quently by senior officers, and that he commanded a small detached force with Mr Forde. gallantry, enterprise and vigour, and proved himself a first-rate leader in tactics of this kind. Lieutenant-General Blarney added: "" I am. satisfied that Lieutenant-Colonel Fleay is a very gallant and enduring officer, and that he is the last person who would attempt to take away credit from other persons"". Prior to his service in New Guinea Lieutenant-Colonel Fleay, who, in 1939, joined up in the ranks, had a record of excellent service with the Australian Imperial Force overseas. He went to the Middle East with the 6th Division, fought in the ""Was tern Desert and in Greece, was wounded in Crete, and returned to Australia with his division, and subsequently served in New Guinea. The honourable member referred to tbe service of members of the 5th Independent Company. This was only one of the companies under Lieutenant-Colonel Fleay during the period to which he refers. explanation. For some time. I refrained from making any reference to this matter, but in view of correspondence which I had received from officers attached to the same unit, I decided to ask a question in the House. If the Minister is convinced that the report from General Blarney is satisfactory, I have nothing more to say. My only desire was to have the matter cleared up.

26,"Fleay, Mr Holloway","I shall be pleasedBiU read a first time. [10.57] -by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. Tbe main purpose of this bill is to provide for the issue of national savings stamps in connection with the raising of Commonwealth war loans. It has been found that the most convenient method for wage-earners to subscribe to loans by instalments is by means of deductions from wages. Where employees remain continuously on the one pay-roll, this presents no difficulty, and deductions are made regularly until the payment for bonds has been completed. There are, however, people whose employment is constantly changing, and in these cases it, is not practicable to make deductions from wages in this way. In order to provide for such subscribers, and also for those who wish to set aside small amounts as they become available, it has been decided to introduce the 5s. national savings stamp. stamps will be provided, the face value of which will amount to £10, and these may be accepted in payment for treasury bonds. Alternately, stamps to the face value of £2, or multiples thereof, may be accepted in payment of instalments for bonds. stamps may be paid to the credit of depositors' accounts with all savings banks. The banks will, in turn, exchange the stamps for war loan securities. The stamps will be on sale at all savings banks, money order post offices, and such other selling points as are decided on from time to time. This measure makes provision for the protection of war savings stamps and national savings stamps against forgery and uttering, similar to that made in regard to treasury-bills in the Treasury Bills Act. Opposition enthusiastically supports this suggested. measure for the issue of national savings Chifley) hopes to widen the field of I investment in liberty loans. No effort Chifley) to reconsider my proposal made should be spared to ensure that people whose earnings have risen as the result those earnings to the national war fund by means of investment in loans. I believe the issue of 5s. war savings stamps will attract many more subscribers than might otherwise have been the case. It if essential that the loans be filled if we are to conduct the wa<r to our full capacity. I support this measure, but I regretthat the bill does not go farther and contain an amendment of the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act, to provide that treasury bonds shall be converted to inscribed stock. Time and again during the budget debate honourable members stressed the fact that one of the most fruitfu l methods of evasion of income tax is investment in treasury bonds. No record is made of the owners or of people to whom interest is paid. In effect, treasury bonds are another form of currency at a time when the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) himself admits that the slightest slackening of controls on the monetary system may lead to heavy Folders containing 40 inflation, with disastrous results. The Treasurer, as a member of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, should know that when all the resources of the nation are fully employed, when it is impossible to produce more goods, and when treasury-bill National savings finance is being used, there is great danger of inflation of the currency, with a steep rise of prices, unless all the necessary controls are maintained. One of the most effective controls would be the conversion of bonds to inscribed stock. That would enable the Treasurer to know exactly who are the holders of the stock issued in return for moneys lent to the Government. He would then be able to watch closely the holders of the inscribed stock, with a view to preventing evasion of taxation. It is probably too late to insert in this measure such a provision as I have in mind, but the Treasurer should take early action to do as I have again urge the Treasurer ( Mr",16,Australian Army Lieutenant Colonel N L Fleay Release Of Pebsonnel

31,Mr Abbott (New England) [11.2].,"on a previous occasion that Commonwealth bonds be accepted by the Treasury as payment of probate duty. I have been in touch with many people -who would be willing to invest more heavily in liberty loans and other loans but for the fact that they are compelled to keep in reserve money in some form more easily negotiable than bonds, lest their estate should be suddenly called upon to pay heavy probate duties. I believe the objection to this proposal in the past was that executors of estates of deceased persons would be able to buy on the market at a discount, bonds which would be tendered at their face value in payment of probate duty, but now that the prices of bonds are pegged that objection no longer holds good. the executors of deceased persons from selling bonds on the stock exchange in the ordinary way in order to obtain the money necessary to pay the probate duty? possible to find a buyer in time, and the Taxation Department is not prone to wait. Therefore, people are apt to take the prudent course of holding reserves against probate duty in some more easily negotiable form than treasury bonds or inscribed stock. Any abuses could be quickly rectified. The objections to the change no longer exis :. The grant1 ing of the concession would, I believe, result in very many more subscriptions to war loans. surer) [11.8] m reply-There is something to be said for the proposal made by the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott), and it will be examined, but I point out that the general public, as a rule, prefers bonds to inscribed stock. cannot be allowed to rest at that do not like have to be accepted by them. be forgotten that we are asking people to iuvest in loans and we have to take their desires into consideration. My recollection of the matter raised by the honourable member for Richmond( Mr responsibility of Parliament upon which Anthony) is that the Loan Council discussed the proposal that probate duties should be payable with bonds, but the objection taken was that executors of deceased persons would perhaps be able to buy bonds at a discount. I concede that the pegging of the prices of bonds has changed the circumstances. I think that bonds issued before 1934 are accepted in payment of probate duty. At any rate, r agree with the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) that bonds can always be sold to either the general public or the National Debt Sinking Fund Com-, mission. Payments into the sinking fund are increasing in proportion to the increase of the national debt, and next, year it is expected that the commission Will be on the market for £20,000,000 worth of bonds.

Such an inquiry the head of the Government would .immediately consent to institute. Therefore, I have already informed the Leader of the Opposition that I am ready to constitute a royal commission to inquire into certain matters. I have informed the l ight honourable gentleman also that I am quite ready, in accordance with practice, to consult him respecting the terras of reference to be given, to the royal commission for the purpose of conducting the inquiry. ready, too, as I believe any other Prime Minister would be, to consult with the right honourable gentleman on the selection of the person or persons who shall constitute the commission. As the inquiry of the royal commission will affect the position of a Minister in my Cabinet, I have adopted the normal procedure of relieving him of his administrative duties until such time as the report of the royal commission is tabled in Parliament.

Mr or hearer of them that information had been Villeneuve Smith, K . C , of Adelaide, and Mr given to Mr Ward out of Parliament and P. D.

I such other officers as properly had access to personally took such notes as appeared to me those files certainly came within it . If any to be necessary to guide me in making my of such officers had divulged information to report. "" At the outset of the proceedings Barry submitted to me that the whole of the criminal prosecution either under section 73A questions which I was asked to report upon of the Defence Act whicli provideswere beyond the power of the commission to deal with, on the ground that they arose out of and necessarily depended upon a statement made by Mr Ward in Parliament, namely, tlie House of Representatives, The first question, he contended, showed on its face that such was the position, and the remaining questions were mere appendages to the first question and their fate must be determined by the fate of the first question. asked Mr Villeneuve Smith whether he wished to address me on the question so raised. replied that he was instructed to make no submission on the point. Miller, I ruled that, even assuming Barry's submission to be correct in regard to the first three questions, the fourth stood on a different plane, and required me to report in any event on an independent of fact. Thereafter, I proceeded to take evidence mainly in relation to the fourth question, reserving for further consideration decision as to the correctness or otherwise of Mr Barry's contention in relation to the first three questions. -of the sittings, I ruled, for Teasons which are set out iu the transcript, submission must be given effect to in relation evidence from members of the Defence Committo Mr Ward himself and that Mr Ward could not he compelled by the commission to attend or to give evidence in regard to his stateanswer the questions put to me it was necesment, the subject matter of the first question. sary for me to determine what was meant I ruled, however, that the privilege which deby the expression ' official files ' and ' Brisbane Mr Holt. ing the truth or otherwise of any aspersion I thought that these words would convey to any reasonable reader No that the information was given out of ParliaMinister in the course of the duty of the came within such a category. I thought that the Minister that a document was missing from the official files as alleged, it seemed to Mr me that such officer might be subject to "" ' Any member of the Defence Force or officer in the Public Service of the Commonwealth who communicates to any peron 22nd June, 1943. son otherwise than in the course of his official duty any plan, document or information relating to any fort, battery, field work, fortification or defence work or to any of the defences of the CommonI wealth or to any factory or air force aerodrome or establishment or any other He naval, military or air force information shall be guilty of an offence,'"" After hearing Mr or under section 70 of the Commonwealth Mr Crimes Act, which provides that"" ' An y person who, being a Commonquestion wealth officer, publishes or communicates any fact which comes to his knowledge question by virtue of his office and which it is his duty to keep secret, or any document which comes to his possession by virtue my of his office and which it is his duty to keep secret, except to some person to whom he is authorized to publish or Ultimately, on tlie final day communicate it , shall be guilty of an offence'"". that Mr Barry's "" I think I should state specifically that I had tee before whom plans would come and from the Chief of Staffs Committee. In order to Lino'. To take the latter first. I informed my mind hy reading the debate of 22nd June, 1943, as recorded in Hansard of the sense in which the expression was used, and witnesses were also questioned as to their knowledge of the expression. No officer either of the Australian M i l it a r y Forces, the Royal Australian Navy or the Royal Australian A i r Force knew of any plan which related to a 'BrisbaneL in e ' so called and all stated that their only knowledge of such an expression was derived from press reports or like sources. They did have knowledge, however, of what was called an 'appreciation' submitted 1 Sir Iven Mackay in February, 1.942. appreciation, Sir Iven Mackay stated in evidence before me, was submitted by him voluntarily of his own motion to the Government of the day. No officer who gave evidence before me was aware of any plan other than this in relation to the matters Sir Iven Mackay dealt with. I . sought from witnesses evidence as to a l l the files which related to matters which were the subject-matter of Sir Iven Mackay's report, and I was given precise information as to those files. There was called before me every officer whose duty it was to have the custody of any of those files, and also every officer who had the right of access to any of them. Each of those officers, without exception, swore that he or she had given no information to Mr Ward in relation to any document, and most of those officers did not even know Mr Ward. I accept the testimony of all these officers. "" It occurred to me that, apart from the officers I have referred to, the words ' most reliably informed' might point to members of the War Cabinet or of the Advisory War Council to whom copies of documents are, in the usual routine of procedure, distributed. I considered whether I should cause to be called before me all or any of such persons in order to question them in relation to any aspersion which might rest upon them by reason of the implication of the words. I assumed (without determining) that my ruling on the question of privilege would not affect such members, but on consideration I came to the conclusion that I should not have them called. Some of those in this particular class are Ministers of the Crown, all are members of Parliament, and those who are not Ministers of the Crown, are all or almost all persons who have been Ministers of the Crown. It is inconceivable to me that if any honourable member had given information to Mr Ward, he would not, after hearing Mr Ward's assertion, have made some statement himself in regard to the allegation. If he had given the information, I should suppose he would have stated so, and Hansard fails to disclose that any of them did. It also occurred to me that it was possible that some officer not within the category of those I have already mentioned might have had temporary access without authority to official files, and might have surreptitiously obtained information from the files, and communicated it to Mr Ward. whether I should make any inquiry calculated to investigate this possibility. I determined that I should not, because I thought that no [24] Minister of the Crown receiving information from such a source would consider the person giving it a most reliable informant within the implication which I have attached to the words ' Most reliably informed'. I hope that these two assumptions will do no injustice to any one. It is of course possible that Mr. Ward has attached some meaning to the words ' Most reliably informed ' other than tliat which 1 have indicated above but, as Mr Ward's evidence was not available on this commission, this possibility is one that I have been unable to investigate. "" The whole of the evidence, without excepThi9 tion, was to the effect that the official files were intact and that no document relating to the ' BrisbaneL in e ' had been or was missing from them. I should add that, beyond satisfying myself as to the method of recording documents, and that the system was adequate to keep trace of the fate of a document, and would disclose whether or not a document was missing, I did not personally investigate the files. To have done so would have been a herculean task incapable of accomplishment within any reasonable time, and one which I felt to be unnecessary in view of the fact that I thought the evidence of the witnesses who spoke to the completeness of the files entirely trustworthy, and, moreover, no challenge was made of it by cross-examination. "" I now address myself to the particular questions asked in the commission:"" 1. I am unable to answer this question, for the reasons which I have already stated. "" 2. I can give only a limited answer to this question, namely, that the Minister was not informed by any officer who hud the custody of the official files or by any officer who had access thereto, or by any member of the Defence Committee or by any of the Chiefs of Staffs Committee. "" 3. In view of the above answers, no answer is required to this question. "" 4. No document concerning the matter known as the ' BrisbaneL in e ' was on 22nd June, 1943, or is now, missing from the official files."" The next document is a letter, dated the 14th J u l y , 1943, w h i c h the P r i m e M in is t e r sent to the then M in is t e r for L a b o u r and N a t i o n a l Service. It readsI have forwarded to you, under separate cover, a copy of the report of the Royal Commissioner in the matter of an inquiry into a statement that there was a document missing from the official files. I w ill not release the report to the press until you intimate that you have received the report. You will note that, because of the plea advanced by your counsel, vital questions in the terms of reference were beyond the power of the Commissioner to deal with, the Commissioner ruling that counsel's submission must be given effect. As a result, question No. I considered 1 was not answered, question No. 2 was given only a limited answer, and question No. 3 was unanswered because of the manner in which questions Nos. 1 and 2 were treated. On euuaideruig the report of the Royal Commissioner, it was clear that the raising of the issue of the rights and privileges of members of the rmliaineiit substance of the questions involved in the terms of reference! have not heen decided and the Government has directed that, as the question of the rights and privileges ment is involved, the matter is one which cannot be completed until a submission has been made to Parliament of the -matters that haw arisen. that, this submission be made at the earliest opportunity. tions Nos. 1.. 2 and .3 in the terms of reference are in effect still nub jwMoe. The reasons which caused me to direct you to abstain from the administration of your oflieu, therefore, continue and wil l continue until the Parliament has dealt with the matters involved. For these reasons, I now repeat my direction to you to abstain from performing any of the duties of your office and have arranged for the Honourable E. J. Holloway, M.P.. to continue to act for and in your place. I desire to make certain comments on the facts which the documents disclose. First, I am sure that honourable members will be glad to have confirmation of their belief that no senior officer of the defence administration was implicated in any way in this matter. The report of the royal commission, limited though it was in -.cope, owing to the attitude adopted by counsel for the Minister then under suspension, was quite emphatic on that point. No senior officer connected with our defence administration has any cloud of suspicion hanging over him. The House will welcome that exoneration. Secondly, the commission was equally emphatic that no document was missing at the date at which the statements were made in this House by the then Minister. found, as a fact, that no military appreciation was submitted to any government before February, 1942, which was four or five months after the Curtin Administration assumed office. Therefore, no "" Brisbane line "" had been drawn prior to February, 1942, by the Curtin Administration, or by any previous administration. Fourthly-and this returns the matter to the purview of this Parliament-J. come to the circumstances in vhich the then Minister claimed privilege as a member of the Parliament in Mr Holt. order to refrain from answering the the Government decided tliat first three questions .submitted to the royal commission. Those questions were: precluded a determination of the first, whether the Minister was .most reliably informed on a certain matter; Tliese matters, therefore, secondly, whether he was informed in the terms, or to the effect, specified in the of. members of the Parliastatement which he had made; and, thirdly, if the information was given to him, by whom, in what circumstances, and for what reason it was given. The The Governinent has directed commissioner was prevented from makTherefore, the substance of quesing any inquiry into these circumstances by the plea made by counsel on behalf of the Minister that to do so would amount to a breach of hi3 privilege as a member of this Parliament. The privileges of members of Parliament are traditional and long-standing, and I agree that the members of this House must jealously guard them. But, on behalf of the Opposition, I ask the Prime Minister to consider whether Parliament did not waive its privilege in order to secure the desired information. I submit that the claim to privilege was waived, in effect, if not specifically, when the right honourable gentleman reported to the House that a royal commission had been appointed to make its inquiries and the House took no objection to that procedure. I believe that it can be truthfully claimed that the action of appointing the commission was endorsed by all honourable members except the .honourable gentleman who was under suspension, and the then honourable member for Bourke, Mr Blackburn. I have no doubt whatever that if the Parliament had been asked to intimate that it waived the claim of privilege in order that the desired inquiries could be made it would have done so and would have given the royal comThirdly, the commission mission complete authority to make the investigation. Because the claim of privilege was made before the commission, the inquiry was balked, and this is the first time that the matter has since come before the Parliament foT us to express our view as to whether investigation should have proceeded and the plea of privilege waived. My next comment is that, although the then Minister was suspended from his office pending the answering of the questions by the royal commission, the important questions remain unanswered. The Prime Minister regards the issues raised as being important, for in his letter to. his colleague be said that, because of the plea advanced by the honourable gentleman's counsel, vital questions in the -terms of reference were beyond the power of the commissioner to deal with, and the commission.' had not dealt with them. The Government had decided that, because the issue of the rights and privilege of members of the Parliament had been raised a submission should be made to the Parliament. The Government had, therefore, directed that such a submission should be made at the earliest possible moment, and that until that was done the matter was stillsub judice, and the Minister would continue to abstain from, the performance of his duties. The only question which was answered wits the one in regard to which there was no dispute, for bothtbe Prime Minister and the then Minister for Labour and National Service had already stated publicly that they did not believe that any document was missing. So far as the Parliament was concerned, therefore, the only question which the royal commission answered was the question which the Parliament considered had already been answered. If there was adequate reason for the Prime Minister to continue the suspension of his colleague after the report of the royal commission was submitted, and until the unanswered questions had been resolved, there is still adequate reason to considered this subject to be of so much continue such suspension, for the matters are still unresolved. The Prime Minister said that the Government had decided that a submission should be made to the House at the earliest possible opportunity. I claim that he is, therefore, called upon to make such a submission. As he has not done so, the House is entitled to know the reason why. Although these questions have remained unanswered, the suspended Minister has been given a portfolio in the new Government in a new capacity. The Opposition considers that an obligation rests upon the Prime Minister, as the custodian of. the prestige and authority of the Parliament, to clear this matter up at the earliest possible moment, and to take all necessary steps to protect parliamentarytraditions and maintain the high standard of conduct that is expected from ministries and Cabinet Ministers. As the right honourable gentleman considered it necessary to relieve his colleague of his duties while these matters remained, undetermined, he should take steps to have them determined at the earliest possible moment, and make a submission to the Housei n regard to them. The House cannot be satisfied with the present attitude of the Government on this subject. If there was good cause to suspend a Minister in order to hold an inquiry, and if , as I believe to be the fact, the House waived the. plea of privilege in order to have thematters investigated, the Opposition considers that the Minister involved should not be allowed to take refuge in the technical plea of privilege. Wo feel that an obligation rests upon the Government and the House to reach finality on these issues. We therefore press the Prime Minister to make a submission to the House in the terms of his letter of the 14th July, and fo indicate the attitude of the Government on the subject. Wc surely cannot allow the highly important issues to which T have referred to remain, undetermined. for Transport and Minister for External Territories) [11.48] I am astounded that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), who is said fo be an eminent legal practitioner, and who previously importance as to demand the appointment of a royal commission to investigate it, should now apparently consider it to be so unimportant that he is not in attendance when it is being dealt with by the House. I am astounded, that tlie honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), wbo also had a great deal to say on this subject when it wa3 previously before the House, should now also have deserted the Opposition. The brief has been left to a junior member, if not the office boy. of the firm. I recognize that, under very difficult circumstances, that honourable gentleman has been called upon to make a. face-saving speech for the Opposition. He has rend copies of several documents, the contents of which were already well known, and' on these he has made certain submissions.",18,Report Oe Royal Commission
39,Mr Waed (East Sydney,"Ministe rHe began by saying that he had no wish to revive the subject because the canard had been exploded. There has been an explosion, but all of the casualties have been among Opposition members. On the last occasion on which I addressed the House on this subject tbe Opposition benches were fairly A decision in the matter has been given by the highest authority in the land, an authority higher than the Parliament or a royal commission, namely, the people; hence the many casualties in the ranks of tbe Opposition parties. To the honourable member for Fawkner has been entrusted to-day the task of submitting a case on behalf of the Opposition. remind him that when the terms of reference of the royal commission were mentioned, I told this House that the inquiry would prove abortive, because the terms were so limited as to make impossible an investigation charges I had made against the Menzies and Fadden honourable member now wants to place on the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) responsibility for the result. At the time of the appointment of the royal commission the Labour party did not have a majority in this House; consequently, because of pressure by certain honourable members the Prime Minister was compelled to submit to the royal commissioner distinctly limited terms of reference, which prevented that gentleman from making an inquiry into my charges. Those terras had the approval of the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) who was then the Leader of the Opposition; he was consulted continuously before they were announced. Surely he was advised by the legal men on his side as to what the powers of the royal commission would be! The honourable member for Fawkner now talks about the privileges of members, and claims that they must be protected. Surely he and -other members of the Opposition must have known that the royal commission would not have the power to compel me to give evidence concerning any utterance I had made in this House! In any event, parliamentary privilege is not held by every member individually, but is the privilege of the Parliament as such; in other words, the If r . Ward. privilege of the people. It would be fundamentally wrong, and a blow at the basis of democracy itself, if any member of Parliament could be subjected to interrogation outside in respect of statements he had made inside this legislature. I have never balked an inquiry; full. I would have welcomed the most complete investigation of my charges. But that was not desired by members of the Opposition. They were not anxious that I should be given the opportunity to have a complete investigation. They knew that they were approaching a general election, and they wanted a ""facesaver"". They wished to be able to say I to the people, "" A royal commission was appointed to investigate the matter, and it has found nothing "". The royal commission could not find anything, because tbe terms of reference were so limited that it could not inquire into the charges of the 1 had made. Being most vitally affected, I considered that I should have had a administrations.' The voice in the framing of the terms of reference. Certain suggestions and recommendations were made by me for their extension, but when the terms were announced they were found to be identical with those requested by the Leader of the Opposition. The honourable member for Fawkner has conceded that before the Parliament had been prorogued one of the questions into which the royal commissioner was appointed to inquire had been answered in this House. A great deal was made of mystatement of the 22nd June concerning a document. The Opposition seized upon that statement. Honourable members opposite believed that they would be able to divert attention from the merit of my charges, to some argument in relation to my statement concerning a document which, I had been informed, had been missing. My charges were not based upon that document. I had received this information after I had made charges against the Menzies and Fadden administrations in Victoria, and during my visit to Tasmania. What the public wanted to know was, whether or not there was any truth in those charges. The honourable member for Fawkner now asks why the Prime Minister, having suspended the Minister for Labour and National Service, does not take positive action. The Prime Minister was impelled to the action he took, because members of the Opposition demanded it, and were able to enforce their demand. Never on any occasion did my colleagues doubt my integrity. The Prime Minister has presented the report of the royal commission for which the Opposition asked. The honourable member for Fawkner says that the right honourable gentleman has not taken positive action. The motion for the printing of the report has the effect of submitting the matter to the House. If tbe Opposition wants further action to be taken, it can move in that direction. AU the legal luminaries opposite are absent from their places to-day, and it has been left to a junior member to make the best case of which he is capable. I have not, been advised that the Leader of the Opposition has met with an accident, that he is ill , or that be balked. Of the way in which the will he has been called away on urgent national business. He knew that this matter was to be debated. The motion in regard to it has appeared on the notice-paper for some time, and only a few days ago the Prime Minister stated that an opportunity to debate it would be afforded. If those members of the Opposition who are absent consider that it is important, why are they not in their places, prepared to debate it? The honourable member for Fawkner has quoted extensively the report of the royal commissioner. It can readily be imagined that by the limited terms of reference the commissioner was seriously hampered. In his report, he has stated that certain officers of the department were not those who had advised or informed me. I agree with that, and am prepared to say that, on the evidence that the commissioner had before him, he has reported correctly. When the announcement of tbe appointment of fhe royal commission was made in this HouseI said that, having had a consultation with the Prime Minister, I was satisfied that at that stage no document was missing from the official files. If honourable members care to engage in a lengthy debate as to what constitutes official files, and how many persons have access to them at one time or another, I can easily show them that, because of the limited scope of the inquiry, it would be quite impossible to say that every person had been interrogated who at one time or another may have had access to what are known as official files. Official files need not necessarily mean files in the possession of the administrative head of the Department of Defence. That was never suggested. There are all sorts of reports and recommendations in respect of defence matters on innumerable files, and numerous persons have access to them. From the outset there was never any doubt in my mind that there was no need for a royal commission if the terms of reference were to be framed to prevent a full inquiry into my charges concerning "" the Brisbane line"" strategy. Members of the Opposition now have the opportunity, if they so desire, to take positive action to ensure, as the honourable member for Fawkner has said, that the will of Parliament shall not of the Parliament has been balked, as he implies, I am unaware. The people have expressed their view. My electors have shown clearly their attitude in regard to the charges that I made; they returned me with the largest majority that any man had ever received in the East Sydney electorate-a n absolute majority of more than 20,000 votes over the votes of four other candidates. I am satisfied that the Opposition has never desired a full inquiry into my charges. The honourable member for Fawkner may consider that, because of the stand taken by my counsel, I balked an inquiry. I had not to determine whether or not the point that he took should be put to the royal commissioner. Mr Barry, K . C , my counsel, advised me that it was bis duty as a legal man to draw the commissioner's attention to the law, and said that if I wished to act contrary to his advice I should have to arrange for other counsel to appear on my behalf. The Menzies and Fadden administrations were legally represented before the commission by Mr Frank Villeneuve-o r villainous; I am not certain of the correct pronunciationSmith. When Mr Barry raised the point, Mr Justice Lowe asked Mr Villeneuve Smith whether or not he wished to make any comment. The right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) was present. Mr Smith conferred' with hiin,,. and then said to the my charges, the Leader of the Opposition commissionar, "" I am advised not to offer any objerfiioir "". Why did. the honourable member for Fawkner not quote that'portion of the commissioner's report? the report. for Fawkner, with the subtlety which characterizes most legal gentlemen, abstracted from, the report and the evidence placed before the royal commissioneronly those portions that suit the purpose of the Opposition. given the documents to Hansard. They will show that I quoted every word of the report of the royal commissioner. I ask that the Minister be required to withdraw what is a deliberate misstatement. -There is. no point of order. represent. If the honourable gentleman, objects to what I have said, I shall amend it by saying that he carefully selected po-rtiona of theevidenee submitted to the royal commission in order to make out soma sort, of case on behalf of the Opposition. ence, but I did read the whole of the report"" presented to this Parliament. who appeared for the Menzies and Fadden administrations, had no objection to offer when the matter of privilege was raised which prevented the royal commissioner from requiring, me to give evidence. The present Leader of the Opposition' and his followers wanted lightly to dismiss my charges when the royal commissioner had made his report and it was received by the Government and released for publication. They said, "" That is the end of ' the Brisbane line' "". It may have been the wish of the Opposition to consider that the end of ""the Brisbane' line"" controversy, but I had other views about it. The honourable member for Fawkner said that he wanted to place on record the report of the royal commissioner. I , too, am anxious to place an record certain matters that; relate to this subject. Shortly after I bad made ( Mr Menzies) saidIt was, a false picture, scaiulitttras in its content, and intended to deceive. -When the Fadden Governinent fell in October, 1941, Japan was not in the war, and Australia was not actually or directly threatened with attack: Of one thing the right honourable gentleman evidently was not aware-o r probably he thought that others were not aware of it : On record were other statements he had made, which showed clearly that months before Labour took office, and long before Japan actually struck, he knew that that countrywas a potential I rise to order. I have enemy of and danger to Australia. In December, 19,40, during another discussion, he said'Any one who believes that Australia's war iltiifgc.iits any less than Britain's is living in n. fool's paradise, which can in a few days become a fool's hell. In this House, on tlie 16th December, 1941, when replying to criticism by the present Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), tie saidHearing some of the thingsthat have been said to-day one would think that war with -Japan literally came like a thief in the night. He would have been a very complacent fool who did not think that at any time vn tlie last two years war withi Japan was u dLsti.nct possibility. The basis of my charge was that the Opposition, knew, wheiai it was in; power, otf this! danger that was; impending, yet did nothing ta meet it. On the 10th June, 1941, at submission wasi made by. the then Prime Minister( Mr Menzies,) to the War Cabinet just after he* returned from abroad. He said that he had been advised by theChiefs' of Staff of the possibility of the early entry of Japan Lato thewar, and the threat of early invasions; yet honourable members opposite say that, the first they heard of the Bris( e bane line "" was on the Ah February, 194-2. It is obvious that if Mr Menzies was able tcwarn his colleagues on the 10th June, the Chiefsof Staff must have evolved some plan to meet the threat-o r does the honourable member suggest tliat; from the loth June, 1941,. to the 4th February. 1942, there was no plan, in existence to meet the possible threat from Japan? the jSTOceednigs before the royal commission.",23,Report Oe Royal Commission

Mr Dwyer-Gray demanded that tbe defence wf those outposts -shoulfl be considered by the council. MT . R. G. Casey was Commonwealth Treasurer at the time, and chairman of the Loan Council. Every -Member of the council was supplied with a memorandum setting out tlie information contained in .the documents referred discussion on the subject. Mr Forgan Smith, the Premier off Queensland, saidTlie Queensland strategy,, contemplated :by tlie military authorities, a,ppear.ed to .be the evacuation .of its north. Mr Dwyie.r-Gr.ay, as late .as the 1st July, 1943, made this statement! n-iii quite satisfied that tftie Brishaiie liii-u originated three nuonths at least before the war. It is a sirojjlc statement of .fact te add that, for a very long period after the outbreak of war no proper preparations, and no really definite plans, had been made for the adequate defenee of Western Australia and Tasmania, while -tlie military strategy long remained the evacuation of the whole of the north of Australia. Three -are the very things t h a i I Jrad tinuedTo 'suppose that the Minister for Labour and National Service ihad lied about the -Brisbane line is absurd.

Inquiries into the strategy of the day showed that Queensland had been left nut of the defemoe plans. Now Jet us see what one of the members of the Opposition had to say. The exMinisterf o r A i r , the honourable member for In d i ( MrM « E w e n ) , saidTlie honourable member 'for Bourke\ Mr Blackburn), whose integrity no man will challenge, when this controversy was raging, wrote to .the Melbourne papers as follows:"" I believed, with 'Government supporters generally, that before -tlie iGnr't'in Ministry took office there had been laid before the Advisory War Council, military opinion that, in the event of war with Japan, we should be -unable to defend Queensland north of tlie Tropic of Capricorn.

No mattei what technical points the Opposition niay raise in trying to elude responsibility for the condition of Australia's defences, whicli was the precedent necessary to the formulation of that plan, it will not be able to avoid the bald fact that the Brisbane line did exist. Records prove it. I challenge the Opposition to show that tliere was one anti-aircraft giui north of Brisbane at that time. In the light of that statement, how can honourable members opposite argue that it was intended to defend those areas? How can they deny that it was proposed tc. leave them to the mercy of the Japanese? I come now to what the present Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) had to say on the subjectl had heard previously in this House the statement by a responsible Minister of a former Government, that one Japanese division could have walked through Australia. made in those terms. Mr ""WARD I have been accused of lying, but surely the honourable member is not now accusing the Prime Minister also of having lied. The statement referred to was made in this House by the then Ministerf or the Army, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender). It clearly indicated the condition of the defences of Australia, shortly before the Labour Government came into office. Now honourable members opposite try to deny that it was proposed to desert large territories in the north and west of Australia, thus allowing the Japanese to walk through. What, I ask, was to stop the Japanese from walking through? The Prime Minister continuedThat WJIS the position when the present Governinent came into office. So dire was the threat, and so limited our resources, that the Commander of the Home Forces and the Chief of the General Staff felt impelled to point out to the Government that their resources were sufficient only to admit of a concentration for the defence of the vital areas extending from Brisbane to Melbourne. That is even worse than I charged them w it h I spoke of a line north of Brisbane. It is clear that the defences of the country were in a shocking condition ae the result of neglect by the previous Administration. The Prime Minister said furtherBefoTe the war with Japan the primary consideration of the other governments had been co-operation overseas, with the result that the home defence plans had been defeatist in outlook and preparation. screen. Mi-. WARD I am quoting what was said by the Prime Minister at a conference in Sydney. The honourable member for Fawkner, who a little while ago was making such insistent demands for information, is now getting more than he wants. I continue to quote the Prime MinisterWith the forces then at his disposal, and the absence of aerodromes, road communications and workable harbours in the northern parts of Australia, Sir Iven Mackay had the soundest military reasons for avoiding a wide dispersal of an inadequate force. We have never blamed Si r Iven Mackay. Obviously, he had to do the best he could with the inadequate forces provided by the last Government. The statement, goes onTo provide the strength for the defence of Australia is the responsibility of the Government. To use the provided strength to the best advantage is -all military commanders can do. The basic facts are undeniableAustralia's trained and equipped military forces were away from the Commonwealth. We had no fighting air power here, and the enemy was moving towards Australian areas in which no preparations had been made for military operations. The works services, and the fighting strength of air and land forces in the north had to be provided after Japan had struck. The Labour Government had to provide defences in the north after Japan had struck, because the anti-Labour administrations had neglected to provide them. h i order that honourable members may not believe that I am making charges that cannot be substantiated it is necessary that I cite my authorities as to the state of the defences when Labour took office. According to the Brisbane Telegraph of the 9th September, 1942, the Ministerf or Health and Home Affairs in the Queensland Government pointed out in the State Legislative Assembly on the 6th May, 1939, that there was no anti-aircraft defence in North Australia, and that again and again the Queensland Government had asked the Commonwealth for an air base in the northern part of the State, but the invariable reply had been that the work did not j u s t i fy the expense.

56,Mr Ward,"T h a t is true, but what then.tMicral MacArthur came to Australia. -In October, 1942, I first publicly made my charges. In October, 1942, the right honourable member for Kooyong and the right honourable 'member for North Sydney -denied the charges. They said rhere was no basis for them and that they were figments of my imagination. On the 17th March, 1943, General MacArthur's statement was published in the Australian press. If the Leaderi f ,tfoe Opposition knew of 'Our defenceless state and heard for the first time ion the 4th February, 1942, of the existence of "" the .Brisbane line"", why did he deny in October, 1942, that there was any base for the charges I have made? He said then that the charges were a figment of my 'imagination. Honourable members opposite were daily appealing to the Ir'rime Minister. 'They wanted Ward shut up and prevented from making the charges which were proving very damaging to them in the electorate. In order to divert attention from the real charges to something that was of relatively less importance, they demanded a royal commission. They had it . It proved as abortive as I predicted it would. I said tliat it would not clear up this matter, and. it did not. Even after rhe report became known, they said, "" This does not dispose of it. The questions have not been answered. The lloyal Commissioner was unable to conclude his inquiry, and therefore tlie matter is one for the Parliament.'"" Although the Royal .Commissioner's report found absolutely nothing in regard to the charges tliat I made, honourable members opposite still demanded the continuance of my suspension. The Prime Minister agreed that the Opposition might desire .an inquiry for the purpose of finding out whether there was any basis for my charges. SoI remained in suspension. Then, in August, T was returned to the House of Representatives with a record majority, and later my -colleagues expressed their confidence in me by restoring me to Cabinet. But members of the Opposition are still dissatisfied. They contend that the matter has not been disposed -of, know what ifibe Government proposes to do. Their lack of sincerity is indicated 683 by the Eact that only six members of tke United Australia party, and most .of them junior members, are listening to this debate. All the prominent members of the United Australia party have ""gome iitto smoke "", becanrsc they wene afraid to face a thorough debate of my charges. Tire Royal 'CommissioRer found nothing. He was obliged to come to the finding that he did. I was never afraid of a proper inquiry into my charges, aeS the majority of the Australian people are quite satisfied that the greatest tragedy which could have befallen this country would have been the return to offiee of the bunglers -and ""worse, who comprised 'the anti-Labour Government. As the B-ovity Telegraph said, the Labour -GovemareHlt started from 'behind scratch. When Iflie Curtin Government took office Australia had been at war for two years, but the Labour party required 'only a relatively short period in which to put the defences of tlie oountry in .such a healthy .condition that the Prime Minister was able to announce on behalf of the -Go.vernmemlt that the threat to this continent feacl passed.

Probably, they will retain their association with that the support of tbe honourable member. body, because they willingly carry every insult which the Minister heaps upon them. That is my view, and it is for publication. I propose to examine the defence position of Australia, and to remind ""FieldMarshal"" Ward of a few things that he has said in the past. No doubt the Minister desires to be promoted to tbe rank to which the leader of the Russians elevated himself not long ago. I recommend to honourable members a book entitled The Day of the Saxon. I have not read it for twenty years, but the Parliamentary Library has a copy of it. Published in 1910, the book contains maps of Australia and of the Pacific generally, and honourable members will find clearly laid down in those pages by one of the greatest military minds that the United States of America has produced, the areas that Australia would be able to defend in the event of a war with Japan. For nearly nine years, I have been a member of this chamber and in that period I have beard many debates on external affairs and the defence of Australia. OftenI have heard the Minister declare that defensive preparations in Australia were not necessary. His colleague, the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), even after this war broke out, asked, ""Who is this enemy against which the Government proposes to defend Australia? "" In 1937, the Lyons Government decided to increase the Militia forces from 35,000 to 70,000 men. I challenge any honourable member opposite, and I include the new vintage, to say that he assisted the Lyons Government in that matter. ably in Adelaide where the honourable member is not known. I invite any Minister to admit, as tbe honourable member for Griffith( Mr Conelan) has done, that he rendered any assistance to the Government of the day in that matter. What did the Minister for the Navy( Mr to that effect appear in Hansard, unless Makin) do? How often has the Minister for Transport and Minister for External Territories spoken in favour of increasing the strength of the Militia? ject of universal training I did not have since I entered public life I have 3tood for complete, absolute and unqualified conscription. I cannot be more definite than that. The Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) would not have advocated universal training when he did if it had not been for the action of the then Premier of Tasmania in leading the Tasmanian Labour party along that line. The honourable gentleman will advocate conscription, calathumpianism, or anything else which the Australian Labour conference instructs him to advocate. everything wrong with it. The point which I make is that the Lyons Government received scant assistance from the Australian Labour party in its efforts to strengthen the defences of Australia. When hostilities began in 1939, the Labour party declared the struggle to .be a. capitalist or imperialist war. When, in December, 1939, the Prime Minister of the day ( Mr Menzies) sought from Parliament authority to despatch units of the Australian Imperial Force overseas, every member of the Australian Labour party opposed the motion. Worse still, when the then Minister for the Army, Mr Street, introduced a bill to empower the Government to employ units of the Militia in Papua, New Guinea and the islands, which are now in the tender care of the Minister for Transport and External Territories, the honourable gentleman opposed the measure in one of tbe most vigorous speeches that I have ever heard him make. If he will refer to Hansard, he will see that his words were in this strain: "" If New Guinea and Papua have to be defended at all, they should be defended by the people who are foolish enough to live there. It is none of my business"". they were expunged, as other statements have been. The Minister voted against the despatch of the Militia to New Guinea.",31,Report Oe Royal Commission

67,Mr Archie Cameron,"WordsBefore the outbreak of war, the Mjenzies Government decided to compile a register of man-power, and the Labour party prevailed upon the right honourable gentleman to delete from the bill the provision that empowered the authorities to seek from each male person information regarding his military service. Instead of talking about having defended Australia, the Minister is one of the last men the Government of Queensland. I have who should refer to the subject. He has done absolutely nothing to support even the most elementary defence precautions. He has only attempted to divide the country on "" tbe Brisbane line"" controversy. On various occasions I have assisted in the preparation of certain plans. AlthoughI have not worked on "" the Brisbane line"" plan, I have no doubt that two or three different lines have been proposed .for the defence of Brisbane. I am sure that there is a line for the defence of Townsville, and other lines for the defence of Coff's Harbour, Port Stephens, Newcastle, Sydney, and PoTt Kembla. I know personally something about the plans for the defence of the southern parts of this continent. For instance, there are plans for the defence of Melbourne from attack from either the east or the west. It may surprise the Minister to learn that I was associated on one occasion with the preparation of plans for the defence of Adelaide. Therefore, on his reasoning, if it be reasoning Mr Clark interjecting, honourable member would be quite safe west of the Darling. One of the things which "" tickled me pink"" was the way in which certain honourable members opposite found it convenient to reside in Canberra after Japan entered the war. Before Pearl Harbour, you could not have kept them here with a battleship's anchor tied to each hand. They used to be on the train regularly on Friday afternoon, regardless of what was happening. These little things cause me great amusement. I watch my fellow men go by, and, still possessing a sense of humour, I can afford now and then to have a good laugh at some of the new-born patriotism of honourable members opposite. Sitting suspended from l.£5 to 2.15 p.m. had first mentioned "" the Brisbane line "" should study carefully this rather momentous piece of political jugglery known as "" the Brisbane line"". Tbe Minister for Transport was at great pains this morning to quote the views of a great number of people on the subject. Among others, he quoted the opinion of Mr Hanlon, a Minister of just met that honourable gentleman, and I have come to the conclusion that he is not at all a dangerous man. The MinisGray, the Treasurer of Tasmania. I know him moderately well. He has never struck me as a gentleman who knows very much about military problems in Australia or elsewhere. If he had to conduct military operations I believe the weapons would be feather dusters. I was not impressed by the remarks of the Minister in that regard. I do not wish to speak at great length on this subject, for some honourable members much more important than I may want to say something on it. Not one authority mentioned by the Minister this moruing could be considered, by any stretch of the imagination, as being qualified to express a weighty opinion on this subject. So far as I know, the Minister himself was the first person to make a reference to "" the Brisbane line "". MacArthur said. sorry that the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) has mentioned General MacArthur's name. It is unfortunate that he has done so. I have an effective reply to the honourable member's interjection if I choose to use it. As one who has some understanding of military matters, I would say to the honourable member for Bass, who always becomes vocal on Friday afternoons, that I , also, have some knowledge of international relations and the customs and courtesies inevitably linked with the successful conduct of international affairs. For that reason, I regret that the Minister for Transport imported into this debate the name of any person who is not one of our own citizens.

'The right honourable member for Darling Downs{ Mr Fadden), who was then Leader of the Opposition, quite rightly took violent exception-well , perhaps not violent exception, but exception -to the .statements of the Minister, and insisted that the Prime Minister( Mr adranee that argument. I take the Curtin) should clarify the position, because if the right honourable member for Darling Downs and certain other honourable gentlemen who now sit on L'hi3 side of the House are guilty of the things that were charged against Miem before the elections, and that have been charged against them again this morning in a most emphatic .and violent way, they should be impeached for what could only be fittingly described as -treason. Certainly, tke conduct .alleged against them amounts to criminal negligence. From his place at the table in -this House, not long before the elections, in the presence of myself and a number of his henchmen the Prime Minister in his wisdom-and he has quite a lot of jjolitical wisdom-repudiate d everything that the then Minister for Labour and National Service had said. So strong were tbe Prime Minister's convictions om that occasion that he suspended the Minister, who thereupon took a seat on the back bench beside the honourable member for Melbourne { Mr Calwell). Tbe question of an inquiry then arose. I am not one of the legal gentry of this place, but I well remember discussing tbe subject with the .then honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn). As soon as the question was raised I naturally took it for granted that leading King's Counsel who, at times, adorn the benches on this side of tbe chamber, would have taken into consideration the effect that parliamentary privilege would have on this issue. Any honourable gentleman who gave thought to the subject at that time should have recognized tliat .that issue was likely to arise. I do not desire to :say very much about the inquiry. Mr^ Hou -Does gentleman think that Parliament waived any question of privilege when it endorsed the action of the Prime Minister in appointing -a royal commission ? 31 r. Archie Gamer on. way be something in that contention. I ana only a 'common "" cocky"" and cowpuncher. On rural subjects I am always ready to talk "" turkey"", though I do -not wish to mix the flavours. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) was, in my view, entitled to -opportunity to say that he put the case very well this morning from the Opposition point of view, but we have to -recognize tliat it is not what the honourable member for Fawkner or I think; it is what the royal commission has dene. That is the all-important thing. The .next most important thing is the action of the Prime Minister after the royal commission had reported to the Governor General. At that time the Prime Minister said publicly that the then Minister for Labour and National Service would remain under suspension until Parliament had met and dealt with him. That is the crux and kernel of the whole question, and, in my opinion, it was not the Minister for 'Transport but tbe Prime Minister who should have answered at the table this morning. That responsibility is now more weighty and deadly than ever, seeing that the Minister for ""Transport reiterated his charges this morning. . Are we to accept the statements of the Minister for Transport or those of the Prime Minister? Are we to accept the view that in order to deceive Japan, :the Prime Minister had to put up .a bluff or a smoke screen? This morning the Minister for Transport conveyed the .impression to the House, on behalf of the Prime Minister, that because of the fine political balance in this chamber before the elections the Prime Minister, in a Machiavellian sort of way, was entitled to tell honourable members and the country that if the noyal commission reported in a certain way he would do something which he did not really' intend to do.

73,Mr Archie Cameron,"Th-.r eHe has impugned the reputation of men who should be here to-day, and who should be given an opportunity to answer for the attitude they have adopted. I . am not one who considers himself to be his brother's, keeper must answer that question for themselves. Why is the Prime Minister not here? not in the chamber. After all, the Prime Minister is the Leader of the Government, just as the right honourable member for Kooyongis tlie Leader of the Opposition. Mr CoN.Ei.Aiv.:-The Prime Minister has more important things to do than to listen to this sort of "" tripe "". honourable member for Griffith need not listen unless he is fascinated by ""tripe"". The Minister for Transport made, a lot of quotations this morning-about the state of the defences of this country when the Ourtin Government assumed office. I took theopportunity during the luncheon recess to consult a volume of Hansard. I shall direct attention to a debate which occurred in this House on external affairs, in 1938, after the Munich crisis. On that occasion the present Prime Minister -thi s great champion of Australian defence, this gentleman whose, picture, with that of an eminent leader overseas was posted in many parts of my electorate during the election campaign-said I conclude by saying that a practical policy gentlemen wbo adorn the treasury bench of economic progress in Australia:-the development of our industries, tlie payment of. to-day. decent wages, and the ensuring of good conditions so as to attract here citizens of the best type from other parts of theworldwill iu itself be an enormous contributor to ber would be like a. crown of thorns on our security. Shortly afterwards, the Estimates were discussed. I shall not quote the remarks quite prepared to stand up to anything of .the right honourable gentleman about that I have said. Long before the war collective security during tbe discussion occurred, as far back as 1935, I informed of the Defence Estimates, though I feel this House that the next, time a world w:ar strongly on the subject, because I was at occurred and we bad France as an ally, that time .a Minister in the Government France would let us down and crash. which is. now beingcharged with the Men who were very friendly to me at neglect of Australia's defence. But on that time took violent exception to my that occasion one of the first things that remarks. If honourable, gentlemen oppohappened was that, the honourable memsite care to examine the volumes of ber for Dalley-the gentleman with whom Hansard they will find also that long. yow, Mr Speaker, are well acquaintedmoved that the proposed vote for the Department of Defence be reduced by £1 as a protest against .the action, of tlie Lyons Government in providing for the establishment of the munitions annexes in which so much work is now being done in connection with the munitions production of Australia. In speaking to that amendment the present Prime Minister, who was then Leader of the Opposition, said1 We, as an Opposition, are opposed to the principle of incubating private vested interests iu Australia in connection with the defence needs. Under the old feudal system,, in return for certain baronial rights which the King gave to his favorites, thosefa.vorites undercook to raise armies on. bis behalf. We can say tliat that was a period in which defence was established on the basis of private enterprise. At the present time-, however, front srtbstance: a communal obligation. I shall not quote at greater length from the right honourable gentleman's remarks because I haive more important things to say, and honourable gentlemen opposite may read the speech for themselves. I remind them, however, that, many years ago, Jonathan Dymond, a noted English essayist, wrote an essay entitled, "" On a man's writing memoirs of himself "". Such records -are available concerning many honourable gentlemen opposite, and, if we were so minded, we could employ some industrious minions, as the Minister for-Transport has done, to collect extracts which could be hung, like a string of pearls, round the necks of some of the honourable extract's concerning the honourable memhis head. .",34,Report Oe Royal Commission

Most of us are average men, Breen) that I was partly responsible for it. After the evacuation of Dunkirk, the Menzies Government, of which I was a member, packed up guns, ammunition and everything else that could be spared, and sent it to the defence of the United Kingdom. I dare any man in the Labour party-I would dare even the devil himself-to say that we were wrong. In the history of the British race, there never was a grander moment than that which followed the evacuation of Dunkirk. Had Winston Churchill been brought out here during the last three or four years, he would have been condemned as a nitwit in this Parliament, the simple reason being that* Winston Churchill, like certain men in this Parliament, in his day and generation was fool enough to go on active service. Eor too long throughout this war, in parliamentary and political circles, has active service and a knowledge of bis subject by any member of this Parliament been regarded as a disqualification. [Extension of time granted.] man is rough on his colleagues. here to consider the feelings of any one. What, above all else, we want imported into this Parliament, is greater respect for political truth and honesty. I am not one who would stand with the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward) and say that, just because it happened to suit us, we had put up an excellent big bluff. I have a counter for that sort of method. When one cannot afford to tell the truth in political or military matters, the safe and honest course is to say nothing at all. man could not do that. capacity to hold my tongue on matters that ought to be kept secret will bear comparison with that of any honourable member of this House. PerhapsI am guilty of having said in this chamber, even during the course of this debate to-day, what not many other honourable members would say. It seems to be the view of too many honourable members that that the great body of our fellow citizens, who have not graced and adorned these green benches, do not understand what is hapand realize that the generality of mankind is not altogether foolish, but can judge the motives of other men. When putting out a smoke-screen, do not run away with the idea that the people outside are not able to judge what is happening behind it. They may not be able to detail happenings. They may not be able to lay a finger on this one and that one, and say that he has done this, that or tbe other; nevertheless they are keenly conscious of what is going on. The statement of Abraham Lincoln that ""you cannot fool all the people all the time "" still holds good. tions proved that. sults of future elections will prove it again. Some day, when I shall still be here, my distinguished friend from Griffith will be once more working somewhere in the neighbourhood of ""the Brisbane line "". You cannot fool all the people all the time. There has been too much of a tendency to import into the controversy on "" the Brisbane line"" a political insinuation which the facts do not justify. No member opposite other than the Minister for Transport would do that, and none has attempted to do it. I hope that there will be some clarification of the position by the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin). Perhaps, having gained the most remarkable victory ever achieved by any leader at an election in Australia, he considers that matters of this sort are beneath his notice.

106,"Mr Fadden""","That is true. Nothparty assumed office on the 7th October, 1941. 1940, the war had been in progress for twelve months. It broke out in September, 1939, and Australia, as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, automatically became a belligerent. Our Government went to the country in 1940 with a twelve months' record of war administration, and the people gave us a mandate to carry on, and confirmed our defence policy. Admittedly, the mandate was not a very effective one. Because of the relative strength of the parties, it was difficult to make of Parliament an effective instrument for legislation. ""What happened? En October, 1940, by arrangement with the then Opposition, we formed the Advisory War Council on which the Government and the Opposition had equal representation with four members each. The Labour party's representatives were the Leader( Mr Curtin), the Deputy Leader( Mr Forde), the present Minister for Supply and Shipping( Mr Beasley) and the present Minister for Munitions ( Mr Makin). Something akin to an all-party government to conduct the supreme direction of the war was set up within a month of the 1940 general elections. government. administration. council. sider and give advice upon all defence matters-matter s involving the strategic direction of the war. The Labour party representatives were most active. They attended meetings of tbe council armed with volumes of advice and complaints and the results of their inspection of munitions factories and annexes. Were the Labour party representatives dissatisfied ? Did they think that Australia was in a defenceless position? Did they believe that our policy was to throw Australia, particularly Queensland, to the wolves? If the answer to those questions is "" Yes "", they failed in their duty to their party and to the people as a whole by remaining silent and by remaining members of the council. But the answer is not "" Yes"" ; it is a decided negative. At the time of the election in They were so satisfied with the condition of Australia that their leader asked me when I was Acting Prime Minister during the absence abroad of the right honourable member for Kooyong, to increase the membership of the council, which I readily consented to do. The right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) was added from the Labour party's side, and the honourable member for Indi( Mr McEwen) from our side, so preserving the balance. If all the claims made to-day by the Minister for Transport were true and Australia was in an utterly defenceless position when Labour took office, instead of asking for the appointment of the right honourable member for Barton to the council, the right honourable member for Fremantle and his colleagues should have resigned and protested to Parliament and the country that the then Government was not doing the right thing by Australia. A further _ denial of the charges made by the Minister for Transport is contained in a statement made by the right honourable member for Fremantle on the 18th October, 1941, only eleven days after he became Prime Minister. The Minister for Transport to-day admitted that the Prime Minister bad made the statement, but offered as an excuse that it was necessary to bluff the Japanese. that statement before the Japanese entered the war. This is what he saidThrough their membership of the Advisory War Council, most Ministers of the War Cabinet were familia r with Australia's war effort, and, since assuming office, the Government had made a broad review of the situation with the Chiefs of Staff and the Commander-in-Chief Far East. The Navy was at the highest pitch of efficiency, as demonstrated by the notable exploits of some of its ships overseas. The Home Defence Army was well trained and its equipment had been greatly improved. The strength of the A i r Force had been largely increased,' both in respect of home defence squadrons and the training resources of the EmpireA i r Scheme. The equipment of the Air Force had also been -much improved.

112,Mr Fadden,"Yes, six weeks before.That is a clear and unequivocal statement by a sincere man entrusted with the destinies of the country. Who would cast douibt on the sincerity of that statement? The Prime Minister, when he made it , had been a member of the Advisory War Council for more than twelve months and knew the facts. If that statement is not suflicient to convince honourable members that the facts are not as the Minister for Transport would have them believe, I point out that the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde), who had also attended meetings of the Advisory War Council, was equally emphatic about our preparedness, because on the 20th October, 1941, less than a fortnight after Labour bad taken office he saidOur Army, Navy and Air Force are at a high standard of efficiency and are improving daily. On page 25 of Volume 167 of Hansard, the right honourable member for Fremantle, five months before he became Prime Minister, is reported as having saidI claim that the war has been prosecuted to sent degree of safety. Australia became the maximum of Australia's capacity. "" Maximum"" else but maximum. That statement was made by a man with a f u l l sense of his responsibilities and an intimate knowledge of the facts. A t a Labour rally at the Sydney TownH a l l , on the 12th October, 1942', the Prime Minister saidI have to pay tribute to the governments which preceded my own for the constructive work they have done in defence and the foundations they have laid. If those statements are not true and are not sincere, it is hard for any one to assess what the responsibilities of a public man are. A f t e r Labour took office, the Advisory War Council was not only continued, but also expanded and given enlarged powers. Therefore, tlie claim by the Ministerf o r Transport that the Menzies and Fadden administrations had no regard for the need to defend Australia is completely refuted. But in case some honourable members yet remain to be convinced, I produce further evidence of the falsity of the allegations made by the Ministerf o r Transport. It is contained in a publication The Job Australia is Doing issued on behalf of the Commonwealth Government by the Department of Informatio n in March, 1943Before this war, Australia had not even built a motor car. But when Australia came in she had already supplied a wide range of war equipment to allied countries, including Great Britain, Egypt, South Africa, New Zealand, Fiji, the Netherlands East Indies, Hong Kong, Malta, Malaya, Burma, India and the Fighting French in the Pacific. Who supplied that equipment-thi s Government or that which preceded it? W ill any responsible' member of this House doubt that it was our Government that, by its acceptance of tbe global strategy, enabled this country, when it was threatened with invasion, to claim and receive strong aid fro m its Allies, notably the United States of America? The isolationist policy which would have been applied in this country had the Labour party occupied the treasury bench in September, 1939, when war broke out, would have disqualified us fro m ever being able to ask for, let alone receive, the aid which has conferred on Australia its preentitled to the aid it received because it can mean nothing raised, equipped and despatched overseas the Australian Imperial Force, men of the Royal Australian A i r Force, ships and men of the Royal Australian Navy, and stripped itself of armaments in order to help GreatB r it a in when it stood with its back to the wall after the withdrawal from Dunkirk. We paid for our right to ask for help in the battle to retain our title to this country. That aid came. It included American conscripts, men enlisted to serve wherever senta contrast with the limitations of service we have placed on our conscripts. The Minister for Transport cited as an authority in support of his claims as to the defenceless position of Queensland in 18j39, Mr Hanlon, the Minister for Health and Home Affairsi n that State. It is well, therefore, that I should place on record a statement made by Mr. Hanlon on the Sth March, 1936The Minister for Health and Home Affairs, Mr Hanlon, indicated yesterday that he favoured the return of its war-lost colonies to Germany. Mr Hanlon was discussing a cable message which stated that the possible return of New Guinea or any of the former German colonies had never been contemplated in British Government quarters. it was obviously to the advantage of tlie A ustratiaii people, Mr Hanlon said, to have jiti-ong European nations interested in t'he I'acific, and possibly Australians would not feel so lonely if they had such a neighbour. A nation like Germany -with an ever growing population must geek colonial expansion -necessacTy to defend our Mandated Territory, That was M i . Hanlon's classic contribution to the basic defence of Australia, and the security of Queensland. When relations with Japan became very grave in February, 1941, I was Actiiug Prime the result of a decision of the Advisory War Council, the then Leader of the Opposition ( MrC u r t in ), the Leader of the Non-Communist Group of the Australian Labour party ( Mr -committee it seems to be generally agreed, Beasley) and I sounded .a joint note of warning to the Australian public. We pointed out -that the gravity of the .situation and the imminence of war with Japan. When and where hostilillM vould break out was a matter tliat we could noit .gauge. Shortly afterwards, the Parliament assembled, and on the 13th March, the present Ministerf o r Transport and External Territories saidThe Acting Prime Minister knows that the Government issued the warning in an endeavour to hoax the public. When I protested a-gainst the use of that expression, he withdrew it and substituted the phrase ""unwarranted scare"". He declared that the warning had been issued for political purposes to frighten the workers, so that they would discontinue strikes. Subsequent events proved that the warning was justified. The Minister's attitude on that occasion was consistent with many of his public utterances. November, 1936, he statedSurely no one imagines for one moment that if Australia were unfortunate enough to conic under the heel of some foreign country, the whole of the 'existing population would be wiped out of existence, or that the material conditions of the {people relatively would be much worse than they are at present. Speaking on the Estimates on the 8th September, 1937, he saidI .again ask the Minister for Defence to see aggressor-and he resisted the expendi-that any warlike equipment at .present in the East iSydney electorate is removed. I am not satisfied, therefore, that there is matter should -be clarified.

On the 2nd November, .1.938, he spoke these wordsI t is amusing to hear people say that we shall not give up New Guinea. To these people I would say that if it should .become they should defend it themselves. 'On tlie 5th November, 19 36, when speaking on the Estimates be declared1 should not be prepared to take up arms against the workers of any country whether Minister. As they he German or of any other nationality. As a matter of fact, because 1 am not prepared to do that, I am not iprepared to tell others to do so. I believe, and judging .by statements made by honourable members on 'both sides of the that Australia would find at very difficult, :iif not impossible, to defend itself against an aggressor. On the 17th November, 1936, he said-I am dealing with a particular item-the Minister himself has mentioned it-the proposal .to construct a naval vessel. I oppose .such a proposal on the ;gro.und that a naval vessel is not an arm of defence but is one of offence; and I suggest that if this Government were concerned purely with the defence of Australia, it would !be providing .only arms of defence and would not be huilding up .a -navy having a range extending far beyond the coast of Australia with the object of using it in the wars of other .peoples. The Australian Labour party .should not support suclr a policy. When the LoanB ill was being debated on the 28th A p r i l, 193S, and the defence of Darwin was receiving attention, the honourable 'gentleman saidThe Schedule to the bill sets out that £20.000 is to he expended upon defence works at Darwin. Can any of the military experts For example, oh tbe 5-th sitting behind the Government tell the House iin wJiat way the strengthening of the defences at Darwin can affect tlie -defence of Australia V The reason for the proposed expenditure at Darwin is that it is desired to establish an auxiliary base there, 'so tJhat, in the event nif Ithe British Fleet being driven from Singapore, it would .have another base to retire to in order that it might continue to defend Britain's possessions in the East. He would have left New .Guinea in a defenceless condition-a n easy prey to an ture on defence works at Darwin. This has reiterated his charges regarding "" the -Brisbane line "". On a previous occasion, the Prime Minister repudiated them isi no wnef-'/vain manner; and I ask the right honourable gentleman' again to repudiate these unfair, unwarranted and 1 malicious allegations. If , as alleged, Australia had been in a defenceless condition when tlie Ourtin Government took office, the Australian Labour party can not, escape its share of the responsibility because of its partnership with the United Australia party and. the United Country party in the Advisory War Council. Motion proposedThat the debate be now adjourned. that. Motion negatived. Never before in my long parliamentary experience has an official arrangement with tlie Government Whip been -broken. I point out, Mr Speaker, that the Government Whip( Mr Sheehan) asked me to move the adjournment of the debate, and I api^eal to tbe Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) to honour that arrangement. is not aware of any such arrangement. for Transport and External Territories ( Mr Ward), who has spoken in his own defence, has endeavoured to obscure tbe three simple points at issue in this matter. been framed accordingly, to ensure The first is the important question of parliamentary privilege, the second concerns a matter of opinion or political judgment.,, and the third relates, to a matter of fact. On the question of parliamentary privilege, the House was. entitled to a declaration by the Prime Minister early in the debate regarding the position of the Minister whom he suspended. He made a definite statement when that gentleman had appealed .through his barrister for the mainbe decided is whether the retention in the tenance of his privileges as a member of Parliament. He said that the Parliament should be the judge in this matter, and added that, in the meantime, the honourable member would be suspended from his ministerial duties. Yet before the Parliament has dealt with the matter, the Minister is again in his place, and is actively carrying out his functions as a Minister. The whole subject of parliamentary privilege is also involved in another aspect, it would be intolerable, indeed, if an honourable member should be able to make statements in this Parliament regarding matters or persons without regard to the interests of people outfide who might desire an inquiry into the truth of the. statements. This matter of resting behind parliamentary privilege should not be dealt with in the off-hand manner which the Government is adopting. We are entitled to a statement by is concluded. As the Leader of the Houst/ he must guard its traditions. I consider that it should have been made at the beginning of the debate. The other two matters raised are of vital importance, and they should have been dealt with by tbe head of the Government, and not by the Minister who has spoken. What will be the position if, as soon as an inquiry is desired as to the truth of certain statements, the sittings of the House are brought to n conclusion? In this particular instance, f am discussing a political issue which could be determined by the electors. Apparently they have given a verdict upon, it and I do not. cavil at it, but I am concerned about the preservation of the privileges of this Parliament and about the redress of just grievances of individuals. Erom the first meeting of tbe British Parliament the practice has been, and the Standing Orders have freedom of debate, so that any legitimate grievance may be ventilated. A defmifv obligation rests on the Parliament to ensure a fair deal to the public. I am gravely concerned at the off-hand way in which this matter has been treated at a time when the whole of the members of the Opposition are not in attendance. So much for the question of privilege. The matter of opinion that remains to Cabinet of a Minister, who has practically given to the Prime Minister and to bis colleagues the lie direct and ths 1 lie indirect, will lead to a negation of responsible government and the destruction of Cabinet authority. For 240 years, parliaments have been building up the tradition of Cabinet responsibility with regard to the control of the Executive.

The Coal Commission directed that the mine he immediately re-opened, and simultaneously gave an undertaking that it would investigate the finances of the mine and pay such subsidy as was reasonably justified. This undertaking was limited to a period of six weeks, as in that time it was thought that a complete investigation would be concluded. It was found, however, that no proper books of account were kept, and consequently tbe investigation was more prolonged than anticipated. A report, 'which will be referred to the Prices Stabilization Committee, is now being made to the Commission. 3. Implementation of the recommendations referred to would require the expenditure of capital in addition to the subsidy found to he payable. The fact is that the mine is not an economical producer. It employs 24 men for a.n output of 20 tons per day, and the Commission feels that it would not be justified in spending Commonwealth funds on its further development-a t least until a boring programme, which has now been undertaken on this field by the Victorian Mines Department, has been concluded.

Audited copies of balance-sheets and profit and loss accounts have been submitted in accordance with regulation 19 (3.), Statutory Rules 1942, No. 290, as amended by Statutory Rules 1943, No. 227, Australian Military (Canteens Service) Regulations. question, without notice, was asked by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr members of the services. The question Francis) of , the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in relation to the Women's Land Army. It must be pointed out; that the Australian Women's Land Army is not an enlisted service as are the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force and the Australian Women's Army Service, the Australian Army Medical Women's Service and the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, and therefore has not been, granted exactly the same privileges, as have been accorded to the services. Cabinet did approve of the Women's Land Army being granted a status akin to that, of the women's service auxiliaries, and pursuant to this decision similar privileges have been granted as far as possible. For example, members of the Women's Land Army are granted free railway travel to their homes for the purpose of enjoying their paid annual holiday leave of twelve working days. The question of extending travel concessions to enable members of the Land Army to visit their homes more frequently is at present under consideration by the Director-General of Land Transport. Members of the Women's Land Army are also admitted to a number of clubs and hostels on equal footing with members of the women's service auxiliaries. Recently the uniform and clothing issue has been increased, so that to-day the issue compares very favourably with that made to of granting special post and telegraph concessions was taken up with the Postmaster-General's Department. However, there are certain technical difficulties in the way of granting such concessions, as correspondence to members of the Land Army would be addressed to private addresses and there could be no suitable check on correspondence sent by members. Moreover, it was considered that if post and telegraph concessions were granted to meinbers of the Land Army similar claims would probably be made by other nonservice organizations, such as the Civil Constructional Corps. So far as attendance at special picture programmes for tbe services is concerned, this is a matter entirely for negotiation with the appropriate bodies, and there for I am asking my deputies in the various States to approach such persons with a view to obtaining for members of the Australian Women's. Land Army the same privileges as are extended to the women's services.",49,Australian Army Warwick Detention
