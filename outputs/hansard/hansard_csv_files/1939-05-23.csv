115,Mr Speaker (Hon. G. J . Bell),"BILL 1939. Debate resumed from the 19 th May {vide page 594), on motion by Mr facing problems somewhat similar to That the bill be now read a second time. [3.48] -When the House adjourned last week, I was pointing out that, although this bill is called the Supply and Development Bill, there is a danger that those functions contemplated under the word "" development"" will be swamped by the activities associated with supply. This danger will continue to exist until the meaning ""regionalism"" is better appreciated. This is a much misunderstood and neglected term, though every member representing an outlying area should know that he is committed to foster the regional development of the district he represents. So that honourable members will know what regionalism means, and understand that it is not merely a fantastic term, I propose to refer to what is being done in this connection in other countries, .and particularly in France, one of the most united, and best developed countries in the world. The following is an extract from an article by Professor Roberts, of the Sydney University, published in the Australian Geographer:In the question of French regionalism factors of history, geography, race, economics and administration all blend together, although geography is the final factor ( in that it determines economics and in the past mainly determined history), and the whole significance of the question is that it illustrates geographimust clearly differentiate such regionalism cal determinism over a long period of time. The modern problem dates from the conflict of two opposed theories at the time of the French Revolution. The basis of the Aneien I!.6gvnie was the provincial organization, for the provinces corresponded to profound differences in race, history, customs, laws, fiscal regimes and spirit. The old provinces, indeed, appeared to be increasingly vigorous in the years immediately preceding the Revolution, and the provincial assemblies had recently been strengthened in order to check the civil -MUcndWts. In point of fact, the provinces had no legal existence, for the whole stress was one the forty gouvernements. and the monarchy had already evolved the idea of extreme centralization as its most effective weapon. Roberts regionalism in France than on national politics. reads what he says and ought to know. I point out that Australia* to-day is those which confronted the French nation for many hundreds of years. Unless we have an efficient scheme of regional planning the optimum carrying capacity of this country can never be reached. In rebuttal of the jibe that the French nation is not united, Professor Roberts goes on to sayThe French say, with Duruy, that ""there is no country in the world with a more real physical unity than France"", and argue that while the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Rhoneand importance of gap give coherence to the country, none of the physical divisions is sufficiently pronounced to create immutable political divisions. The geographical centre, they go on, has been the historical centre, and this creates a narrowsolidarity between the provinces. U n d e r the heading "" The Facts of R e g i o n a l is m "" he saysMost post-war projects' realize that there are three separate fields (administrative regionalism, intellectual regionalism, and economic and social regionalism), and, though all unite in wanting local assemblies as a basis, it is agreed that little is to be gained by confusing these various aspects. His concluding remarks are as follows:A t present, the position is that administrative regionalism is practically nugatory (because Republican policy and vested interests have made Mtatisme ascendant), sentimental regionalism is constantly growing (especially in Alsace-Lorraine, Brittany and Provence), and economic and geographical regionalism can be stopped by nothing. The very pressure of events is hastening them at a terrific rate, and France, if she wishes to avert suffering, from administrative regionalism and not lump all manifestations of this phenomenon into one amorphous mass. All told, regionalism, in its various guises, is one of the most significant and interesting phases of post-war French life. In the citation of this bill the word "" development"" is used. Unless we group Australia into natural regions by an economic survey, which would mean redrawing the map of Australia, we shall fail to take full advantage of the expenditure of the millions of pounds of money to be made available under this bill in the name of development.

I know that I am not alone in that view; it is shared by many other honourable members who during this debate have castigated monopolies in those two cities. We all affirm our conviction that without certain principles, liberties and rights, we could not regard any organization of society as a tolerable one. member of this House, I believe in government by persuasion backed by science or exact knowledge. I need not add that exact knowledge is a compelling logic. I do not believe in dictatorial violence; but I realize, with many others, that the democratic system is on trial. The vote of honourable members on this bill will show just how they stand in regard to the question whether or not we are to take full advantage of the money to be expended under this bill to develop some areas which it would be uneconomic to develop were the money not to be made available. decided defence flavour. It represents an endeavour to preserve peace; but it seems to mc that this Government has forgotten that in its political aspect tbe problem of peace is actually one of government. The motive of profit-making, of Avhich we have heard so much in this House during the last \veek,.has already in other countries, particularly England, to a greater degree than is realized, ceased to be tbe mainspring of economic activity. development of the resources available to the community under public ownership or control for the use of the whole community will be further extended in the years to come. I like to think that the same outlook will continue, and that big business, that is, the ""commercial complex "" will be infected by this ethical outtion in land and community planning. look.

This"" might be "" bill is thrown down in front of us. makes no suggestion of spreadability or equity, yet the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Casey) saw fit to suggest national planning. ProbablyI the huge would not have been on my feet had not the all-embracing term ""national planning "" been misused during this debate. What a slur on the' host of scientific thinkers, engineers, town-planners, As an independent regional planners, business men and sociologists who alone could enunciate a policy of regional planning in this country! I have frequently stressed the need for such a policy in this country. I am not unmindful of the fact that on the now famous 6th December last year the Minister for Defence( Mr Street), among the members of the Government, was the first to use the expression ""national planning"" in this House. Prior to that, the Government regarded any suggestion for national planning as blood-red in its origin. Subsequently it began to revise it3 views and regarded This bill has a this subject as somewhat pink in origin. But now we have the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Casey) referring to national planning as an objective of this Government. I strongly object to the use of such an all-embracing word in connection with this bill. Let us see the character of the planning that is being done overseas. I direct attention to the January, 1936, Newsletter The of the American -Society of Planning Officials in order to show that this idea is not by any means new. England, of course, is doing as the Americans are doing. The American society's Newsletter states that the aim of the organization isTo promote efficiency of public administraNothing like that is contemplated in this bill. The report readsI t certainly suggests Thirty-one State planning boards, the District of Columbia, three planning regions and two foreign countries were represented at the Conference on State Planning Administration called by the society and held in Chicago during the second week in December. Representatives came from as far south as Alabama, f r om as far west as California, Washington I am afraid that it will and Oregon, and from as far north and east as Massachusetts and Vermont. A resolution was adopted at the conference urging that Congress enact the b ill now pending before it It providing for the creation of a permanent national planning board.",19,Casey

120,Mr Blain,"That is the very thing I have been advocating in this House ever since 1 have been a member of it . The report proceedsJudging by tlie statements made at tlie conference and by the many letters received since the conference, those who attended were very well pleased and valuable results were obtained. NewYork writes as follows: ""As1 stated at the meeting, 1 feel that it was the first conference ever held which accomplished the pui-posc for which it was called."" The work of the national planning authority of the United States of America is being done without any shelving or back-sliding. The policy of the organization is clearly stated and it is being effectively applied. In regard to regional organization, such as is very desirable in Australia, the report statesA regional organization, whatever its varied form, should not be considered as a new form if sovereignty, even in embryo. It need never develop to the stage where it will have elected ufticurg, a legislative body, and the power to tii.x. Consequently, the region need not have fixed biiundiiritis. By the same token, the region need have no definite body of citizens. An Australia-wide planning authority should be established for Australia. That could be easily done if we adopted a regional system in preference to our existing State system, and any difficulties in relation to overlapping could be successfully combated. In this regard the report addsMany citizens may consider themselves as belonging to one region for one purpose and to an adjoining region for another. From the point of view of the National Planning Agency, regional planning work should be focusscd in a central office to which have been assigned certain problems, largely overlapping because of having different ureal extents. The statement proceeds to refer to continuous national planning, for any effective national planning must be continuous as it w ill need to go on for centuries. It, statesWe recommend the establishment, from time tn time, «a needed, of regional planning commissions of the general type of those recently set up in the Pacific north-west and in New England, as advisory bodies for planning purposes in their respective areas. These regional planning commissions have consisted of representatives of State planning boards and of a federal district chairman representing the National Planning Board, and have been advisory rather than operating agencies. Yet this Parliament scorns to call upon scientists. It regards the scientist as some kind of vermin, or, perhaps I could say, a reptilian creature which deserves no consideration. The President of the United States of America, however, holds quite a different opinion. Shall we dare to set ourselves above h i m in this matter? The National Planning Board of the United States of America has done remarkably fine work. A great deal of the excellent developmental work in the Tennessee Valley, and in other areas that are now carrying large populations in the United States of America, was inaugurated by the National Planning Board. The President set up this authority to give advice on national planning, and he has not hesitated to develop national resources in conformity with the advice of the Board. Some such authority must be established in Australia, but unfortunately, the Government has only a limited vision. Alli t can suggest is that some accounting authority shall be authorized to probe deeply, or perhaps not so deeply, into the activities of the profit-makers. The profit-makers are, of course, very real persons in Australia. The honourable ingly indicted them in his speech here a few days ago. He. referred, in particular, to the iron and steel industry, the sugar industry, and one other. He had his own methods of describing these octopus organizations, but it was quite clear that he was deeply sincere in his denunciation of them. I shall describe them iu my own way. I suggest that each of the three industries to which the honourable member referred is like a large circle surrounding many smaller circles which touch one another at various points. Perhaps a better illustration is found in the description by a schoolboy of tbe marine animal forammifera which inhabit the deepest and darkest beds of parts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. His words were as follow:Formninifera are minute marine animals enclosed in shells perforated by innumerable perforations through which the' animals protrude their tentacles. Honourable members may consider that that is an even more perfect description of these monopolistic organizations than that given by the honourable member for",20,Casey
121,Member For I N D I ( Mr Mcewen) Scath,"Indi. But, any spirit of banter apart, it is highly essential that we shall do our very utmost to deal effectively with these monopolies in order to ensure that the development of this country shall proceed on sound lines. Our greatest need is decentralization. Unless the Government is prepared to introduce some measure to ensure the effective decentralization of our key industries, it will lay itself open to the charge of insincerity. In my opinion, the producers of iron and steel should be required to limit their activities to production. They should not be permitted to accept big contracts for governmental construction works. The assent of various administrations to that policy in the past has had highly unsatisfactory results in the North. I know that various contractors have been termed interveners or entrepreneurs because they have dared to tender for contracts for government works which have involved the expenditure of substantial sums of money. It has been said of some of these tenderers that because they have not £100,000 or so behind them they are really men of straw and should not be allowed to tender. Tbe adoption of this attitude towards them has undoubtedly been suggested by the big monopolists which, under current government policy, are not only producers of essential raw materials, but also contractors for works in which it must be used. member is aware that the production of iron and steel in this country is practically in the hands of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited.. agrees with me. I hope he will also support my contention that the'key industries of this country must be decentralized. Last year, when certain honourable members representing South Australian constituencies called attention to this subject, they were told that decentralization was not possible. It will never be possible so long as we permit the producers of essential raw materials, such as iron and-steel, to accept government contracts in which the materials they produce are used. Adherence to that policy will result in these.huge organizations scorning the activities of companies with., limited capital. Obviously, companies which are able to use in contract work the raw material which they produce, will always have an advantage-over other companies which have to purchase such raw material from. them. In the northern areas of AustraliaI am notmerely referring to my own electorate-smal l contractors have been deprived of contracts because it would be a little more costly to give them to them. If certain authorities in inland towns were given the right to form a company they could produce the smaller articles that are required under the defence scheme. There is no need to concentrate all activities in tlie south-eastern corner of the continent. In continuation of my remarks on national planning I shall quote an article by Charles E. Merriman, a member of the National Resources Committee of the United States of America, the adoption of whose recommendations has made for the development of the American continent. There cannot be development without the aid of scientific men. They are track finders. The article reads as follows :The report of the National Resources Board brings together, for the first time, exhaustive studies by highly competent inquirers into land use, water use, minerals and related public works in their relation to each other, and to national planning. The report lays the basis of a comprehensive long range national policy for the conservation and development of our fabulous natural resources. If the recommendations arc put into effect, it is believed that they w ill end the untold waste of our national domain now, and w ill measurably enrich and I see that the honourable enlarge these national treasures as time goes on. Tho following are perhaps the most important recommendations:1. A land purchase programme providing for the retirement of some five million acres of sub-marginal land yearly for some fifteen years, with administration through a permanent land planning section, co-operating with State and local boards and authorities. It h in k t h a t t h a t w o u l d appeal to the honourable member for B a r k e r ( Mr Archie Cameron). 2.

A permanent public works administration, preparing a six-year works programme, operating through lump sum appropriations by Congress, and assuming the leadership in cooperation between national and local .public works authorities. 5. Continued encouragement of and cooperation with State and regional planning boards. 6. Collection of basic data for planning, including a financial balance sheet for the Federal Government, a census of population and employment, completion of standard maps of the United States of America, basic scientific studies of land and water resources. 7. A permanent advisory national planning board to serve as a general staff for the President. It was suging free areas of human activity. gested that this board consist of not more than five members appointed by and responsible .to the President, with a rotating panel of consultants and a skeleton staff made up of government personnel, and others brought in for special inquiries. It is that permanent body instead of what has been suggested in this bill that I am desirous of seeing set up. This bill allows the Government to choose its advisers as it thinks fit; but it is a permanent body of advisers that is needed-me n on high salary, not with administrative authority as some honourable members think proper, but with authority based on exact knowledge. There are three outstanding considerations in looking at plans for planning:1. The necessity and value of co-ordinating our national and local policies, instead of allowing them to d r if t apart and pull against each other. 2. The value of looking forward in national life, of considering in advance, rather than oifterward, of preventive measures as well as remedial. I submit that these conditions exist in Australia. honourable members to the report of the Royal Commission on Bush Fires in Victoria. That report should have awakened honourable members to the fact that there is no co-ordination and that there is jealousy even between departments in a small State. How then can Consideration of retirewe have co-ordination in an area of 3,000,000 square miles unless we have a For a ll these purman continues3.

He is u p against t h a t a l l the t i m e . He does n ot believe in r e g i m e n t a t i o n in t e r f e r in g in the lives of the people. I am not referring now to the objections of those who think of regimentation as an interference with their robber-baron privilege of private exploitation and oppression, hut to those who sincerely believe that there is a danger of sacrificing something which is valuable to civilization. Wise planning makes provision for decentralization as well as for unification, for territorial and individual decentralization, for independent criticism, judgments, and initiative, for preserving and creatThe zoning of power is as important iu political as in economic organization. We may plan indeed for fuller liberty-and indeed are now so planning. Sound planning is not based on control of everything, but of certain strategic points in a working system. Control of these points holds the system in balance, reconciling order, justice, liberty. Tlie best planning will find these strategic points shown by the social directives of the time, with least delay, and sees no more points than are necessary for the purpose in mind. What happens is:1. Change is too long delayed. 2. The re-adjusters violently seize more than they need; and 3. Eventually the re-adjusters restore what they would not have taken if they had been wiser. I am not unmindful of the complexities arid difficulties in the way, but dangers lie around as well as ahead, from non-action as well as action. We cannot proceed as if nothing hail happened in recent years, or could over happen again. Our doctrines of liberty, equality and democracy are not to be regarded merely as legal phrases to be paraded and celebrated on memorial occasions.

It we can look the facts in the face and not do what we do not like; if we can consult our fears less and our hopes more; if we can think more in terms of the present and future and less in terms of the past; if we can show inventive ability in social and industrial arrangements equal to that developed in technical advancement, we can realize the promise of life more f u l ly than even the prophets have ever dared to dream. That article sums up planning from the technical side right down to the human problem. This bill does violence to my intellect. ""national planning"". That term should never be used until a board exists comparable to that which exists in the United States of America from which the President of the United States of America is not ashamed to take advice. Therefore, I say that if Country party members who come into this Parliament advocating the formation of new States support this bill in the name of national planning, it is about time that the large body of country people who sent them here found other representatives who would more truly voice their opinions and support a movement for the regional development of country districts. does not appear to me that the ranks of the great United Australia party are very thrilled by the introduction of this measure, the first in regard to Supply and Development, if I may judge toy the beggarly array of empty benches while this urgent measure is being considered in this, to use the words employed in the conscription referendum of 1916, "" time of grave emergency."" I notice that an Assistant Minister, the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), has moved forward to a seat at the table, thus leaving the ministerial bench empty. I was very greatly entertained during the debate to hear an honourable member who is a recent acquisition to this distinguished debating society state that although the powers conferred by the bill are great and far-reaching, there is always control by Parliament as a safeTare"". T h words "" control by Parliae ment "" take my mind back to the period of the Great War. I remember the measure of control exercised over legislation passed by Parliament in those years. Many of us recall that as a time during which the totalitarian State worked at its best. If any person imagines that, when the time comes, if ever it does come, for giving effect to this measure, the elaborate powers which are now being taken, or at least previsaged by it, will be controlled by Parliament, that person has not profited by the study of history. There is never ""control by Parliament"" in time of war, or in anticipation of war, because Parliament presupposes discussion, consideration and deI t makes reference to cision, based on evidence, and these things are always absent from popular conceptions in time of war. If I should be found quietly assenting to the second reading of this measure, or at least seeming to assent in that I may not call for a division or join with at least one other honourable member in doing so, it will not be because I view it with any approving enthusiasm; much less that I imagine that the bill has in it the essence of a charter of liberty at least equal to that of Magna Oharta. I will assent to it, if at all, I fear, grudgingly, and with an entire absence of reforming zeal, mainly because I am not in a position to command sufficient numbers to oppose successfully the motion for the second reading. Most measures introduced into this chamber are described at some stage or another as "" a bill for an act."" When passed in due course, an act perhaps confers rights; almost certainly it imposes obligations and re-arranges, at least over some limited area, the relationship of some members of the human family to others. This measure is certainly "" a bill."" but it would be unduly optimistic to suggest that, in any real sense, it will become an act, according to our accepted definition of the term, because it neither confers rights nor imposes obligations. The honourable member for Indi( Mr McEwen), in a very comprehensive speech, said that it was a declaration of policy, and that an act of Parliament was not the proper medium for a declaration of policy. That was not far wide of the mark, but I prefer to say that the bill",23,Casey
126,Mr Brennan (Batman) [4.21],"I tis a rather broad hint at policy-a n indicationof what policy is to f ollow. The fact that it opens up a very wide field for discussion has been made evident by various speeches delivered upon it. I have listened to some interesting observations from my next-door neighbours of the Country party. For example, the honourable member for Riverina( Mr the lives and businesses of individuals, Nock) discussed exotic plants, flax and jute. A little further away, although still a neighbour, is the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), who gave us a learned and most alluring disquisition on precious metals, some of which, but for tbe honourable member's contribution to the debate, I would probably not have heard of at all. SoI again have to thank the honourable .gentleman for having given me some help in regard to the tantalizing subject of tantalite, the merits of wolfram, and the delights of pianganese. osmiridium. pity if , in a discussion of practical defence measures, osmiridium were excluded from our consideration. vanadium be excluded from the consideration of vanity. passed before us in review as matters for consideration by practical men in connection with defence. I thank these honourable gentlemen for their spoken essays, and am far from suggesting that pny one of them was, even in my humble judgment, out of order; because it is quite obvious that in regard to this bill, which hints at policy and suggests things which may in some way be marshalled or captured in the interests of defence, no limit whatever should be placed upon the imagination of public speiakers. AlthoughI may, and probably shall, at least appear to assent to this bill by remaining silent while'the second reading is being passed, there certainly are in it matters to which, on principle, I cannot agree, even though they be merely declaratory. I shall not agree to that portion of an inquisition into the private lives, habits, and businesses of individuals. Those matters might, in particular circumstances, and to a particular end, be fit subjects for a royal commission or other properly constituted body of inquiry; but I shall never agree to a bill which seeks, through the medium of regulations, to empower a government to enter upon an unlimited area of inquiry into merely because of the declaration in advance that, in the opinion of the Governor General which means the Government-the answers to tlie questions asked are necessary in the interests of defence. I shall never agree to give to a government the right to declare to whom and when an act of Parliament shall have application. I shall never.agree to tlie right being established of the prosecutor to determine at will whether an offence is indictable or one to be dealt with summarily. I shall never agree to a restriction being placed pn the freedom of the labourer to work where ho will, to be employed by whom he may, or to his being regimented from one class of employment to another in order to suit the exigencies of the Government,' in the name of defence. It would not be at all difficult for me, upon a little further inquiry, to find opposed to tbe contents of this bill; but I shall allow to stand for the moment those that I have mentioned, and shall suggest, others as the measure passes through committee. Supply and development are quite pleasant phrases, which seem to me to be associated with peace, social service, and general uplift. Yet this measure, whatever else it is or is not, is certainly a war measure. It deals with matters of daily concern to us in our ordinary lives, such as the acquisition of goods, the development of industries, employment and unemployment, wages and the lack of wages, and the costs of production; but it deals with all of these matters in their relation to war relation to war-making, and not in their proper relationship to one another in the interests of what I have already described the. measure which authorizes as social service and general well-being., enlightenment and popular happiness.

134,Mr Brennan,"When a person ishe is not here, and is leaving the hill in the hands of the ""War Minister, he is to he technically and nominally, and for social purposes, the senior Minister. On that much he insisted. On toning to clause 5, sub-clause 2, we find the quaint purpose of the bill disclosed in these termsTlie Governor General may from time to time determine the extent to which or the conditions upon which any of the matters specified in this section may be administered inquisition is a very disquieting one. by the Department. I ask the Ministeri f he will be so kind as to make a note of my special interest in this sub-clause. Has he ever known an act of Parliament hitherto, which, as is stated in this case, applies here to-day and there to-morrow; to one group to-day, and toanother group to-morrow; to a part of a group to-day and to another part of a group to-morrow? Is the Minister's idea of equal justice as between all the King's Hege subjects that the arbitrary requirements of a government should demand that the law should flit like a sparrow from bough to bough in this way, to suit the necessity? I ask the Assistant Minister( Mr Holt), as a lawyer, what he thinks of that; later he may tell us. It must be remembered that the Governor General-and this means the Government-wil l determine how and where the law may operate in that way, and it is not, apparently, to be done by the process of a regulation adopted and laid on the table and capable of being disallowed by the House. It is to be done through the swift process of the order in council, which, as far as I know, is not subject to the same legal procedure as that applying to a regulation made under statutory authority. At all events, I should be pleased to know that I am wrong. To me it seems monstrous that a law should bear upon its face, as this measure does, a confession of its obvious inequity. The next clause is the one which introduces tbe inquisition. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) said that it was easy to imagine with what gentleness the processes of ""big business "" would be dealt with under this clause. Imagination may well run along those lines, but I permit my thoughts for any person to disclose any secret process to travel also in the opposite direction. I of manufacture. ask myself, not how gently will the inquisitor deal with his friends, but how harshly^ will he deal with his enemies. This notion of approving in advance of the commencement of war, and in anticipation of the passage of a war precautions act the policy of setting up an authority, empowered to an unlimited extent to be prescribed by regulations not yet adopted, to put individuals, presumably privately, upon the rack of There is here a further invasion of our civil liberties, and one to which I do not propose to lend tbe very slightest countenance. Clause 6, sub-clause 1, statesWhere, in the opinion of the Governor General, it is necessary or desirable in the interests of the defence of the Commonwealth that information should be obtained in relation to industrial, commercial or other undertakings, or with respect to any goods, the regulations may require such persons or classes of persons, as are prescribed, to furnish, as prescribed, such information and particulars, as are prescribed, with respect to those undertakings or goods. Those are prescriptions over which this Government's political Parliament will have no supervision. Are we in this young country, and at this time, to lend encouragement and support to a policy of this kind, to a general power in government to make secret investigations under heavy penalties? Was it not rather our belief that justice would continue to be administered in the open light of day, according to the well-established principles of jurisprudence known to Britain and its associated dominions? The definition of ""goods"" is"" goods"" includes all kinds of personal property, and also includes anything growing in or on land and mineral or other deposits; I find nothing in that clause, as it stands, which wouldprohibit the secret tribunal from requiring an answer to the most intimate personal questions directed against the liberty of the individual by the body unknown to be set up under this measure. I do not propose to lend any countenance to it by my vote or approval. The only exception admitted in tbe bill relates to secret trade processes which we are assured will be sacrosanct. The clause statesNothing in this act shall authorize the making of any regulations rendering it compulsory Liberty is nothing! The freedom of the subject is trivial! The principles of British jurisprudence are midfer considerations, but processes of manufacture go to the root of commercialism. That is a business matter, and if life is sacrosanct, business is more so, and a great deal more so than individual liberty. I had the advantage of hearing the greater part of the excellent and comprehensive address delivered by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) on this measure, and I was impressed by the temperate and restrained manner in which he analysed its contents. I have taken a somewhat different line. I do not propose to make a speech on defence or on preparedness. I should like occasionally to find myself free to speak in this Parliament without addressing argument to the subject of war mongering and war scares. I believe that history so far has been on my side. The war scares have come and gone. They have blown out, and have been proved to mean nothing. to the armourers. honourable member. A war scare can be quite as profitable as a war itself, probably more profitable. In a sense a war scare fills the pockets of the armament makers to repletion better than does a war, and it can be maintained for a very considerable time, as our present experience proves. However, let me not be misunderstood. I do not say for a moment that it is impossible that this country should be involved in war. I think that there is a real danger of Australia being involved in war, but only by this Government. So long as this self-governing nation, so far removed from the theatre of war, unthreatened by any nation, unmcnaced, uumentioned, almost, by other nations, resolves to remain at peace it will be left in peace; but so long as we have a government pledged, in the words of the late Prime Minister, who has now passed beyond criticism, to 100 per cent, interference in international quarrels in Europe, and in almost any part of Europe-so long as this Government pledges us to enter into commitments with countries at that distance in respect of other countries contiguous thereto, there must be a continuing danger of war. The safety of Australia cannot be assured internationally until the policy of Labour is applied by a Labour government in Australia for Australia. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat ( Mr Brennan) referred to this bill as a great and urgent measure, for which, however, he had no approving enthusiasm. was great and urgent. member used those words, though perhaps in a different sense. tbe honourable member. great and urgent describe this bill, because it is designed to ensure that, if .a national emergency should arise, Australia will be prepared for it as well as is possible. We must prepare, not only in regard to the supply of munitions, but also in regard to those contingencies affecting trade, the storage of primary produce, &c, which might arise in the event of hostilities, and against which we must provide in every way that our ingenuity can suggest. I join with the honourable member in saying that I do not believe that any of us view this bill with enthusiastic approval. I would much rather be debating ah international agreement, entered into by Australia as a nation within the British Commonwealth of Nations, providing for international disarmament, and designed to ensure peace. Unfortunately, no such agreement seems possible. Again using the honourable member's words, it is unfortunately true, that we do not know from day to day what may happen overseas to involve Australia in a war that has its roots in the ambitions of people far removed from us. That being so, a government would be betraying its trust if it did not take whatever action was possible to ensure the security of Australia. I should like to know why the Ministry for Supply is not to carry out the works which it institutes. I have read the bill, and it appears to me that another title could be given to it. This is really a",26,Cameron No R Should Other Grounds Upon Which I Should Be

141,Mr Hutchinson,"The wordsbill of works, because it provides for tbe undertaking of works of almost every conceivable kind, including works associated with the manufacture of munitions, works to provide storage of primary products, works in connection with roads and various forms of transport and so on. Yet, we find that the Department of Works is to remain entirely outside the control of the Minister for Supply. The works are to be undertaken by another department which has been described as the "" Ministry of a hundred tasks,"" and is certainly one of the most congested departments of the Commonwealth. It seems strange that the works to be undertaken in connection with matters arising out of this bill should be delegated to a notoriously congested department for performance, and that the Minister for Supply and his assistant should exercise' no control or supervision over them. I have on previous occasions made inquiries on this subject, but have, so far, received no sntisf.ictoTy reply. The honourable member for Batman also drew attention to the fact that the Department of Defence now employs the services of four Ministers. I approve of that arrangement. The task is beyond the capacity of one man, however great he may be. Surely, among the four Ministers now associated with this department, one should be able to exercise control over tbe works to which I have referred. For instance, the Minister controlling Civil Aviation( Mr Fairbairn) is now engaged upon rationalizing matters associated with his department, but once that has been done, the department will more or less run itself. I suggest that this Minister could well be placed in charge of the works contemplated in this bill. Reference has been made in tlie course of this debate to oil fuel. The finding of flow oil in commercial quantities in Australia is of vital importance to this country, both in war and in peace. There is a conviction in the minds of many honourable members, and in the minds of the public also, that everything possible is not being done to find oil in Australia. There is a suspicion that some influence is directed against the finding of oil. I do not propose to go into that aspect of the matter, but merely point out that, despite the fact that private enterprise and the Government have expended many thousands of pounds on investigations flow oil has not yet been found. Nevertheless, it has been authoritatively stated that flow oil exists in Australia in commercial quantities. Some time ago, I c.mie in contact with a. geophysicist of international repute, who stated that he was quite sure that flow oil existed in commercial quantities in Australia, and that, if the proper methods were employed, it could be found within six months. This matter is of no mean importance. The expert to whom I refer is well known to tbe Government. authority to disclose his name. His qualifications, however, are such that private enterprise in Australia has subscribed sufficient capital to employ his services in areas outside the Commonwealth. That fact shows how highly private enterprise, at any rate, thinks of him. I do not suggest that our present .idvisers are not the best we can secure; they may be, but the plain fact remains that they have not found oil in Australia. The point 1 emphasize is that if divergent views exist among experts as to the efficacy of the method being followed in the search for oil in Australia, the Government should accept the opportunity to consult any geophysicist of standing, and should, at least, allow him to inspect the exploratory work now being carried out. Furthermore, this expert has had experience in practically every oil-bearing region in the world, including oil fields in Russia, Mexico, the United States of America, and Roumania. I doubt whether the Government's present advisers have had anything like his experience. After checking up on his qualifications, I should be inclined to put him in charge of this work in order to give him an opportunity to substantiate his claims. He states that he would be prepared to give his services to the Commonwealth entirely free in the event of his failing to discover flow oil; he is prepared to stake his reputation on finding flow oil in commercial quantities in this country. In those circumstances I should certainly be prepared to give him every consideration.",28,Cameron No R Should Other Grounds Upon Which I Should Be

143,Mr Hutchinson,"I have noClause 5, sub-clause 1, provides that the matters to be administered by the department shall be matters relating to(e). arrangements for the establishment or extension of industries for purposes of defence; (/) the arrangement or co-ordination of(i) surveys of Australian industrial capacity and the preparation of plans to ensure the effective operation of Australian time of war; and ( i i ) the investigation and development , of sources of supply of goods, which in the opinion of the Governor General are necessary for the economic security of the Commonwealth in time of war. These are very wide powers. I do not object to wide powers being given to the Minister in such circumstances, and I am aware that it would be impossible to detail in a measure of this kind all the powers that might be required by him. However, I have misgivings concerning this particular sub-clause, because I feel that the views of certain members of the Government may lead them to embark upon industries which may not be necessary to Australia and the maintenance of which in the long run may involve an over-riding cost to the people of this country. Almost any industry one may like to mention has a bearing on defence. I am all the more concerned about this matter because in an explanation given to the House a week ago, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) stated that motor car manufacture would be commenced in Australia at as early a date as possible, one of the reasons for its early commencement being the purposes of defence. reason he gave. honourable members, I am not against tlie manufacture of the complete motor car in Australia; nor am I against the -establishment of any other industry, so long as I can be assured that it will make for the economic benefit of Australia as a whole. However, the Tariff Board has inquired into this particular industry, and has made certain findings in respect of it. Two days before the Prime Minister made this statement, I asked the Minister for Defence( Mr Street) whether this industry was considered to be necessary from the point of view of defence, and whether certain gentlemen who had been invited to Canberra to discuss it had come here at the invitation of his department? In as clear-cut a reply as one could desire, the Minister answered that no person interested in motor car manufacture had industry income to Canberra at the invitation of his department, and that the department did not consider this industry necessary Australian for defence purposes. be produced before the Tariff Board to say that it was necessary for defence purposes. tion which I have just given arose only during the last few weeks. The giving oi such powers to the Minister as are enumerated in this measure, may mean eventually that efforts will be made to establish industries which will, not only prove very costly to the people of Australia, but will also mitigate against the success of industries which are unquestionably of vital importance to this country. Shortly after the first Lyons Government assumed office, the view was expressed officially that the depression, not only in Australia, but also in other countries, was due primarily to the fall of prices of primary products. It was also stated as the belief of the Government of the day that economic recovery depended primarily on the recovery of prices of our exportable products. Consequently, all of the energies of the Government at that time were directed to that end. production costs in primary industries. Ottawa Agreement assisted us to a very great extent in attaining that objective. As the result of this policy, Australia rose out of the depths of the depression to a prosperity the equal of which in some respects it had never known before. However, a different psychology is at work to-day. Many people now hold the view that Australia's future advancement is bound up almost entirely in the development of industrial enterprises which cannot",29,Cameron No R Should Other Grounds Upon Which I Should Be

The new policy may have advantages so far as defence is concerned, but it savours very much of economic self-sufficiency. economic self-sufficiency without industrial development? gesting that we can. economic self-sufficiency has never succeeded, and it never will. Any policy which aims at hindering international trade and international investment will never contribute towards the peace of the world. industries in Germany and Italyi n an endeavour to make those countries self-sufficient in a time of war 'is to-day one of -the very reasons why we are threatened with war. The synthetic machine which Hitler has built up in Germany threatens to devour him and his system should it collapse, and I do not wish to see anything of the kind adopted here. I am not against industrial expansion. In order to populate this country adequately and to ensure that we, as a nation, shall be free from the ups and downs associated with a country which relies solely on primaryproduction, we must expand industrially. I am afraid, however, that this idea, which is definitely held by many honourable members to-day, may lead us along the road to economic insanity and defeat the very object which they have in view. ber believes that some people are willing to exploit our defence position? that because of the great powers proposed in this measure to be conferred upon the Minister, we may go far beyond the objective which the Government now has in mind. I warn the Government to bear that aspect of the matter in mind, and I shall watch any move in this direction with the closest possible interest. member know if it is more than a hope?

Anything that interferes with that basis, and, consequently, interferes with the economic stability of Australia by decreasing our accumulated funds overseas, must rebound in such a way as to reduce our standard of living. Eor instance, this financial year our overseas funds will probably can we have decrease to something like £10,000,000. That prospect is by no means pleasing. Therefore, I urge the Government to tread very warily along the path it is about to take. I know that we shall be The policy of obliged, in the interests of our defence, to establish many new industries in this country, but in considering our needs for war purposes, the Government should, before it embarks on any synthetic ventures, or establishes any factories that will The building up of synthetic prove white elephants in time of peace, if such a time should ever recur, consider the storage of these commodities a much better proposition. After all, any commodity so stored could always be utilized should the quantity placed in reserve prove to exceed requirements for defence purposes. The only other point with which I propose to deal is that relating to profits. I believe that if the people of Australia can be assured that profit-making will be kept under control, they will be more amenable to the expenditure of large sums of money for defence purposes. Under this bill, provision is made for the appointment of an advisory panel to work in conjunction with the Minister for Supply and Development and his permanent Staff. The members of this panel will advise as to the best means to check profiteering in the manufacture of munitions and in tbe production of materials used in their manufacture. As honourable members are aware, under the definition of munitions in clause 4, almost every commodity produced in this country can be brought within the scope of the bill. I know that this is the hope of the Government, and that it will probably be fulfilled in some instances.",30,Cameron No R Should Other Grounds Upon Which I Should Be

I do not think that it is possible to devise any system to prevent profiteering in a general way under this measure. The co-operation of the Treasury will have to be sought. honourable members are aware, I have for a long time been very keen to see the introduction of some means by which the Government could tax undue profits made in any industry. I am well aware of all the difficulties associated with the taxing of excess profits, but I still believe, notwithstanding what has been said concerning ""shutting the stable door after the horse has gone"", that something of the nature proposed is imperative. It should be possible to assess excess profits, but, studying the whole range of manufacture and primary production in Australia, it is not easy to devise a means by which industrial activities can be supervised effectively, and excess profits actually determined. the honourable member has not any conters and things deemed by him to be necessary fidence in the proposals of the Governor ment? tain directions, but I do not think it assigns the work in connection with this possible to devise a satisfactory scheme department of energy to the Minister to cover the whole of Australia's indusfor Supply and Development.

His Corpus Juris Civilis included "" novel"" So, which provided that nobody should manufacture arms unless licensed by the Government, and then only in licensed factories, and that no person should sell arms to any private person. Justinian was one of the great war makers, but after his death much of the empire he had founded by conquest fell to pieces. Even his laws against private manufacturers of arms and armaments did not prevent war. The importance of munition-making in the world seems to be explainable in this way: Every nation is becoming industrialized-becomin g an industrial manufacturing nation-and it develops the proin defence and aid to economic prosperity. duction of goods which its own people are unable to buy; they have not the purchasing power,' because only a fraction of their national product goes to them as wages. Nations then have to sell their surplus abroad in competition with other nations. That has become increasingly difficult, and to-day is practically impostralian investors must be intensely interested sible. Nations cannot feed, clothe and maintain their working classes by producing exchangeable goods. What then does a nation do that is not in a position to employ its own people in the production of exchangeable goods, and yet must employ -them or be exposed to social revolution? It devotes a good deal of capital and energy to the building up of industries which do not produce exchangeable goods. It embarks on public works and on preparation for war, because the advantage, if we may so term it, of such a policy is that profits are provided for capitalists and employment for the workers. A country cannot provide profits for capitalists and employment for the workers in industry by producing only exchangeable goods, because every country has a surfeit of such goods.. If a country can employ its people on the manufacture of materials required in war and ensure profits to the capitalists and employment to industry policy we are adopting? have to prepare to destroy men in order people. The people of Australia generto maintain them. That is the position ally will scrutinize most carefully every in the world to-day. But for our concentration upon the preparation for war a greater number of persons than are unemployed in Australia and in other countries would be unemployed. That, I think, accounts to a large extent for the great preparations for war that are being made in every country. The following paragraph appears in a circular which has been sent to meI shall not give the name of the author-and follows other warnings and advice which have been given:The Commonwealth has entered also upon a new. era in the production of munitions of war. This is another very valuable adjunct A long view plan is in the early stages of development by which Australia will produce not only for herself but also for New Zealand, South Africa and the Empire in the East, and the Pacific. All these enterprises mean work for thousands, the circulation of more money, more business all round, more new wealth created each yeara widening and ever-expanding circle of prosperity. Ausin all this expansion, not only from the paramount aspect of national safety and growth but also from what might be termed "" self interest"". Increased industrial activity means more general prosperity. That in turn connotes larger turnovers, higher profits, bigger dividends. That represents the warnings and advice given to investors all over Australia. We have been told that the way to prosperity is through the development of the armaments industry. Now comes this bill containing many clauses which mean nothing at present; they must be worked out and their meanings revealed later. The experience of the Great War has warned the people against giving too much power to governmeiats.

Either the honourable gentleman is pretending^ to misunderstand me, or he desires to misrepresent me. I do not think that he wishes to misrepresent me. I repeat that the Commonwealth Government may manufacture only things that are connected with the defence of Australia, and nothing else. 1 ts powers would be temporarily enlarged in the event of war, but at the conclusion of the war those powers would shrink again as they did after the Great War, The Commonwealth Government would not be able to turn its factories to the production of peaceful implements as the privatei-capitalist could. A great deal has been said about the necessity for controlling the prices charged by private producers of munitions. The Minister has suggested that a profit of 4 per cent, would be reasonable,"" a jury. My answer is that if the offence but I point out that it would be impossible to determine the actual profits made by such a body as the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited. Unless there were some reliable check upon the actual cost of production by its subsidiary companies, there would be no means of ascertaining that company's production costs. In order to produce figures to prove that it was not making more than 4 per cent, profit, the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited would need only to arrange with its subsidiary companies to charge inflated prices. If the Government be in earnest, it should insist that no private company shall manufacture munitions unless it discloses tlie names of its subsibefore a jury of his peers. diary companies and the number of shares held by it, and by its directors in every other company. With that information in its possession, the Government might be able to keep a check on costs; otherwise a reliable check would be impossible, and any attempt in that direction would become a laughing stock. Such information should be obtained from all private manufacturers of munitions. I am of tbe opinion that no person should be allowed to manufacture munitions except under licence, one conditionof which should be that he shall make the fullest disclosures"" as to his relations with other manufacturing bodies. At the moment I am mainly concerned with the power to make regulations. Clause 16 contains a general power to make regulations, whilst clause 6 gives something in the nature of specific power, in that it authorizes the Governor General to make regulations calling upon such persons or classes of persons as are prescribed to furnish, as prescribed, such information and particulars as are prescribed with respect to certain undertakings or goods. Clause 6, sub-clause 4, providesAny offence against this section may be prosecuted either summarily or upon indictment. If the offence be prosecuted upon indictment, the case will be heard before a jury, but if dealt with summarily, it will be heard before a magistrate without a jury. It is open to the Commonwealth Government to bring the offender before either a jury or a magistrate. It may be said that minor offences do not justify be a minor one, the penalty also should be of a minor nature. No man should be liable to be sent to gaol by a police magistrate. yes. not been convicted before a jury should be sent to gaol.

177,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs) [5.55].,"the intolerable position were tbe supply of lubricating oil from other sources to be cut off? That brings me to a matter upon which I have spoken publicly whenever the opportunity has been presented, namely, the necessity for taking steps to produce petrol substitutes in this country. I know that the Liquid Fuels Committee has been set up to carry out an investigation of this very important matter. As a Queenslander I am particularly interested iu the research and investigations carried out in connection with power alcohol. From all I have been able to read in connection with this matter and from statistics collected from 49 countries and made available by tbe courtesy of the United States of America Department of Commerce, I find that Australia is practically the only country in the world which is entirely dependent upon imported petrol; at the same time, it is the only country which national legislative enactment for the compulsory blending of imported petrol with locally produced alcohol. import into this country approximately 360,000,000 gallons of petrol annually. If we compelled only a 10 per cent, addition of locally-produced spirit we would at least be able to dispose of 36,000,000 gallons of power alcohol annually. It has been stated that, from an economic viewpoint, power alcohol cannot compete with imported petrol. We know very well that it cannot, but neither can a lot of other things produced in this country compete with foreign articles. We do not want them to be competitive if their production is to be at the expense of the White Australia policy and the industrial conditions of Avhich we are proud. Comparison with the prices of imported petrol is not the basis upon which we should approach the national consideration of the local production of fuel oil . Rather we should consider how indispensable is an assured supply of fuel, particularly in time of war. I urge the critics who reject local production of power alcohol as uneconomic to bear in mind that they have no guarantee as to what the petrol companies in this country will charge for their product at any time. We know very well that the Government was not able to satisfy itself and the people, even after exhaustive inquiry by a royal commission, regarding the activities of the petrol companies in Australia. We also know that during the war Australians paid as much as 3s. 6d. a gallon for imported petrol, and that even at that price supplies were, rationed. We got exactly what the petrol companies were prepared to give us and only at an exorbitant profiteering price. To make the price of imported petrol an excuse for discouraging the expansion of the power alcohol industry is ridiculous, decidedly unfair, and un-Australian, because the price of imported petrol has no relation to the costs of production, importation and distribution. During the last few years there has been a big move to amalgamate the great merged corporations of the United States of America with the combines of Europe. One of the most notable achievements in this direction was the pooling of the interests of the StandardO i l Trust of the United States has failed to provide by of America, the Royal Dutch Shell Company, the British firm of Imperial Chemical Industries, and the German ""We Chemical Combine known as the I . G . for the commercialization of the patents for the production of fuel oil f r o ni coal by tbe hydrogenation process which received so much publicity in this country and which has such an indefatigable champion in the honourable member for Hunter( Mr. James). This gigantic monopoly was brought about in 1931 by the establishment of the International Patent Company, with head-quarters in Germany, which operates in all countries including Britain and Australia. The rationalization of the world's petroleum industry, outside Russia, has been brought about by an Anglo-American-European"" understanding "". Honourable members know that Australians, particularly those in terested in power alcohol, have suffered greatly because of lack of encouragement of that very important industry, the expansion of which I consider to be essential. All the factors necessary for the successful establishment of the industry are here. First, we have the market. A t present we import almost every drop of petrol that we use. Secondly, we have all the raw materials necessary for the production of power alcohol. We also have the sunshine, the rain, the idle menplenty of people are looking for workand the idle land. As we are anxious to provide adequate defence for our country, why can we not do as the people of other countries have done? During the war, Germany had to produce alcohol locally, because it had no other liquid fuel for its mechanized armies. Approximately 40,000 distilleries were throughout Germany to process all surplus materials from farms. Refuse, and even straw were used to produce power alcohol. Certainly it had to be done at a price. ""We in Australia, have the opportunity to establish the industry, and it is the responsibility of the Government, and in fact, of every Australian, to see that it is established. The industry should not be considered simply from the point of view of pounds shillings and pence, particularly as we have to depend now on imports from other countries. The cotton industry is also vitally important to us. Cotton is a raw material for defence purposes. I have the privilege and pleasure of living in and representing a State which has within its borders the only suitable cotton-growing land in Australia. If all Australia's requirements of cotton were to be supplied by local industry, the growers of Queensland would need to crop another halfmillion acres of land. that means! work. centralization, and of the development of rural centres are staring us in the face. En the circumstances the opportunities available are not merely opportunities; they are also responsibilities. take full advantage of them. If the Government is sincere in its intentions, it has a wonderful opportunity in Queensland to-give practical application to this measure, the main purpose of which, so we are told, is to effect a national stocktaking resources. Our policy should be determined by our own needs, not by external influences. No considerations, other than those to find the best methods to develop Australia's resources, increase its population, and ensure the security of its people beyond any possibility of successful challenge, should be permitted to affect the position. Some honourable members have become so pro-English that they are now anti-Australian, although they do not Mr Fadden. recognize it. We must give serious consideration to our defence responsibilities, and do everything in our power to reduce expenditure on the defence programme, even though we may be told by our experts that it is essential. We are established informed that we are in danger of war. War implies a breach of international relations, and therefore it appears to me that every logical system of defence should provide for the maintenance of international, friendships, tbe smoothing out of difficulties with potential enemies, and the establishment of intimacies with potential allies. The Commonwealth Government has neglected this aspect of defence. Australia has a special interest in Japan and the United States of America. Consequently, the Government should be trying to solve outstanding problems which affect our relations witb Japan, and it should also be trying to secure some promise of assistance from the United States of America in the event of war. Other dominions have appointed Ministers to non-British countries. The Australian Government has refused consistently to follow their example. It is not necessary to make appointments wholeVisualize what sale. Still, an Australian Minister at People are looking for Tokyo would be invaluable at presentThe problems of defence, of deHe could do much to improve international relations, and help to 3olve outstanding problems. Possibly, also, he could act as an intermediary between Japan and the United Kingdom. An We should Australian Minister at Washington could do much to establish Australia's security, and, as a consequence, lessen expenditure on what, under existing circumstances, seem to be essential defence activities. It may be true that the United States of America will not make a general agreeand develop the country's ment with the British Commonwealth of Nations, but it is quite probable that it would be willing to conclude a regional defensive pact with Australia. These which involve an effort factors are far more important than the mere expenditure of money, particularly when the expenditure is decided upon by experts, or so-called experts. Naturally, I believe in the employment of experts, but I have had some experience also of so-called experts. The Government, should not place too much power in the hands of, or repose too much confidence in so-called "" defence experts the responsibility to decide all matters of policy. It should formulate its policy and then see that it is applied. Naval and military experts often seek to take advantage of critical times in order to urge expenditure on projects calculated to advance the interests of the professional sailors and soldiers rather than those of the country. We must benefit by experience and take full advantage of the knowledge that is in our possession in order to ensure that Australia obtains full value for every pound expended, and that a pound is not expended if a shilling will be sufficient. The decentralization of our population is highly necessary. Records show that although our population has increased by 38.4 per cent, in the last twenty years, the population of the six capital cities has increased by 58 per cent., whereas that of the country districts has increased by only 24 per cent. unhealthy tendency should be arrested. Every possible means should be used to adjust this ill-balance of population. Australia needs not only an increase, but also a better distribution, of population. We must remember that the security of the country is based upon its man-power. Sitting suspended from 6.1.5 to 8 p.m. the claims of the country side of Australia for the better distribution of industries. industries should be removed from densely populated to less vulnerable parts. In considering the problem of secondary industries, it is necessary to remember that a prime objective of any government should be to produce a well balanced state, that is a state in which a due proportion is maintained between primary production, secondary production and trade. History is full of examples of empires and states which have decayed, after a period of brief prosable members from Queensland and perity, because of failure to maintain this balance, or, to put it in another way, because of an over-emphasis oh either primary products, secondary production or trade. The maintenance of a proper proportion between primary, secondary It has and commercial activities contributes to the development of the self-sufiicietit state in this way:; (a) the growth of primary industries provides a market for secondary products and gives additional employment to traders; (b) the growth of secondary industries provides a market for primary products and gives additional employment to traders; (c) the organization of efficient trading agencies enables both primary and secondary producers to gain easy access to markets. The maintenance of a proper balance will lead to a progressive increase of population, properly distributed through the country, and probably giving evidence of a more equable distribution of wealth. This increase of population is essential to Australian security partly because world opinion will not tolerate forever the Australian claim to territories which are not fully used and partly becauseObviously this it will supply the man-power necessary to defence. In this connection I desire to put forward as strenuously as I can the claims of Queensland. There are honourable members of this House who would give the territory north of the Tweed to the Japanese, or any other potential enemy, if it meant the well-being of the rest of Australia. The State of Queensland is the most vulnerable State in the whole of Australia. I need not Wherever practicable, stress that to responsible honourable members. It is almost the least populated, and the least developed. It has the greatest potentialities and the greatest resources of any of the States. I recognize that I am leaving myself open to the charge of being parochial, but I lay stress on this because the defence of the rest of Australia will depend on the garrisoning of the coastline of Queensland and the effective occupation of sparsely occupied and undeveloped spaces. I , in common with other honorQueenslanders generally, view with alarm the scant consideration that has been given by way of defence expenditure to Queensland. I hope that that will be remedied under the national stock-taking that this bill proposes, and that the resources of",36,Cameron No R Should Other Grounds Upon Which I Should Be

180,Mr Faixden,"North of. the Tweed.Queensland will come very forcibly under tbe notice of the Government, because ii is on that State that Australia will have to depend for the raw materials needed, not only for the defence of this country, but also in time of peace. I am sure that there is no honourable gentleman who regrets the Government's policy in regard to the establishment and maintenance of iihe great sugar industry. Everybody recognizes now that whatever consideration or concession was bestowed .upon that industry, the expenditure it involved has been the best defence expenditure that this country could possibly undertake. Every responsible Australian will also agree that every farm house in the tropical belt of Queensland and on its coastline constitutes a garrison for the defence of this country. I shall now touch on the various details the greatest requirements for the defence of this bill. I notice that the bill is designed to bring into operation an act that will continue for five years. I submit that because it is a measure which provides to the greatest possible degree, and degree, for government by regulation, if this bill is to have any virtue, the shorter the period during which it is allowed to operate the better it will be for parliamentary procedure and democracy generally. It should be an annual bill. It should be a measure to come before Parliament each and every year for the reconsideration of Parliament just as the British Army Act has gone before the House of Commons every year since 1689, when in the reign of William the Third the Mutiny Act, subsequently in ' more recent years replaced by the Army Act, was first passed. There could be no possible argument against bringing this measure up for, reconsideration every year so that Parliament could accept that responsibility which belongs to it and government by regulation could be minimized. It could then be considered' in the circumstances of the time and omissions could be rectified. One of the most important provisions cure. There is nothing to prevent the of this bill is for co-operation between Government from operating a definite the governments of the Commonwealth scheme for profit limitation on the same and the States, but I urge that there basis as the gas and electric light comshould also be brought into the realm of panies have to operate. We all know Mr Fadden. essential co-operation the co-operation of local-governing bodies and local authorities, so that the three spheres of activity, namely, local government, State government and Commonwealth government, would be co-joined. It must be remembered that the same people are represented within those three spheres. I am astonished that some definite plan is not contained in this measure. Nothing concrete has been placed before Parliament. We have been told that this will be done and that that will be done, that this will be considered in committee, and that that will he covered by regulation. There is no excuse for the Government's failure to lay down a definite plan for co-operation and coordination of the electric light undertakings of Australia, because that is one of of the country in the event of an invasion. A definite plan could and should have been set down for consideration by this Parliament, whereby the capital cities would not be dependent, in the event of the greatest disadvantageous hostilities, on their own isolated electricity supplies. A plan should be devised to link up all the electricity undertakings throughout the Commonwealth. I am also astounded that there is no protection for the people of Australia against the horror and dread that every body must have when war is spoken of or defence is undertaken. I refer to profiteering. It is a serious responsibility of the Government to lay down a definite scheme to prevent undue profits being made out of any unfortunate circumstances which may be forced upon this nation. I throw a suggestion out to the Government. I . do not agree with methods of excess taxation, because 1 recognizeI speak with some experience each and -that all taxation is paid by the workers and the producers, who cannot pass it on. The greatest factor in the cost of living is the class of taxation that can be passed on to the two terminal points that I have mentioned. We must, therefore, look for another method to control profits. I believe that prevention is better than that gas and electricity can be sold to the consumers only on the basis of government requirements and regulation. Tbe Government can go further by having price-fixing legislation and methods in order to prevent people from making undue profits out of the defence of this country. tricity undertakings do well. is some protection for the consumers.

Consequently, the Government's announcement of the creation of the new Department of Supply and Development was, I believe, received with the widest approval. The variety of subjects dealt with by honourable members, in the course of this debate, the length of the debate itself, and the public interest which it has aroused, have provided more than sufficient evidence of the necessity for the bill. of this defence expenditure was formerly handled by the Works Department which the Government has now abolished. tension of his time in order to place his views before the House. If he does not interrupt me I shall not ask for that priviis fully conscious of its obligations under lege. Under the bill, as the honourable gentleman has pointed out, the Government takes very wide powers. I suggest, however, that that is essential-eve n inevithonorable members are well aware that able. It is necessary to make provision for supplies for all branches of the de'fence forces; to take measures to ensure that there are adequate reserves of essential commodities which to-day are either imported or cannot be manufactured within a reasonable time in Australia, or for which we have to make provision within this country in the future. The scope of the matters to be dealt with and the degree of uncertainty as to the extent of the problems which will arise have, I repeat, rendered inevitable the taking of very broad powers under this rneasnre. The fear which has been expressed in some quarters that the exercise of these powers will be abused is, I suggest, entirely groundless. The bill itself contains certain checks. Two are to be found in clause 5 which specifies the various functions of the Department of Supply and Development. In the first place of the subject-matters enumerated only those which the Governor General directs may be dealt with by the department. Towards the end of that clause there is a provision, that the Governor General may determine the extent to which any of the matters specified may be administered by the department. Thus there is a very real check, at the outset, on the exercise of the powers conferred by this measure, and the responsibility rests, not only on the department, but also on the Government. Furthermore, there is a definite limit of time placed upon the functioning of the department itself. The life of the department is limited by the bill to a period of five years and it will not be possible to extend it without the approval of Parliament. Also, the regulations under which these powers may be exercised must come before Parliament regularly for approval. Some honourable members have expressed the fear that these powers may be used to ride rough-shod over existing government policy in respect of the establishment of secondary industries. Here again, I suggest, the fears are without substantial basis. This Government the Ottawa Agreement. It has shown repeatedly its desire to use the machinery provided in the Tariff Board Act, and any action which it may take in connection with Australian industries must eventually come before this Parliament for approval. Those honourable members who have expressed the greatest concern in this respect are well aware-and I assure them that the Government also is conscious of the fact-that the continued existence of the Ministry is dependent, in the last analysis, upon their support. There is, surely, a real assurance in that comforting fact! Several honourable members have expressed the opinion that, in making some provision for the manufacture of munitions by private enterprise, the Government is violating some fundamental principle of eivic morality. I suggest that a common-sense approach to this problem will lead to no other conclusion than that the policy being adopted by the Government in this connection is the correct one. It ensures that Australia's peace-time requirements of munitions and defence equipment will be obtained from government establishments. In time of war, of course, the demand for these supplies will be greatly increased. Surely no one will contend that in time of peace we should maintain, as government establishments, the necessary industries for producing",41,Cameron No R Should Other Grounds Upon Which I Should Be

If they consider these checks use should be made of government workshops. But I think that most honourable members will agree that the Government's policy is a sound one. ment has declared that Australia's peace-time requirements shall be supplied from government workshops, but that to meet emergency requirements in time of war it will utilize private industrial establishments. Therefore, it has been necessary to put these private industries on such a basis that, should the emergency arise, they can with the least possible delay and witb the least wealth. possible dislocation be converted to the production of government requirements. The further suggestion has been made that, since the Government has decided to establish annexes, it should make fuller use of. State government workshops. NeedI point out that in time of war all State railway workshops would be working to capacity, whereas many private industries which to-day are producing peace-time requirements, some of which are luxury items and certainly not all are necessities, would be comparatively idle? Government's scheme, many of these establishments converted to the production of munitions and other defence requirements. Another fear which has been expressed Is that tlie Government may be exploited by industries converted to war-time needs in respect of the prices charged for their commodities. The information given to the House by my colleague the Minister for Defence( Mr Street) should do much to allay this fear. As honourable members are no doubt aware, it is intended to set up an advisory panel of accountants. Let there be no misunderstanding as to the function of this body. It is not suggested that these gentlemen should do the work of cost accounting for the whole of 'the activities of the defence establishments, whether conducted by the Government or by private enterprise. that the members of this panel, all of who are men of standing in their own profession-man y possess specialized skill in cost accounting, which is a particular branch of accountancy-wil l examine the present checks which the Government is to be inadequate, they will be at liberty to suggest alternatives, or improvements, and it will be a responsibility The Governof the Government and of the new Department of Supply to see that machinery for limiting any exploitation of the people is introduced and is working effectively. The Government gives Parliament and the people of Australia the sincere assurance that action will be taken to restrict any attempt to make What is virtually blood money out of defence preparations of the Commonsibility of the Government, which will be answerable to this House and to the people of the Commonwealth if they do not approve of what is done in that regard. necessary provision in the bill? Government can effectively accept that responsibility. Under the Practically every speaker has stressed the desirability of making proper provicould rapidly bo sion for adequate supplies of oil fuel and other fuels-ha s stressed the encouragement and development of that particular phase of our requirements. The Government can withstand any charge of either negligence in the past or lack of appreciation of the urgency of this problem so far as the future is concerned. It has made financial provisioni n the past in respect of operations designed to discover oil in this country; it has kept functioning a permanent body-the Q-il Advisory Committee-to advise it on matters relating to oil supplies'; and it has the standing committee on liquid fuels, whose particular task is to give advice in respect of substitutes for petroleivm products. In addition, on the defence side more particularly, there is functioning at the present time an oil sub-committee of the Principal Supply Officers Committee, and It is intended a further sub-commritotee of that committee which is concerned with ma tters of storage and of rationing for defence needs. Consequently, adequate machinery is in existence to deal with this particular subject.",42,Cameron No R Should Other Grounds Upon Which I Should Be

196,Mr Holt,"No authority except theThen there are the preparations which are going ahead for the production of oil from shale at Newnes. I deplore, on behalf of the Government, suggestions made earlier in ' this debate questioning the bona fides of those who are conducting that particular' enterprise. It has been suggested that, in effect, the undertion levelled against them that they have taking at Newnes is possibly only a "" blind "" or a "" cover-up "" for some of the big oil companies, and that the sincerity of the undertaking given by those in charge of the enterprise to produce oil fuel from shale within a reasonable time is open to question. I give an emphatic denial to any such suggestion. At the present time, 403 men are working at Newnes on this project, and 150 additional men are working on the improvement of tbe road from Capea-tee bo tlie Newnes field. Plant which could not be obtained in Australia has been ordered abroad, and a considerable quantity of plant is also being manufactured locally. 1 pay tribute to the public-spiritedness of the gentlemen in charge of the enterprise, who have invested £166,000 in a highly speculative undertaking. In addition, as honourable members are aware, the agreement contains a penalty clause which provides that, failing production by the 1st January of next year, .a penalty may be imposed amounting to one-tenth of the capital invested. Mr .BEASLEY -Penalties may waived, as was the case with the last syndicate. of this Parliament. On all sides there have been suggestions ranging from bold statement to sly innuendo that .allegedly sinister influences are retarding the development of the oil industry in the Commonwealth. "" alleged "" in them. that there is some gigantic conspiracy, in which are involved not only the oil companies but also the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments, many of whom are either composed of or arc controlled. by members of the same political colour as honourable members opposite? In tbe States of Tasmania, Queensland and Victoria, all of which have been mentioned as possible fields for the production of considerable quantities of oil, there are either Labour governments or, as is the case in Victoria^ a government subject to considerable pressure by Labour members. Is it suggested that there is a gigantic conspiracy in which they are involved, or is the accusabeen either dilatory or negligent in respect of this particular matter? One other matter upon which I desire to touch I should not have regarded seriously had it not been raised by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), who led the debate for tbe Opposition. He suggested that, in the acquirement of goods for defence and other governmental purposes, the present administration is influenced by an inferiority complex, and that apparently, in its view, the Australian-made article does not meet our requirements, either on account of its quality or from some other cause, with the result that to a far greater degree than is necessary we are going outside the Commonwealth for our supplies. With every respect for. the honourable gentleman, and a proper appreciation of the very able and informative speech that he made, I suggest that that is one accusation which he cannot substantiate. As was pointed out by the Minister for Defence, at least 82 per cent. of our total defence expenditure is be to be incurred within the Commonwealth. If the honourable gentleman cares to make a tour of inspection of the Government establishments at Maribyrnong and Footscray, I believe that he will regard as a revelation the degree to which resources for our self-containment and security are being developed. The degree to which we have been able to produce goods which in the past we deemed to be completely outside either our mechanical or our productive resources, is one of the most remarkable features of the post-depression period. I point not only to the manufacture of our own munitions requirements, not only to the arrangements with the Britisn Government for the manufacture of aircraft that will be returned to Great Britain to help to meet the requirements of that Government, but also to the encouragement that is being given to the establishment of such important industries as the new tinned plate industry, which has been",43,Cameron No R Should Other Grounds Upon Which I Should Be

PerhapsI may here pause for a moment to review the criticism, not only ujrmeasured but also, I suggest, irresponsible, which has been levelled at what is popularly known as "" big business "" in this country. It is rather an extraordinary characteristic of some aspects of Australian politics that, whilst success in any other profession or calling in life, even that of politics, evokes a certain degree of admiration and respect, success in a commercial or business sphere inspires the wildest, most flagrant expression of suspicion. In this matter we might not only exercise some measure of restraint, but also give credit where credit is due. In one breath honourable members like the honourable member for West Sydney accuse the Government of not developing industries sufficiently, and in the next breath, roundly and utterly condemn those men who at this very moment are making a splendid job of the development of the secondary industries of this country. Some recognition should be accorded to those leaders of industry, many of whom are now making their expert services available to the Government voluntarily and in an entirely honorary capacity. The only other point, on which I desire to touch is that which relates to the making of surveys of our material resources. Some honourable members have affirmed that, whereas it is apparently the intention of the Government to attach to the National RegisterB ill a schedule setting out in detail the information to he sought, no such provision is made in this measure. reasons for that, which doubtless will be given to the House in considerable detail during the committee stage. I now give to the House the assurance that -the Government has every intention to exercise fully the power to bo given to the new [8.45] -The Assistant Minister( Mr. department in this regard. I could proH o l t ) carefully mentioned many matters duce for the inspection of honourable not dealt with in the bill, but studiously members a printed questionnaire which avoided consideration of the many evil has already gone out to secondary induseffects thai must flow from the measure. tries. Whilst in a survey of this kind it Many Australians will be much dismay be found desirable to send out a appointed ami shocked when they f u l l y questionnaire to different industries, and realize the nature of the defence policy of we may require to touch on different aspects in respect of those industries, it may not be considered necessary to seek information from every establishment registered as a factory. I understand that there are in the Commonwealth about 25,000 registered establishments which, technically, come under the heading of "" factories "". The elimination of those that employ no more than four hands would reduce the number to about 12,000. Therefore, it may ""be found that the questionnaire need not be sent to more than a relatively limited number of industrial establishments. One reason why it has been found necessary to take this power is that the response to the questionnaire already sent out has been very disappointing; only about one-third of those sent out were returned in any degree of completion, and even those are on the average about 40 per cent, incomplete. Therefore, in order to obtain a proper survey of the material resources essential for the planning of reserves and, if necessary, the substitution of some materials for others that we now have to import, such information must be. obtained. In conclusion, I point out to the House that the objects underlying the introduction of this measure are, first, to improve the administrative machinery dealing with our defence preparedness; and secondly, to plan ahead, not only for the possible future defence requirements of tliis country, but also for its proper development, insofar as it will, by its passage, advance that development and promote our security, it is f a i r l y entitled to the approval and the commendation of members of all parties. I u that spirit, and in the confident belief There are very good that, such will he the result of the operation of the measure, if agreed to, I commend it to the consideration of honourable members. the Government as expressed in this bill.

200,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"with, regard to defence, or a careful tabulais now -proposing that Australia shall tion of our resources so that they may be put to the best possible use; but why is it considered necessary at this stage of our history to pass a bill of this kind ? Almost daily, Ministers and members generally express abhorrence concerning the undemocratic form of government obtaining in countries ruled by dictators, and suggest that Australia, at least, should adhere tenaciously to the principles of democracy, and not permit them to be undermined. Coupled with the proposed national register and the Crimes Act, the legislation, now under discussion is reminiscent of conditions experienced in this country twenty years ago which rendered necessary the passage of the War Precautions Act The first great exception that I take to this bill is that it is proposed to hand over to private enterprise the manufacture of arms and ammunition for sale and profit. This is a complete reversal of the policy advocated by the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Casey) when be held the position of Treasurer, and is contrary to the people's wishes. The Government now proposes to provide £1,000,000 tp assist private manufacturers IO extend their works so that they may increase their profits by the manufacture and sale of munitions. The Ministei repeatedly said that he was opposed to private enterprise having anything to do with this work. He stated that, although the Government should not compete with private enterprise in ordinary commercial spheres, private factories should not be permitted to engage in the manufacture of arms and munitions for profit. Yet this bill is designed to assist private enterprise to turn Australia into a depot for the supply to countries bordering the Pacific of death-dealing instruments. Scores of books fresh from the press contain sworn evidence collected by royal commissions and at other governmental inquiries condemning the manufacture of arms and munitions by private enterprise because it is generally recognized that the profit made in this trade is one of the greatest incentives to war. This Government boasts of a desire to uphold the democratic ideals of the people of Australia, and pretends to hate the warlike methods of dictatorship countries, yet it Mr HoUoioap. compete with other countries in the private manufacture of death-dealing instruments. The people have never been consulted by referendum on this matter. If their opinion were sought it would be shown that they are strongly opposed to this country being thrown into the very cockpit of war. Under the bill, private manufacturers will not only be given contracts for the manufacture of munitions, and a government subsidy of £1,000,000 to encourage them to tender for this work, but they Will also have the free use of departmental blue prints and the services of experts now 'in the employment of the Government. During the Great War it was found necessary to give contracts for the supply of clothing and other equipment required by our troops to government factories, and these supplied the necessary goods at half the prices that private manufacturers had been charging. We have been told that tbe annexes to private factories will be used only in war time. I desire to know whether we are now living under peace or war conditions. in the annexes is not now being used. that already that great octopus) the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, has been engaged in the manufacture of shells for the Defence Departmenti Last week we were informed that the price charged for shells made by this company was so exorbitant that the company was ashamed to take the money. Mr Iloi/r -That is a distortion of what was said. company return 7s. in respect of each shell supplied? This was done because it realized that within a week or two the whole world would have known that the price charged was too high. Therefore the company cut tbe ground from under the feet of the Government by returning a portion of its excess profit. Highly-paid accountants; some of whom receive salaries up to £5,000 a year, are employed by the firms engaged in the manufacture of arms and munitions. The Government, apart from advancing a",45,Cameron No R Should Other Grounds Upon Which I Should Be

203,Mr Holloway,"Why then did thelarge sum of money to assist in the financing of private manufacturers ""who desire to extend their equipment, proposes in this bill to establish an advisory panel for the purpose of indicating to the department the quantity of arms and equipment that should be produced, where they should be made, and the prices that should be charged for them, and these same men will be the tenderers themselves; they will be defendant, jury and judge. Scores of inspectors, probably paid high, salaries, will be needed to measure the sleeves and legs of every pair of trousers needed by our troops to mate sure that private manufacturers do not rob the Government. make sure that measurements are not skimped and that the right classes of materials are used. Government factories for the manufacture of clothing and munitions and other defence equipment have shown in the past that they are quite capable of meeting the defence requirements of Australia. It would have been an easy matter to double the number of persons employed in government workshops, and it would have been of advantage to the people, because the goods needed could have been produced at a much lower price than will be charged by private manufacturers. We have been told that it is necessary to assist private manufacturers to establish annexes to their factories, because they may prove to be white elephants; but we know enough about the methods of private manufacturers to be sure that expenditure involved in extensions to existing plant will be taken into consideration in determining the cost, of production in connection with all government contracts and that they will safeguard themselves against white elephants at. the people's cost. For twenty years, owing to constitutional barriers, valuable plant in government factories has been lying practically idle, or machinery has heen dismantled and disposed of, because all work done in these factories must be carried out exclusively There have been resolutions of chambers of manufactures, deputations to Ministers, and test cases before the High Court in an attempt to.prove that a breach of the Constitution was taking place. When the Commonwealth Clothing Factory sought to keep its machines in working order and its staff available by making uniforms for policemen, the chamber of manufactures, aided by a sympathetic government, asked the High Court to determine whether the making of a policeman's uniform could be described as a military operation. The decision of the High Court prevented that establishment from making police uniforms. The fault for our unpreparedness lies with the Government because of its policy of protecting private enterprise. An anti-Labour government gave away the woollen mills, and allowed private enterI t will be necessary to prise to increase its profits. The mills were taken over by an organization of returned soldiers and ever since then have successfully competed with other concerns. Those mills could have been retained by the Government to make uniforms for members of the naval, military and air forces. Similar action was taken with respect to the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. That establishment should still be in the hands of the Government, as it could have been had the Government been allowed to undertake such work as the making of a few boilers and machine parts for semi-government institutions, even if not directly for defence purposes. Governments with the outlook of the present administration, which ought to have known the trend of world affairs, and the need to be prepared, cared only that private enterprise should continue to make profits. Even in time of war private enterprise is sacrosanct! an out-and-out socialist. that. My first objection to this measure is that it is opposed to all the ideals and principles for which we have fought for 20 or 30 years. I never thought to see the day when private enterprise would be allowed to make profits for the manufacture of armaments and munitions in Australia. Many citizens of this country will be disgusted for defence purposes. at the compromise with principle which would not have been thought possible twelve months ago. Another objection to this bill has been anticipated by the Minister. He can sense the opposition to the bill as it-",46,Cameron No R Should Other Grounds Upon Which I Should Be

205,Mr Holloway,"I do not denystands. In its original form the bill made it possible for wages boards determinations and agreements to be set aside. tention of that, and the honourable member knows it. The bill contains wide powers enabling the Minister to do many things by regulation. This legislation is to remain in force for five years. Those years maybe peaceful, but before they have passed all of tbe economic advance of the last twenty years may have been destroyed. Even if the bill contained no other objectionable feature, I , and I believe every other member on this side of the House, would be justified in voting against it because of the danger of interference with existing standards. The Minister has distributed amendments designed to meet the objection to which 1. have referred. It is true that they will remove some of the objections to the clause. Bourke( Mr Blackburn) has drafted an amendment which will safeguard the wages and working conditions of the artisans and labourers who will be conscripted under regulations declaring certain factories and workshops to be factories established for, or in relation to, the provision or supply of munitions. If it be true, as the Assistant Minister said, that there is no intention to interfere with existing awards, the Government should accept the amendment of the honourable member for Bourke. .Should it do so, the Opposition's attitude towards the bill may be different. As honourable members know, there is at the present time a strike of workers at Darwin. Although number? of men hav» been sent there to take the place of the strikers, so far they have not done so; but unless tbe Government exercises some common sense, the whole of the works at Darwin are likely to be held up. The Northern Standard, published at Darwin on tbe 12th May, contains the following paragraph :Evidence of tlie tactics being adopted by democratic people. Tho Labour party's tlie contractors is given in a letter Mr Willdefence programme includesprovision inott sent to the Works Director( Mr Stodfor a national survey of all industries in dart).

The material would then be subject to protection in the event of the dispute being extended. This group of contractors in Darwin recently reduced the wages of the workers by 16s. 3d. a week. When the men resented the reduction of their pay, the contractors referred to suggested that the Commonwealth Government should declare the materials required by them to be war materials. win not working under award conditions? should tell the whole story. suggested that I have told only half the story, I shall relate the facts leading up to the present upheaval.

Every decent employer in Darwin paid his employees at the. higher rates, but when this group of contractors obtained big government contracts they went back to the old award which was fixed in depressiontimes. brought up to date. contractors may be justified on legal grounds, hut certainly not on moral grounds. My second objection to the bill is that it. leaves too much to be done by regulation. The secret star-chamber methods for which we blame Germany and Italy pre not. acceptable to the Opposition. The Prime Minister tells the members of the Millions Club that we must defend our democracy, yet in this measure his Government proposes to act along the lines followed by dictator countries.

The contention that we must work along the lines of the dictatorships in Germany, It a l y and elsewhere, is an admission that we have lost f a it h in democracy. Under this bill the Governor General may make regulations. means that regulations w ill , in fact, be made by the Government, the Governor General merely signing what the Government desires. Regulations become law as soon as made. law until Parliament has an opportunity to consider them. bers know how easy it is to miss tlie significance of regulations which are laid on the table of the Blouse. Frequently the time for disallowance expires before honourable members are alive to the danger. Government by regulation is not democratic. the evil features to which I have referred, it represents legislation decades behind present-day thought. ""It lets loose again the lust, for profit from the making of armaments.* Many of us did not think that Australia would ever be made a cockpit of wars. In the future, Australia is to manufacture munitions, arms and gas appliances to standard patterns, thereby offering an enticement to foreign vessels to replenish their supplies in this country. Australia, which was supposed to be an outpost of the Empire which with all the world, is, almost overnight, engaging in warlike activities, and its people are being brought almost to a state of hysteria by reports of wars and rumours of war. People whose principles are opposed to legislation of this kind are almost forced to swallow their convictions. We must ask ourselves whether these things shall continue for' ever; whether under coercion we are to accept the things that wo hate. We are told that an enemy is knocking at our doors. I do not believe that that is so, nor do I agree that this legislation is necessary. Australia is not likely to be attacked unless its people so f a r forget their manners as to insult the peoples of other nations. In committee I intend to urge the adoption of the amendment which will be proposed by the honourable member for Bourke, which aims at testing the Minister's statement that the conditions of the working people of Australia w ill be safeguarded, and that people will not be dragooned by regulaThat tions into workshops for the purpose of munition or armament manufacture when wages and conditions built up over years are to be suspended. If the Government hasno desire to cut wages or to take away any of the p r i v ileges which the workers now hold dear, then it should have no objection to accepting the amendment which will be moved by the honourable member for Bourke. If it declines to accept that amendment, I hope every member of the Opposition w ill vote against this measure, lock, stock and barrel. There is much in this bill which commends itself to me. Some of its general Because this bill contains principles will, I have no doubt, be approved by the majority of honourable members, 'but at the same time, there is much in the measure which is vague, unexplained and undefined. I do not agree with the contentions of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr. Holloway) who speaks of "" imaginary "" enemies. Let him tell the Albanians, the Abyssinians, or the Chinese, of imaginary enemies. We .cannot live in isolation; we are part of the world, part of an Empire, and we must be realistic and face facts. Insofar as this measure will improve the would carry on peacefully position in respect of supplies of the Defence Department, I applaud it, because there has been a deplorable lag in that respect. The Minister for Defence( Mr Street) admitted, in reply to a question which I asked, without notice, this afternoon, that the department had not overtaken the supply of uniforms for volunteers in the militia forces. Our army is a small one, its f u l l strength is only 70,000, and about half of that number have been enlisted within the last six months; yet we have not been able to supply all of those volunteers with uniforms, despite tbe fact that the enlistment campaign has been in progress since September last.

It is a fact that certain units have gone to casual camps without uniforms, and when in camp were issued with working clothes, boots and greatcoats, which were taken from them when they left camp. Months have passed since they enthusiastically came forward to enlist, but these men are still without uniforms, and even now attend Saturday afternoon and night parades in such circumstances. If my statement is challenged, I can cite the units and specific instances which I have our forces on that occasion. in mind, but the Minister admitted suffifirst division was fully equipped and cient in his reply to my question this afternoon to prove that the department has been guilty of an omission in this respect.

I submit that the failure of the department shows that there has been absolute inefficiency on its part. The department did the job very well in clothing the Australian Imperial Force in 1914. It did not have two years to clothe The sailed in a matter of a few weeks. I recall that my own unit was fully clothed and equipped in a fortnight, sion did not take over the civilian factories in order to do so.

I suggest that the manufacturers of boots and clothing could be called in and asked to put forward their proposals and quotes .on a mass basis, and tbe department could then place its orders quickly or call for three quotes, as materials to those annexes? After all, was its practice at one time. In fact, whenever purchases are made without calling tenders, three quotes should always be obtained, a procedure not always carried out. very well look into that suggestion. I feel cerned, and the whole power of pricesure that by acting in that direction he could effect greater savings to the taxpayers and bring about greater efiiciency in his department. In the hope that it will tend towards greater efficiency and more rapid development, I intend to support this measure on general principles, out I hope that the Minister for Supply and Development will apply his ability to the the development of the Commonwealth. If his department is merely to be one to which surplus officials who have been recruited by the National Insurance Commission are to be transferred, the proposal will not bear examination. The former Treasurer, who has now been transferred to the Department of Supply and Development, was previously Minister in charge of Development. In this new department a great field awaits him, and if he applies himself to the task, in which he will have the full support of Parliament, he"" can bring about the development which is needed in this country. We are on the threshold of great new industries, such as the manufacture of motor cars and aircraft and ship-building. These industries can be undertaken on a large scale. Another aspect which tbe Minister should bear in mind is the decentralization of these industries. these powers, however, he should be careful that he does not put power into the hands of vested interests in a way which will re-act detrimentally on the taxpayer. We have his assurance that a careful survey will be made of expenditure and prices-it may be a pious but simply point out that there may be promise that may prove futile-bu t there some merit in the fact that Australian is nothing definite in the measure to steel is cheaper than British steel. But ensure that profits will be carefully what about other materials, such as explored. We are told that the annexes, copper, zinc, and tin?

But what of the people who will supply the raw very little profiteering exists where competition is encouraged. There is very little exploitation among the smaller manufacturers, but there is too much The Minister could exploitation where monopolies are conmaking may very well fall into the hands of a ring, with the result that the public is exploited, and an unnecessary burden is placed on the taxpayers. The profiteer is of a type that no one can admire. There can be no doubt that we have profiteers in our midst. They are a product of the last war and are powerful to-day. The American poet, Alan Seegar, who was killed in France, wrote of themThose who watched how the battle veered Waited, profited, trembled, cheered. We have the profiteers with us to-day, and we should not wait until war is declared before we take steps to check up on profits. 'To-day we are piling up stores of shells and munitions, as we would also be if war were declared,' yet certain essential materials for the manufacture of war requirements are in monopolistic hands. The BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited has been attacked at length in this debate, and there may be some merit in the arguments used against that concern, but I point out that that company supplies steel to Australian users at a cheaper price than British manufacturers of ""steel supply that commodity to British users. Prices of steel in Great Britain are fixed by a cartel which controls the prices of that commodity, not only in Great Britain, but In asking for all of also on the Continent.

232,Mr White,"I do not suggest that,present copper, which is one of the components of brass, is loaded with fictitious costs. Does the Minister consider it f a i r that copper mined in Australia is sold to the public, and I presume to the Government, at a price equivalent to the cost of exporting it to B r it a in and re-importing it plus exchange? honourable member will let me check his figures. the war period the prices in Australia moved up and down as the prices fluctuated overseas and when the Australian pound depreciated by 30^ per cent, before it was pegged at 25 per cent., as it is at present, Australian prices moved up almost simultaneously by 30^ per cent. There may be some merit in this being done, but I suggest there can be very little. The Tariff Board condones this practice in respect of certain supplies, but it is definitely a loading against secondary industries in Australia. Copper isone of the essential ingredients of brass which the manufacture of munitions. the Government satisfied with these prices as a basis on which contractors shall supply materials to the annexes? If it is not satisfied on that point it should provide specifically in this measure to check profiteering. I shall now quote the prices to which I have referred, prices for which the Ministerf o r Defence has asked and about which I think the Ministerf or Supply and Development knows somethingThe price/s quoted is/are based on a price of electrolytic copper wire bars of £53 15s. per ton, made up of the London market price of £43 per ton, as issued by the Australian Mines and Metals Association, plus the bank buying telegraphic transfer Tate of exchange, Australia on London, of 25 per cent., and is to be varied up or down by one-tenth of a penny per lb. for every complete £1 or part thereof by which the price of electrolytic copper wire bars, as issued by the Australian Mines and Metals Association, plus the bank buying telegraphic transfer rate of exchange, Australia on London, on the day of receipt of order by us, is greater than £53 10s. l i d . not join our fighting forces can serve in per ton, or less than £53 per ton respectively. Is tbe Government to be satisfied with that? Zinc is used in making brass which is employed in the manufacture of cartridge cases and small arms. Sheet brass which is rolled in the munition works at Maribyrnong is used extensively in the manufacture of shell cases. Here is an opportunity for the Government to display some activity. I should not have mentioned this subject but for the attitude which the Government has adopted in omitting specific methods of dealing with excess profits, though it declares its anxiety to do so. The Minister should ascertain whether undue profits are being made by manufacturers. who are shareholders? the directors of this company, two of whom are on the industrial panel, are profiteers. They may be conducting their businesses in a legitimate manner, and the profits they make may be moderate and reasonable; but this is definitely a matter which should be investigated and I now suggest a way in which it can be handled. It is anticipated that the profits allowed to those manufacturing in annexes shall be about 4 per cent., which is so extensively used in is a f a i r return on the capital and labour Is invested, and equivalent to the rate of interest paid on government bonds. In some businesses where energy, enterprise and effort have to be displayed, a profit of even 6 per cent, may be fair . That profit is allowed even in Germany where industry is socialized. I do not think there is much that we can copy in that country, and I believe that £ have said sufficient on previous occasions to show how I abhor the German form of government. no good to General Motors-Holden's Limited. which tbe direqtors and shareholders of these companies can show their practical patriotism.

Nevertheless, there are men in this chamber who are little Hitlersi n their hearts. What is the immediate trouble before us? We are told that Germany wants Danzig. What an astonishing thing! There they are again, we are told, .after some other country's territory. Every schoolboy of sixteen knows that the small, free city of Danzig was previously held by Germany. Under the Treaty of Versailles, a corridor was pushed through from Poland to the sea between East and West Prussia, and Danzig was made a free port for Poland. Poland has a comparatively small population, and it is unreasonable to suppose that the Poles would threaten Germany. part, I do not believe that they are .going to do anything of -the kind.

It is not imposPart of Herr Hitler's last speech was cabled to this country, but some essential parts were not. In a portion, which was not cabled to Australia, Hitle r made the following proposals to Poland :1. Danzig returns as a Free State into the framework of the German Reich. 2. Germany receives a route through the Corridor and a railway line at her own disposal, possession the same extra-territorial status for Germany as the Corridor has for Poland. This is to have a right-of-way to East Prussia. As a matter of fact, the majority of the people in Danzig are Germans and Nazis, who favour reunion with Germany. Whether we like it or not, we must con.cede that the people of any country have the right to determine what kindf of government they want. given that right? visited Czechoslovakia as a peacemaker, reported that the Germansi n that country were suffering many grave injustices.

We see, therefore, that Poland has really no right to this territory, and it is absurd to suggest that Poland has the right, against all sense of justice, to drag Britain into a war in which Britain would have no chance of success. I do not think for a moment that Mr tralia, indicates that the new department Chamberlain will embark upon a war in which Britain must inevitably be defeated. Now let me quote another authority, no less a one than the honourable member for Barker, who has been freely interjecting. He is reported in the Bulletin as follows:The change in Britain's foreign policy was the theme of Mr Cameron's contribution to the debate. grievances against Poland "", and he asked "" whether a move by Germany to have its grievances redressed is something upon which British lives and money should be squandered "". Going further, he said, "" The present British alliances do not comply with the three main principles which should govern all alliances: community of interests, identity of objects, geographical and strategical ability to render mutual a i d "" . Where are the community of interests and identity of objects so far as Russia is Rumania and Poland, where are the geographical and strategical considerations which would make it possible for the allied it about this gross extravagance in countries to assist each other? could Britain send troops to Poland? Nobody answered the member for Barker, probably because nobody could answer him.

[ cannot imagine that Poland would be foolish enough to court national disaster in that way. Nevertheless, Britain may go to war as an ally of Poland over Danzig; and if that happens, is Australia to be involved? The Minister for External Affairs( Sir Henry Gullett) disagrees with the honourable member for Barker in regard to this matter. He says that Australia would not necessarily be at war if Great Britain were at war. The latter part of the title of the bill which relates to the survey, registration and development of the resources of Auswill undertake inquiries which could well be undertaken by the States through their existing departments and machinery. We know from experience what the setting up of a new department involves. Outside of those European countries which are on the brink of war, this country stands out as having lost its head more than have any others in its war preparations. It is proposed Germany, he stated, has "" j u s t that no less than £23,000,000 shall be expended this year on war preparations. Every pound unnecessarily spent on defence is taken out of the mouths of the unemployed men and their 'wives and children. 'Social services in this country have been sadly neglected.

I am not opposed to expenditure for necessary defence, but I am not prepared to cast my vote in favour of a measure which will enable private armament manufacturers to amass vast riches and to dominate the legislature of this country at the expense of the social security of the people generally.

I u his second reading speech on this bill, the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr -Casey) saidConsiderable thought has been given in many countries to the limitation of armament profits. Measures for the taxation of excess profits have been drafted and passed in various forms to meet the position-but , so far as I .inn aware, in no .instance, have they been really successful in operation. Such a method -of attacking tlie problem may be described as shutting the stable door after the horse has been stolen. For the time being at least, the Government proposes to attack the problem from what it believes to be the more logical point of view-to ensure that only the most reasonable profits are made from the business of munition manufacture. We have reason to believe that we shall have wide co-operation in our endeavours.

In November -of the same year a further interim divi-dend of 6J per cent, was declared, and, least in a state of warlike tension which .according to the latest report which I favours the constant increase of armaments. have been able to obtain, a further dividend of 6J per cent, was declared in June, 1937. Soi t will be seen that Yet that recently the company has been declaring annual dividends of 12-J per cent. If the business of the company is such as to enable it to declare such high dividends in norma] times, what huge profits the company will make if ilt be given an opportunity to manufacture war materials can be imagined. Yet honourable members opposite are opposed to -trusting State governments with .the manufacture of muuitions in their own establishments. Here we have a clinging to the old ideas of former administrations that governments should not engage in manufacturing operations because by doing so they deny private manufacturers of opportunities for exploitation. Isi t not true that following the sale of the Geelong Woollen Mills, which had been established by the Fisher GovernHill Proprietary Company -a corresponding increase of the price D i d we have -,a similar experience of Hill Proprietary Company who, in a country whose granaries are B y commend them to read George Seldes' It is has never been denied. It must be admitted that this armament industry is interested, if not in actual war, at This Government is endeavouring to create an atmosphere of war so that, in this country, the expenditure on armaments may be increased without question. Mr Bonar Law, the famous English statesman, said in the House of Commons in 1924 that £104,000,000 had been paid to ship-owners between the 4th August, 1914, and Armistice Day, 1918, for ships which £01,000,000. remind honourable members, at a time when the workmen of the Empire were being called upon to lay down their lives to preserve what they understood to be their liberty. As a matter of fact, the nation was being sand-bagged, in the name of patriotism, by armament gangs. Mr Bonar Law also said on the 24th May, 1917, that a ship of 8,000 tons, sunk that year, had involved the government, in an expenditure of £150,000, although its original cost was only £40,000. He added that the ship-owners had made a profit of £350,000,000 between 4th August, 1914, and January, .1937. Mr Bonar Law also had sufficient courage to declare:I have some interest in ships. For every £.100 I put in I received last year £47, after all taxes, including excess profits tax, had been paid. I shall give some other instances to show that armament manufacturers are regardless of all decency. A general of the American army invented a disappearing gun-carriage, which, had it been retained for the nation, would have given the Americans a superiority over every potential foe. But the invention was immediately taken over by a firm whose president is one of America's noblest patriots, and the rights were sold to all foreign governments, which now are able to use the equipment in the killing of American sailors and soldiers. All this is done in the name of patriotism! The marvellous French gun known as the -"" 75 "" was taken to the Putiloff works, in Russia, where engineers from Krupps' works were working side by side with British and French engineers. Of course, they learned all the secrets of this famous gun and made them known to their compatriots. The good old British firm of Vickers Limited helped to arm the Turks immediately before tbe war, and the Mr Green. Turks used British armaments almost exclusively in killing and wounding Australian and New Zealand troops at Gallipoli. These, let us remind ourselves, were the ANZACs whom we revere. Basil Zaharoff, a Turk of Greek parentage, presented a submarine to the Greek nation, On the day on which the submarine was put into commission. had cost, originally, only Zaharoff took a steamer across the Aegean This occurred, let me Sea, landed at Constantinople, the home of the enemy, pointed out the danger in the submarine, and then sent an order for two similar submarines to TorstenV i l li elm Nordenfeldt, who was operating a small factory in England. Zarahoffand we must be fair to him-ha s contributed largely to the funds of many patriotic societies. And so the awful game goes on. In spite of all these facts, this Government is proposing to permit private enterprise to manufacture munitions. We face the gravest danger if we allow even £1 of public money to be expended in purchasing munitions of war from private companies. God knows the experience of other nations in this regard has been bitter! I trust that the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Casey) will move slowly in this regard. He ought to utilize to the very fullest extent all State instrumentalities capable of producing essential munitions, and he ought also to take immediate steps to enlarge existing Commonwealth factories which produce munitions. I believe that we are spending a great deal too much money on munitions. The tension in respect of Poland has lessened. We are told now that less likelihood of war exists in that quarter. Where is war likely to occur? Who are our potential enemies? No one cares to say. Will it be suggested that Italy and Germany are likely to assail us? Surely they have sufficient troubles to cope with already. Is France a potential enemy? Perhaps some honourable member will mention Japan. When I was Minister for Defence in the Scullin Government, I was told that Japan was the only nation in the world that was at all likely to attack Australia, and that the danger from that quarter was slight. Whatever feelings Japan may have towards Australia to-day, all honourable memberswill agree that it has trouble enough at its own door. that the Japanese people wish to attack Australia or that Japan has ever intended to invade our shores. I was informed definitely, while I was Ministerf o r Defence, that that policy would be f u t i l e because in the six months that would be required for adequate preparations all the world would learn of any warlike intentions. It is true that an attack could be launched in these days in a much shorter time, but how many points could be attacked? Sydney Harbour could be shelled. B n t steps have been taken to meet any such emergency. Are the democratic nations of the world likely to fight us? It seems to me that our greatest danger is from the munitions manufacturers. We know very well how the moneyed interests behind the munition manufacturing enterprises are willing to do almost anything for profit. The private banking institutions of this country contributed £250,000 to defeat the campaign Government for the improvement of the banking and of Australia.. They poured out their treasure to halt democratic advances.

The Government of New Zealand has not dreamt of any expenditure of this magnitude, nor, for that matter, has the Government of Canada. Africa will not entertain any such proposals. We ought to be following their good example. Question resolved in the aflirmative. B ill read a second time. In corrvmittee: Clauses1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3This act is divided into parts, as follows:PartI -Preliminary . Part II -Administration . Part III -Miscellaneous . Supply and Development) [10.19] I move That after "" Part II -Administration. "" insert "" Part IIA -Aircraft Assembly."". Since this bill was introduced the I do not believe Government has made further investigations of the organization of aircraft assembling, w i th the result that it now is able to introduce a number of additional clauses to set out in greater detail its intentions concerning the creation of an aircraft manufacturing authority. The amendment puts into the list of parts of the bill this new part 2a, which is merely descriptive of the part which I shall introduce by amendment at a later stage. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause4 (Definitions). I raise the point to which I referred to in the debate this afternoon. "" Time of war "" is defined as meaning-any time during which a state of war exists, and includes the time between the issue of a proclamation of the existence of war or danger thereof and the issue of a proclamation declaring that the war or danger thereof launched by the Scullin declared in the prior proclamation no longer exists. monetary system That is based upon the definition in the Defence Act, but I point out to the committee that this b i ll does not exactly bitterly resent the tremendous follow the scheme of that act. In the first place, the definition of "" time of w a r "" in the Defence Act, uses the word "" actually "" before the word "" exists "" . Secondly, the Defence Act defines "" war "" as meaningany invasion or apprehended invasion of, or attack or apprehended attack on, the Commonwealth or any territory under the control of the Commonwealth by an enemy or armed The Government of South force. It is very material, because before the Governor General can proclaim that a war exists, he must be satisfied that there is in fact a war. There is no such definition in this bill. As this clause is drawn, it would be quite sufficient for a war to exist between B r it a in and some other country without Australia being in any way involved, endangered, or affected for the "" t i m e of w a r "" provisions to be proclaimed. Under, tbe Defence Act, the Governor General cannot proclaim that a state of war actually exists unless his advisers are satisfied that there is "" any invasion or apprehended invasion of, or attack or apprehended attack o n "" this country. I suggest that the omission of a definition of "" w a r "" from this bill",56,Cameron No R Should Other Grounds Upon Which I Should Be
257,Mr Casey (Corio,Minister for,59,Cameron No R Should Other Grounds Upon Which I Should Be
258,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [10.20].,"would enable its provisions to be brought into operation merely because B r it a in was at war without Australia being in danger or being involved in war. Assuming that a European war was in progress without Australia being in any way involved, a state of Avar could be proclaimed here, and the "" time of war "" provisions of the measure could be brought into operation. I submit that the limiting definition of "" w a r "" contained in the Defence Act should be incorporated in this bill. amendment without consulting the M in ister for Supply and Development ( Mr Casey), and I should like to hear his views. Supply and' Development) I the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn). stated, the definition "" time of war "" contained in the Defence Act has been lifted almost textually and placed in this bill. There is no definition of "" war "" in this bill, for the good reason that the term "" war "" is not used, except when prefaced by "" time of "". In other words we define that and it appears to be unnecessary to go further. I appreciate that the honourable gentleman fears that in the event of a war remote from Australia opportunity could be taken to proclaim a time of war in Australia, but I do not think that that is practicable. the Minister disclaims any intention to make this legislation apply unless Australia is affected by or is likely to be involved in a war? has no sinister intention. The definition of "" time of war "" in this bill has a broad significance. It might well be that in some unfortunate circumstance a war on the other side of the world would clearly forecast a war in Australia. gentleman says that Australia is in danger of war now. clamation. I propose to say a little about that later. I shall confer with the Government's legal advisers upon the point, taken by the honourable member for Bourke. Meanwhile I suggest that the clause be postponed. Clause postponed. Clause 5(1.)

(2.) The Governor General may from time to time determine the extent to which or the conditions upon which any of the matters specified in this section may be administered by the Department. On the second reading, I pointed out that, the Government had said that it intended to check profiteering in the manufacture of armaments and munitions. That is a laudable object, but so that it may be something more than merely a pious wish, I want to see it in the billProfiteering has happened in the past, and unless there be some definite prohibition, it can happen again. There will be little scope for large-scale profiteering in the annexes, but there w ill be plenty of opportunity for it in connection with the supply of metals and other raw materials that may be in monopolistic hands. In my second-reading speech I showed how the price of copper is loaded with phantom costs of exchange.

There are three main heads, under the first of which are the government workshops. There can be no suggestion of profit in their case, except possibly in respect of the purchase of raw materials. point. it is impossible to select one or two raw materials and make a specific rule in regard to them. I repeat that there can be no question of profits, apart from the purchase of raw materials, in connection with government workshops. Then there are the annexes, in respect of which the maflter of profits is dealt with in the agreement made between the Government and the industry to which each almost all cases, the profit is limited to 4 per cent. The third method . is purchase on tender by the Contracts Board. At the present time, the greater part of the defence requirements is purchased by the board on public tender. During the short existence of this department, the Assistant Minister and I have had numerous conversations with all of the senior officers of the Contracts Board From the evidence placed before me, I believe that the system of contracts militates in itself against the possibility of excessive profits being made. In almost all instances other metal subject to this same condithere is very keen competition. Members of the Contracts Board, particularly the senior members, have through years of association with the problem become very closely acquainted with the prices of raw materials and finished goods, not only in the various capital cities of Australia, but also abroad. I am assured that there is little if any opportunity to make profits in respect of goods purchased by the Contracts Board. The matter of raw materials also is involved. Whenever the Contracts Board notices that a successful tenderer is getting away with what the board believes to be a high price, even though the tender be the lowest submitted, it inquires into the costs man read from a. document, and I shall be on which the tenderer has made up his price.

In ment in order to see whether the privilege of tariff protection has been abused. Raw materials, of course, cover many things besides metals. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) has asked how the price of metals is determined. I think that the case put by him is that; a ton of copper is sold at a price which is, in effect, the London price, plus the exchange between Australian currency and sterling. I understand him to say that there is a limiting factor of £60 odd a, ton for first grade electrolytic copper. I , myself, believe that there is a limiting factor in the price of copper, zinc or any tion. It may well be that a horizon of cost is established in respect of each metal which is, I should imagine, somewhere about the cost of production of that.metal in Australia.

Asf a r back as 1929-32, when the Scullin Government was in office, protective duties were imposed on ladies' lightweight dress materials and lightweight materials for men's suitings, with the result that these goods are now extensively manufactured in Australia, giving employment to about 3,000 operatives. I ask the Minister to make inquiries into the report with a view to obtaining authentic information on the subject, as tbe statement of D r . Clunies Ross is damaging Australian industries.

If not, why? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes, in the course of a speech in Sydney in August, 1934. 2. My Government f u l ly realizes the necessity for the provision of adequate housing for the people. The provision of housing is, of course, the responsibility of the States, but the Commonwealth has always endeavoured to co-operate with the States, subject to constitutional and financial limitations, in the carrying out of their obligations. The total financial assistance to the States for all purposes during the current financial year is estimated to exceed £20,000,000. Any direct assistance to the States for specific provision of housing during recent years would have involved the raising of considerable sums of loan moneys. Owing to the limited amount of loan moneys available for all governments, this would have merely diverted loan moneys from the ordinary developmental programmes of the States with a consequent reduction of employment. In the Commonwealth BankB ill , which was introduced towards the end of last year by the Treasurer and which is now awaiting consideration by Parliament, providing for the establishment of a mortgage bank department in the Commonwealth Bank, provision has been made, inter alia, for the mortgage bank department to be permitted to make loans to societies approved by the Treasurer on the security of a mortgage over land. This provision will enable advances to be made to building societies. In view of the necessity of mobilizing our financial resources for the urgent needs of defence, it is impossible for the Commonwealth to provide further funds foi housing at present. 3.

The Department of Agriculture of the United States of America sent an expedition to Mongolia, Russian Turkestan, and other parts of Asia, in order to collect such grasses. The expedition was successful in obtaining a number which wore subsequently planted in several introduction testing areas in the Unitod States of America. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Beseach has for several years past been in communication with the Department of Agriculture of the United States of Americai n this connection, and that department has furnished seed of a number of promising grasses. They are being grown at Black Mountain, Canberra. The best of these grasses are poor seeders, hut cuttings can be made available at present in limited quantities. Already one of these grasses has given good results in arresting sand drift in the Mallee of South Australia. If the honourable member would like to inspect these. grasses and to obtain further information in regard to them, 1 suggest that he get into direct touch with Dr. Dickson, Chief of the Council's Division of Plant Industry at Canberra. honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) asked the following question, without noticeIs the Prime Minister aware that it is a common and growing practice among employers in Australia in occupations that do not require apprenticeships to discharge young men when approaching adult age, and to engage boys or youths at tow rates of pay to replace them? If he is not aware of it, will he have early inquiries made? If he is aware of it, can he -five the House any information as to the steps, if any, being taken to meet the situation have received permanent appointments. arising from this serious state of affairs? I desire to inform the honourable member that the Commonwealth Government is in communication with the Government of New South Wales in connection with this matter, and that a conference between representatives of the Commonwealth and the States will probably be held in the near future. honourable member for Martin( Mr McCall) asked the following question, without noticeWill the Prime Minister consider the desirability of amending the Public Service Act in order to give permanent employment to returned soldiers who have been temporarily employed for from two to three years? I desire to inform the honourable member that, so far as appointments to nonclerical positions are concerned, returned soldiers under 51 years of age who have given two years' continuous temporary service in such positions are accorded a preference for appointment ,by section 34 9 c of tbe Public Service Act. It is the practice to appoint such returned soldiers in the prescribed order of preference with other returned soldiers, as vacancies oceur, if they are engaged in a class of employment for which permanent positions are created. In regard to clerical positions, appointees to the permanent. staff must demonstrate the possession of educational qualifications of a reasonable standard, and the appointment of persons to such positions solely on length of temporary service without regard to educational qualifications could not be agreed to. Provision already exists for the appointment of returned soldiers who have passed examinations of a lower standard than that applied to other entrants to clerical positions. The existing provisions of the Publie Service Act as to the appointment of returned soldiers are considered to be very reasonable, and the Public Service Board is unable to recommend any further amendment of the act in this connection. The policy as to. preference to returned Boldiers is being very closely observed, and it may be mentioned that within the last two years over 1,000 returned soldiers reply to a question asked by the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Frost), I promised to have inquiries made as to whether any request had been made from",68,Defence Contracts Shell Cases
