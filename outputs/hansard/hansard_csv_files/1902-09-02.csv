A similar mistake occurred in regard to the observance of Easter Saturday. I should like to know how the blunder happened, and what rule is to be adopted by the department in the future ? has inquired into the matter, and has ascertained that the mistake occurred because, while the regulations issued by the Post and Telegraph department make provision for the observance of certain Holidays only, these have been overridden by the determination of the Government that all holidays proclaimed by the Government of any State shall be observed by the Commonwealth officers in that State. The two holidays to which the honourable and learned member for South Australia has referred arc statutory holidays which should have been, and, in future will be, observed by the Past and Telegraph officials in that State. give the men who were compelled to work yesterday another day 1 extended to them ; but I understand that they were kept at work for only two hours.

Whether, since section 98 of the Constitution expressly endows this Parliament with power over State railways in their relations to trade and commerce, the Governmenb will consider the propriety of immediate intervention in this case, where thousands of citizens suffer severe loss and inconvenience through trade being diverted from its natural highway and through the enforcement of special rates on the railways for the carriage of products imported from other States? ber is aware, the preference or discrimination alluded to can be determined only by the Inter-State Commission.

They have the utmost sympathy with the propositi to remove all restrictions on Inter-State free-trade, which can be removed consistently wibh proper regard to the Constitution Act. This removal is now more possible and desirable than originally, because of the smaller amount receivable under section 92. Tbe amount collected under this secbion of bhe Constitution is also rapidly diminishing. Ib only botalled £9,130 for the half-year ending June 30th, 1902. Further, its rapid decrease is indicated by bhe faob thab for July, 1902, it was only £1,126, as follows:New South Wales Vicboria ... Queensland South Australia Tasmania ...

47,Mr Watso N (Bland),"I m o v eany committee of members which will be -satisfactory to the whole of tbe House from tbe variety of points of view that must necessarily be taken into consideration in re.spect to a matter such as this. I have attempted to provide that each State shall have some representation upon the committee, and I have attempted also to -fairly divide tbe committee in the matter -of fiscal opinion so that no undue prefer-ence shall be given to one side or the other in that regard. So far as possible, of course, I submit the names of honourable members, who from other associations have had an -opportunity of hearing or knowing a little -of the subject. I may further say that if the House chooses to adopt the coarse frequently adopted in dealing with motions of this description, the first portion of the motion may be voted upon separately, and -should it be carried the composition of the -committee can be arranged in the usual way. referring the Bill to a select committee, I may in the first place point to the fact that on the last occasion when a similar proposal was made, it was confined principally to the establishment of State iron works. On this occasion I propose that the range of the committee's investigation should be very much wider. -Since that time the debate in committee on the measure has disclosed, to my mind, the necessity for further detailed .information : this has been more emphatically impressed upon honourable members at every stage of the Bill. If it is assumed that the House Or the country is justified in granting bonuses to private individuals, the amount necessary to be set aside for that object must be a matter of moment and a matter for inquiry so far as this House is concerned. To arrive at a correct conclusion in that regard it seems to me that we ought to know first the cheapness as compared with deposits in other countries, with which the iron deposits in Australia can be worked j the ampunt of capital which it will be necessary to invest in the undertaking, and the probability, or otherwise, with the assistance of a bonus, of the industry being carried on without any large amount of duty in the future. All these considerations should be taken into account before we say what bonus, if any, ought to be paid. We cannot in this matter accept ex parte statements. statements from those who are promoting these companies as to the cost of installing' the necessary plant, and I must say that there is a considerable difference of opinion as to what the amount necessary will be. It is, therefore, all the more desirable that we should have evidence, so far as it is obtainable, from all sides of tbe question before accepting the suggestions and statements of those immediately concerned. On the strength of a statement made to me by a gentleman who should know something of the subject, I have myself put forth the statement that £250,000 should be quite sufficient to thoroughly test the iron deposits of Australia. But against that it is slated by tbe Blyth River Company that they wil 1 have to spend £1,000,000 before they can hope to carry the matter through success-fully. In view of the fact that all these statements are made ex parte, and without that criticism which will be afforded by evidence on both sides of this question, it is idle for W it h regard to the main idea of this House to say-eve n if it is granted that bonuses are desirable-ho w much per ton the bonus should be or for how many years it should be maintained. This is one view of the matter which shows the necessity for some such inquiry as I propose. Again, there is the proposition put forward by the section of the House with which I am associated with regard to the establishment of State ironworks. I know that in this connection the Sydney Morning Herald of a few days ago, referring to the motion discussed in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, the other evening, stilted that I had assured the Minister for Trade and Customs that the Premier of New South Wales, Sir John See, knew nothing of the feeling of his own Legislative Assembly in this matter, and thafc I was able to express a more reliable opinion on this subject than himself. I need only recall to honourable members the fact that what I did say was that I did not take the assurances of Sir John See against the establishment of State ironworks as expressing tbe opinion of the people of New South Wales, a very distinctly different, thing from the opinion of the LegislativeAssembly in which Sir John See has the honour to lead a Ministry. This is an aspect of the matter which any such committee as I 'suggest will, if appointed, require to consider. There was a division taken the other evening in the Legislative Assembly of New We bave already a number of South Wales upon the motion dealing with this subject, and, as I anticipated, there was a. considerable majority against the proposal to establish ironworks. The Speaker usually does hot vote, but reckoning the full numbers, and counting pairs, 33 honourable members out of 125 voted for the establishment of State ironworks. stances in which the body of support for a particular proposal has at that stage been much smaller, and yet it has been carried by an overwhelming majority in the Parliament of New South Wales within a couple of years. For my part, therefore, I am quite satisfied with the amount of support such a proposal has received in the New South Wales Parliament, and I feel that there is every reason to believe that, notwithstanding result of the motion recently decided there, once the people of that State have the question thoroughly debated, they will be more than likely to return a majority to the local Parliament pledged to carry this proposition through to its conclusion. same thing may be said for the other States, of which I am not so well able to speak. I may be considered optimistic in taking this view, but I have so frequently seen changes in the personnel of the State Assembly, under pressure from outside, that I am quite prepared to believe that if another Parliament is elected, and if , in the meantime, agitation is carried on in that State for the undertaking of this work by the Government, a majority may be found in favour of the proposal. these points of view I think it is necessary that a committee pointed to report to this House before any further action is taken in tbe matter. Now, as to the question of delay, some of those who opposed the proposal for a committee on the last occasion argued that its only result would be to secure the defeat of the Bill, and to indefinitely postpone tbe consideration of the question. to me that if a select committee is agreed to under these circumstances the members of it should take every reasonable means to arrive ab a report-I mous report, because I do not suppose it is likely, whatever committee is appointed, that we shall get a unanimous report upon such a debatable question as this ; but at any rate they should be able to obtain useful information for the benefit of member's of this House and of tbe other Chamber within a comparatively short period. have, I am sure, quite' a number of gentlemen interested in promoting these Mr Walton. projects, who will be only too. anxious, to give to such a committee every informa-tion as to -what their intentions are, and what their plans amount to. In addition, to that, I am satisfied that we can get eviI know of several indence from people who are not directly interested, but who are yet qualified to speak on the subject and to offer criticism of these proposals. All this , need not take more than a few weeks, even though it should be found necessary to visit one or other of the States in order to secure evidence which may not be obtainable here. all it should be done thoroughly. that a very large proportion of the evidence can be obtained in Melbourne, and at first hand from those directly interested. Of course there are other questions which the committee will require to consider, but in Possibly the any case I at present see no reason why such a committee should nofc be able to report before we adjourn. So far as I am concerned, even if ifc were found necessary to extend the inquiry wifch a view fco having some deLegislative cided action taken, I should still consider fchis the proper course fco adopt in view of all the circumstances. There is another matter to which, if in order, I fchink I am justified in referring.

These honourable members acknowledge that fact freely ; and all honour to them. And their honour I hope will induce them to refrain from voting for a proposition with which they do not entirely agree, simply for the sake of wrecking that to which they strongly object. On the other hand, there is a large majority of honourable members in favour of a bonus for tbe establishment of the iron industry. These honourable members would do anything in reason to attain that object, but they are unhappily split into twosections, oneof which strongly favours the enterprise being undertaken by the State, and the other of which is not yet driven to any such conclusion, but would, in default of the State under. taking it, prefer to see the industry started at the earliest opportunity by any persons willing to embark their capital. It is said that information is required as to whether there are people ready to take advantage of * the bonus; but is there any doubt on the subject ? We read the newspapers, and our ears are open ; aad there appears little room for doubt that if a Bill be passed somewhat on the lines suggested, there are people only too willing to invest their capita] in the industry.

If I recollect rightly, the honourable member for Bland said he wanted to know what money would have to be spent, and what would be the likely profit. But the party which the honourable member leads here, and of which he is the representative in Australia-and which, I understand, is, and properly so, almost one in the variousStates-ar e haunted by no doubts as to the success of tbe enterprise. Last week in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, .the labour party, properly, but unsuccessfully, sought to induce the Government of that State to pledge themselves to undertake the enterprise. Does the honourable member for Bland suggest that under these circumstances the party with which he is associated have any doubt as to the success of the industry ? to be a success, there is no need for a bonus. would not ask for such a pledge from theNew -South Wales Government if they did. not believe in the success of the industry. I previously contended that New South Wales opinion is properly represented by theGovernmentof the day-that the possession of the Treasury benches is generally indicative of the power to express the popular will. I am strengthened in that opinion by the* recent division in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, where by 46 votes to 27, which represents a majority of nearly two-thirds over the lower number the figures 46 show a majority of 19, and. 19 is more than two-thirds of 27. Under the circumstances, am I not right in saying that the majority was more than two-thirds ? man double his Customs figures in that way ? ber knows perfectly well that I place the figures in the most attractive way from my own point of view, but, at the same time, In order to provide I use them with absolutely mathematical precision.

The must occur to all of us. Our finances are now in such a condition fchat the Treasurer can scarcely forecast results from month to The scheme month. We are under certain obligations to the smaller States, and this fact has been made use of by the Ministry as a political cry. Yet, notwithstanding the manifesto of the Prime Minister that we should provide for revenue without destruction, and maintain tottering industries, it is proposed to appropriate £250,000 for the encouragement of an industry which was not in existence at fche last general election, and in connection with a scheme which, I venture to say, has never been before the people of the Commonwealth. I hope the proposal of the honourable member for Bland will be agreed to, and that the select committee will consider a great many matters connected with the scheme. 1 have listened very attentively to the special pleading of my right honourable friend, and I have noted the arguments based on the conditions of the Canadian iron industrywhich are not at all on all-fours with the proposed scheme-and also his special reference to the iron industry in tbe United Statesa country populated by 80,000,000 of people. But I have not heard anything that w ill convince me that, at this stage of our national life, with a population of only 4,000,000, ifc would be to our interests to spend a large amount, of publicrevenue upon tbe establishment of a new industry, for , which the chances of success are very doubtful, and -which if once supported by the State, especially by bonuses, would require more and more assistance until it became an absolute monopoly.'

In view of the interests of the manufacturers, themselves-whic h the protectionists are supposed to conserve-and bearing in mind that iron enters largely into almost every one of our important manufacturing concerns, this is not the time afc which we should contemplate an increase in the price of the raw material. On' several occasions we have lacked information such as could be obtained only by means of exhaustive inquiry, and this is a matter upon which -puttin g aside my fiscal faith, because I do nofc believe in bonuses of any kind-w e should be placed in a position of much greater advantage if a patient investigation were made by a committee of this House. Why should we rush matters in connection with this industry? We are half way through this Parliament, and the proposed industry cannot be placed upon its feet until the next Parliament is elected. Why should we commit our successors to such an enormous expenditure as that contemplated ? I consider that some time might well be spent in investigation, and that theMinistry-afte r the tedious debates which have dragged through weeks, and -which have shown that there is no determinate opinion one way or another-ough t to be glad of an investigation that would throw some distinctive light on the question. AlthoughI am opposed to bonuses, I recognise that a majority of honourable members are in favour of the bonus system under certain conditions, and I sball therefore vote for the appointment of a select committee, which will at any rate place in our hands an authoritative statement as to the actual position of affairs. The honourable member for Wentworth was right in spying that a majority of honourable members are in favour of the granting of bonuses under proper conditions. A t the same time it is curious that the majority should not bave their own way. As a matter of fact, the triangular duel which has been proceeding is being made use of by the minority to impose their will upon the House. A majority of honourable members are in favour of the granting of bonuses subject to proper precautions, but thafc majority have unfortunately, allowed themselves to be split into two divisions,'one of which insists that the bonus shall not be granted, except upon certain conditions. W it h all respect to tbe honourable member for Bland, I think that he and those associated with him are making a great mistake in their own interests. The honourable member has led his party with great ability and industry, and has paid great attention to the debates in Parliament, but I cannot help thinking thafc he has been ill advised in this matter. about "" the other fellow's "" opinion. saying whafc I really think. I take it that the motion for the appointment of a select committee is intended to shelve the Bill, and I think ifc would be better for the honourable member for Bland to frankly say so.

I feel that it would be of the greatest advantage to us if we could secure the establishment of the iron industry at a time like the present when industries are sadly needed. The primary producers have, to a large extent, failed us, and there are hundreds and thousands of men who are anxious for work, and who cannot secure it , and if there ever was a time at whicb ifc was important to develop new industries it is at present. It is not in times of stint thafc we should close up our purse; at such times,. we should open it as far as we can. l t is true that this expenditure will fall upon all the States in proportion to population, and that some of them may find it hard to pay their way.

86,Mr Higgins,"I bhink I can undergood deal to be said in favour of allowing private individuals to experiment with a new industry at their own expense, instead of at the expense of the Commonwealth. This is a very different case from that of the railways. Supplies of iron can be obtained from abroad, where the industry is controlled by trusts, but no syndicate or trust can run the Australian railways in parts outside Australia, and therefore it is safe to assume that they will be carried on by the States Governments. But, considering the huge industrial movements which have their centre at the present time in America, it by no means follows that the States will be able to supply iron and steel in sufficient quantities to satisfy the wants of our railways and our people. Our efforts in regard to iron production would be very puny as compared with those of the great iron industries abroad. But we can render this industry very valuable service here. If private individuals, with the aid of a Government bonus, are prepared to risk their money in the enterprise, either at this or any other time, I am willing to give them the opportunity of doing so. Of course, it must be clearly understood that the States can always ask for a bonus if they desire it , and I am quite sure that the Government would give them a preferential claim. But I think honourable members ought to recollect that it is a distinct advantage to Australia to have people who are prepared to risk their money, time, and labour in a novel industry of this sort. An y bonus in which they may participate will be really a small thing as compared with the good results to the Commonwealth. In the event of the B ill being carried, stringent regulafavour of delaying the passing of this Bill tions could be imposed by the Government, and I am quite sure that in framing those regulations, which have to be submitted to Parliament, we may trust the Government to protect the interests of the inhabitants of Australia.

I protest against the money of the Commonwealth being handed over to assist a number of individuals to establish monopolies. That is tbe sole ground of my objection to this measure. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne expressed surprise at the action of the honourable member for Bland who, he said, was making a great mistake from the point of view of the interests of the party with which he is associated.

Private enterprise often builds up monopolies, to which I am certainly opposed. Apart from the financial question, which, as the Minister knows, is of serious importance to the State of South Australia, I would point out that if fche second part of the Minister's proposals is carried into effect, and an import duty of 10 per cent, is placed upon pig-iron, tlie manufacture of machinery, and of will be ruined. . The import duty upon manufactures of iron will probably be 15 or 12^ per cent., but an import duty of 10 per cent, upon pig-iron would reduce the protection of local manufacturers to 5 or 24j per cent., which would be a ridiculous margin. There is another mafcter which should be inquired into. The Minister did not propose the payment of butter bonuses in South Australia until a select committee had i nquired intofcheadvisability of doing such a thing. We have been told thafc there is room in Australia for several establishments for the making of iron and steel, and fchafc, therefore, the granting of these bonuses cannot lead to tbe creation of a monopoly.

112,Mr Batchelor,"This is not the matter forms another subject for an inquiry. Why should this Parliament, in its first session, commit itself to the expenditure of £300,000 of the people's money, when we cannot find time to deal with Bills and other legislation which is urgently needed 1 itself to the expenditure of only so much as the Government may think fit to authorize. that the Minister will not see fit to sanction the expenditure of the whole amount ? Once we pass the Billthe matter will be taken out of our hands. must be framed to carry out the intentions of the Bill will have to be laid before Parliament for approval. quibble. Does any one believe that any harm can result from the postponement of the consideration of this matter for perhaps twelve months, so as to permit of an inquiry being made into the whole subject ? There are many important questions connected with it , upon which the House to-day has no information, and upon which it should be informed before authorizing the proposed expenditure. allowed the standing orders to be suspended so that this motion for tlie appointment of a committee might be moved, as though they intended to agree fco the appointment of the committee; but now they are objecting to its appointment. The only new reason that the Minister gave for his present attitju.de is that he has discovered to settle the vexed questions which its conwith deep regret that the Parliament of New South Wales has refused to agree to a proposal for the establishment of State ironworks. I think that I shall save the time of the House if I direct my remarks principally to that argument. The Parliament of New South Wales certainly vetoed the proposal to establish State ironworks, but I may inform the Minister that they would with equal directness have vetoed this Bonus Bill. The New South Wales Opposition, which numbers about 35 members, gave its support, with one or two exceptions, to the Ministry to defeat the labour party on the proposal to establish State ironworks, but as free-traders they are opposed to a bonus system of any kind at all. Ministry are in favour of bonuses. tectionists. They are the unused wing of the protectionist party here. The people of New South Wales, however, as represented machinery by their Parliament, are opposed to the bonus system. The Minister would have us believe that they are opposed to the adoption of State ironworks, but have signified their willingness to accept the Bill as it now stands. The honourable and learned mamber for Northern Melbourne, who spoke as an Australian, with a capital A , said that he approached the consideration of the question from the Australian stand-point, and asked us, in the interests of Australia, to pass the Bill. As an Australian, and in the interests of the people of Australia, I am opposed to the Bill. No doubt, the honourable and learned member, from his training and I regard that as a associations, is disposed to look with favorable eyes upon judicial bodies, and what I ask is that a select committee may -be appointed as a judicial body to decide between the conflicting statements which we have heard from honest men on both sides of the Chamber in regard to the matter now under consideration. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has spoken about tlie "" dog in the manger "" policy of those who refuse to vote for the Bill, but, if I may be permitted to use a similar metaphor, I would refer to the policy which he advocates as a "" pig in the poke"" policy. AVe, as the representatives of the people of Australia, cannot be expected to vote for this B ill without further information. I wish for the appointment of a select committee, not to settle the Bill, but sideration has raised. I should like to know a little more about the stringent regulations to which the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has referred. Are they provided for by the Bill? That is another reason why this judicial committee composed of honourable members selected from all sides of the Chamber, and representing all fiscal viewsa purely Australian body in its personnel-shoul d be appointed. What more could the honourable and learned member require than an Australian select committee to inquire into this great Australian question ? It takes a good deal to annoy me, but when the honourable and learned member appealed to tbe representatives of New South Wales and, as a representative of Victoria, asked"" What have we to gain 1 AVe are simply bursting",28,Malcolm Mceachabn I S Nofc A Iron And Steel Implements I N Australia

119,Mr Wilks,"Yes, because they are prowith a desire to assist New South Wales. We are consumed with an anxiety to carry this Bil l so that the people of New South Wales may have a noble and powerful industry established in their midst,"" I marvelled attheexhibitionof this new concern for the interests of that State. I wish that the honourable and learned member had shown the same degree of concern for the interests of New South Wales a few days ago when the question of the suspension of the fodder duties was raised. A m I to be blamed if I look askance at his appeal 1 But supposing that it is made in the interests of New South Wales, I , as an Australian, have to say that New South Wales does not require patronage at all-does-nof c ask forfcheassistance of Australia at the expense of the Australian people to build up any of her industries. Why should these honourable members be so concerned for her interests to-day ? The honourable member for Bland believes in a' State-owned iron industry, and the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, said with marked emphasis -and the Minister for Trade and Customs did not deny it-that the bulk of the people of his State were at the back of the proposal he believes in. The Minister, a representative of that State, by his silence, practically affirmed that idea. The honourable member for Bland made a very strong case when he said that in New South AAales7 the people had not considered the question of a State-owned iron industry, that the vote in the Legislative Assembly was practically a catch vote, and that the supporters of the principle had done very well in their first effort. AVithout committing myself to tbe idea of a State-owned iron industry, I submit that a proposal of this character could not have been made at a more inopportune time, in the affairs of New South Wales, because they are tired with regard to the management of certain State industrie,s, and are afraid of proceeding further, and involving themselves in a larger expenditure. I do not understand the finances of this question. Bothi n this debate and in previous ones, ifc has been said that it involves an expenditure of sums ranging from £250,000 to £350,000. Ifc has been stated, too, that four times thab amount of money will have to be collected from bhe people of Ausbralia before bhe required bonus can be obbained. AVhenI , who closely follow bhe proceedings of Parliament, .do not clearly understand bhe position, I am satisfied that thousands of persons in Australia, who may like to see the iron industry established, are not aware of how much money is required to insure its establishment. For that reason, what better body could we have than an Australian select commibtee bo seek for full information ? The appointment of a judicial body of thab kind is an admirable idea. Probably, except in bhe case of those whose free trade views are very strong, the information it would collect would set at rest all doubts. The Minister for Trade and Customs, who is genei-ally prebby calm and judicious, is allowing his enthusiasm bo carry him away in bhis mabber. I refuse bo be carried away by his enbhusiasm. He possesses a mosfc magnetic power, and it is with bhe greabesb difficulby bhab I am opposing him. His enbhusiasm is nob a sufficient justification for bhe House bo hastily sanction bhe expendibure of £350,000. Thab is a very good reason for appointing a select committee which could seek for reliable information from all quarters. I have read in the press bhab certain persons are bursting wifch a desire to establish industries foithe benefit of Australiapure philanthropists, who have no idea of seeking for profit or gain. Everybody has his own peculiarity, but their peculiarity is to place in some part of the Commonwealth an industry involving the expenditure of, as they sa)', £900,000, so that the people of Australia shall benefit by its operations. If that is so, sir, you can hardly wonder at my doubting the statement. I am fairly gullible, but when I read the statement. I doubted ifc. A select committee could prove its accuracy or otherwise. If there are gentlemen with large national characteristics desirous of establishing industries purely for the gain of Australia, I should like a select committee to be appointed to thrash out the question. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne thought it was oubrageous for a free-trader to oppose a bonus. While I may not be the "" real Mack-.iy,"" so far as economic principles are concerned, I should like to know how he stands in regard to bonuses all round. If ifc is good enough for the iron indusbryour very own industry, as the Minister said -to receive a bonus at the expense of the great Australian public, is the honourable and learned member prepared to give a bonus for shipbuildingto a portion of the Commonwealth in which I live, and which bas to use iron'in the construction of ships ? I wish to know whether a select committee could obtain information on the point ? We can never estimate how much information the members of a select committee can collect. If you, sir, refer to the names'of the proposed select committee, you will not discover the name of one honourable member who is not most industrious in political life, or who is likely to be caught by chaff. It is proposedfchati t be constituted of phlegmatic, judicial characters. Surely the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is not going to insult those honourable members whom the honourable member for Bland would not think of nominating without their consent? Apparently, they all think that it is right to appoint a select understand that .many objections could not committee. Is tbe honourable and learned member, with others, prepared to give a most violent slap in the face to honourable members who are willing to sacrifice their fcime in fche public interest, and to undertake a mosfc arduous political work which meets with little publicity? Surely the Minister is nofc prepared to slap in the face some of his most ardent supporters when they are anxious to ascertain the rights and wrongs of fchis question ? Is he a very good judge of character ? I am told fchat he is. Therefore, I ask him, in the most abject manner, is he prepared to leave me in this quandary-that I shall have to vote against the Bill, because I require further information than he has given ? character, fche honourable member will. flippant. Thafc is exactly how he is with the Bill. He says fco the House"" Vote this sum of £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0; never mind about the raising of £1,200,000. It will be a success."" We hope that it will be a success, bufc we prefer to adopt Scotch caution and to obtain more information, so that Australia may' not be placed in a more awkward situation, and her people may not be at a loss. I appeal to the Minister, and all those who believe in tlie bonus system. If their belief in its efficacy to establish, industries for the benefit of Australia is so great as they represent, surely fchey are not afraid of going before a select committee of the House? If they are afraid of going before a select committee, then it is an admission that the bonus system is very weak, and that they are going to trust to time and chance to put the industry in a healthy condition, and the demands which may be made upon it in the future to strengthen what would otherwise be a most weak concern. If they do believe in the efficacy of the system, why are they now fighting here and trying to obtain a catch vote, which probably another place may not respect as they ought to do ? It is a question of hastening slowly. There is no killing of the measure involved. If the select committee came back fco fche House armed at all points with information as to finances, stringent regulations, power of resumption, and all the other matters which have been mentioned in debate, then I could readily be raised to the Bill. I have not heard any reason to induce me to remove my opposition to a Bonus Bill. I trust that the Minister will not resist the motion. If his idea is to continue to resist the proposal, then he should have opposed the suspension of the standing orders. I again ask the honourable member for Northern Melbourne, has he so little faith in the efficacy of fche bonus system thafc he is unprepared to give a select committee the benefit of his calm, deliberate judgment? I fchink thafc this great Australia has much fco gain from the exercise of that judgment. I should like to see the calm, deliberate judgment of the advocates of the bonus system placed before a select committee, clothed wifch power to make a searching investigation. If there I am a judge of is anything in the system fchey will come out of the inquiry triumphantly. I am not afraid of a select committee. I believe that the members of it can obtain information which will guide not only the Commonwealth Parliament, but tbe Parliaments of the different States; and thafc ib will be shown that at the present day, and for some years to come, the iron industry in Australia cannot be made a payable one. I believe thafc, in thafc way, the people of this Commonwealth maybe saved the expense of a very costly experiment. It is nofc a quesbion of £250,000, or even £1,000,000, because once the industry is started, it must be continued. Under all the circumstances, I plead wibh bhe Minisber for Trade and Cusboms bhat, in the interests of the Commonwealth, he should not take action which wil l burden the people with more taxation, and that he should allow this select committee to be appointed in order thab, irrespective of parby.",29,Malcolm Mceachabn I S Nofc A Iron And Steel Implements I N Australia

Honourable members must not lose sight of tbe fact thafc we have only a section of the British navy standing between Australia and the destruction of her national interests to-day.

The object now is to get the industry established, and the information we have to date is that the States will not undertake the enterprise. compelled to do so under the circumstances ? that the all powerful State of New South Wales, in which there are large iron deposits, has not developed the industry. The three chief reasons given by the mover of this motion for referring the Bill to a select committee at the present time were the cost of working the deposits, the amount of capital required for the development of tbe industry, and tbe possibility of its development by a bonus without the necessity for a high duty. As to the first point, surely no honourable member who was privileged to listen to bhe address of the honourable member for Parramatta on the second reading of the Bill can overlook the fund of information which he gave to the House with regardfcothe deposits available, and bhe esbimated cosfc of working them given by reliable authorities? Then as to the amount of capital required, we have information from different sources, and the total capital involved appears to be entirely a question as to fche quantity proposed fco be produced by the different companies supplying estimates. The honourable member for South Australia laid great stress upon the point fchat we can establish the industry without any bonus at all, and that there is a possibility of its being established merely by the imposition of a slight duty. The difficulty of dealing with the matter from that standpoint is that we all know that by the imposition of a duty at the outset, before the production of iron is established here, bhe cosb of bhe raw maberial bo bhe users of iron and sbeel will be ab once increased. Thab is a difficulty fche Government and bhe communiby generally are interested in avoiding, by giving a bonus upon the material produced until such bime as iron and steel are produced in quanbibies approximating closely bo tlie amount required forfcheCommonwealth. Personally, I regret to see the small trivia] differences that divide those who are earnest in their desire to see this industry established. The difference of opinion simply amounts to this : bhab there is a section of honourable members who are very desirous fchat the Stabes should embark T h a t is not the quesin the enterprise. Personally, I have no objection whatever bo bhab. I should be very glad indeed to see the States embark in this enterprise. But failing that, no action of mine will be taken to prevent private enterprise being .allowed to develop this industry, because seeing thab we It is a peculiar thing have bhe raw maberial available, I look upon it as one of tbe most important and beneficent industries that could be established for the welfare of the community. I am prepared to support fchis. Bill without any further enquiry whatever. Having to vote in this instance contrary to the party with which I generally vote, I must explain why I do so, and my explanation shall be brief. I believe in the bonus system, and so long as it appeared possible to secure that this industry should become a State monopoly, I worked in that direction. I was inclined to support this motion for a select committee so long as I believed that ifc was soughtfcobe appointed in fcbeinteresbs of the bonus system, and in tbe interest of the industry being undertaken by the State. But the mover of the motion confesses that he believes in bonuses, and that this committee is simply a proposal to find out what is the best means of getting the greatest amount of good out of the bonus system. lieved in bonuses ; not afc all. able member in his speech to-day to say fchafc he proposed the committee in the interests of the bonus system. If I remember aright, there was first an effort made to give tbe States a monopoly of the industry ; then an effort was made to give the States a monopoly of fche industry for two years, and then an effort was made to give the States a monopoly of the industry for one year. Finally, in order to put fche matter into fche hands of the Sbabe, as I undersbood it, bhis select committee was to make enquiries as to what it would cost, and as bo howa Sbate could raise the money necessary to starb ironworks.

Honourable members have said that they desire only delay, but delays are dangerous, proverbially, and in this case delay will be very dangerous. The honourable member for South Australia asked where would be tbe danger and evil of delay in this case 1 Ifc lies in tbe fact thafc afc the present time we have hundreds and thousands of unemployed with whom we do nofc know what to do. Meanwhile there are a great many works which are depending upon the iron industry, and I sayfchafcat the present time, when we have fche assurance of fche Governmenfc fchafc capital is ready to be launched in fchis great venture, it is criminal and sinful for us to stand in fche way, in view of fche present state of affairs in the industrial world. I am honestly and earnestly in favour of going on with the work without a moment's delay; and, therefore, I am against the appointment of a select committee. I do nofc believe in needless delay or in subterfuges. So long as there was an honest effort in the direction of a State monopoly, I was in favour of it ; but I am against any subterfuge which has for its object the killing of fche Bill. The bonus offer has been unfairly stated over and over again this afternoon. It has been stated that the proposal is to here and now vote away £250,000 or £300,000 of the public money. The fact has been obscured and hidden that payment is by results, and that not one penny of the taxpayers' money is compromised. The terms are-n o iron, no bonus; and if we are to get our money's worth from the raw material brought from the bowels of the earth, we are, by opposing the Bill, standing in the way of the development of a native industry. It has been asked where the money is to come from with which to pay the bonus. But how much would it require to meetfcheinitial expenses of a State monopoly. I favour a State monopoly, but I see no chance of fchat until we have money of our ownfcoembark in the industry. Under the present circumstances, State monopoly would simply mean a monopoly of financiers in London, seeing that we I speak only for myself. should have to borrow the money in order the honourable to undertake the enterprise. That would be simply handing the industry over to capitalists in London, and leaving us as I was explaining that far as ever from State monopoly. If a select committee be appointed, will it make inquiries, and set, side by side, fche expense of initiating a State monopoly, and the expense of giving bonuses to private individuals? If that were done, I believe it would be found that the initial expense of making a State monopoly would be infinitely greater than thafc of a bonus system which, from beginning to end, safe-guards the people's money by the principle of payment by results. I regard the bonus principle as the supplement or complement of the protectionist principle, of which I am .an avowed advocate. On the hustings. I told the electors that the two went hand in hand, and I am only carrying oufc my pledges to my constituents, who are largely interested in the iron industry, when I endeavour fco expedite the establishment of the bonus system by every possible means. The iron industry is the parent of a hundred and one other industries, and I shall do everything in my power to prevent one moment's delay in the realization of a proposal which will be a f r u it f u l source of development throughout Australia.

The honourable member. for Southern Melbourne declared that he opposes a select committee, because the proposal looks like a conspiracy to defeat the investment of private capital. That honourable member charges the labour party wifch being conspirators; and I object to any honourable member, however humble in morality or intellectuality, being so charged by a man who is over-loaded with morality. ber for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, must confine himself to the question before the House. Mr O'MALLEY -The honourable member for Southern Melbourne declared that he would have voted for the appointment of a select committee, but for his belief that a committee meant a conspiracy to prevent iron works being established. able member for Southern Melbourne states the truth. MrO ' MALLEY I should like to know where the honourable member for Melbourne obtains his knowledge. Mr O'MALLEY -Wher e is the evidence? It may be rumoured that the honourable member for Southern Melbournewill turn a somersault to-morrow, but there is no certainty on the point. No honourable member should make charges which he is member for Melbourne stands as the very essence of dignity and honour, and is always upbraiding honourable members for making charges of the kind to which I now object. The honourable member asserts that there is a conspiracy; but I deny tlie statement, and contend fchat there is nofc an honourable member who would be guilty of such an offence. We hold that this is a matter which ways of the country are owned by the people, and iron works also ought to be owned by the people. HadI dreamt for one moment that this industry would get into the hands of a private syndicate-int o the hands of Goulds, Vanderbilts, and against a duty of 15 per cent, on raw iron. It is proposed to tax the people of the country to the extent of £250,000 in order to enable a private posed to give a monopoly, and compel every man interested in primary production to contribute towards enriching a few syndicators. If ever Australia were at war, we should, under the proposals of fche Governmenfc, have fco go on our knees fco these monopolists, as America had to do in her great war, and ask what they would take for their i r o n ; and the price asked would not be governed by tlie cost of production, plus the cost of the raw material, but governed by fche rates in New York, Montreal, and London. If the giving of this bonus be agreed to, it will go down to history as a stupendous act of infamy which I made no charge. plundered unborn millions of their inheritance. the ordinary responsibility which Parliament always has in connection with any legislation, we have a further responsibility in this particular matter.

151,Mr Eowler (Perth),"In addition todebate we have had the very haziest information as to the exact standing of the gentlemen who are going to embark in this industry. Once before, on the floor of tlie House, I challenged those gentlemen to produce evidence that the money was actually available to carry on the work. challenge, which I now repeat; If the money be available, let evidence to that effect be produced; and to that extent, at least, we shall then know where we stand. But we know perfectly well that the gentlemen interested are going to the markets of the world with their' leases, and that they intend to dangle this bonus before the wealthy classes in order to bring about the formation of a company. We are responsible to the extent that we offer a bonus, andfcheassumption is thafc fchis Parliament considers the industry to be one with every likelihood of success. But are we in a position to say we believe the industry, if initiated by the company, will be successful to the degree which the company have a right fco expect ? We have no evidence whatever to that effect. In the interests of the people who are prepared to enter into a bona fide industry of this kind, it is our dufcy to appoint a committfce of investigation. If the proposed company be sound, and have reasonable ground.for assuming that they will carry on the industry successfully, I fail co see what objection tbey can have to the appointment of a committee, which, if the evidence be thoroughly satisfactory, will materially assist them in obtaining the moneyfcheyrequire. In fchis way the appointment of a select committee will accelerate the establishment of the industry, and on that ground alone the motion is justified. If the result of the inquiry is to satisfy this House that there is reasonable prospect of success, those who are floating the company will have no difficulty in inducing investors to subscribe the required money. Por these reasons alone I believe a select committee ought to be appointed to proceed at once wifch the necessary investigation. ifc necessary afc this stage .to repeat speeches in which I have already shown my strong opposition to socialism. The proposal for a select committee seems to have been made in consequence of the debate which took place in the New (South Wales Legislative Assembly the other night on a motion that tbe Government of that State should pledge itself to take advantage of the CommonwealthBonus Bill. Mr Eitzpatrick suggested, nofc only on that occasion, but also when a member of a deputation to the State Minister of Public Works, that m addition to I have had no reply to that the iron industry, coal-mining, gold-mining, clofches-making, and, infacfc, everyofcherindustry, should be brought under State control.. The design of the labour party in New South Wales has therefore been clearly indicated. The labour party in this House are following their example, and having failed to carry out their socialistic ideas, are only consistent in doing their best fco defeat the Bill, by shelving it for three or five years. This will be the result of referring it fco a select committee. I am not so well able to arrive afc the motive which has led tbe leader of the Opposition fco support the proposal to refer the B ill to a select committee. Some honourable members have not dared to vote against the socialistic principle embodied in tlie proposal for the establishment of' ironworks by the States Governments. They do nofc like socialism, but they are uncertain as to how their constituencies would regard their actions if they directly opposed it. The proposal for the appointment of a select committee, therefore, affords them a means of achieving their end without directly committing themselves. Some honourable members of the Opposition have professed to be absolutely ignorant of the details of the Government proposal and of the consequences which would follow the passing of fche Bill now before us. They therefore say,fcheyfavour the appointment of a select committee in order that tbe fullest information may be placed in the hands of honourable members. I would, however, ask those honourable members who are now so anxious to obtain every information upon tlie subject now before us, why they did not realize the same necessity for a f u l l investigation in connection with the Pacific Island Labourers Act and tbe Immigration Restriction Act. Those were measures which involved fche mosfc important considerations affecting the relations of Australia with the Pacific and tlie Empire; the vast interests of sugar growers, merchants, ship-owners, and vast industrial and mercantile concerns, and yet when it was proposed that it should be referred to a select committee they argued that this House was",35,Malcolm Mceachabn I S Nofc A Iron And Steel Implements I N Australia
152,Mr Crouch (Corio),"-I do not thinkquite competent to deal with the matter. In the present case honourable members should be just as capable of transacting the business before them without waiting for an investigation by a select committee. Their opinions are not likely to be altered by tbe conclusions arrived at by any committee. If honourable members feel that they cannot venture to openly vote against socialistic proposals, they are quite justified in supporting the appointment of a select committee, which will have the effect of shelving the Bill for some time. It would be preferable if they were to demonstrate that they had the courage of their opinions by voting directly against the proposal for the establishment of ironworks by the States Governments, and so at the outset crush a pioject which, if carried into effect, would create a monster that in time would swallow up every industry in the Commonwealth. Honourable members, whose sole reason for existence as members of this House is that they have devoted years to the study of politimembers who are already committed to supcal economy and social functions, should come out into the open and vote fearlessly in' support of their opinions. I find that of those honourable members whom it is proposed to appoint as a select committee, the honourable member for Bland and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, the Minister foi' Trade and Customs, the honourable member for West Sydney, and the honourable member for Parramatta have declared themselves strongly in favour of nationalizing the iron industry. Parramatta and the Minister for Trade and Customs voted against the proposal to nationalize the iron industry. member for Bland deny my statement that the honourable member for Parramatta stated that he was in favour of nationalizing the iron industry? posal on the ground that it was not opportune. not, tbe honourable member is reported at page 13612 of Eansan-d to have stated that he was in favour of nationalizing the iron industry. The Minister for Trade and Customs also similarly declared himself. The honourable member for Darling Downs stated that he was in favour of State control of the industry for two years, and that he could not go any further. The honourable member for Newcastle, as a member of the labour party, must support State socialism; and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie voted in favour of the State socialistic proposal of the honourable member for Bland. Therefore, eight members of a committee of ten have expressedthemselves in favour of having the iron industry established as a State enterprise. I have not been able to trace any expression of opinion by the honourable member for Wannon, or the honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon. I have some doubt as to the views held by the latter honourable member, but I should judge that the honourable member for Wannon would be opposed to State socialism. If a fair and honest inquiry is to be made into the merits of the Government proposal, and as to the desirableness of the iron industry being established under State control, the committee should be differently 1 constituted, and should not comprise eight port State socialism. proposed committee have voted in favour of nationalizing the iron industry. which members of the committee are in favour of individualism ? except the. honourable member is in favour of individualism is mistaken. I should like to see the honourable and learned member for Parkes appointed to the committee, if for that reason only. He would prove a useful member of such an investigating body, because he has devoted a large amount of attention to the study of political economy. If the committee is appointed, and is constituted as now proposed, it will not serve the interests which the honourable member for Bland seeks to advance, because it will not possess the confidence of this House to the same degree as if it were evenly balanced. sary for me to say that I am a firm believer in the importance of establishing the iron industry. I do not think that the appointment of a select committee, as proposed, will postpone the accomplishment of that object.

161,Mr Tudor(Yarra),"It is scarcely necessugar was followed by disaster, and the loss of a large sum of money would probably have been obviated if an exhaustive inquiry had been made prior to the establishment of the Maffra Beet Sugar Works. If the committee proposed by the honourable member, for Bland, after an impartial inquiry, recommend that we should adopt the bonus system, I shall support tbem. I do not agree with the honourable and learned member for Corio that the opinions of honourable members are fixed upon the subject of the establishment of the iron industry as a State monopoly, and I do not share his anxiety as to the results. Even if the personnel of the committee is not altered, only four members out of ten will stand committed to the nationalization of the iron industry, because the honourable member for Parramatta and the Minister for Trade and Customs voted against the proposal made by the honourable member for Bland. The honourable and learned member for Corio statedthat it was singular that honourable members had not been willing to refer the Pacific Island Labourers Bill to a select committee for the purposes of investigation. I would point out, however, that the voice of the Australian people had been raised unmistakably in favour of the abolition of the Kanaka traffic, and that in passing the measure referred to we were carrying out the specific mandate of the people. . On the other hand, the question of granting bonuses for the establishment of the iron industry was not raised at one meeting out of fifty held in connection with the Federal elections'. If the select committee is appointed, I hope that it will be able to bring up a report early next session, and I do not fear that the result will be to seriously delay the passing of the measure now before us. bane) -The question with which we are to all tbe States which choose to embark now dealing is a vast one, but I do not upon this enterprise. I mention that fact share the feeling of the honourable and to emphasize the desirableness of delaying learned member for Corio, with regard to the further consideration of this matter. If responsibility which rests upon honourable the Government refuse to drop the Billa members.

Personally I feel no responsibility in regard to it . How can any honourable member feel sure that he is representing his constituents by voting for or against the measure? He cannot possibly know what, their views are. I regard tbe sudden appearance of this measure upon the political horizon as utterly unreasonable. When I spoke regarding this measure a few weeks ago, one or two honourable members thought that I expressed myself very 'warmly. When I feel strongly it is natural I should speak with some warmth. But I have no desire to speak warmly tonight. I wish honourable members to understand that I am speaking as coolly as if I were dealing with a business matter of my own, or with one in which I was acting as a trustee, and I say that there is absolutely no warrant for intruding this vast matter upon the House, either during the present session or the next. The only solution of the difficulty which has arisen a solution satisfactory alike to the labour party, to members of the Opposition, and to Ministerial supporters-is to drop the Bill. I ask the Minister to give honourable members breathing time-tim e to examine the question thoroughly in all its bearings. It is only reasonable that they should be allowed an opportunity of conferring during the recess with the leading people in their constituencies, and of informing themselvesby means of public meetings of what the opinions of the electors upon this matter really are.' Let us come into contact with those who take an interest in it . If the Bil l be passed, is the payment of tlie bonus to be limited to one State? From advices which I have received from experienced and reputable thinkers in Queensland, I know that they favour giving equal consideration wish to ask if you will be good enough to put my motion in two parts-the first portion affirming the desirableness .of referring the Bill to a select committee, and the second relating to the personnel of the committee.",37,Malcolm Mceachabn I S Nofc A Iron And Steel Implements I N Australia

Wales) I again wish to direct the attention of the Acting Prime Minister to the question of the prorogation. It appears to me that an effort might be made to close the present session before the close of the current month. It is possible that, apart from the financial Bills, we may get through most of the measures remaining to be dealt with during the current week. I know that we shall be glad to bring that about. I have learned, too, in an unofficial way, that the Treasurer will not be able to make his Budget speech until nearly the close of the month, but it seems to me that a big effort should be made to close the session this month. Paragraphs have . appeared in the newspapers which"" speak of the possibility of tlie session being prolonged until the end of October, but that would be a great calamity. We have now been sitting for a longer period than any House of Parliament with which I am acquainted has sat during late years, and, therefore, I think that a supreme effort should be made to close the session this month. I-hcpe that the House will help the Government to do that. afternoon I asked the Acting Minister for Defence whether the salaries of the drill instructors who have been sent to South Australia are to be regarded as new expenditure, since the officers in question have been transferred from New South Wales to South Australia without being re-enlisted under the laws of the latter State. As I may be dead next a matter of constitutional principle I wished to know whether the salaries of these drill instructors are to be debited to But others will not South Australia as the salaries of transferred officers or as new expenditure. The Minister replied that the salaries were to be regarded not as new but as transferred expenditure, and were to be debited, not to New South Wales, but to South Australia, although the officers'have not been re-enlisted under the South Australian Act. The view I hold is that if the officers have not been re-enlisted under the South Australian Act, they remain under the New South Wales Act, because there is no Federal Act. If they do not remain under the New South Wales Act, they are not enlisted at all, because they have not been re-sworn under theSouth Australian Act ; but if they remain under the New South Wales Act, and the expenditure is not 'new expenditure, it must be debited to New South Wales. If they have been transferred to South Australia without being re-enlisted, and the expenditure is not to be debited to New South Wales, it must be regarded as new expenditure, because it is expenditure, not for the maintenance of the department as it existed in South Australia at the time of its transfer to the. Commonwealth, but expenditure in addition to that. I do not know how the Minister came to the conclusion that the expenditure is not new expenditure, or that, if transferred expenditure, it can be debited to South Australia instead of to New South Wales. I mention the matter because I am not satisfied that the opinion given by the Minister is correct in law. bane) -When it was arranged in May last that a trip, as it was called, should be taken to view the suggested sites for a federal capital, many honourable members declined to go, because they felt that by going they would risk their health. It was understood, however, that a subsequent trip would be arranged to meet their convenience, and I should therefore like to know from the Minister for Home Affairs, not later than next week, what arrangements he intends to make with that object. There are about 50 honourable members who were not able to take part in the last trip.
