I .desire to thank the honourable member for Darling for having very kindly taken charge of this motion in my unavoidable absence from the House. I have read the discussion which has taken place, and I feel sure that it is not necessary for me to add anything to what has been stated by the mover, who has covered all the ground. I was pleased to notice that very little objection was urged to an inquiry into the subject. The Prime Minister has moved some amendments which I readily accept. I desire 'that this Committee shall obtain all possible information, with the idea of the Commonwealth Government owners of the steamers which carry the mails between Australia and England, because I feel sure that only when that change has been brought about shall we overcome the difficulties which beset us at present. I do not contemplate' that the operations of such a line of steamers would be con* fined to the carrying of mails, but and cargo. I am very strongly in favour of the Commonwealth acquiring a fleet of steamers which will be capable of carrying the mails between here and Great Britain, and also of 'entering into ordinary business, such as is conducted by the present mail companies. I am contented that the whole question should be inquired into by a Committee, even though my ultimate objective is not made, the main against my proposal would not be sufficient to outweigh the evidence in favour of Commonwealth ownership of the mail steamers. I understand that some objection is raised, and possibly with some degree of fairness, to the -personnel of the Committee. One of the reasons why the Committee as it now stands is not fairly representative of both sides of the House is that when my motion was first framed the Reid Government were still in office. Since then, of course, the disposition of parties has somewhat changed. The honourable member for Pairamatta pointed out that too many members of the Labour Party had been nominated on the Committee. fact that the objective was socialistic. eleven members, but the Prime Minister suggested that the number should be reduced, and I agreed to the elimination of the names of the honourable member for Grampians and the honourable member for Bourke. The former honourable member consented to be nominated merely .as a personal favour to myself, because he was busy in connection with the Old-age Pensions Commission and in other ways, and afterwards the name of the honourable member for Bourke was withdrawn. Upon the withdrawal of these names five honourable members of the Labour Party and four other honourable members were left among those nominated. The honourable and learned member for Angas asked me to withdraw his name, as he was very busy, ultimately becoming the and the honourable and learned member for Wannon also desired that his name should be withdrawn. As that would leave upon the Committee too many members of the Labour Party.

If it can be shown that excessive charges are being made by the mail companies, or that there is inefficient transport of the mails, there might be some justification for the proposal. stitute a fossicking expedition simply upon a bald resolution, and no one should more keenly oppose the creation of such a body than the Prime Minister himself. wishes to husband the financial resources of the Commonwealth, now is his opportunity to do so. If he fails in his duty in that direction, what is to prevent any honourable member from tabling a seductive resolution in favour of the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into almost any matter coming within the purview of Federal stances, it is easy to conceive of the whole House being busily employed in The history of this Parliament has been characterized by the appointment of too manv Select Committees and Royal Commissions. Only to-day we find one of the powerful Melbourne newspapers voicing its dissatisfaction with the work of the Tariff Commission. In the face of such an expression of opinion, are we to appoint another Committee of the character proposed ? Every honourable member must have wrangle, which took place in the Chamber this afternoon -regarding the personnel of the proposed Committee.

It has been proposed that six honourable members from the other side of the .Chamber, ;-and two honourable members from the Opposition shall serve upon the Committee. What respect could the Commonwealth pay to the recommendations of a body of that character. In The data submitted is view of the fact that the Ministerial party number only nineteen all told, whereas the Opposition, excluding Mr Speaker, totals twenty-eight members, it would be a lop-sided Committee. The balance of the House is represented by members of the Labour Party. Tested from Buti t is preposterous to in the stand-point of those figures, not even proportional representation is proposed in regard to the personnel of the Committee. I say that before appointing any further If he Select Committees, we should tabulate the cost of Royal Commissions and Select Committees up-to-date, and let the public judge for themselves how little return they have received from the expenditure incurred in this direction. Moreover, the House has yet to decide that it is socialistically inclined. I could understand the Prime Minister declaring that it was the policy legislation? Under such circumof the Government to introduce a system of State ownership of steamers; but for a private member to take that stand, and travelling round the country. for this Chamber to endorse it , would be an admission that we are prepared to receive from a Committee a report of a social-stic character. Until more reliable data is forthcoming, I shall oppose the appointment of this or any other Select Committee. motion was submitted,. I must confess that I felt some surprise at finding that the Government concurred in the appointment of the Select Committee even with the modiheard the absolutely indecent fications proposed by the Prime Minister. It is perfectlv obvious from the honourable and learned gentleman's amendments, that the Government are not at present prepared to consider as within the pale of practical politics the suggestion of the honourable member for Barrier that a fleet of steamers should be purchased and controlled by the Commonwealth.

Not a word has been proposed Committee. The object of tlie motion is perfectly clear. The honourable member for Barrier and his friends in the Labour corner, would constitute a majority of the Committee, inasmuch as there would be five members of their party upon it , out of a total of nine members. In other words, there would be a majority of gentlemen serving upon it who have the reputaI understand that the tion-deservedl y or otherwise-of being Socialists, and who have no hesitation in affirming that Socialism is the proper form of government to adopt. They exhibit r.o lack of boldness in proposing the first big experimentin the direction of nationalization-a n experiment in which it would be quite impossible for the State to succeed. This proposal would mean more by a great deal than the nationalization of a monopoly. It would mean the nationalization of a service which could not be made a mono, poly, except by subjecting the commercial community to such enormous inconvenience of mails, pasthat even our socialistic friends would shrink ( from tackling the job. That is the nature of the proposal in its original form, but though the Prime Minister has taken all the heart out of it, these bold Socialist warriors are content to accept everything that has been proposed by way of amendment. I can understand a man holding a view, and standing up for it ; but I must confess that I am surprised at the attitude of those who, having made a suggestion of this kind, and having resolved to institute a fishing inquiry, which cannot result in any good, have abandoned the whole principle concerning which they desired to nave I again ask what inan investigation.

There has not been a suggestion that wrongs exist which can be righted by means of the information which would be furnished to this House and the community by a Select Committee, and, until that has been done, no -case can be made out for its appointment. 'This is the first Select Committee whose appointment has been asked for without any justification being shown for its creation. mails, passengers, and cargo between Australia and the United Kingdom is undoubtedly a difficult one, but it is not one which can be settled by the sort of information which this Committee could elicit from the witnesses it is likely to examine.

If it be suggested that the Commonwealth is at present paying money for the carriage of its mails which it ought not to pay, no one knows better than the honourable member for Coolgardie that, as far as the existing arrangements are concerned, it could not have hoped to get its work done at a less cost. were no shipping rings. honourable member ought to know that a contract for the carriage of mails between Australia and the United Kingdom is not to be undertaken by any one unless he can satisfv the Government that he is a man of substance. Speculative brokers who make> offers to the Commonwealth to carry out large contracts, Avithout giving any substantial guarantee of their ability to perform them, are not to .be seriously regarded. When the honourable member for Coolgardie interjects that if there were not a sihi\ppi|ng ring in existence this, 'service might be carried out at a more reasonable cost, he betrays what, after all, may be the intention-although , perhaps, the unconscious intention-of the majority of the proposed Select Committee-that is, to find that no satisfactory arrangement can be made for this service in the absence of a nationalized system of steamers. In other words, those who are to be appointed to this Select Committee wish to deal with the whole question in a way that the amendment was designed to prevent. the amendment will prevent the Select Committee from considering the whole question. The question of the carriage of passed as amended, the Select Committee, if it finds that the evidence justifies it , may report that the Commonwealth alone can properly carry out this system. The Prime Minister could not possibly have realized that fact when he moved the amendment, otherwise he would have opposed the motion. I am not going to be a party to inquiries that suggest that the Commonwealth is going to attempt to become a public owner in the very direction in which public ownership would be accompanied by difficulties-difficultie s far greater than those which must naturally surround No arrangements ( the ordinary assumption of such powers. A monopoly cannot be created in this direction. I should have thought that the socialistic party would begin with something less ambitious than a proposition of this kind. If , on the one hand, the motion, as amended, will mean nothing more than an inquiry into facts, with which every one is fairly well acquainted, and which certainly could be ascertained with very little difficulty by the Postmaster-General's Department, I cannot support it ; and if , on It could be done if there the other hand, it will leave the Committee, with its majority of avowed Socialists, open to discuss the whole question as originally proposed, I must still vote against it. I should be very glad to hear some reason, good, bad, or indifferent, for the creation of this Select Committee, and as to why the .Government should be ready to indulge so cheerfully in further expenditure in this direction. Public funds have apparently no useful purpose to serve. I am ready to be convinced of the justice of any case, but those who question the wisdom of appointing this Committee are entitled to expect its advocates to give some reason for its creation. We should .not vote for it merely because it has been submitted by a member of a party which controls the movements of the House, and has been agreed to by its obedient supporters in an altered form. Are we to support the motion simply because honourable members in the Ministerial corner say, "" We have the numbers, and are going",19,Steamers That It Would Also Convey Passengers

76,Mr Mccay,"Even if the motion beto have this inquiry in some form or other."" That seems to be the position, and until some good reasons are adduced for the appointment of the Committee, we shall do wrong in agreeing to the motion. for the opposition to this motion is obvious. The mistake that has been made lies in the fact that the motion was submitted from the Ministerial corner. I , for one, however, wish to know why the Commonwealth should have to pay so much for the carriage of its over-sea mails? honourable member trust the Government to inform him? General in the late Government informed representatives of the press a little time ago that an attempt was being made by the Orient Company to rob Australia sum of money from the Commonwealth in respect of the mail service than was justifiable. ""rob"" was not used. of the words which the late Postmaster General used when dealing with the question. The honourable member for Parramatta is not always very careful in the choice of his words, but I am quite prepared to accept all responsibility for any statement. I may make. It is well known that until quite recently we paid £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 per annum for the carriage of our mails between Australia and the United Kingdom, and that the Orient Company endeavoured to extract £ r 5 o , o o o a year from the Government in respect of this service. Those who are always ready to raise the socialistic bogey asserted that the demand for an increased subsidy was due to the trend of socialistic legislation-fha t f t was practically the result of the provision in the Post and Telegraph Act that black labour shall not be employed on subsidized mail steamers. chagrin, however, they found that the companv would not support them in that contention. The company itself admitted that the demand for an increased subsidy was not due to the white labour provisions of the Act. M.r. DUGALD THOMSON -The honourable member is wrong in his figures. We formerly paid, not £ 7 0 . 0 0 0 , but ,£85,000 per annum for this service. the company for demanding a subsidy of £150,00 0 was not that they would in future be required to employ only white labour, but that they were losing money on the Australian service. They wished the Postal Department practically to make j up a guarantee equal to 5 per cent, on the Capitalized lvalue of their Australian service. order. It is a well-known rule, Mr Speaker, that we may not anticipate a matter that is already set down for discussion Cannot the on the notice-paper. The honourable member is now dealing with the amount of the subsidy required for the carriage of mails under the contract recently entered into by the Postmaster-General, and which contract,according to the statement made this afternoon by the Minister, will be submitted to the House in the course of a day COOK -What? or two. I submit that the honourable member may not traverse that phase of the question at length, as he appears to be doing. Then the word bet for Parramatta is correct in saying that no discussion which anticipates the debate on notice of motion No. 2 of Government business can now take place. The honourable member for Grey can discuss the question of the mail contracts only in so far as it relates to the motion for the appointment of a Select Committee. I had exceeded my right in this respect, and I venture to submit that the whole question of the carriage of mails may be reviewed under cover of this motion. I do not intend, however, to assist the opponents of the proposal in their desire to delay the appointment of the Select Committee. The Orient Company now charge something like £ 8 0 0 for the carriage of a ton of mail matter to England, although they will carry a ton of merchandise at from £ 1 to £ 3 . As a matter of fact, the charge which they make for the carriage of frozen produce is only about £ 4 per ton Much to their lowed for the conveyance of the mails? ber will find that for some years very little saving of time has taken place. We have now entered into a contract with the Orient Company for the carriage of our mails from Australia to the United Kingdom at a cost of £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 per annum.

There is no possibility of a Committee obtaining information in regard to the question from any source which is not available to the Governpersonnel of* the Committee makes it, not ment. So far as passengers are concerned, they may very well be left to look after themselves. Those who travel on the mail boats between Australia and the old country are not the class of persons about whom honourable members like the socialistic member for Barrier concern themselves. What we are all concerned about, however, is fhe carriage of cargo. Seeing how much Australia is dependent upon. her. export trade, the carriage of cargo from Australia to England and other countries is a matter of very great concern to her producers. But I ask the honourable member for Barrier how the proposed Select Committee can obtain any information, on this subject which could not be obtained from Sussex-street. Svdney, or from Flinders-street, Melbourne. 'Has he any idea as to tbe present rates of freight prevailing? I undertake to saythat neither he nor six of the other proposed members of the committee, if they were questioned on the subject, would be able to inform the House what rates are paid now for the carriage of perishable produce from Australia to London. The only two members whom it is proposed to appoint to the committee who have any knowledge in connection with the subject are the honourable members for Flinders and all information about the carriage of mails, the passenger traffic does not concern us, and for an investigation into the carriage of cargo, the honourable member for Barrier should at least have procured the services big producing interests of Australia.

Line 9,","The proposal of the honourable member for Barrier, as amended by the Prime Minister, has the entire approval of the acting leader of the Opposition, and the suggested inquiry is one which, on the face of it , should be supported, because, if there is one thing about which the public and Parliament should have f u l l and complete information, it is the conditions under which mails, passengers, and cargo, are conveyed from Australia to the old world. We must necessarilv have such information before we can endorse any new contracts with steam-ship companies. We wish to know how the increasing requirements of Australia are being met, and whether there is any truth in the statement which is continually being made by newspaper writers and public men, that Australia is suffering loss by her White Ocean policy. We wish also to know what is the effect on the cqgt of the mail service of requiring compliance with certain provisions in regard to carriage of perishable produce. to know whether the best machinery available is being used, and why the subsidy has been increased. honourable memberi may not discuss this quesquainted with the contents of a book which tion of mail subsidy. ber for Boothby is not discussing the merits bers have not time to wade through the or demerits of the contract for the conveylarge number of publications which are disance of mails entered into by the Comtributed throughout Australia, and it is demonwealth with the Orient Steam Navisirable that the salient facts in regard to gation Company; he is merely expresmatters of high public importance should sing his desire to know why the subsidy be prominently brought before them by is being increased.

I have been told by a member of a State Government-no t a member of the Labour Party-that the practice has arisen of buying up cargo, space in some of the ocean steamers, and retailing it to producers at higher rates; in fact, cornering cargo space. If the proposed Committee can show that it is possible to insert a clause in future contracts, which will overcome that difficulty, some good will have been accomplished. ready a clause in existing contracts which is intended to obviate any possibility of undue monopoly of space. the appointment of the Committee appears to me to be such a reasonable one that I cannot understand the opposition to it, except, of course, such as may come from the honourable and le'aihed member for Corinella, and the honourable member for North Sydney, who were members of the Government which entered into the contract with the Orient Company. orable members who oppose the proposal because its original objective was socialistic in character are taking up a most illogical position. The motion does not now bear a socialistic complexion. the names suggested are concerned. that I do not know what "" Socialism"" means. I have given up all attempts to distinguish between what is socialistic and what is not. The word "" socialistic'' has become positively meaningless. It has been used to describe proposals of all kinds. I thoroughly agree with the motion, because I. am sure ihat it is intended to secure an absolutely fair inquiry by an impartial tribunal.

Is there not a straight and clear intent in that motion? Is it not a question as to whether the Commonwealth, in addition to other experiments already made or proposed, should carry its many powers and influences, and its rights of ownership, beyond its own borders, over the seas of the world ? able members must, judge from their respective stand-points whether.such an inquiry is necessary. Now an entirely new proposal is made. WhatI have mentioned is not now the professed intent. Hontent still, all the same. said to be the intent now, but there are two ways of arriving at the one end.

How can he achieve his object? through the personnel of the Committee. What is the proposed' constitution of that body ? the result of its inquiry practically a foregone conclusion. I agree with other honourable members who have stated that we are incurring a great deal too much expense in connection with the appointment of Select Committees and Royal Commissions, and that, in many cases, these bodies are finding out-as was mentioned by the honourable member for Boothby-wha t was thoroughly well-known and what had been published to the world prior to their creation. alluded to the discovery by the ""Old Age Pensions Cbmmission that the cost of the old-age pension system in New South Wales was enormously in excess of that of Victoria. heard the right honourable member for Balaclava allude to it. Further, it has been mentioned in the Parliament of New South Wales, and it will be found in the reports of the Statistician of that State. Yet the Commission apparently considers that it has made a discovery. ' I do not say that Select Committees which have been appointed have not accomplished useful work, but I do claim that if ever there was work for aGovernment to do it is that which is outlined in the motion under consideration-assuming , of course, that the proposal is legitimate. If , on the'other hand', it is intended only as a means by whidh the purchase of a Commonwealth fleet of steamers may be recommended, that is an entirely different matter. The only opportunity that the House can have of ascertaining whether or not that is the object is by the constitution of the Committee. th? honourable member think that the Opposition ought to have serving upon it? say how many should come from any particular side.

Obviously would settle the matter. members. opinions of the five members suggested are identical, why appoint a Committee ? Why not send in the report ?

In that connection, I say that its appointment would be likely to place the Government in a position simiThe honourable member for Boothby lar to that which was occupied'by the late Ministry.

The Ministry ought to be setting about that work at once. They ought not to await the report of any Committee. If they do so they will again be placed in the unfortunate position of having to conclude a new contract with greater haste than should be necessary. That is not desirable. I am opposed to the appointment of the Committee, because I think that it will involve an unnecessarv expense unless there is some charge attached to the motion. If a charge is attached to it. by all means let it be inquired into, but. if not, the appointment of the proposed body will constitute an unnecessary expense. It is not within the powers of a Committee to ascertain as effectively as a Government what can be done in the way of cheapening the mail subsidy.

They have no such powers. How then could they handle the question better than could the Government? I believe that we should hold the Ministry responsible for entering into contracts for the conveyance of our mails. Let them use the powers which they have for that purpose-power s which are greater than those which anySelect Committee can possess-and let them submit their proposals to the House. Of course, I recognise that that is not the object of the motion.

In order that there may be no further repetition cf the misstatement, or of the ill-feeling which r may be aroused by it , I wish to quote from the proceedings of the recent Inter-State Labour Conference, to which the honourable member referred.

AlthoughI am not going, to lose sight of the importance of the question in so f a r as it relates to the carrying of mails or passengers, I wish to emphasize the necessity for some such inquiry as suggested, in the interests, not only of our producers, but of all others concerned with the carriage of cargo between Australia and Great Britain.

218,Mr Carpenter,"That is so, ando f goods to and from Australia. I wish to quote from a report recently presented to the Governor of Western Australia by -a Royal Commission on Ocean Freights, which was appointed by the Government of that State. take the evidence of that Commission, instead of having a repetition of their inquiry ? mission has done for Western Australia should be done by us for the whole Commonwealth. It is remarkable that the Commission mentioned as one of the possible solutions of existing evils the ownership and control of a line of steamers by the Government of the Commonwealth. The situation has become so bad in Western Australia that traders in that State appear to be almost at their wits' ends to know what to do in order to secure the carriage of their freights at a reasonable rate. Among the recommendations made by the Commission was the following: Whilst your Commissioners would welcome the establishment of an Australian Mercantile Fleet under Commonwealth control for the transport of mails and cargo between Australia and the United Kingdom, capable of being commissioned in time of war, we believe this ideal is not within measurable distance at present. If that Commission, after taking evidence bearing on the shipping trade of only one State, was convinced that the owning and control of a fleet of mercantile steamers by the Commonwealth would prove a solution of the existing difficulty, surely, out of respect to that Commission and to the people whom it represented, we have a right to ask that an investigation shall Vie made on behalf of the Commonwealth. If time permitted I could quote instances of oppression on the part of shipping combines-o r the shipping ring, as it is called --that would open the eyes of honourable members. I shall not say that that which -applies to Western Australia applies to the whole of the Commonwealth, but it cannot be gainsaid that the shipping trade between Australia and Great Britain is in the hands of a ring or combine of shipping brokers-no t of ship-owners-wh o absolutely fix rates at their own sweet w ill. ' that system is that a cargo can be brought from America vid Liverpool to Australia below the freight charged on a cargo direct -from England to Australia. appointment of a Select Committee to ascertain that fact. Select Committee should do for the whole of Australia what this Commission did for ber mean to say that, after transhipment at Liverpool, a cargo from America to Australia costs less than does a cargo from England to Australia direct? freights for the carriage of cargo from America and Germany to Australia are much lower than are those for the carriage of cargo from England to Australia, and that in consequence of this our trade with Great Britain is suffering. The people of America can send their goods from New York to Liverpool, and thence to Australia, at a lower rate than that at which goods can be sent directly from England to Australia. quite correct. facts, it is time that an inquiry was made in the interests not only of the producers, but of the consumers of Australia. I need not remind honourable members that business men-merchant s and shopkeepers who have to pay these additional freightspass on the increased charges to the consumer ; they actually make a profit on the higher freight they pay. The consumer, therefore, is doubly hit every time he makes a purchase. When the Commonwealth took over the Postal Department, we discovered somewhat to the surprise of many people, that we had been paying a very large annual subsidy to the mail steamers for the carriage, not only of postal matter, but of produce. There was considerable friction when the Government attempted to differentiate between a contract for the conveyance of mails and one which also included provision for large cold storage space on board the mail steamers. I am not going to say that, in any contract we may make, we should not pay due regard to the necessity of securing cool storage on mail steamers, and every possible facility for the carriage of our produce to England; but I do say that, as a Commonwealth Parliament, we have no right, under the guise of entering into a mail contract, to pay a large sum for something which is really no part of such a contract..

The honourable member has again referred to the"" oversea mail contract which is to be dealt with at a later stage, and two honourable members have already been ruled out of order for doing so.

Is it the honourable member's desire to continue his remarks at a later date? the House that the honourable member have it, after I had read the proposal of the leave to continue his remarks at a later Treasurer, made at the Hobart Conference, date? Leave granted; debate adjourned. That, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable1. That Commonwealth Treasury notes should be issued, on the lines of the Treasuryf e r cafita for buildings taken over in every other notes issued by the State of Queensland. 2. That a reserve fund should be established for payment of the notes on demand; provision for similar payment being now in force in the Queensland Treasury. 3., That instead of such issue being put intocirculation as in Queensland by being, lent to financial institutions at the rate of 2 per cent, per annum, the proposed notes shall be issued on a populationbasis to the several State Treasurers, I rise to a point of order. and each Treasurer shall credit the amount received as on account of the properties transferred to the Common, wealth. 4. That4 per cent, of the issue shall be withdrawn from circulation each year and cancelled, and that a sufficient sum I am not aware that each year shall be granted for the purpose of such cancellation. I have been following this question ever sinqe Queensland issued Treasury notes in 1893, and, in bringing forward my proposal, I am fully aware of the difficulties of the subject and its importance to the so; but so long as they Commonwealth. The scheme has naturally been talked about. It has been discussed as if my object were merely to provide funds for the taking over of fhe transferred properties, and thereby the liquidating of the debts of the States; but that is incidental only. The scheme aims, in the first I have not replace, at establishing a Commonwealth issue of paper money. Mr Coghlan, at page 813 of the latest edition of his Australian statistics, speaking of the Australian note circulation, says that if the notes were guaranteed by the Commonwealth, and made a legal tender, their probable issue might be set down as £6,750,000, the present note circulation of the Commonwealth' being o n l y £3>8oo,ooo. The conference of bankers held in Sydney in 1895 made a proposal of a similar nature. If the Commonwealth chooses, it can setgoing £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 more of currency, which w ill be as good as gold. My proposal was and referred to in the Budget debate last session. He is reported, at page 6145 of Vol. XXII . of Hansard, to have then saidWe ought never to forget that the Commonwealth and the States are composed of the same people, and that, therefore, if we have to pay any State a sum of money for buildings, not only has that State to contribute towards the payment for its own buildings, but that also it has to pay State. I cannot look upon it as a sound business transaction, that we should borrow a large sum of money in order to pay for the buildings transferred from the States to the Commonwealth, in order to distribute that money amongst the States, thus placing upon them the obligation to pay interest, and to repay the capital borrowed within",30,Thomson Ca N We Not Western Australia

To show the need for something of this kind being done, I wish to quote from the speech delivered by the right honourable member for Balaclava, on joth June, 1902, when introducing his Loan Bill. Vol. X . of Hansard, to have saidWhen certain Departments were transferred, works were being proceeded with in most of the States, and were being paid for out of loan funds financing any very urgent works out of the Treasurer's advance vote. Further on, he says-a t page 13433This expenditure is to be charged against all the States on a population basis, and therefore we could not allow the works to remain in abeyance in the poorer States while proceeding with those required in the States which are in a better positionWhile on page 13434, he is reported to have saidI f we adopt the practice which has been suggested of providing these large sums from revenue, I am perfectly certain that we shall leave the States in a difficult position view of their present condition, it would be exceedingly unwise for us to take any such step. These statements did not induce this House to pass the LoanB ill ; but if they were justifiable then, they are justifiable now, for nothing has been done to remedy the sad position of affairs which he pictured. All the States, except perhaps Western Australia, have paid in interest more than the sum total of their borrowings, and yet they all owe, and are likely to continue to owe, the f u l l amount borrowed. I come now to the bedrock of my motion-the Commonwealth Treasury note issue. In dealing vyith this subject, I shall not quote academic authorities for or against what I advocate. I shall rely upon accomplished facts, and the attempts to float loans which have failed, to show that there is good reason for my proposal. To put before the House the main facts on which I rely, I must go back to the financial crash of 1893. The financial institutions of Australia, with three notable exceptions-the Bank of New South Wales, the Bank of Australasia, -and the Union Bank were then largelv assisted by the Governments of the day in rallying from that disaster. I shall not burden the House with an account of what was done in that direction in the five southern States, but shall refer only to the case of Queensland, where prompt and effective measures were adopted for relieving immediate difficulties. 4S3 taken were remarkable and bold, but not original. The Government of Queensland, by their Treasury notes scheme, have demonstrated to Australia that it is perfectly right and proper for the State fo issue a paper currency. He is reported, at page 13431, of The Administration of the day were anxious to avert the threatened collapse and restore public confidence. It. was decided that public faith in paper money must be restored, and therefore the Government In the meantime, I am commenced their task by taking the issue of paper money into their own hands. It had been proved that such a public convenience as paper money ought not to be dependent upon the temporary financial condition of eight or ten banks, and the Government doubtless realized that, inasmuch as the Bank of England issued all the bank notes required in England, the State Treasury might appropriately fill the gap in Queensland. Arrangements were made for a Government note issue. The bank note duty of 4 per cent, was abolished, and a prohibitive duty of 10 per cent, was imposed In on all banks wishing to continue their own note issues. Three Bills, were promptly introduced by the Government, and became law, viz., the Treasury Notes Advance Act, the Treasury Notes Act, and the Treasury Bills Act. Under the first measure, any bank which had stopped payment, or its manager or liquidator, could apply for an advance of Treasury notes to redeem from public circulation its own discredited notes, provision being made for ultimate repayment to the Queensland Treasurer. The Treasury Notes Act provided that the Treasurer should hold gold to the amount of one-fourth of the value of any notes issued, and should also issue Treasury Bills signed and ready for sale. The Bills were to be vested in trustees until required. Section3 of the Treasury Notes Act reads as follows:All such Treasury notes made, issued, and circulated in pursuance of this Act shall be issued from and bear date at the Colonial Treasury of Queensland, and shall be payable in specie on demand at the Colonial Treasury. Treasury notes made, issued, or re-issued under the authority of this Act shall be everywhere in Queensland good legal tender of money, by all persons other than the Colonial Treasurer, at the Colonial Treasury, to the amount therein expressed to be payable. Section4 providesThe Governor in Council may, from time to The steps time, apply any sum or sums of money to arise from any such Treasury notes to any service authorized to be defrayed out of the Consolidated Revenue of the Colony, or out of loans authorized by Parliament. The Act also provided for departmental regulations being formulated whereby notes would be handed out to the banks requiring them, which had to deposit with the Treasurer gold representing one-third of the value of the notes issued, and to pay 2 per cent, interest on the remaining two-thirds df the value. The Treasury Bills Act authorized the issue of Treasury bills, to be vested in trustees, for the same amount as the proposed issue of notes. required, are still intact, and can be utilized to raise money if required. At the end of the first year's work the Auditor General, in his report on the Treasury notes, said that £240,600 of the reserved gold could be placed out at interest. This advice was unheeded by the Queensland Government. The next year the Auditor General reported that £250,000 of gold was unnecessarily idle. He also said that he realized that the Act was not intended to produce revenue. The Queensland Act was such a success that the money rolled in all the time, and the first impulse of the Queensland Government was to lend the surplus money to the banks. The accumulation of this gold had been brought about without expenditure on the part of the Government, excepting only the cost of the notes and office expenses, amounting to about £2,000 per annum. The unused notes of the banks were bought by the Government' and faced with the Treasurer's 'promise to pay, and for several months Queenslanders endured that makeshift. I propose to quote some particulars from the report of the Auditor General of 1903 as to the revenue produced by the Treasury note system. The interest on Treasury notes, amounting to £388,833, lent to the banks at 2 per cent., yielded ^7,776 13s.; the interest on Treasury notes gold, amounting to £50,000, lent to the Royal Bank at 3 per cent., yielded £1,500; the interest on Treasury notes gold, amounting to £100,000, lent to the Bank of New South Wales for six months at z\ per cent., yielded £1,250; the interest on Treasury notes gold, amounting to £75,000, lent to the Bank of New South Wales for another six months at and he shall have abundance; but from him that i\ per cent., produced £937 ios.; and inhath not shall be taken away even that which/ terest on Government debentures, amounting he hath. to £300,400, at 3& per cent., yielded The banks in the United States having inMrC til pin. £10,514; the total being £21,978 3s. 4dIn addition to these sums, there was £40,000 at current account, which produced no interest, and the reserve money, amounting to £336,208. The next year an addition was made to the Government debentures bought with Treasury notes, and the amount increased to £386,522. With the exception of the £388,833 of notes lent to banks at 2 per cent, interest, there has been sufficient money held to pay off every note with gold. The Government have very properly invested some of their surplus cash, and £40,000 has been generously placed on current account without These bills have never been interest. Coghlan says that in 1893 the average bank note circulation in Australia was £3,912,062, the Queensland share of this amountbeing £458,236. At present the note circulation of Australiaamounts to £3,844,866, of which Queensland is credited with £620,000. It would appear from this that Treasury notes aremore acceptable to Queenslanders than are bank notes to the people of the other States. The bank note duty realizes in Victoria £18,434, in New South Wales £28,743, in South Australia £8,055, in Western Australia £7,852, and in Tasmania £3,262, the total for the five States being £66,346. The revenue derived by Queensland from the Treasury note issue is equal to one-third of the total amount realized by the bank note tax in the other States, whereas the population of Queensland amounts to only one-eighth of that of the Commonwealth. I should like to say a few words with regard to the different note systems. The Bank of England practically has a monopolv of the note issue of Great Britain, and all the joint stock banks must go to that institution for their paper currency. This phase of the question is overlooked by bank advocates, who wish to retain paper money as a bank privilege. The Queensland Government have adopted the position of the Bank of England as an issuer of notes. In the United Statesthe practice adopted is the reverse of that followed in England. In the United States a bank which deposits Government bondscan issue notes of an equal value. Thisis a case to which the oft-quoted text may be appliedFor unto every one that hath shall be given,, terest-bearing bonds are privileged to issue rcotes, but the borrower who has not the wherewithal to carry on is often stripped and turned out a beggar. It will be necessary to explain a simple phrase used by bankers, and applied to a great instrument -of profit making. I refer to "" t ill money."" This does not refer to money in the t ill , hut to that great power which banks of issue exercise to create money on paper, namely, credit, when they can use it to advantage. The United States banks and the English joint stock banks have to pay for their "" t i ll money."" The Bankers' Conference held in Sydney in 1895, at which the bankers of Victoria and New South Wales were represented, proposed to amend the Australian note issue, to obtain Government endorsement for their notes, and to pay the Government a better price for the privilege. They asked that £ 2 , 2 5 0 , 0 0 9 worth of notes should be ranked as notes for circulation, and a further £ 2 , 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 worth should be given to the banks to hold as "" till money."" This would have given the banks notes to the value of £ 4 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 . So that the bankers themselves practically admit that we want more note issue. Every bank in England, except a remnant of privileged note issuers, wanting any form of till money can only get it by paying for it at Threadneedle-street. Morton Breckenridge, the champion of the Canadian banks, says in VolumeX . of the publications of the American Economic Association, page 402How great is the saving of interest on the hard following terms:cash which, without the ability to use unissued notes, the banks would be obliged to hold as t ill money, is not particularly difficult to calculate. On the following page he saysI f the banks were deprived of this advantage, it is safe to say that they would De obliged to withdraw some $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 now .employed in the trade and industry of Canada. I quote these passages to show what till Canada is at one with some honourable money means. Now, for the other side members opposite upon that question. The of the shield. When Treasury notes were Dominion notes are backed by 15 per cent, first issued in Queensland, the three strong of gold, and 10 per cent, of Dominion debanks I have named, hoped, by refusing bentmes guaranteed by the British Goto touch State notes, that they would cause vernment. These notes throughout Canada the scheme to f a i l . In doing so they deare treated as the equivalent of gold just as liberately deprived themselves of till Bank of England notes are in England. money, or its substitute, Treasury notes, Morton Breckenridge gives equal value at 2 per cent., instead of their own bank to them in notes at 4 per cent, and till money gratis. which will be found upon page 430 of ""There is no till money in Queensland, but Vol. X of a publication by the American the bank-note rate was 4 per cent., and Economic Associationthe banks were allowed to use an equal siumber of notes as till money upon which July, 1894, the amount of specie and Dominion they paid no duty. Now, in Queensland, every note has to be accounted for, either in gold, or by paying 2 per cent, interest upon it . I take it that that rate of interest, which is an extremely low one, is equivalent to giving the banks t i ll money. These banks imported gold, and for twelve years they have not taken any State notes at 2 per cent. those three banks? New South Wales, the Bank of Australasia, and the Union Bank. A champion of these banks, writing to the Brisbane Courier in April, 1903, complained that for every Treasury note they used, £ 2 in gold had to be paid That seems to be a verycurious statement, but from their point of view it is actually correct. They had been using a promise to pay £ r on demand, so long that to do so they considered was their privileged right, and when they redeemed their promise by paying £ 1 , and then paid £ 1 for a Treasury note, their innocent champion said that they were paying £ 2 for a Treasury£ 1 note. The Canadian system was referred to by our first Treasurer, the right honourable member for Balaclava, in introducing the LoanB ill , and last session my leader intimated that he favoured proposals in that direction. ""Confiscation"" was the epithet applied to his proposal. Morton Breckenridge speaks of the Canadian Dominion notes held by banks as the 40 per cent, reserve in the The Government have forced from the banks a permanent loan without interest of from $10,000,000 to $14,000,000. Again, he saysThe justice of a forced loan for 16 per cent, to 22 per cent, ot the entire banking capital of the Dominion need not be examined. It is evident that the banks' champion in the following passage For the four and a half years preceding ist",32,Commonwealth Treasur Y Notes

The lowest percentage shown by the Bank statement was 8; the highest io'o8 per cent. This, it will be observed, is quite as high as the proportion of money kept on hand by the English Joint Stock Banks, although for most of them, gold, and its practical equivalent, Bank of England notes, are the only till money, and form part of their business machinery. I should like honourable members to notice that gold and Bank of England notes, as notes, are phrased together as of equal value. give one entry for specie and Dominion notes, and one sum only embracing both denominations. is Canada. minion notes can issue £ 1 0 0 of its own notes'. Honourable members opposite call that ""confiscation."" WhatI wish to see is the whole of the £ 1 0 0 issued by tlie Commonwealth. The amount of gold held in Queensland shows that a one-fourth gold reserve is unnecessarily high. I would allow the reserve to be one-fifth, which ^ 33'3 per cent, higher than the reserve gold held for Dominion notes by the Canadian Government. Canada there is what is called a bank redemption guarantee fund of 2\ per cent, for two years, making 5 per cent, upon the amount of bank notes issued. Maritime. Bank failed in 1887, and its dollar notes sold for 40 cents. This is not likelv to occur to Dominion notes, Queensland notes, or to our notes when we get them. If the privilege of using our own notes is attached to the scheme, so that our Treasurer can pay them away, we can arrange a reserve without difficulty. £11,000,000 each year, and 1 per cent, of that amount, replaced by a portion of our note issue, will give us our reserve. Morton Breckenridge's statement in reference to banks applies to us. He saysThe only way for a bank to get its notes in circulation is to pay them over its counter in the ordinary course of business. The Panama Canal trouble, which was referred to last week in the Sydney Morning Herald, is analogous to the position which we have here. The railway combine, realizing that the canal imperils their supremacy, by buying over the engineers, and slandering the canal, are doing their best to block its success. We have to recollect also that all practical men in finance are [REPRESENTATIVES.] Treasury Notes. trained, employed, or interested in financial institutions, and we must expect difficulty in getting our side advocated by other than laymen like myself. Bank notes are used by bankers in the place of specie money, at the risk of the people, for the bankers' benefit. If paper money is used by the people's Government, the risk borne carries a corresponding advantage. The Government reap the profit on behalf of the people. That the Commonwealth wants money is shown by the attempts which have been well as specie' and Dominion made to get a loan sanctioned. I have shown that, according to Coghlan, over Again, banking return forms £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 more of note issue can be used if an absolutely reliable security is ofis quoted fered. Further, I have pointed out that There in Queensland, where good, indefeasible no tax on the note issue in paper alone is used, the profit therefrom A bank holding £ ' 4 0 of Doto the Government-the profit from that one-eighth of Australia-is one-third as much as the other seven-eighths get from their paper money. The redemption of notes is a necessary feature of my scheme. A promise to pay is all the better if after one, ten. Or fifteen, or twenty years the amount involved must be paid. that ? was not present during the delivery of the first portion of my address, otherwise he would realize what a saving in interest Yet the would be effected by the adoption of my scheme. When we borrow we neglect to pay back our loans, but we must pay our interest, and this periodic cancellation is only equivalent in burden to that which we now pay in interest alone, although every penny we spent in that wav would be a net reduction of our debt. The low We handle price which our stock realizes in London would be a cause for rejoicing-no t for weeping. Our transactions-in stock for the future must be in buying-no t in selling. I cannot conclude my remarks without quoting the words used by Mr Justice O'Connor in introducing the Loan Bill in the Senate. They will be found recorded in Hansard, page 2691. of the first session of the Commonwealth Parliament. They read as follows :The best security we can possibly have is the security of the Government. I know that when he made that statement he was, as we used to say in the old country, ""putting the best side to London.""

We desire to dispose of the works and buildings estimates before tihe general estimates are dealt with. Previous experience has shown us that generally it is very late in the year before the Estimates are passed, and that very little time then remains within which to proceed with works for which provision is made, and -complete them before the end of the financial year. I think that the course we now propose is a good one, because it will enable us to place the works in hand at an early date, and probably obviate the necessity of coming to the House next year and -asking honourable members to revote large sums of money. delay in the construction of works arises from the neglect to push on with them. difficulty in pushing on with the works. In the first place, plan's and specifications have to be prepared, and the Department is not in a position to incur even this initial expenditure until the works have been approved. Therefore, no work can be legally put in hand until the Appropriation Bill has been passed. Honourable members will see at once that if plans and specifications were prepared at considerable cost for the erection of buildings, and .Parliament afterwards refused to sanction the expenditure, no money would be available for the payment of even the preliminary expenses. ever known of such a system haying been adopted in any other Parliament?""

Honourable members cannot say that they have not had notice of the intention of the Government in this direction, because I intimated about a fortnight ago that we intended to follow this course. There has been no whisper either from honourable members or from the press that any objection would be raised, and I trust that no technical objections will be brought forward to interfere with the passing of this appropriation. The works and buildings estimates, which are included in the schedule of the B ill , provide for an expenditure of £ 4 1 8 , 9 1 1 , as compared with-nearly £12,000,000 provided for in the general A great deal of the estimates. I do not see why we should delay proceeding with the proposed works until honourable members have talked for two or three months. The change which we have made is, I think, in the right direction. £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 of the money proposed to be appropriated will.be spent in wages? Sir JOHN FORREST I cannot say the exact amount, but necessarily a large sum will be spent in wages, because buildings can only be constructed by the employment of labour, which, of course, has to be paid for . I cannot see any practical objection fo the course we are adopting. Honourable members will see by reference to the schedule that under the Treasurer the Department of Trade and .Customs, provision is made for a revote of £ 1 , 9 7 9 , and for the expenditure of £ 1 8 5 upon new I cannot say services. Under the head of the Defence Department, it is proposed to revote £ 2 6 , 2 4 5 , and to appropriate for new services, £ 4 0 , 2 7 1 . In the Post and Telegraph Department, it is proposed to. revote £ 2 3 , 5 6 5 , and to devote to new services £ 5 6 , 0 1 6 ; the total being £ 1 4 8 , 2 6 1 , of which revotes represent £ 5 1 , 7 8 9 . It is anticipated that £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 of the total amount will not be expended during the year. It is proposed to appropriate for the construction of telegraph and telephone lines, £169,150 , but it is anticipated that £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 of this amount will not be expended during the year.

I trust tHat we shall be able to spend this money during the current financial year. construction of the fort at North Fremantle was not 'spent last year, because the site was not acquired, and not because of the delay in passing the vote. the site was selected two years ago by Major-General Sir Edward Hutton. is perfectly correct. to revote £ 9 , 9 0 0 for post-offices in New South Wales, £ 4 , 9 3 7 for post-offices in Victoria, £ 1 , 2 9 9 for post-offices in Queensland, £ 1 , 7 5 4 for post-offices in South Australia, and £ 5 , 6 7 5 for post-offices in Western Australia. were voted last year, but the works could not be completed because of the short time that elapsed between the passing of the Appropriation Act and the end of the financial year. I do not think it is desirable that we should repeat the same operation year after year. All these works for which these sums are to be appropriated have already been approved by the House^ and still we have to come back and ask that the money shall be revoted. Under the head of new works, it will be seen that provision is made for fortifications and other defence works in New South Wales to the extent of £ 9 , 9 2 2 , and that it is proposed to spend in Victoria£ 1 0 , 3 5 6 ; in Queensland, £ 3 , 8 2 1 ; in South Australia, £ 3 , 3 8 1 ; in Western Australia, £ 1 1 , 2 4 7 ; and in Tasmania, £ 1 , 5 4 4 .

I may mention that provision is made in the amount voted for the Postmaster-General's Department for £ 3 0 , 0 0 6 for the construction of a trunk telephone line from Sydney to Melbourne. It is proposed to expend £ 1 5 , 0 0 0 upon telephone lines in Queensland, and £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 upon similar works in South Australia, whilst £ 6 , 0 0 0 is appropriated for telegraph lines, and £17,000 for telephone lines in Western Australia. Under the heading of Defence, it is anticipated that there will be an expenditure of £ 1 4 0 , 0 0 0 , in accordance with the plan which is being carried out for providing special up-to-date armament and material, and for placing our land forces upon a war footing. It is expected that we shall spend that amount this year, although, if it is possible to obtain the requisite arms and armament within that period, the expenditure will be £181,060. As I remarked the other evening, we are nearing the time when we shall have completed the scheme for I know that what I state placing our land forces upon a war footing, so far as their equipment with arms and armament of the most approved type is concerned. My colleagues will be able to explain to honourable members any details in the Bill connected with their various Departments. The measure provides, I am sorry to say, only for the few works which All these amounts the Commonwealth is able to carry out. Those works will be constructed out of revenue, and the expenditure upon them represents even less than the amount for which I have been accustomed to ask in a small State. Seeing that we are only asking the Committee to authorize an expenditure of £ 4 1 8 , 9 1 1 upon wcfrks for the whole of the Commonwealth, 1 do not think that any one can charge us with extravagance.

I am totally opposed to the course which the Government propose to take in connection with them. I am not opposed to reasonable despatch in the voting of supplies for necessary works, and I deeply regret that I have to place myself in antagonism to the Government upon this matter, for the simple reason that I anticipate there will come, from some quarters of the House as reasons for the urgency of the course which the Government are adopting, the cry that people are out of work and want it.

He regrets that he has not millions to scatter over a smiling Australia. He says that he is adopting this course because it is a convenient one.

He has already shown a very decided disposition to make a new departure in connection with the delivery of his Budget. move the control of the finances from the House. No doubt that would be a very convenient practice, and the more a Government is inclined to be extravagant, the more convenient it would be. What are the facts of the case? The Treasurer submitted the whole of the financial policy of the Government to us two days ago. It has occupied a whole year in preparation. from the stand-point of the honourable member, but from my point of view it is perfectly correct. I say that the Treasurer's statement, as presented to us, shows the working of the Commonwealth Departments over a whole year. altered his original statement. that statement a little. I say that from that stand-point the Treasurer's statement is the result of the year's operation of the Departplease, but certainly not before. That is ments. If it has taken the Departments a whole year to formulate these proposals, is it fair to ask us at two days' notice to vote huge sums of money, involving large matters of Government policy, in this hasty manner? We have had no time to peruse the various items contained in the Estimates. They have been placed before us, and we are asked, forsooth, to vote the money and to discuss any question of policy which may be concerned subsequently. The other night the Treasurer agreed to an adjournment of the Budget debate for a week to enable the ex-Treasurer-the right honourable member for Balaclava-to peruse the statement submitted to the House. discuss this matter, but the honourable member took precedence of him. the ex-Treasurer will be able to answer for himself, and I have yet to learn that the honourable and learned member for Corio is so much of ai thought-reader as to know the intentions of the right honourable gentleman. member for Balaclava rose to address the.

Can we again discuss these matters after the money has been voted ? Will it be of any use jEor us to do so? I venture to say that we are wrongly discussing the whole matter now. We qannot possibly discuss these large'questions of policy so hurriedly, and with the small amount of information that is now in our possession. I am not complaining of the wisdom of dealing with these works estimates at the earliest possible moment. I do not wish to be misunderstood upon that point. I agree that every expedition should be used, consistent with the duty cast upon us of thoroughly investigating the items. But I submit that they should only be dealt with after there has been a thorough discussion of the whole of the Budget proposals-immediately , after that has taken place, if honourable members the point I take in connection with the whole matter. What was done last year? It is well known that the ex-Treasurer has always urged that we should pass the Works Estimates as speedily as possible, on the ground that more time is thus given for the expenditure of the votes so passed, and that the Treasurer feels that he has greater freedom in dealing with the money. The action taken last year by the Government may have suggested the course now proposed to be followed, but the two cases are altogether different. If the Government would pursue the policy that was adopted by the late Government, I should have no complaint whatever and no ground of quarrel with the Treasurer.

I can conceive of nothing more disastrous ""to the finances of Australia than the pursuance of a policy that may have been advantageous in the early days ot Western Australia. I am not condemning the right honourable gentleman for anything that he 'did in Western Australia, but suggest that the position of the Parliament of that State is entirely ^different from that of the Commonwealth. Here we are acting, as trustees in monetary matters for the whole of the States. Our position is very different from that of those who are agreeing to the expenditure of Before we have any further voting away of large sums of money, the least we may ask the Government to do ""is to facilitate, the discussion of the Budget, and to finish the financial debate before proceeding to deal with these Estimates. The acting leader of the Opposition has forestalled me in the remarks which he has just made. I think that he has put the position very fairly, and forcibly. Government will not accuse me of desiring to prevent them from getting on with business, and it is my wish to facilitate the passing of these particular Estimates. My experience as Treasurer showed me that the effect Of passing these Estimates late in the vear, and of the Works Department not having ready in advance the necessary plans and specifications, so that the works for which Parliament voted money could be proceeded with directly the Works and Buildings Bill became law, was that the parliamentary appropriations could not be spent during the currency of the financial year. I therefore intimated, some time ago, that I intended to ask the House to deal with the works portion of the Budget proposals earlier than with the ordinary appropriations for the year j the former practice being to discuss the ordinary appropriations for the year, which took several weeks, before dealing with the works estimates. Now, however, we are asked to go from one extreme to the other., and to do what, in my opinion, it would be highly improper, I am as anxious as is any one to see necessary public works proceeded with, but it will not make any difference whether we pass these Estimates to-night or three weeks hence, because, before anything can. be done tenders must be accepted; and there is nothing in the world to prevent the Government from calling for tenders, and having everything ready a month hence, by which time. I am certain that the Estimates will have been passed, because a large part of the amount asked for fs made up of revotes for works in progress I admit that it is useless to fight the Government on. this question, because of their solid majority, but I urge the Prime Minister and the Treasurer not to 'attempt to rush these Estimates through. right honourable member suggest as the pro-' per time for their discussion? ing out that the Government will gain nothing by forcing through these Estimates now.

The be paid for by Victoria and New South Wales alone? ing to the practice of the last two years, expenditure of this kind, whether incurred in Western Australia or in any other State, is debited to the Commonwealth as a whole. The suggestion I make to the Government' is advanced in all friendliness, with a view to expediting the passing of the Estimates. We are to resume the debate on the Budget next Tuesday, and T am certain that the' Government do not anticipate that the Estimates now before us can be finally dealt with in the two or three hours of to-night's sitting, and the few hours at our disposal to-morrow. They perhaps could be forced through if they were nof properly discussed ; 1 but the Government would make a grave mistake if they adopted such a course.

377,Sir George Turner,"No. Accord'are my honourable friends on the corner benches that work shall be provided for the people, but such work cannot be proceeded -with until the Works Department has all preliminaries ready, so that it will be sufficiently early if we pass these Estimates in a month's time. honourable member see that preliminaries were advanced when he was in office? quently urged the Works Department to have their plans and specifications prepared in advance of the voting of money by Parliament ; but I found it difficult to get them not sanctioned by this House? to do so. My suggestion is that we should commence the financial debate on Tuesday next, and deal with the Budget proposals as a whole. We cannot fairly discuss proposals of great moment, such as the Budget, piecemeal; but that is what we are being asked to do. We must either pass these E stimates without discussion, and vote blindfolded, or we must properly consider them, in which case they will not have been dealt with by Tuesday next, when the debate -00 the Budget is to be resumed. I suggest, therefore, that they should be allowed .to stand over until the conclusion of the debate on the Budget, which probably will be concluded within a fortnight. My remarks on the Budget will be of the briefest character, because I have no desire to spin out the discussion on the Treasurer's statement, and I do not know that any honourable member desires to do so. Therefore a fortnight, and perhaps a week, will suffice for the Budget debate, and these Estimates can be brought forward immediately afterwards. In regard to them, T suggest to the Treasurer that he might advantageously follow the practice which I -adopted in connection with my first Budget, and which I intended to adopt in connection ' with the others, but found it impossible to do so, namely, to have a short statement -prepared, giving all the information available in regard to every proposed work,' and to circulate that statement amongst honourable members. If that is done,, probably nine out of ten of the proposals will be passed without discussion. I appeal to the Treasurer, and to my old friend the Prime Minister, not to try to force these Estimates through now. The Government have nothing to gain by doing that. No harm may be likely to come from passing this particular set of Estimates at this time, but to do so will establish what I think may be a dangerous precedent. While nothing will be gained by forcing the Estimates through, nothing will be lost by allowing their consideration to be postponed until after the Budget debate, because, in the meantime, plans and specifications can be got ready, and tenders advertised for, returnable, say, in three weeks or a month, by which time the Estimates will have been passed, and the money needed will be available. position of the poor people who go to the trouble of tendering for works which are works to be tendered for which are certain to be sanctioned by this House. the Estimates now? have no precedent for dealing with an important part of the Budget proposals before the statement of the Treasurer has been discussed . I was astounded when 1 I entered the Chamber, and found what was proposed. I shall not take any further part in opposing the action of the Government if they refuse my request; but I urge them, in their own interest, and in that of the Committee, to prevent the establishment of a dangerous precedent, by allowing the discussion of these Estimates to be postponed until the conclusion of the Budget debate, when we on this side of the Chamber will"" facilitate the passing of them, as much as men can do. the conclusion of the Budget debate ? diately afterwards.

For the present, we shall have to rely upon the Treasurer's advance, but I trust that honourable members will see that the course that we have proposed to follow with these votes is far from being opposed to any constitutional practice, and will be a convenient one.

The Prime Minister, in my opinion, for weakly yielding, deserved the rebuke which he received from the leader of the Opposition. Estimates were presented providing for revotes amounting to £ 5 1 , 0 0 0 for works which were authorized last year, and which should be proceeded with without any further delay, and yet the Prime Minister immediately complies with the request of the ex-Treasurer, and consents to set aside the business in hand.

In the present instance I think that the Prime Minister is to be commended for the course which he has taken. I am sure that if the honourable member for Kalgoorlie had been present during the sittings of the first Commonwealth Parliament he would have recognised that even his impetuosity, added perhaps to my own, would be quite powerless to coerce a House into doing something of which it does not approve. to ask the Treasurer whether he can give us any definite idea as to when this matter will again come up for consideration. The Prime Minister has stated that its discussion would be resumed after the right honourable member for Balaclava and two or three others had spoken upon the Budget. Upon the present occasion we had a f u l l day's notice,that these Estimates were coming on for consideration, and, although there are some matters in them which will excite no comment, there are others which may provoke discussion. In these circumstances, I ask that the resumption of the debate shall not be sprung upon the House without sufficient notice having been given. not regard the statement of the ex-Treasurer in the same light as does the Prime Minister. I think that the right honourable member for Balaclava gave the Committee the very best reason why we should pass this portion of the Estimates to-night. He assured us that everything is "" right as right can be""-so right that the Government could proceed to call for tenders for carrying out the works enumerated in the B ill : Personally, I am of opinion that we have been too long bound by bad precedents. I admit that we-ought to scrutinize these Estimates very carefully, but I am sure that if they had contained one-item which was open to challenge the Opposition would have found it long ago. The whole of yesterday's' silting was wasted in the discussion of a most trivial matter. If that is an indication of the way in wfiich' the work of the session is to be conducted, it is very difficult to hazard an opinion as to when these Estimates will be passed. If I thought that any important matter of policy was involved in any of the cate delay. Buti f such a thing could be suggested, I am sure that the watchful deputy leader of the Opposition would have mentioned it ere this. I do think that it is time we endeavoured to do a little more for those persons who at the present time are starving. We have been doing too little for them, and indulging in too much wrangling. In my opinion, we should pass these Estimates, and provide what employment we can for those who are so badly in need of it . to understand from the Prime Minister whether he intends to proceed with these works before the Budget debate has been concluded. finished ""within a reasonable time we do not intend to proceed with the larger works, but only with the minor works to which I have referred. MrM c CAY I see no reason why the Government should not undertake the responsibility of immediately proceeding with the smaller works, for which the plans are ready. AlthoughI am strongly opposed to the proposal to push these Estimates through before the Budget debate has taken place, for reasons which I shall mention in a moment, if I did not know that the practice of the Departments is such that they are not ready to proceed with the bulk of the works, I should be prepared to consider them. But the fact is that the Departments do not begin to get their plans and specification^ ready until the passing of the works estimates is assured. When I was Ministerial head of the Defence Department, I was preparing to issue instructions-so far as defence works .were concerned-that as soon as the Budget was introduced and the Estimates circulated, the plans and specifications of those works were to be got ready, in order that they might be proceeded with the moment that they were sanctioned. I am perfectly certainj, however, that that practice has not been followed in tlie Departments to any material extent.

That statement was repudiated by the Minister df Trade and Customs, who said that, as a matter of fact, all the money required for the works would be raised in Australia. During the interval I have had an opportunity to examine the evidence given before the Royal Commission on the Bonuses for Manufactures Bill, and find that my statement was absolutely correct. I do not propose to read Mr Darby's report bearing on this point unless it is the desire of the House that I should do so; but I am in receipt of a copy of the Trustees and Investors' Review for August, in which reference is made to this very question. It clearly shows that this money is not going to be raised in Australia, but will' really benefit an English syndicate. I specially commend the article to those who hold opinions similar to those entertained by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. The Trustees ^and Investors' Review is pubr lished purely in the interests of financiers, and those having funds to invest; it regards such schemes as this purely from a commercial stand-point, and it is, therefore, interesting to note that in dealing with this question it sets forth thatThe evidence of Mr Jamieson shows that the deposit was thoroughly examined by an English expert, Mr Darby, managing director of the Brymbo Steel Works, in England, who reported on behalf of English capitalistsNot Australian capitalistswho were prepared to find capital for establishing iron and steel works if the inquiry proved satisfactory. the article? this is a well-known publication.

I call the attention of honourable members to the concluding words of the last sentence, and propose later on to show that the ""other intolerable conditions "" to which the writer refers are really the socialistic provisions of this Bill.

What your that the Bill before us involves something mean is that there is a possibility we might ask more than an expenditure of £250,000. for more duty.

I have shown that Mr SandSo that the voracious promoters of this ford and others stated, when before the syndicate want not only a bonus but conCommission, that if the bonus system were not continued for a further period, or an currently equivalent duty imposed, the industry would have to be abandoned. That being the case, we are simply asked to throw away £250,000. In any event, that must be the result of the passing of this measure, because the Commonwealth itself will not derive a benefit, even to the extent of one farthing, from'Ihe proposed expenditure. Every penny will go to ,the enrichment of a private syndicate. There is no getting away from that fact. We may seek to gloss it over as we will, but the bald truth remains that this expenditure will serve* no national or public purpose, and is designed solely for private gain.

To ask us"" now to do without a bonus would be like offering a man a present and then taking it away. out my contention that this bonus is regarded as a present. Honourable members are practically proposing to make a present of £250,000 of the taxpayers' money to an English syndicate. To benefit Australia ? Not in the slightest degree. The payment of that money to the proposed company would not benefit a single man, woman, or child in Australia. It will swell the profits of a rich English syndicate, which, on the face of the evidence of their own experts, have a splendid property from which (they could derive high returns without the assistance of any grant from the Commonwealth. There is a very peculiar feature about the shares in this company^ practically no market value at present. They are supposed to be worth 2s. 6d, each, but it is expected that, if the bonus be granted, their value will be increased to £ 1 each. I do not propose to deal with this aspect of the matter at any greater length, because the ground has already been covered by the honourable member for New England. wish now to refer to some of the provisions of the Bill. Clause4 reads as follows:Where the rate of bounty is fixed on the value of the goods, their value shall be taken to be the same as the value of imported goods of the like kind and quality as ascertained for the purposes of Customs duties. This clause will require to be very carefully considered, because we must not have a repetition of the experience through which we have passed in connection with the imported harvesters, the values of which were If the artificially inflated' by the Minister on the recommendation of his officers. ber knows that the Minister had very good authority for his action. the Minister nor his officers had any warrant for. what they did, on the evidence of the papers in the case laid on the library The truth of the matter is that table, and we should be careful not to leave the door open for similar action on their part in regard to the valuation of imported iron goods. Clauses5 and 6 read as follows :The total amount of the bounties authorized to be paid in respect of any particular class of third column of the schedule opposite the description of that class of goods. No bounty, shall .be authorized to be paid on(a) Pig-iron, puddled bar-iron, or steel, made after the first day of January, One. thousand nine hundred and eleven; (i) Galvanized iron, wire netting, or iron or steel pipes or tubes, made after the first day of January, One thousand nine hundred and nine; (c) Reapers and binders made after the first For what purpose? day of July, One thousand nine hundred and seven. I have already pointed out that the evidence of men who are interested in the establishment of this industry shows the absolute farce of imposing a time limit within which the bonus shall operate. We know perfectly well that when the bonus is about to expire, an agitation will be raised for its continuance, in order to protect what will be termed a ""languishing"" industry. Is not that the experience, of , We find that they have every enterprise which has received artificial aid from the Treasury? Is it not our own experience in connection with the sugar bounty ? In thatconnexion, do we not find that long before the period during which the bounty is to operate has expired, an agitation has been created for its continuI ance, and did not the Government indicate in the Treasurer's Budget speech that they intend to make provision upon the Estimates for an extension of that period? What has happened in the case of the sugar bounty will occur in the case of the iron bonus. It is a perfect farce to insert a clause of that character when we know perfectly well, from the evidence of the very men who will receive this bonus, that it will require to be continued.

Where, I ask, is this system of bonuses going to end ? Only last session, the present Minister of Home Affairs proposed that a bonus should be granted to the cotton industry. Thus we shall establish a precedent for supporting any industry which likes to set up a claim for adventitious aid. I say that if we are going to grant a bonus to any industry we must grant bonuses to all. Why should we favour one industry at the expense of others? It is a scandal and a perversion of the powers of Legislature to convert public money to purposes of this kind.

One of the witnesses, Mr Sandford, managing director of the Eskbank Iron Works, New South Wales, stated that he had made an agreement with an English syndicate to spend £250,000 in extending the Lithgow works if . the B ill passed. Honourable members will observe that that is just . about the amount proposed to be given by way of bonuses for the establishment of the iron industryIn answer to another question, Mr Sandford said that to make pig-iron he wanted a plant involving an expenditure of from £100,000 to £125,000. This estimate is less than half the sim proposed to be paid in bonuses. In other words; it is proposed that the Commonwealth Parliament shall agree to the payment of bonuses aggregating twice the amount to be expended in the direction of plant and buildings. has a laTge plant at Lithgow at the present time. but the English syndicate will in all probability so arrange matters that he will not derive much benefit from this measure. I shall now read what the report has to say as to the experience of Canada in this regard. But for the promise I gave the Prime Minister last night, that I would curtail my remarks, I should have dealt fully with the experience of Canada in connection with the bonus system but in the circumstances, shall do no more than refer to what the report has to say on this phase of the questionThe Canadian experience is not encouraging. the Labour Party, a prominent protectionThe bonus system for iron production was first ist, amongst others. instituted there in 1883. Subsequently a B ill was passed, in 1897, further continuing the system. the The payment of the bonuses was limited to rea certain period, but at its expiration a afdemand was made for the continuance of the the system. We may expect the same thing to happen in Australia., if this Bill be Another Bill was carried in 1899 providing ft:t the diminution of the bounties by a sliding scale expiring in 1907. In July of this year the Dominion Government decided to postpone the operation of this sliding scale for one year, which practically means a further increase in the bounties paid. I think that it is our duty to carefully consider the statements made in this report, based as they are upon evidence submitted to the Commission. We have a right to ask ourselves whether the experience of Canada is not likely to be the experience of Australia? Do we not know that, as a matter of fact, it will be our experience, if we pass this Bill? thing of the kind? only human nature for one to seek to get as much as possible at all times. When there is a chance of gaining more by simply asking for it, these people are not likely to remain in the background. In clause 6 of the report, we have the following statement :Nearly all the witnesses examined before the Commission agreed that the payment of bonuses would ""be useless unless followed by a duty. Experience shows that if the payment of bonuses be commenced the liability of the Commonwealth will not be limited to the sum proposed under the B ill , but that further Government aid will be sought. This bears out what I have contended from the first. Paragraph 7 readsThe evidence failed to show that there was any commercial necessity for the bonuses proposed. Mr Sandford said he could produce pig iron at Lithgow under 35s. a ton. Allowing for freight to Sydney, Melbourne, and other parts of the Commonwealth, he could, on this showing, compete favourably with any imported pig iron. Other witnesses, who, however, had less experience than Mr Sandford, doubted the correctness of his estimate of cost. member is quoting from the report signed by those who are opposed to the principle. report which was signed by tfie leader of port.",59,Chapman Th E Honourable Comparison Between The Cost Of Production

I have already shown that this is the position by comparing the price quoted"" by experts with that which was submitted even on the amended basis of 61s. per ton. Clause8 of the report readsNo effort was made to bring forward witnesses against the B ill . Notwithstanding that fact, the evidence given failed to establish a case in its favour. Several witnesses thought the establishment of ironworks in the Commonwealth premature, and much of the evidence was strongly against any attempt by the Government to .establish the iron industry by the payment of bonuses. It will thus be seen that -the case for the granting of bonuses broke down on the evidence, not of those who were opposed to the principle, but of those who favoured it , and came forward to give reasons for its adoption. I desire to say, in conclusion, that I regard this Bill as a most impudent and barefaced attempt to use the public.Treasury for the purpose of enriching a private syndicate. means in my power to oppose the B ill line byline when it reaches the Committee Stage. that, ought to be submitted to a Select Committee. vernment are prepared to adopt that course, but they certainly ought to do so. are many other points with which I had originally intended to deal, but, in compliance with the promise I made to the Prime Minister last night that I should endeavour to complete my speech within an hour, I do not propose to further discuss the question at trie present stage. only to repeat that I shall do all that I can to oppose the granting of these bonuses, when the Bill reaches the Committee stage. the fact that it is now 10.15 P-m., I think it only reasonable to ask the Government to agree to the adjournment of the debate. proceed. In submitting the B i ll to the House the Minister of Trade and Customs said he was not responsible for its drafting. We know that it was prepared by the Government draftsman, but we must certainly hold the Minister responsible for the principles and learned member's leader once declared which it embodies. and very good principles they are. good principles if they were dealt with in separate .measures,! but they have 'been crowded into one B ill for a special purpose. The Bill is really a double-barrelled one. In the first place, it provides for the granting of bonuses-the desire of the Government being to placate those who, like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, are staunch protectionists, and believe in the system-whil e in the second it embodies certain conditions as to the ultimate nationalization of the industry that are calculated to satisfy .the socialistic party and their supporters. I should like to point out to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who approves of this B ill , that when we were discussing it twelve or eighteen months ago, he asserted that he was in favour of the nationalization of the iron industry of Australia. cure its nationalization. the Bill is that the Ministry, who are nowthe servile and subservient supporters of the I shall use every legitimate socialistic party in this House, have not only made provision for the payment of bonuses, but have inserted certain clauses in It is really one of those measures the Bill for the nationalization of the i ndustry, in order to meet the wishes of that I do not know whether the Goparty. Notwithstanding the strong way in which he spoke on this matter some time ago, There the Prime Minister, who is now the slave of those on the cross benches, has provided in clause 9 for the nationalization of the industry. Why has he not made a straightforward proposal in that direction, if he believes in this step? three years ago, when the first B ill was before this House. ber believes in the nationalization of the industry, why does he not insist upon the Ministry proposing it straight out ? I believe in neither the granting of a bonus nor the nationalization of the industry, but if I were compelled to vote for one of the two I would vote for the latter.

I defy any one to show . that the minority report is incorrect in any of its statements This afternoon we had a motion for ""the appointment of a Select Committee. Various statements in support of that proposal were made by the honourable member for Barrier, and other honourable members on the cross-benches, but here we have a report, not from a Select Comimittee, but from a Royal Commission accompanied by a mass of sworn evidence, and I ask whether honourable members propose to take any notice of it,or intend to completely ignore fhe labours of the Commissioners ? We gave the utmost attention to the matter, considered the whole of the evidence given from start to finish, andsix Commissioners honestly and conscientiously drew up a report in opposition to the bonus proposal. I admit that the six other Commissioners just as honestly and conscientiously signed the so-called majority report; but I am still entitled to ask the Minister in charge of the B ill , and honourable members who propose to support it, to show me any respect in which the minority report is wrong. I understand that the Postmaster-General has taken up the challenge. I am delighted that the honourable gentleI happened to be one of the man should have accepted it, though I know his capacity, his keenness in debate and his skill in the discovery of little points in support of the cause he has espoused. If the honourable gentleman can tell me from the evidence given before the Royal Commission that any statement appearing in the. minority report is nof justified, I shall'be the first to admit that I have made a mistake; but it must as» be remembered that there are others as well as myself who must be satisfied on the point. that the report signed by the other six Commissioners is not substantiated.

On those grounds he moved a motion for the reference of the question to a Royal Commission. able member think that the industry could be nationalized at that time? able member for Hindmarsh know all about that. I repeat that it was through the action of the leader of the Labour Party that the first measure of this kind was referred for inquiry to a Select Committee, which subsequently became a Royal Commission; and that after he had heard the evidence taken during that inquiry, he was more strongly opposed to the granting of bonuses to private individuals than he had been before. I ask the Postmaster-General, who appears to be in charge of the measure at the present moment, if the Bill provides for the nationbeen bestowed upon us by the mother land.' alization of the iron industry. As he does not answer, I assume that he does not know what the intention of the Bill is. Minis1 ters"" seem to Be in the same position with regard to this Bill 'that they were in with regard to the Commerce Bill, which the Attorney-General thought provided for the grading of butter, and the Minister of Trade and Customs thought did not, they being thus in direct opposition on a question affecting one of the most important industries in Australia. I again ask the Prime Ministeri f the Bill provides for the nationalization of the iron industry. He does not answer my question. passed. again. on until question time comes again if honourable members compel me to do so. I can speak for ten or twelve hours on this subject without repeating myself. I feel very strongly in regard to the matter, because I was a member of the Royal Commission, and attended most of its meetings. I heard the evidence of nearly all the witnesses who were called, and was in as good a position as any member of the Commission to form a fair and honest judgment on the question submitted to us. Having given careful consideration to the whole matter, having heard the evidence, and seen the demeanour of the witnesses who were called, I felt so strongly opposed to the granting of bonuses that I signed the minority report, which was agreed to bysix of the twelve members of the Commission. As some honourable members now present may not have heard that report, I shall direct particular attention to it. There can be no doubt that, in many respects, Australia is favourably circumstanced for the production of iron. The protectionists who sit on the Government side of the Chamber pose as the only members of the House who desire the establishment of manufacturing industries in the Commonwealth, but we free-traders who sit in opposition are as anxious as any protectionist who was ever elected has been for the establishment of such industries. But we desire that private enterprise shall have free and fair play-that men of ability and enterprise shall have the fullest opportunity to carry their ideas into effgct, and tb develop their businesses for the benefit of this great heritage ' which has state of the House. [Quorum formed.] traders recognise the desirability of establishing the iron industry in Australia if only in order that we may manufacture guns and implements for defending our shores. We on this side yield in no par-' ticular to honourable members on the other side so far as that question is concerned While we recognise that we are not placed in as good a position as other countries for manufacturing iron, still we are placed in a very favorable position when we bave such magnificent deposits of iron, coal, and limestone in close proximity in various parts of Australia. The report of the Royal Commission contains a list of the witnesses who were examined. The Minister of Home. Affairs, as well as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, will bear me out that no attempt was made to call witnesses in opposition to the principle of granting a bonus. call witnesses? cessary. The evidence given by all the men who came to support the granting of a bonus was so weak that the Commissioners whose names I have read out twice felt themselves justified in drawing up a strong report, from which I intend to read after I have referred to the witnesses.

584,Mr Fuller,"Becaus e it was not neMr Sandford, and others are prominent men in commercial undertakings. All these gentlemen were examined at length. The first witness was Mr Edward Fisher Pittman, a gentleman who has occupied a high and honourable position in the Public Service of New South Wales for a great many years. He is a geologist, and his knowledge of the iron deposits in various parts of Australia is not excelled by that of any man in Australia, or by that of any of the experts who have been brought here from abroad. He was examined at length by the chairman and other members of the Commission. Although, in view of his official position, we did not ask him to express an opinion on the policy of granting a bonus, still he gave most valuable and interesting evidence in connection with iron deposits and the possibility of establishing an iron industry here, which every honourable member before he votes on this Bill ought to study at length. If I find that honourable members are obdurate, and are disposed to treat this important question in a light way'; if they are not prepared to study the report, it will be my duty, however long it may take, to quote those salient features which I have marked off. The honourable member for Barrier knows that Mr Pittman is highly esteemed by all mining people in New South Wales, and that his word on these matters has never been questioned. Another expert who was examined was Mr Jaquet, whose attainments in connection with mining matters are well known in Australia from one ford declared that the honourable member for Parramatta, by appointing Mr Jaquet to make f u l l inquiries concerning the iron deposits of New South Wales, had done one of the most valuable things in connection with the development of the iron industry. My honourable friend is entitled to great credit for what he then did. The evidence given by Mr Jaquet concerning the deposits of not only New South Wales, but other parts of Australia, forms a volume which every honourable member ought to study before he votes on this B ill . If it is passed it will afford to certain persons an opportunity of floating a company. We have it on the sworn evidence of Mr as it could be turned out in any other part Sandford and Mr Jamieson, two men who are speciallyinterested in the formation of a syndicate, that although the bonus may be instrumental in enabling them to start the iron industry, it will be of little use to them in the end, unless ' protective duties are afterwards imposed. This measure has been placed before us by the Minister of Trade and . Customs as a Bil l providing merely for the granting of bonuses; but we know perfectly well that if the iron industry is started here as the outcome of the bonus, and some hundreds, or even thousands, of men are employed, we shall pass through the same experience as has fallen to the lot of Canada. We know that demands will be made for an extension of the bonus, or for the imposition of high protective duties. In Canada applications have been made for further and higher bounties. The American iron industry was established without the aid of any protective duty, and in Australia, where we possess abundance.' of natural facilities for carrying on an enterprise such as that contemplated, we should be able to get along without any artificial aid. I had not the advantage of hearing the speeches delivered by the Minister of Trade and Customs or the leader of the Opposition, but from what I can gather from the official reports, the assertion of the leader of the Opposition that Mr Sandford had stated that he could manufacture iron at Lithgow at a cost of 35s. per ton was questioned. I would appeal to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who attended the meeting of tlie Commission at which Mr Sandford gave his evidence, to say whether that gentleman did not squarely and fairly state that he could manufacture pig-iron at Lithgow at the price mentioned. wards that he had made a mistake, and sought when it was too late to give f u r ther evidence. bers of the Commission, and I was present at most of its meetings; but I never heard before that Mr Sandford had expressed a wish to modify the evidence he had given, to the effect that he could manufacture iron at Lithgow at 35s. per ton. W ill the honourable member say that Mr Sandford did not assert that hei could manufacture pig-iron at Lithgow as cheaply of the world? ' Only last Friday a report of an interview with Mr Sandford was published in the newspapers. In the course of his statement he said that he was satisfied that we had in Australia good qualities of raw material, though not of the best, and that our raw material could be",68,Chapman Th E Honourable Comparison Between The Cost Of Production

In the evidence he gave before the Commission, Mr Sandford stated as one reason why the bonus should lie granted, that it would help to enable him to pay freights and compete with foreign products in Queensland, Victoria, and other parts of the Commonwealth. Mr The very first clause is, it will be seen, a Sandford, upon being interviewed shortly after his return from a visit to England, Sweden, Belgium, America, and other countries where the iron industry has been highly developed, repeated the statements he made before the Commission. saidI have always considered that if the Sydney quorum present to hear this report read. market would not absorb the output of a modern blast furnace, the proposed Federal bonus would [Quorum formed.] materially help in paying freight and meeting competition in Queensland, Victoria, and South Australia. As one who was intimately acquainted with the late Mr Joseph Mitchell in his desire to establish the iron industry in New South Wales, I was extremely anxious that Mr apparently, honourable members are in a Sandford should have every legitimate opportunity to establish the iron industry upon a basis that would be beneficial not only to himself, but to New South Wales and the whole of Australia. the state of the House. [Quorum formed.] honourable members, but I recognise that this is an important matter to the people of Australia. Some honourable members seem to think that it is of no importance that a large sum of money is to be taken out of the pockets of the people for the benefit of a few; but I think it is my duty, in the interests of the country, to point out these matters, because I feel keenly and honestly about them. other subjects to which I wish to refer. Committee, and the honourable member can refer to them then. when it suits my purpose. I know that the Prime Minister wants to get the Bill into Committee, but I do not. If I judge honourable members opposite wrongly, I apologize to them, but I really do not believe that they have read the evidence of the Commission. They would not have so much calm confidence in reference to this Billi f they had done so. Let me again invite attention to what is called the minority report of the Commission. They sayWe, the undersigned members of the Commission, are against the passage through Parliament of the B ill for the payment of bonuses by the Federal Government for the establishment of the iron industry within the Commonwealth. declaration against the principle of paying bonuses. The second clause of the report is one to which exception cannot be taken. The members of the minority recognise that the Commonwealth possesses vast deposits He of iron ore, of high-grade coal, and other material required in iron w-orks. struct business. I thought it would be of interest to honourable members to hear what the minority of the Commission had to say. I had also intended to quote the evidence of Mr Jamieson and Mr Franki. But, frame of mind in which they are prepared to pass anything without consideration at the dictates of the present Government. It appears that honourable members on the cross benches who believe in the nationalization of the iron industry, and not in the granting of bonuses, are not prepared to stand to their principles. On a former occasion, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports proclaimed that he was in favour of the nationalization of industries. I have looked up Hansard, and have before me a report of his speech. But he and other honourable members are now chiefly anxious to keep the present Government in power. I suppose that one of the most treacherous things ever done in the history of parliamentary government in Australia was the means by which the present Ministry secured possession of the Treasury benches. The Prime Minister denounced Socialism from start to finish. People talk of what the leader of the Opposition, has said in condemnation of Socialism in this House and in the country. But he was mild as compared with the declarations of the man who now sits on the Treasury bench, and is kept in power by the support of a party who are so obviously using him for their own ends. The public of Australia ought to understand clearly that while .this measure purports to be one for granting bonuses to establish the iron industry, it is really a means by which",69,Chapman Th E Honourable Comparison Between The Cost Of Production
