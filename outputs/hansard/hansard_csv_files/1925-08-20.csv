0,"House Of Representatives. Thursday, 80 August, 1986. Took The Chair At 2.30 P.m., And Read Prayers. Old","AGE PENSION'S. question on the subject of the proposed increase of old-age pensions. I believe my question was misunderstood, because the reply given was not an answer to it. The Treasurer, in replying, directed attention to the budget; but as the budget is not sent to old-age pensioners, it is impossible for them to know what it contains. Mr ""WEST I shall put my question in this way: Will the honourable.gentleman u8o all his power as Treasurer and bring down a bill, giving Parliament an opportunity to pass it within twenty four hours, providing for the increase of the old-age pension as proposed in his budget speech? I stated the position very clearly yesterday. As soon as the national insurance legislation to be proposed is passed by the House, a bill for the increase of the old-age pension will be brought down. The national insurance legislation will be introduced as soon as possible. fact that the Marrawah is tied up in Melbourne, and the' Oon-ah has been thrown out of commission by a collision with, the Cooma, I ask the Postmaster General what provision the Government proposes to make for shipping facilities between Melbourne and. King Island, Stanley, Burnie, and Devonport, for mails, passengers, and cargo. Will he take into consideration forthwith the necessity of the Loongana making Burnie her first port of call until satisfactory communication is restored ? made, and will see that the mails are conveyed to the places mentioned, as has been done in the past. presenting the Minister for Markets and Migration if he will lay on the table of the House the report of Mr Ross Grant, Commonwealth Veterinary Surgeon, concerning the condition and sale in London of the shipment of beef chilled by the Rayson process, and carried by the s.s.

The matterMOET'S DOCK ister whether his attention has been drawn to a statement by the chairman of Mort's Dock, published in the Argus today, complaining bitterly of the competition of Cockatoo Island and Walsh Island Docks. By way of explanation of my question, I may be allowed to say that I am informed that tlie Prime Minister has been supplied with particulars showing that several recent tenders by Cockapower to censor matter to be broadcast. too Island Dock so undercut tenders by Mort's Dock as to make it quite clear that all overhead charges at Cockatoo Island Dock bad not been allowed for.

I have explained that the Government proposes that the provisions referred to shall be rigidly enforced; and, in these circumstances, there ean be no unfair competition by Cockatoo Island Dock with any private enterprise, Minister's attention been drawn to the statement published in a Sydney newspaper that the Queensland Wireless Broadcasting Station has sent out certain apparently anti-British announcements purporting to be news ? The announcer of the station is reported to have said that the Conservative Government which controlled the destinies of the British nation Avas determined on playing a lone hand in the Orient; that the Washington Treaty had never been put into effect by any of the signatories; and that Britain's present attitude, if'persisted in, would have the effect of entirely nullifying it. "" Britain,"" the statement added, ""had larger interests in China than any of the other powers, and evidently was determined to push them at all. cost. It was evident that Britain had decided to resort to arms in an attempt to uphold her financial interests."" Has the Government, under the wireless regulations, that any such statement as the honourable member has referred to was broadcast. If it was, it was most improper, and steps will have to be taken to prevent inaccurate information of such a character being sent from any broadcasting station in Australia. Broadcasting can only be carried on under licence from the Postmaster-General's Department, and power is reserved to censor anything that is being broadcast from any station. I shall have the matter mentioned by the honourable member .looked'into, and I can The whole assure, him that proper steps will be taken, if any such statement as that to which he has directed attention was broadcast.

[2.54] -When I obtained leave last week which caused this remarkable community to to continue my remarks upon this motion come into existence-the mutiny of the royal commission into the affairs of Norfolk Island was desirable. Last Christmas, when on a visit to the island, I was surprised at being told by the residents that I was the only federal member who had been there since it was taken over by the Commonwealth. Certain honourable members have interjected that that statement is incorrect, but so far as I have been able to ascertain the last visit by members of this Parliament was that of the party organized by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) in 1914, which was just prior to the assumption of control by the Commonwealth. If any members of the Commonwealth Parliament have been to Norfork Island since that year there is no record of their visit. have made any impression. felt but little interest in the affairs of the island, or they would have taken some action to give effect to the wishes tain the nature of their grievances, and to deal with them as diplomatically as take this, my first, opportunity to do so.

The Island, to which the entire population of Pitcairn Island had been transferred by the British Government in the year 1856. island was a natural prison, and it was this fact which caused it to be made a penal settlement in the earliest days of Australian colonization. It had the grimest and gloomiest history of all the convict settlements. story was shuddersomc in the extreme. Before the Pitcairn Islanders were landed, the convict settlement was discontinued, and there remained only the evil criminal associations of the place. The people were physically strong and attractive, and their manners were pleasant and friendly. But they lacked initiative and mental vigour. This was probably due to their isolation, and the ease with which they made a living from the land. There was no money in circulation, yet they managed to have plenty to eat and to keep themselves noticeably 'well dressed. They regarded the island as their exclusive property, claiming that it had been given to them in perpetuity by Queen Victoria. In official circles they were -still known as "" Queen Victoria's pets."" Their history was one of the most interesting of any single small community in the world. After a stay amongst them the visitor came away with the most pleasant recollections of this people, who were a definite responsibility upon the shoulders of the people of Australia. The origin of the Norfolk Islanders as far back as 1787, when some London merchants with plantations agitated to have the bread fruit tree of the Tahiti Islands transplanted for the sustenance of slave labour. Sir Joseph Bunks, who had 'voyaged with Captain Cook, is said to have advised that this bread fruit plant could be successfully transplanted Subsequent events proved him to be wrong: but to test his theory the British fitted out the armed ship Bounty, of 210 tons, and placed Captain Bligh in charge of a. i -rew of 45 men. The ship si-cured the bread fruit plants, and spent six very agreeable amongst the Tahiti Islanders. back a mutiny, led by the master's mate, one Fletcher Christian, a high-spirited youngman who had fallen foul of Captain Bligh, resulted in the capture of the ship by 26 of the erew. Christian put Bligh and eighteen other men adrift in an open launch. gated this launch over stormy seas 3,618 miles to Timor, where five of the men died as the result of their hardships. as one of the most adventurous in naval history. Tahiti in the Bounty, where they agreed to divide forces. The majority decided to remain at Tahiti and take their chauces of recapture. In about two years' time a British arrived and took them back to England, where three were hanged. other*, six native men and a number of Mr Thompson. native women left in the Bounty for Pitcairn Island, where they burned the ship and hid themselves. It wus 20 years before a ship called and discovered the whereabouts of the mutineers. speaker briefly described Norfolk By that time pnly one man-.John Adamswas alive. All the others, including the blacks, had been killed in quarrels. Adams The was in charge of a small community of women and children. He had .turned deeply religious, and as he had 'become a teacher and pastor, he was not disturbed by the British Government. Later on British warships Its regularly visited the island. The good conduct of the Pitcairn Islanders became worldfamed, and they were held up as the most religious and moral community in existence. In time the young men and women married, and the community rapidly increased, until in 1856 nearly 200 lived on a rock about 4 square miles in area. The British Government in this year removed the entire community to Norfolk Island, which is four or five times larger than Pitcairn, and is more adapted by Nature for the support of a considerable population. In a year or two about 5Q>who were home-sick returned to Pitcairn, where they have lived ever since. The present .population of Pitcairn is about 200; so that with the Norfolk Island (population close on 1,000 persons are to-day the living descendants of tlie mutineers of the Bounty. The tragic history of the mutiny, and the remarkable career of the descendants of the mutineers, formed one of the most interesting chapters in the annals of British history. Now that these people were under the care ot the Commonwealth of Australia it was only dated fitting that something should be known about them. Up to the present they had been placed in the West Indies on Norfolk Island and forgotten. The problem of what was going to be done with so many people of a mixed racial strain cooped up in a little island was one which seemed difficult of solution, but it would have to be tackled. If the mutiny of the Bounty had to the West Indies. never taken place these people would not be in existence to-day. Government I place that resume of the history of the P it c a i r n Islanders on record to explain the remarks I am about to make. months These people were transferre d to No r On the voyage folk I s l a n d by the B r it is h Government in 1856, and were practically given this small area, of about 13 square miles to do as they liked with. T h a t at least Bligh naviwas the view of the original Pitcairn Islanders, and it is the view of their descendants to-day. The original popuThis voyage ranks lation of 200 has grown to about 760, and The mutineers proceeded back to is increasing fairly rapidly. There is very little doubt that in ten or twenty years' time the population will be very much greater, and then the problem of conwarship trolling this large community on so small Christian, with eight an area, and fro m a place so far away from the centre of their local affairs, w ill be acute indeed. futur e is already exercising the minds of only natural that they should attach a great deal of importance to their local affairs, and it is also natural that we, who are so far away, should not feel a very keen interest in them. I explained that when I spoke to them. I told them of the heavy commitments of the Commonwealth, and gave them to understand that, as far as I could see, under the present form of administration they could not expect to attract very much attention from Melbourne. As a result of that public meeting a petition was forwarded to the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce). A copy of it was sent to me, and I shall now read it to honourable senators, because it wil l give them an idea of the troubles that are agitating this unique community. The petition readsSir, Wc, your' humble petitioners of Norfolk Island, prayeth that you will take into favorable consideration the appointment of a royal commission at once to investigate certain grievances which we consider of vital importance for the well-being of the Island. We herewith humbly beg to show that within the last ten years approximately £40,000 has been spent by the Federal Government (chiefly in salaries). We are of the opinion that this expense is unwarranted, as the Island practically receives no benefit from this source, owing to the fact that the Seat of Government being 1,000 miles away and other reasons, we are quite confident that the Government knows little of the state of the Island, and this has been recently confirmed by the views of the Federal member, Mr V. C. Thompson, who has lately visited us. We have carefully viewed the whole situation, and have come to the conclusion that if the Island is to progress a drastic change of the Administration must be brought about. This has been, expressed many times by notable men of business who have visited us and by many residents of reputable standing, who have held responsible positions in the outer world.. Before dealing with an alternative system, we might mention the Island comprises about 8,000 acres, about 400 being cultivated, costing abont £10 per acre to administer. The population is not increasing, so many of the young people are leaving owing to the unfavorable conditions prevailing. Prosperity is a thing of the past. We feel convinced that if this royal commission were granted much of the present grievances would disappear, and a system cheaper and more economical would be submitted of practical benefit to all concerned. Their The Minister replied refusing the request of the petitioners. In answer to a letter the people themselves. It is from me, Senator Pearce wrote on the 8th May I shall be pleased to see you at any time to hear your views iu regard to the affairs of Norfolk Island. The additional powers conferred upon the Executive Council of Norfolk Island, referred to in my letter of the 21st April to Mr Charlton, M.P., copy of which was forwarded to you on that date, should give the islanders an opportunity oi making known their views on matters of administration. I enclose, for your information, copy of the Executive Council Ordinance 1925, and would invite your attention to section 17 thereof. Section 17 of the ordinance referred to gives the local executive council authority to make suggestions for the government of the island, but it explicitly provides that any suggestions must come before the Administrator for comment before being forwarded to head-quarters in Melbourne. Naturally his personal views carry considerable weight with the Minister. trator? I have a copy of the letter which Senator Pearce addressed to Mr Charlton, the Leader of the Opposition, giving his reasons for refusing the request of the residents for the appointment of a royal commission. It is advisable that. I should place it before the House. The letter, dated the 21st April, 1925, readsWith reference to your letter of tlie 16th April, in regard to a communication addressed to you by Mr John Newton, hon. secretary of the Norfolk Island Progress Association, relative to the petition which was forwarded to ine praying that a royal commission .be appointed to investigate certain grievances which were alleged to exist in connection with the administration of tlie Territory, I desire to inform you that, after very careful consideration, the Acting Administrator of Norfolk Island was instructed to inform the petitioners that it was not considered that the petition disclosed sufficient justification for the appointment of a royal commission to visit the Island and inquire into the administration thereof. As the principal grievance would appear to be the alleged excessive expenditure upon salaries of officials, the petitioners were asked to furnish suggestions as to the directions in which savings could be effected without curtailing any of the benefits derived by the islanders from the educational, medical, postal, savings bank, police, and other services at present provided. The Government is desirous of promoting, in every possible way, the welfare of the inhabitants of Norfolk Island, and is at all",17,Properties I Was Explaining Why An Inquiry By A

Prior ,to the receipt of the petition, approval was given to the enactment of an ordinance for the enlargement of the scope for usefulness of the Executive Council of the Island, by providing that the Council shall have power to submit proposals for new ordinances and for amendments to existing ordinances. Hitherto the Executive Council has been in the nature of a municipal council, and has had no voice in the framing of the legislation of the Territory. The new powers now conferred upon the Council will give the residents of Norfolk Island an opportunity of making known their views on the local legislation, and of suggest-. ing proposals for the better government of the Territory. Since then I have received from the Norfolk Island Progress Association the following letter, dated the 5th June, 1925. It furnishes a very definite reply to the Minister's communication:At a meeting of the Progress Association held on Wednesday evening a communication was presented from the Acting Administrator in reply to the petition which was forwarded. They cannot grant a royal commission or inquiry, as there is not sufficient reason to warrant one. However, greater .powers have been granted the Executive Council, and the department will welcome suggestions that will tend to .the better government of the Island. Wie are forwarding a. suggestion that one qualification for a man should be a knowledge of law. with ability to preside acceptably over a court of justice. We suggest that a warden should lie appointeda man who would be prepared to conic for a salary of £250 or £300 a year: one who was retired and desired a rest and change, and would accept such a position which assured him of a place of standing on the Island. should be many such men in the community. .To support our suggestion that a man of legal knowledge would be desirable, we are forwarding brief reports of recent cases heard at the Court, viz.:-Allen's , MuP'h&il's, Patching's; also reports of the treatment meted out to Eevd. A. R. Martin and Mr they are cooped up on a small island Barnes (late schoolmaster) by Colonel Loane. Another suggestion is that ten or twelve local honorary J's.P. 'be appointed, so that two may be available to sit with the magistrate on the bench. A further suggestion made was in connection with the existing mail service which expires shortly. It was that a separate contract be invited for a service to Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands and thence .to New Zealand every three weeks or month, providing for running of a more up-to-date and faster boat, with increased and improved This would tend to increase the number of tourists visiting the Island, and would attract tourists from Now Zealand, and it would help the Island by conveying fruit and other produce to that dominion. Mr Thompson. We understand that at present there are over 200 people waiting to visit the Island, and every berth is booked for months to come. One of the problems we are hoping to tackle soon is the liquor question. It seems to get more acute from month to month, and will mean a big struggle, as it is entrenched in 'officialdom. That the islanders are very hostile to the present Administration is evident from this concluding noteA word in your ear -'A ' man has recently -come as clerk in the Court( Mr Wilson). Rumour has it that he is gathering information. Would we be safe in confiding in him in our work as an association? Honourable members w ill admit that the ""situation is not at all satisfactory when such a large community is so distrustful of officials appointed by ^he Commonwealth Government. The first consideration of any administration should be to inspire confidence in the people in the system of government under which they are called upon to live. I should like to impress it upon honourable members that the origin of these people has created a problem which makes it intensely difficult for any administration to control them according to our standards. The newspaper report of the address which I delivered gives the tragic history of these people. They are the direct offspring of eight men who, if they had been captured w it h in a reasonable time after the mutiny, would certainly have been strung up to the yard-arm of a B r it i sh man of war. When the B ritish naval authorities captured a number of the mutineers two There years after the mutiny three were hanged, and others' had a very narrow escape. The Norfolk Islanders of to-day are under rhe care of the Commonwealth Government. They number 760 people, and the fact that should ensure for them sympathetic treatment by the central administration. Undoubtedly they w ill feel that they have a genuine grievance, and will believe that the}' are being neglected by the central administration, if honourable members of this House give l it t l e attention to information that is presented to them concerning their condition. These people are dissatisfied, and have accommodation. asked thatj some form of inquiry be initiated. Usually, if any considerable section of the people of Australia demands an inquiry into some grievance, l it t l e difficulty is made about granting their request. That Norfolk Island is 900 miles from. Australia, and its inhabitants are but little known to us, is not a reason why we should take no interest in their affairs. Our neglect of them is a strong indictment of the f u t i l it y of the territorial .system of government. opinion, that system-is wrong. utterly impossible for a number of men sitting in Melbourne to d r a f t ordinances, and to determine the conditions which shall govern the lives of persons living many hundreds of miles away. MrE . RILEY Minister for Home and Territories ever visited the island? It is the duty of members of this Parliament to interest themselves in the affairs of this community, and I hope that they will do so. the honourable member for Barton( MrF . McDonald) was at the last moment prevented from accompanying me when I visited the island, otherwise I should have had his corroboration of my remarks. Nevertheless, I feel certain that honourable members will realize that a request from 700 people with such a remarkable origin and so tragic a history, and who are so peculiarly situated as regards their relations with the Commonwealth, should not be ignored. of government, there ? of Home and Territories, which, i u reality, means the Minister, appoints a.u administrator.

I beI n my lieve that the present Administrator has It is conscientiously endeavoured to administer the Territory rightly, and to deal in an impartial manner with the small amount of legal work with which he is entrusted, but his lack of training has resulted in dissatisfaction among thei people. InH as the present one case which, came before him in court, the Administrator gave a verdict for £ 8 0 damages against an engineer who I do not think so. went to the island from Australia. He repaired au engine belonging to a local picture showman, and subsequently the latter brought an action against him in ""Unfortunately, the local court. The Administrator, in his capacity as chief magistrate, awarded £ 8 0 damages against this unfortunate individual. I do not say that the merits of the case were not against the defendant, but the fact remains that the administration of justice in the island is in the hands of a man who deals with cases of that kind. The local Clerk of Petty Sessions, who has resided in the island for twenty years, informed me that he was very dissatisfied with the treatment which he had received as a servant of the machinery Federal Government. It appears that civil servants, having once been sent to the island, are forgotten. They have none of the privileges enjoyed by the civil servants of the Commonwealth, and do not participate in the benefits of the superannuation f u n d .

In spite of their mixed origin, the people there are intelligent, and take a. keen interest in-their f u t u r e ; they realize that disaster awaits them if the present conditions are long continued. There are about twelve families on the island, the members of which are continually inter-marrying. Honourable members know that inter-marrying does not tend to improve a race; yet the Commonwealth is making no attempt to improve the position of these people. I understand that their real desire is that the island be attached to New Zealand. Geographically it belongs to New Zealand, two as against six days' steaming' from Sydney. of the island are also grown in Australia, whereas none of them can be produced successfully in New Zealand. If a shipping service with Auckland, such as that which now exists between the island and Sydney, were established, the islanders would be able to dispose of their produce, whereas, to send it to Sydney is like carrying coals to Newcastle. have spent the whole of their lives on the island have no particular regard for Australia, with which they have nothing in common, either in blood or tradition, except that many of them served with the Australian Imperial Force, and fought with Australians. One of their chief grievances is the absence of any news service. Even the Administrator, in my opinion, has not been treated fairly by the Government in this respect. Some time ago he forwarded a request to the Minister that he should be furnished with an ordinary wireless receiving set, so that he might receive news, and distribute it throughout the island; but he was given the old red-tape reply that the matter would be considered when the next Estimates were under consideration. from the cable station.all the information they want. is a little world to itself. the station every day. was at the island the test cricket matches were being played in Australia, and to ascertain the results I had to go to the cable station, where, as a special favour, the information was supplied to me. The people of the island generally knew nothing of the results of the test matches. They are in the same position regarding other events outside the island, as there is no news service from the rest of the world. The fact that the request of the Administrator for . a wireless set was turned down indicates mental lethargy or indifference on the part of the central administration towards these people. There is another serious condition in the island which requires consider atioj). If a large number of able-bodied young men is growing up in a confined community, without anything as No r f o lk Island is only to do, they must inevitably get into misdays' steaming from Auckland chief, and one of the problems of Norfolk Island is to find suitable employment Moreover, a l l the products for the labour of its young men. Many of them are of very fine physical type, but they are becoming lackadaisical largely as a result of their inability to find some avenue of profitable employment. There is no money in the island worth considering, beyond what tourists bring there. Some people favour Norfolk Islanders who the imposition of rates or taxes, but the people w ill have no means of paying them if they are imposed. A suggestion has been made that a duty should be imposed upon all imports, which might bring in a revenue of about £10,000 a. year. The total volume of trade of the island, covering imports and exports, in 1924, was £25,000, and of that amount £22,000 represented imports. The only way in which any .appreciable revenue could be obtained is by imposing taxation upon imports. There are practically no exports from the island. It is the centre of one of the greatest whaling stations in the Pacific. Thousands of whales go past the island twice a year. A t one time, the islanders carried on quite a whaling industry, but through lack of capital, modern plant, and appliances, they were unable to continue it , and now whales go past the island in thousands untouched. There is a profitable export of bananas, other f r u it , and lemon juice. A t the present time, an outside company, w it h headquarters in Melbourne, is commencing activities there, but what its operations will mean to the island I am unable to -3ay.

They have three meals a day and they all have their little homes, but have no great in terest in life. It is very necessary that the administration controlling the island should discover profitable avenues of employment for the islanders in order that they may earn some money and contribute something to the cost of their administration'. The Commonwealth is spending £4,000 a year on the administration of the island, and is getting nothing in return. The people are dissatisfied, and it would be better that the island should be handed over to New Zealand, which has wanted it for many years, than that existing conditions should continue. The islanders prefer this solution of their difficulty. If tbe Commonwealth took active steps to find out what is really the trouble in No r f o l k I s l a n d, and what it is best to do to make the islanders more contented, and make the future a little less gloomy than it appears to me to be, I think the islanders would eventually come to think it better to be associated with Australia than with New Zealand. of the island from New Zealand find from Australia? is about 900 miles from Australia, and, .1. think, 400 miles from New Zealand.

If we are to keep Norfolk Island as territory of the Commonwealth, it is our duty to take an active interest in its local affairs, and our obligation to see that any grievances which the people have, and which it is possible for us to rectify, are rectified without undue delay.

Whilsti t must be admitted that the Minister concerned, no matter to what party he belonged, would t r y to do his best for the community over which he presides, it has to be borne in mind that in the final analysis he is dependent upon the man who goes to Norfolk Island to represent him.

He has submitted in his prothe posal what he thinks should take the place of that system. He proposes that the cabinet shall beelected on a system of ""proportionate representation."" The honourable member proposes that each party shall select its own proportion of the cabinet. That is the system he proposes to substitute for the one now in vo'gue. The motion is practically a challenge to the system deliberately established by the people 1 of Australia, under the Constitution.

He also objected to the position now occupied by a Prime Minister on the ground that he is an autocrat, because he has the right to advise the dissolution of Parliament and the disthat Parliament should be free to select were contained in one party, much of it would have to be sacrificed in the selecdoes not suggest that the present system gives the best results ?

The man who tries to be independent of party condemns himself to mere f u t i l it y , or, at the best, he be the spirit of corporate responsibility; comes an opportunist, who tries to see what help he can get from each party in turn in advancing the cause in which he is interested.

There would, therefore, be a cabinet, meeting Executive Council to come to determinations and to tender advice. Would the election of the members of the Cabinet"" change the party system? My view is that a member would carry into the Cabinet his party feeling. Those associated with him in Parliament would naturally press him in Cabinet to f u l f i l their own party programmes, and would do everything possible to have their own political objects achieved. I cannot see that the mere fact of members being elected by their party would prevent party feeling. views of their own party, of what, use, it fluence in the Cabinet?

He proposes that a cabinet should be composed of Ministers elected proportionately by the different parties. This could not tend to political harmony. The honourable member's next objection to the present system is the domination of small minorities; but the position of small minorities would not be altered by having elective ministries.

The argument advanced by the honourable member regarding the domination exercised by parties' is no justification for the complete overthrow of (he present political system that has been in vogue for so long in many countries.

Tho policies _ of the Ministers would be just as numerous and varied as the parties represented in the Cabinet. presentative policy would not be possible. The greatest difficulty would be found in connection with the control of the finances. Under the present system each Minister is responsible for the administration of his own department, but all confer in Cabinet, the decisions of which become the policy of the administration. The Treasurer has the responsibility of balancing receipts and expenditure, and he exercises his power in close consultation with his colleagues. It has been truly said that finance is the basis of government. Certainly finance, to a great extent, dictates the general policy of an administration. Under a system of elective Ministries, Cabinet would consist of representatives of different parties holding diverse political views, each; probably, requiring.a different system of finance. How could such a body evolve a corporate policy? sections in the Cabinet differed, who would have the deciding vote? Treasurer had the final decision he would be a greater autocrat than is the Prime Minister under the present system.

The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) said that the Cabinet he proposed should be mainly an executive body, by which, presumably, he meant matters would, as far as it is concerned, be subsidiary. In the United States of America the President is practically in dependent of the legislature. Ministers are appointed by the President, and become practically his servants. They have for the time being is no right to appear in Parliament, and are not responsible to Parliament. Certainly there is a. way by which messages can be sent to Congress, but there is c almost a complete severance of the executive from the legislature.

The supreme test is the capacity of the executive to act in a grave emergency, for* Wimmera is quite right when perhajas party feeling is running high. coalition cabinet was formed in Great Britain. no party feeling in Great Britain at that time.

The ex-president, referring to thr working of the Swiss system, placed his finger on its weak spot.

Its chief purpose was to register an accurate description of the land held by the people and the basis of taxation, to ensure that taxation was based on a fixed assessment; of the dues, the rights of the K in g, the names of land-holders, the resources of the people, the amount of arable land, the number of plough teams-in those days eight oxen were regarded as a plough team-the area of river, meadow, and woodland pastures; of the grades of serfdom and the annual value of the properties,' as well as of all liabilities. For taxation purposes Australia has two systems of valuation. Many people, myself included, believe that we should have one simplified system. We are getting some common sense. Zealand, and also in New South Wales, the Government has power to resume land on the basis of its taxation value.. I think that we are moving in the same direction in Victoria. The making of a Domesday Book for the purpose indicated in my motion would have much to recommeud it . that the wealth of Australia did its f u l l share in the late terrible war ? Cani t be said that the effort of wealth equalled the response made by the manhood of Australia ? 1,000,000 adult males, over 600,000 offered for war service; and of the 360,000 who went oversea, approximately 60,000 lost their lives. It is deplorable that even the children of men who died at the front should be called upon to assistorable member get over the difficulty of in carrying the accursed cross of in terest that the war debt has placed upon the shoulders of the people of Australia. On occasions I have asked myselfWouldi t be fair to make a capital levy of one-fourth of the valueof assessed properties in Australia to pay off the war debts? In 1914, before the outbreak of war, this value was stated at £1,200,000,000 for all Australia. On the 30th June, 1915, nearly a year after the commencement of the war, the value had increased to £1,600,000,000, showing an increase of £400,000,000 even in time of war. value is now estimated to be over £2,500,000,000. budget gives the amount raised in Australia for war and repatriation purposes as £268,000,000, honourable members will agree that that amount does not cover the total cost, because if we take into consideration also the losses in connection with war service homes, the purchase of ships, and other contingent losses, the total would exceed £300,000,000. It is reasonable to suppose that during the next ten years the increase in the value of Australia will not be less than during the previous decade. It is evident, therefore, that no one who owns property would b<; adversely affected by the application of the principle which I "" am advocating. Thfland would be taxed upon present values, and any portion of the unearned increment in excess of the aniouni required to pay the wav debt would be remitted to the property-owners. RecentlyI asked twelve keen business; men, including some possessing considerI n New able wealth, whether they would prefer that the unearned increment on their property be applied to the redemption of the debt, or that they should pay one-quarter of their capital in cash as a capital levy. One of thema man reputed to be worth over £100,000-sai d that for him to pay £25,000 in cash as a capital levy would entail great difficulty, as he would have Can any one pretend to arrange for an advance from the bank. He pointed out that his case would be bui one of many, and that if a capital levy were made the banks would be unable to meet the demands of the property-owners. Out of a total of He concluded by saying that if either system were to operate he preferred that of applying the unearned increment tc the reduction of the debt. D r .

Having improved the property in which they resided, he proposed to increase their rents. I introduced to him a deputation consisting of the tenants, and pointed out that, as the war would probably last for two or three months only, he should not increase the rents for that period. He replied that the amounts wjhich he was asking ""represented only 6 per cent, on his capital outlay, a percentage which he considered to be fair, and on which he intended to insist. I left him with a heavy heart, but next morning I received a message from him desiring an appointment. him again he said that he had thought the matter over, and had decided that for the period of the war he would not increase the rents payable by his tenants, and, further, that he would do the same thing in connection with the companies with which he was connected. As he had a controlling interest in between 60 and 70 substantial houses, honourable members will understand how joyful I felt. When I told him that he would be given credit for his generous action, he said that (he promise would be withdrawn if I mentioned his name. I therefore regret that 'Dr. Maloney. the name of this Jewish gentleman cannot be made public, but I am able to say that he kept his promise notwithstanding that the war lasted much longer than was at first anticipated. Unfortunately, such cases wore few. The profiteering which has taken place since the his tongue commencement of the great war is a disgrace to civilization. It is almost inconceivable that human beings would take fellows. Whilea smail section of the community took advantage of the war I have pointed to serve its own selfish ends, irrespective of the suffering it caused, Australia as a whole did magnificently in the great war. On the battlefields many of our bravest and best, with rich, red blood running through their veins, performed wonderful feats against great odds, and proved to the world that the men from the great open spaces, of Australia, who had breathed its pure air, were in no way inferior to the stock from which they sprang. In this connection I should If my motion is carried, and the Governcredit of being the first government in modern times to remove the curse of interest from the innocent millions who are to come after us. No one will contend that capital did its fair 3hare in the last war. Was there not a threat made from the government benches in this chamber that if certain men did not take up some of the war loans compulsion would be used to make them do so? I asked for a list of every one in the Commonwealth who paid income tax on £1,000 or upwards. I intended to f.illow that information up by asking for another return to see if those who were in a position to do so had taken up a fair share of our war loans. I cannot understand why the Government refused my When. I saw request for that information. The State Government under the premiership of Sir Alexander Peacock published a list of 252 persons, indicated by numbers, who paid income tax on incomes beyond a certain amount. The purpose was to show who had made increased profits during the first, second, and third years of the war. The information supplied showed that the profits made by some persons were increased by thousands per cent, during the war period. Why should we refuse to let the public know the persons who make such profits? Does not every one know, or can he not find out, the salary paid to the K in g, the salary paid to the Speaker and members of this' House, to every judge and Governor, every soldier from the highest general to the latest recruit, and every sailor from the* admiral in command to the latest midshipman? The time is coming when in these matters the people w ill control the government and parliament to a greater extent than they do .at present.' If I can do anything to keep the cross of interests from the backs of those Australians now unborn, who under existing conditions will have to bear it , I shall do it . PerhapsI cannot hope that the Government will agree to my motion, but while I . retain the confidence of my constituents such a motion will find a place on the business-paper of this House. Surely the children born of the brave dead and of the brave living who returned from the war maimed., blind, and helpless should not be compelled to pay interest on our war debt. One of the arguments urged against my motion is that if a government found that it could wipe off its huge war debt in the way I propose it might adopt the same means to wipe out all its debts. stated in. support of this objection that the income tax was at first imposed in England only as a temporary means, but its imposition has been continued. could' provide that means I propose should be adopted only to wipe off the war debt. I do not propose such means for the liquidation of other national debts. The money which they represent was in many cases spent in developing and improving Australia, but most of the war debt went up in smoke, and we have no assets like Railways and Public Works to set against it . that by the great power of the press the Australian people may be persuaded to put au end to these debts. I know of no fairer way in which this can be done than by resort to the iinearned increment. Unearned increment is not due to the genius of any single man or body of men. large population in some one place. Let any one who thinks that land would be of value independent of population ask himself what is the present value of a corner block in Babjlon, or on the most important thoroughfare of any of the ancient cities; whose populations have perished. It is population that creates unearned increment, and we should claim, the right to make use of the unearned increment for the. wiping out of the terrible load of interest which the Government has to meet, and which as an honourable nation we must pay. If the state through its rulers is hot honest in its dealings it cannot be expected that its people w ill better the example set them.

It would be a very good thing if by waving a fairy wand we could wipe out all our debts, and especially our war debt.3, and the interest burden that accompanies them. But whilst it is desirable to abolish debt the difficulty is to discover a practical means of doing it . Debt cannot be wiped out except by the producI t is tion of wealth. , The Government has brought down a practical proposal to wipe out the whole of our war debt in 50 years by means of a sinking fund , which w ill We be contributed to by direct or indirect taxation. There are other methods for wiping out debts. There is that suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne ( D r . Maloney), and there is the method followed by Germany, where the war .debt was wiped out by the depreciation of the currency. The currency of the country was so depreciated that it became possible to wipe out its war debt I hope with a comparatively nominal amount of real wealth. But we cannot get a quick and easy way to wipe out our debt. This can only be done by hard work. There are certain objections, to the proposals of the honourable member for Melbourne. There is first of all the objection that the compilation of a DomesI t is due to the congregation of a day Book, and the estimation of present-day values and values in ten years' time, would involve the establishment of an enormous organization. A very big staff would be required to carry out the work, and uo one w ill contend that the staff would be engaged upon productive work. I ts work would not add",31,Extinction Of Wardebt

Anotherobjection to the honourable member's proposal is that it singles out one particular type of wealth or property for the payment of the war debt. It is only f a ir that the payment of the debt should be made from all sources ofwealth, and should be imposed fairly upon the .community. I might give an .instance to show the inequity of the method for the payment of debt proposed by she honourable member for Melbourne. A t the present time the value of the home of an old-age pensioner is not subject to inclusion in the amount to be deducted from his capital in estimating his pension. An old man and his wife may own the house in which they live, and have only their old-age pensions to depend upon. population or for some other reason, their property might, ten years hence, become very valuable, and they would then be asked to contribute to the payment of the war debt the amount by which its value had increased. MrE . RILEY -The honourable gentleman is doing the honourable member for Melbourne a great injustice. He never suggested such a thing. he did not, but I am pointing out what would be tbe effect of his motion. I have stated only a typical illustration of its operation. alteration not of actual wealth, but only of price levels, and it might be. that because price levels differed at different times, holders of property would be penalized. ' What the honourable member proposes is merely a for m of a wealth levy. 1 shall not go into the objections to that, because to do so would open up a very big subject. There is another point of view f rom which the motion might be considered. this generation the whole burden of tbe war debt? Why should we say that it must all be wiped out in the next ten years ? When one looks back over the last century he w ill find that, after the wars of England with Napoleon, there was a very heavy war debt imposed upon the people of that country. Whilst af first it appeared that that debt was absolutely crushing and intolerable, it was ultimately borne fairly comfortably because of the discovery of new inventions and the application of improved machinery to production. T h i r t y years after the battle of Waterloo the production and the standard of living in England had> advanced enormously. It seems to be quite reasonable to expect that, as a result of the last war, its burdens, problems, and the crises that have had to be passed through in connection with it , new inventions will be made which will enable us to increase production and wealth and make our burden of interest at least tolerable during the 50-years' period within which the GoA^ernment has made provision for the redemption of the debt. For the reasons I have given I oppose the motion. I do not think it proposes an equitable way of liquidating our war By the increase of debt. I have not much to say on the motion, but I wish to reply to some of the statements of the Treasurer ( D r . Earle Page). It seems to me that whenever vested in terests are attacked, we are reminded of the.""poor widow."" Those whose interests are endangered endeavour by a stretch of the imagination to make it appear that the interests of the poor widow are identical with their own. Nothing was further I am aware that from the mind of the honourable member for Melbourne ( D r . Maloney) than to suggest that the homes of poor people should be taxed to pay the war debt. There might be an I wish to inform the Treasurer that the debt of the Napoleonic wars has never yet been paid, and I venture to say that it is still part and parcel of the British national debt. The people of Britain are now paying for the powder and shot that Wellington fired ab Waterloo. To hear the Treasurer, one would think that the national debt sinking fund was one of bis brilliant ideas, but he well knows that the principle of the sinking f u n d is quite as Why should we impose upon old as the national debt. It was tried in Great Britaini u the days of P it t , who, while paying off a few-'million pounds by means of a sinking f u n d , added many millions to the British national debt The Treasurer, in effect, says, "" L e t jiosterity pay.""

The Treasurer said the scheme would be a wealth levy, but I do not agree with him. The increase of wealth consequent upon the nation's development should not belong to a few individuals. A property in Melbourne may be worth a lot of money, but a similar property in the Sahara Desert, owing to the lack of population and means of exchange, would not be worth 2d. As the nation develops, its population and wealth increase. The Treasurer did an injustice to the honourable member for Melbourne in endeavouring to fix iipon him the advocacy of the taxation of old age pensioners, and of persons who deprived themselves of many comforts in order to obtain their own homes. poverty of the people is always used by the Government to bolster up some injustice aboiit to be perpetrated upon them. Unless the Government alters its present tactics, the national debt of this country will never be paid. I commend the honourable member for Melbourne for bringing the motion before the House. deed refreshing for an honourable member gether with the proposed decrease of to move a motion having for its objects the income tax, will mean, not a decrease but elimination of the burden of interest, a decided increase in the national debt. forced upon the people of Australia in In addition, there is £150,000 of war consequence of the late war, and to preexpenditure for transporting troops. A l vent the innocent unborn millions of Austhough six years have elapsed since the tralia from being saddled with it . I have war, this Government now intends to pay closely examined the budget, and I find that sum out of loan. When such things that the Government is following the pracas this are brought under our notice we tice adopted during the past few years can well understand the Treasurer saying of gradually increasing the number of t h a t ' there are more ways than one of works to be paid for out of loan, instead paying off the national debt. There are of out of revenue. I shall have something also more ways than one of obtaining more to say on that subject at a later a surplus. It is intended to spend, out date. afternoon clearly showedthat he had given poses. Many items in the budget could little thought to the motion before the well be paid for out of revenue, instead of House. He said that it was a good idea to out of loan, but were this done, it would try to wipe out tbe national debt. He certainly has no objection to wiping out the national debt providing that the process does not interfere with the interests of his friends. ' The taxation proposed to be derived from unearned inA l l debts have that crement, over a period of ten years, would fal l principally upon the large proN a t i o n a l debts perty holders. Last sessiou the Treasurer The endeavoured to wipe out nearly £2,000,000 of land tax due on Commonwealth territory held under Crown lease, but, when the Art/us and Age took him to task, he lost the support of his colleagues, and had to withdraw the bill . I am not surprised that the Treasurer tried, this afternoon, to make an apology for the large property holders. "" He said that there were other ways of dealing with the national debt. He instanced the case of Germany, who, by the continual in flation of currency, overcame her difficulties to some extent. I asked the Treasurer, by interjection, if he preferred that method to the proposal before the House, and he wisely gave no answer. He then brought in his grand old hobby horse, the sinking f u n d . He has trotted that subject out on several occasions. I remind him that there is more than one kind of The sinking f u n d , and the one that the Treasurer has adopted is the least effective of a l l . His statement that the national debt will be wiped out in 50 years does not take into account any unforeseen circumstance. He does not anticipate another war, or any upheaval of a far-reaching effect. I find, on looking at the budget, that this year there w ill be.an expenditure out of loan, on post-offices The Treasurer's statement this of loan, £300,000 for immigration purbe impossible to boast of reducing the national debt by £1,500,000, an expenditure to which I do not object.

He suggested that if we tax the owner of a block of land in Collins-strseton the unearned increment of ten years, a pensioner living on the outskirts of Melbourne would alsobe taxed on the increased value of his home. Treasurer were prepared to put into operation some such scheme to wipe out the interest bill of this country, it would make possible a decided increase in old age pensions, and thus compensate the pensioner for the increased tax on his home in the suburbs. The Treasurer, of course, would not accept such a proposal. He asked why should we impose on this generation the whole cost of the war. The people of this generation cried aloud, *' On with the war "" ; they allowed William Morris Hughes, when Prime Minister, and the Defence Department to spend money and waste it as they liked; they howled down any person who uttered a word of warning, and they allowed themselves to become panic-stricken, therefore let 'them pay this war bill, and not pass it on to posterity. generation have benefited by the doings of the past generations, and surely we should be prepared to shoulder our own responsibilities. The Treasurer may reply to that argument by saying that this generation is passing benefits on to futuretion as we did when incurring it, we can generations, who should be prepared to pay something for them. But he is endeavouring to pass on to our children and grandchildren not a portion, but almost the whole of the burden of war debts. I can see nothing unfair in the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney). The Treasurer says that it would be a form of wealth levy. I do not agree with him. The taking from some persons of increased property values which they have not earned would not be a wealth levy in the sense in which that term was used in Great Britain. If the scheme proposed by the honourable memMr Gabb. ber for Melbourne were put m operation it would affect mainly the large property owners in city and metropolitan areas. What is unearned At present, land values in the country It is wealth created by portions of Australia are .unduly inflated. For some years the prices of both wool and wheat have been above the average value for the. 20 years TheTreasurer said that immediately preceding the outbreak of war, and because of that agricultural and pastoral lands -have advanced to a fictitious value. Therefore, values are more likely to decrease than increase during the next decade. I am quite sure that' this scheme for taking the unearned increment for the next ten years will If the not be put into operation, firstly, because it is too idealistic tosuit the present Government, and secondly, because it would not be a popular policy to adopt within six or seven months of a general election. I do not say that I agree with the scheme iu its entirety, but I compliment, the honourable member for Melbourne upon having brought into this Parliament some fresh thought upon the reduction of the national debt and the interest burden it entails. congratulate the honourable member for Melbourne upon the motion he has submitted. Notwithstanding the incubus with which the war has loaded us we are still borrowing. The Treasurer said that the Government has evolved a scientific We of this method of extinguishing the national debt. I am not satisfied with that method. I do not believe in waiting 50 years to clear off a debt that was created in less than five years. If in regard to the liquidation of our debt we show the same determinagetout of our difficulties as. rapidly as we got into them. The people who were responsible for borrowing that money should stand up to their responsibility to repay it. I have always said that in regard to boi-rowing we are working in a vicious circle, but until the honourable member for Melbourne submitted his motion no one had attempted to suggest a solution of the debt problem. He has put forward a sane and practicable proposal, which would be approved by the people if they were afforded an opportunity of expressing an opinion with regard to it. The honourable member has proposed that any increase in values from",35,Extinction Of Wardebt

Why should not the Commonwealth take all increased values created by the war ? My family owns a property which was acquired for £625, and which could be sold to-day for £1,200.

Apart from that, we have a responsibility to undo what we did during the wajr, I belong tjo a party whose platform provided that the defence of the Commonwealth should be paid for out of revenue.

Balaclava ( Mr Watt) said ab the time that it was almost impossible to raise a loan of £20,000,000 in Australia, and, therefore, the then Labour Government the filtration of taxes through the higher was well advised to issue the loan in in economic and social strata until they stalments of £5,000,000. The honourable rested upon the manual worker. Though member said that £20,000,000 could not he does not realize it , the worker is be borrowed in the Commonwealth withactually paying the whole of the interest out disrupting industry and causing comon the war debt.

But despite the declarations of stay-at-home field marshals and financial experts, that there was not enough money in the world to finance the war for twelve months, it continued year after year, and the Commonwealth raised loan after loan for war purposes u n t i l its borrowings amounted to The Aushundreds of millions of pounds. Notwithstanding the positive declaration of The the honourable member for Balaclava and other authorities, the greater portion of that money was found in Australia. Now, in order to liquidate the debt that War-created wealth resulted from that orgy of borrowing., the honourable member for Melbourne has submitted this motion. Because of the inflated values created by the war, we are justified in adopting a proposal for redeeming the debt by a levy upon those who were enriched by the war. I believe that the honourable member for Melbourne lent to the Commonwealth free of interest such Andrew Fisher, a money as he could spare. Why could not the wealthy ""patriots "" do that ? I put into war loans one-third of the wealth I possessed-no t voluntarily, but In 1915-6 a Labour because I was driven by force of circumThe balance bonds at the bank, the clerk asked me I replied, "" Payi t back into the TreaI am admitting that sury.""

127,Debate (On Motion By Mr Fenton ),"WAR SERVICE HMS. I move That in tlie opinion of this House it is desirable that a royal commission be appointed to take into consideration all the circumstances in connection with the dismissal of Colonel James Walker from the position of War Service Homos Commissions; and that the siiid commission have power to call tor persona and papers in connection with this matter and shall issue its report before the expiration of the present session. I Lave a large amount of matter in support of this motion-, but I shall spare honourable members the infliction of reading it all. It is a littl e over four years since I last mentioned this subject in Parliament, and during the intervening time. I have become still more firml y convinced that the best interests of the. country w ill be served by appointing the royal commission I propose. There is a great deal more than appears on the surface of this matter, and I make no apology for again bringing the motion forward. I remember you, Mr SpeakerI think in July, 1921-sayin g that in a matter of this sort there were no statutory limitations, which I understood meant that if a man considered himself injured no lapse of time should prevent h i m from seeking justice. I do not think I can do better than quote from the debate that took place in Parliament on this subject on the 4th A p r i l , 1921. appealed to Mr Rodgers, who then represented the Ministerf o r Repatriation in this House, to Sir Joseph Cook, and to the late SenatorE . D . Millen to grant a royal commission to inquire into this matter. They all refused the request, and, when I asked them to state the ground of refusal, each of them told me that it was because of the insolvency. Colonel Walker had quite unf a i r l y and unjustly been declared insolvent, for he really owed nothing, and could have obtained a certificate of discharge at any time. He did not apply for a certificate, but the insolvency was annulled, which means in law that it never actually existed. When Colonel Walker applied for the position of War Service Homes Commissioner, the Minister naturally wanted to know something about him . He was referred to MrH . Cupples of the London Bank of Australasia, Brisbane, who replied by telegram, which he subsequently confirmed in a letter addressed to Senator Millen. There has been a groat deal of argument about that telegram. Colonel Walker declares,, that Senator Millen saw it , and that it stated that Colonel Walker had been in solvent. Senator Millen said he had never ples. Strange to say, two years afterwards the letter turned up. It is inconceivable that a letter of such importance, which afterwards necessitated a validating act of Parliament could lie on a departmental file for two years without any one in authority seeing it . When I was debating: this question formerly a copy of the Melbourne Herald, just off the press, was handed to me, and in it MrD . J . Gilbert was reported to have stated that the memory of Senator Millen was evidently at 'fault. Although Mr Gilbert had nothing to 'do with the War Service Homes Department, he was secretary to the Repatriation Department, and the Minister controlled both departments. The article, which I read in this House at the time, stated"" I am very loth to say anything at all about the matter,"" said Mr Gilbert, "" but as Senator Millen, Minister for Repatriation, has denied all knowledge of the existence of Mr H. Cupple's telegram from Brisbane regarding Colonel Walker, War Service Homes Commissioner, and as Mr Rodgers, Assistant Minister for Repatriation, blissfully acquiesced while I was being attacked by rash and uninformed members in Parliament as the person responI had sible' for any mistake that may have been made, I feel obliged to say a word or two. ""When Senator Millen said that he did not sec the telegram in question, his mtsmory must have been a,t fault. I sent put certain telegrams at his request, and when I received the replies I made them available to him, and that not once only. "" That is all I had to do with the matter. The Minister was attending to it himself. . . . "" In reply to a question as to whether he would care to say anything about the position that the War Service Homes Department had got into, Mr Gilbert said he would not. There is much more in the same strain, but I need not read it . When I was speaking on the subject on the previous 12th July, ;the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) said, "" W h y does not Colonel Walker make a sworn statement?"" He did make a sworn statement, which I have in my possession. It is a statutory declaration, dated 19th March, 1924, and signed before a justice",38,Extinction Of Wardebt

The appointment was made by Walker was thereDuring his term of office, Lieutenant-Colonel were held on matters, connected with the department. attacks miide on him owing to his policy to red nee the priecs of ma terials, and his manner of dealing with various persons who attempted to exploit the department. During his term he had to light a ring formed against him by various builders for the purpose of fixing high prices, and' also to compote with the Commonwealth Bank which had instituted a similar organization to the War Service Homes for -the purpose of erecting similar homes, and thereby duplicating and increasing the cost of materials and labour. These involved dirties placed heavy and onerous responsibility upon Lieutenant-Colonel Walker, yet at the time of his dismissal the number of homesthat were found to be faulty did not exceed 2 per cent., and these latter were remedied. Despite this record after two years of organization and administration of his department, without anv previous notice he received on 13th March,"" 192.1, the following abrupt letter from the Acting Minister for Repatriation:""Dear Colonel Walker, It having been ascertained (a faat as appears above which was known by those responsible for the appointment at the time the appointment was made) that at the time of your appointment as War Service Homes Commissioner -you were an uncertified insolvent, your appointment as War Service Homes Commissions is therefore null and void. It is proposed to make an executive declaration to this effect. Being, therefore, incapable of further acting as War Service Homos Commissioner, you are directed to take no further action in that capacity. Acting Minister for Repatriation."" On the same date a letter on behalf of Lieutenant-Colonel Walker was forwarded to the Assistant Minister, setting out the case, to which the Minister replied as follows:"" I am in receipt of your letter of 18th inst., and am taking the first opportunity on my return to the city to-day of replying thereto. I have only to add to my letter of 18th inst. to Lieutenant-Colonel Walker that action was not taken by the Government until after most careful consideration of all the circumstances of the case, and the Government see no valid reason for varying the decision already arrived at."" Following the procedure laid down in section 11, sub-section (2) of the War Service Homes -Act 1918, the Assistant Minister for Repatriation, on 7th April, 1921, made the statement in the House of Representatives then sitting {Hansard, No. 59, page 72SS), and in the course of the debate that followed in answer ford to the Assistant Minister( Mr Rodgers) if Lieutenant-Colonel Walker's insolvency was the only reason for depriving him of his commission, Sir Joseph Cook answered that, "".He"" {meaning Lieutenant-ColonelWalker) Lieutenant-Colonel Walker had "" was. distinctly told when the question, was considered that the satisfactory ""discharge of his duties was not in question at a l l .

In . the finding of the royal commission it was. stated""If the Commissioner (Lieu.ter.antColonel Walker) who was duly conversant at al l stages with Bradshaw's intentions, and ""was very anxious to use Australian timbers whenever possible, had been allowed to pursue the policy thus indicated, the contract would, it seems, have resulted in a large'profit to the Commission. Unfortunately, ministerial approval of the proposed sale of the redwood and oregon, as ultimately arranged among the parties, was withheld on the ground that the commission should not engage in trading operations."" During the term of Lieutenant-Colonel Walker's appointment as Commissioner of War Service Homes he received a salary of £1,500 per annum, and although construction of houses lessened considerably, the gentleman who was appointed in his stead received' a salary of £2,500 por annum, with a board of which the members received a remuneration of ten guineas per day. In July, 1921, during a debate in the House of Representatives on the War Service Homes Validation Bill, the matter of LieutenantColonel Walker's dismissal was brought before the House by various members, who pointed out that the Government had the knowledge of Lieutenant-Colonel Walker's insolvency at the time of his appointment. Mr Rodgers, Assistant Minister for Repatriation, in the course of his reply, stated that the members of the House would have an opportunity given to them later to discuss the matter uf 'LieutenantColonel Walker's dismissal. This opportunity has so far never been given, and the requests of Lieutenant-Colonel Walker for a royal commission to inquire into his administration and dismissal, have not been granted.

Colonel Walker denies that he was responsible for it . approval of the Minister for Repatriation and the Government. in his sworn evidence before the Public Accounts Committee, said he had been sent up by the late SenatorE .

This matter was ventilated in Smith's Weekly, which paper, I may add, does a great deal of good by the ventilation of public grievances. Colonel Walker is unfairly blamed for many mistakes in the war service homes administration. Whenever the War Service Homes Commissioner is mentioned, people are unable to discriminate between the present Commissioner (Colonel Semmens) and Colonel Walker. I should not be surprised even if some honourable members present this afternoon could not say who is now filling the position of War Service Homes Commissioner.

The inquiry conducted by Mr Henchman cost very little. I believe a similar commission to inquire into Colonel Walker's position would not involve heavy expenditure.

The Government. has already let him a contract for work at Canberra amounting to approximately £15,000, so that it cannot be said that he is not a competent man.

Some of tlie contracts for other supplies were less carefully handled. The dealings of the commission in timber with the firm of Messrs. E. A., and ,D.. Green, of Footscray, arc quite incomprehensible to the committee, even after the most careful investigation. The purehases of land by the commission were carried out for the most part in a rather haphazard fashion. In some of the states, officers with little or no experience in this class of work bought areas of land far ahead of possible requirements, in quite unsuitable localities. The building of houses by day labour was very badly managed by the commission. Materials were not always delivered when wanted, nor in sufficient quantities. A foolish instruction took out of the hands of the architects of the commission in the various states the responsibility for the execution of the work. The supervisors were not always well chosen, and even the best of them were handicapped by being given the oversight of more work than they could effectively control. I do not wish to pursue this matter f u r ther, but, according to the facts available, Colonel Walker stated that SenatorE . D . Millen knew of his insolvency at the time of his "" appointment. Millen stated that he had no such knowledge, and a statement to that effect was made to the House. Assuming, however, Colonel Walker to be right, he has suffered no injustice, as, on the report submitted by the Public Accounts Committee, his appointment should have been terminated earlier than March, 1921. The government of the day could not have retained Colonel Walker, in view.of the disclosures made by the Public Accounts Committee. vernment has considered the request for the appointment of a royal commission to inqiiire into the dismissal of Colonel Walker, but cannot see its way to agree to it . The facts are quite clear, and, if Colonel Walker's services had not been terminated on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment on account of his being an uncertificated insolvent, the responsible Minister must have taken action, either then or later, for his removal from office, in view of his incompetency, which unquestionably is shown by the reports of the Public Accounts Committee, which, at the request of honourable members,' considered his case.

OLD-AGE PENSIONS-SAL E OF POSTAGE HEMP AMALGAMATED WIRELESS Question-That Mr Speaker do now leave the chair-proposed . There are one or twomatters to which I wish to direct the attention of Ministers. While the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) is present, I had better refer to the matter of old-age pensions. I suggest that the proposed increase in the old-age pension should be made payable from the date of the delivery of the budget in which it was announced. It is unfair that the. old people should ha%'e to wait for the increase in their pension u n t i l a bill providing for it ' is passed. I suggest Senator that when the Treasurer introduces the necessary bill he should date back the payment of the increased pension to the date of the delivery of his budget speech. I trust the honourable gentleman will give sympathetic consideration to that request. I wish to refer now to a grievance in connection with the administration of the Postmaster-General's Department, which I thought had been remedied; I refer to the refusal of the department to grant licences for the sale of postage stamps. I The Gounderstood that the order for tlie cancellation of licences had been withdrawn. I have received serious complaints on this subject from people in my electorate, residing at Bacchus Marsh, Sebastopol, and Daylesford.' Some of these people have been' selling postage stamps for 40 years, and one of the places referred to, at Sebastopol, is 1 mile from the post office. These people are making nothing out of the sale, of stamps. Their service in the matter is like giving change for £ \ , but the permission to sell stamps on commission was of great convenience to the public. I cannot understand why they are not permitted to charge a commission on the sale of stamps. Daylesford is a tourist resort, and there is a post office there, but tourists, who visit the town in thousands, go to a news from 6.80 to 8 p.m...",43,Arthur S Rodgers

It is questionable whether the cost to the department of providing for the sale of stamps by other persons will not amount to more than the commission which used to be paid to people given the right to sell stamps. I hope that this grievance will be promptly remedied. I to the grievances of returned soldiers. I am sorry the Minister for Defence( Sir Neville Howse) is not present. I understand that he represents the M i nister for Repatriation, but on reference to HansardI cannot find any mention of a Minister for Repatriation.' The work of the Repatriation Department is carried out in a most haphazard manner, and .there is no Minister in control of it . I have appealed to the present Minister for Defence, but have received no more satisfaction from him than I did from the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), when that honourable gentleman was in charge of repatriation matters. receive the old reply. The officials of the department turn a case down, and that is the end of it . I have a case before me of a man who has two children and is expecting a third. He was gassed at the war and suffered from strained muscles, and he spent six months in a hospital in France. He is now suffering from bronchitis, and his local doctor, D r . Hardie, has no doubt that his bronchitis is due to the effects of gas. know that gas affects the lungs and that bronchitis is a lung complaint, and that this man is suffering from bronchitis because he went to the war ' and was gassed. He is receiving for himself a paltry pension of 7s. n week. He cannot do laborious work, and the family have sold practically every stick of their furniture to enable them to carry on. I made an appeal to the Repatriation Department to grant this man at least a living allowance to tide the family over their trouble, but I might just as well appeal to a stone image as to the present Ministeri n charge of the Repatriation Department. Every time. I go to Ballarat the wife of this man calls at the TradesH a l l to know if anything is being done to assist tbe family. We get the reply from the department that bronchitis is not one of the effects of the war, but honourable members need not be doctors to know that when a man who was gassed at the war suffers from bronchitis the disease is a result of his having been gassed. I hope that Ministers will taike a ' l it t l e more in terest in the Repatriation Department than they appear to do. I mention another case of a man who applied on the 9th Julyf o r a livin g allowance, and though have some references to make this is the 20th August, he has so f a r received no satisfaction. He wrote again on the 1st of August to know what was being done in his case, and received a letter dated the 11th August, informing him that his case was being considered. It took the department ten days ho acknowledge receipt of a letter asking what was being done. That is not a fair deal for a man who volunteered to go to the war department through the honourable member? He should have done so. MrM c GRATH No , he wrote directly to the department. I can assure the honI continue to orable member for In d i ( Mr Cook) that a man is likely to get as much satisfaction from a direct appeal to the department as from an appeal through the member representing the district in which he resides. I do .not know of a single case in which the Minister has not followed the recommendations of officials. The whole of the difficulties arise from the way in which returned' soldiers making claims upon the department are examined. If a man canWe not point to a specific war injury (he examining doctors say that his disability -is not due to the war. These men were in it is reasonable to assume good health .when they were accepted for service, many of them are nowunable to do a hard day's work, .and they should be treated more sympathetically than they are. I have another case of a widowed mother who lost her boy at the war. She was getting a pension of £ 1 per week from the Repa.triation Department, but as soon as she received the invalid pension the Repatriation Department reduoed her pension by 7s. 6d. per week. I understood that the payment of invalid or old-age pensions was not to affect in any way the payment of war pensions. I appealed to the department in this case with the usual result. I complain of the delay in the Repatriation Department in replying to correspondence, and generally of the treatment of returned soldiers. The whole matter was thrashed out last session, and",44,Limited Papuan Products

A doctor may say that the bronchitis from which the first man to whom I referred is suffering is not due to his war service, but the fact remains that he was six months in hospital in France. He was badly gassed, and the gas will have a lasting effect upon him. He cannot do laborious work, and, as I have said, a paltry 7s. a week is all that a grateful country gives to a soldier, who hope that the Minister concerned will give sympathetic consideration to the representations I have made. shall occupy only a few moments in referring to a matter of great concern to an important industry of the Commonwealth; I refer to the large importations of coke. I am sorry that the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) is not present. Two or three weeks ago I received communications from representatives of coke workers in the south coast district of New South Wales, asking me to ascertain from the Minister the quantity of coke imported during a period of twelvp or eighteen months, and the countries from which it was imported. I wrotn to the department on the subject on the 24th July, and I have here a letter from the Minister for Trade and Customs in which he statesI am in receipt of your letter dated 24th. July, 1925, relative to your desire to be furnished with certain information regarding imports of coke, and in reply desire to advise you that the imports of coke into the Commonwealth during the twelve months ended 30th June, 1925. were 28,840 tons, of a recorded value of £56,255. The recorded value is the invoice price, plus 10 per cent. Details of the imports from various countries during the whole of the period mentioned above are not immediately available, but arrangements have been made for a statement, setting out the deMonths sired particulars, to be forwarded to you as soon as the necessary returns shall have been received from the collectors of Customs in the various states. The letter I quote is not dated, but is about a fortnight old, and up to the present I have received no further information.

The coke industry on the south coast of New South Wales is practically . out of existence. Most of the coke-ovens suffered and bled for it . I are closed down. Hundreds of men are out of employment, and those who are working work only one shift a day, or half or quarter time. The position w ill not improve while large quantities of I coke are being imported into this country. I question whether the whole of the 1S,000 tons of coke imported from the United Kingdom is really the product of that country. It is quite possible that a large quantity of coke is purchased in Germany at a low cost and shipped to Australia as a B ritish product. The duty is light, and, in consequence, our coke and coal industries are suffering seriously. It w ill be interesting to know whence the whole of the imported coke comes. The Department of Trade and Customs may not yet have the figures available, although I asked for them f u l l y a month ago. Our base and key industries must be firmly established if this country is to develop on sound lines. We should do everything possible to encourage the coke industry by imposing a heavy duty upon the imported article. .Because of mass production in Germany and of the development of so many subsidiary industries there, coke has become an important by-product of that country, and is therefore sold at a very low price.",45,Limited Papuan Products

I wish to direct the attention cf the Postmaster-General to the subject casting, and to protest against ihe excessive fee charged for listening-in. I know that the department has agreed to make a small reduction, but if a comparison is made between the income received by the department from this source, and the subsidy paid to the broadcasting companies, one can only regard the business as a form of profiteering. In reply to a question asked early this session the Postmaster-General admitted that £34,628 19s. I d . had been paid to Farmer's £12,000 to Broadcasters Limited. time that the Government made a larger reduction. in the fees. As a listener-in I these fees is .inequitable. As I have said, £12,000, service £34,000. Broadcasters Limited is of greater quantity than and of equal quality to that of Farmer's, and it seems grossly unfair that this arrangement should be continued. 1 should like the Minister to inform the House whether, in the event of further stations being established in New South Wales, it is proposed to allow them to participate in the distribution of the licensing fees. The present fee has been the subject of considerable public protest. for Brisbane( MrD . Cameron) today asked a question concerning the news broadcast from Brisbane. should certainly be some regulation of the information broadcast by the various stations. The news broadcast from the two Sydney stations is very often charged with political bias, according to the channel from which it is derived. As the public pay a licensing fee to the Commonwealth Government for these services, news only, and not political comment or other matter likely to influence the public mind politically, should be broadcast. I do not object to the broadcasting of speeches, provided that privilege is extended to the various parties. During the recent New South Wales election both Government and Opposition leaders were allowed to broadcast their campaigu speeches. A purely propaganda station, for whose service the public would pay no licence fee and to which it would be optional to listen-in, would be in a ( Mr Gibson) category entirely different from stations of wireless broadsuch as Farmer's, Broadcasters, 3LO, and others. I should like to hear from the Postmaster-General whether there is any possibility of securing a further reduction of what I consider to be the excessive licence fees. Monaro) [8.30] -Fo r some time.

One result of the delay w ill be that some traders w ill have to go through the ruinous process of competing for two years with others who have imported goods under a lower schedule. Importers' warehouses are almost bursting with some of the .goods that w ill be dealt with in the schedule, and the country w ill be flooded with them as soon as the schedule has been passed. It would appear that the Government is in league with the importers. There There is no excuse whatever for the delay. In a composite government, such as is in office at present, there must be Parliament. The promise, a sacrifice of principle on both sides, if members of the Ministry have such things as principles. On tariff matters one-half of the Ministry is pulling one way, and the other half the other way.

The present tariff is not protective, and this country would be better off without it . I have restrained myself in patience as long as I could, but the delay is getting beyond human toleration. I hope that the Government w ill introduce this overdue schedule next week. I do not know the fiscal faith of the Minister for Defence( Sir Neville Howse), and I have not heard the Vice-President of the ExecuI t has promised to tive Council( Mr Atkinson) express his views on the subject, but I have a susI t is time this picion that the Treasurer ( D r .

What has become of the pronouncement made by the Minister, when, as a p r i vate member, he sat ' in the corner near where the honourable member for Are there any protecFranklin( Mr Seabrook) is now sitting 1 In those days he thumped his desk, and declared in no uncertain language that tbe industries of Australia must be given adequate protection without delay.

If the people will not give my party power to put that policy into operation I shall, on every occasion, vote to protect the Australian manufacturer from the encroachments of the foreigner. Manufacturers in my division, and in many of the provincial centres of Victoria, are suffering from lack of adequate protection against outsiders. Minister will now stand up to his professions of protection, he may save himself politically. We should insist upon a complete analysis of the tariff schedule. The Tariff Board has been investigating certain proposals for over two years. Consequently the importers have a very shrewd idea of what is going to happen, and have made preparations accordingly. If members of the composite Cabinet cannot agree upon all the items of the proposed new tariff schedule, they should in troduce that part of it upon which they are agreed. They should not allow Australian industries to suffer simply because of the difficulty of getting an agreement in Cabinet. I shall harass the Government on this subject u n t i l the Minister introduces the tariff schedule which is so long overdue. 1 also have a remark to make concerning tariff proposals, but from a slightly different stand-point from that of the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton). the Tariff Board by the Imperial Oil Company, the Commonwealth Oil Refineries, and John Fell and Company, on the 4th August, to fix a duty on kerosene and petrol imported in cases and tins. Under the present tariff kerosene is duty free. firms I have mentioned, have asked members of the Tariff Board to recommend a duty of 2d. a gallon on all kerosene imported in cases. A t present petrol is dutiable at £d. a gallon under .the British preferential tariff, and I d . a now they are gallon under the' general tariff. Their request is for a duty of l ^ d . per gallon I do not agree with British preferential, and 3d. a gallon The in the general tariff. I have no f a u l t to find with a protectionist policy that is likely to help legitimate industries in Australia, though I may not be quite as enthusiastic on this subject as the honourable member for Maribyrnong. These firms argue that if the proposed duties I believe in the new are imposed, considerable employment will be provided for Australian workmen in canning and casing bulk kerosene and petrol. Honourable members representing country divisions remote from the capital cities of tlie Commonwealth have received protests against these proposals. E am not going to say that they are perfectly understood. 1 am stating the If the complaint that has been voiced w i th the object of obtaining information. I have no doubt that every honourable member has received literature from the British ImperialO i l Company on the subject. This company states that £250,000 is lost to Australia annually through the importation of petrol and kerosene in tins and cases. In a special letter to me and to other Western Australian members, becaiise of telegrams from the primary producers' associations throughout Western Australia, the company points out that the intention is to erect bulk stores i u all tbe capital cities, and that insteud'of prices being increased, they will be reduced 3d. per gallon in bulk. This would be very acceptable if we.could believe it . I should be in favour of the proposal if that were likely to be the outcome, but logic makes me ask why the companies mentioned have approached the Tariff Boardi f the imposition of the duties mentioned will mean cheaper petrol for consumers in Australia. They are very careful to I refer to a requestto emphasize the advantages of these bulk Britishstores. What does this mean ? It means, of course, that while petrol may be cheaper to consumers in capital cities, -people livin g in country districts and in the outback areas, being obliged to purchase their requirements in cases and The tins, w ill have to pay the increased price.

164,Mr A. Green (Kalgoorlie) [9.5],"although a very busy man, he will focus his attention upon this important proposal. I hope that he will insist upon a guarantee being given that if the requests be agreed to higher prices for petrol and kerosene w ill not be levied on consumers in country districts. If it is necessary to impose a duty upon kerosene and petrol imported in cases and tins to establish the packing industry in Australia, it seems to me that the only way to safeguard the consumer is to make some arrangement whereby the material required for cases and tins may be imported duty free. I am very much afraid that, unless some such precaution is taken, there w ill be an increase in the price of petrol and kerosene to country consumers in the interior .of Australia. There is another matter of 'considerable importance to which I desire to direct attention. I have been advised unofficially that, owing to the heavy cost of repair work, it is proposed to abolish tlie overland telegraph line between Albany and Adelaide, and to erect two wires along the east-west railway line to carry the present traffic. Telegraphic communication between Western Australia and the eastern states was established in 1S76, repeating stations being established at Albany, Israelite Bay, Euchi, Fowler's Bay. If the existing AdelaidePerth line is dismantled and communication made along the east-west railway route, it w ill mean that instead of having two lines as at present, one by way of Albany, and another from Kalgoorlie through Norseman and Balladonia, we shall have only one. There have been occasions during cyclonic storms in Western Australia when the line between Coolgardie and Balladonia has been blown down. The same thing has happened in connection with the line from Albany to Eyre, but on no occasion have both Hues been affected simultaneously. proposal is carried out, we shall have to depend on one Line only. mean that the line on the coast would be remo ved ? MrA . GREEN -That would be the case. the munication between Western Australia and the eastern states being cut off at intervals. Eveni f it cost £.1.0,000 to renew the line from Eyre to Albany, it would be better to spend that amount and have a duplicate line than to take down the existing line. The cost -of the upkeep of the. existing line is not very great, as the staff at Esperance, Fowler's Bay, and Eucla consists of only four telegraphists and four linesmen. I trust that the Government will effect any necessary repairs to the existing line, and allow it to remain. A. further reason for the retention of this line is that that portion of Western Australia which, from a pastoral point of view, has been largely overlooked, is now receiving attention. That area, and the portion of South Australia between Fowler's Bay and Eucla., would be severely handicapped if the line were removed. During the last twelve months several parties have inspected this area with a view to taking it up for pastoral purposes. Asi t has been' ascertained that water is obtainable there, the country can be profitably occupied; but if the telegraph line is taken.away, an incentive to its development will be removed . When the Estimates for last year were before the House the sum of £5,250 was provided to obtain plant for the and manufacture of artificial limbs, made from a material known as duralumin. This is a very light materia], which, during tbe war, was used in the manufacture of aeroplanes, and since it has also beeu used in the manufacture of artificial limbs. I understand that it was the Government's intention to establish the main plants for the manufacture of artificial limbs at Sydney and Melbourne, with subsidiary plants in the other artificial limb factories in the Commonwealth. In reply to a question the other day, the Minister for' Defence informed me that artificial limbs made of duralumin would be available, to amputees early in the new If this year, but that the limbs would not be constructed wholly of this material; the wooden socket, or bucket, for thigh amputations would be retained, as well as wooden feet. No mention was made of artificial limbs to replace arms or of below-knee amputations. In addition to being a very light material, In that event there is duralumin possesses a peculiar toughness, possibility of .telegraphic comso that limbs made of it are not liable to wear out to the extent that",51,Austin Chapman W H E N Necessarily Opposed To I T

166,Mr R. Green (Richmond) [9.181,"wooden limbs do. shown that duralumin buckets, or sockets-, for thigh amputations are better than those made of wood. I recognize that artificial feet must still be made of wood, but I hope that buckets for thigh amputations and iimbs for below-the-kuee amputations will be made of duralumin. The date mentioned by the Minister as that when duralumin limbs will be available is still five or six months ahead, or about eighteen months after the approval by Parliament of the expenditure necessary for the purchase of the plant tb make them. sibly this delay is capable of explanation, but these limbs should have been available before this. Many amputees are continuing to use their present artificial limbs in the hope that others of the new material will soon be available. I visited the artificial limb factory in Melbourne last week to ascertain what progress was being made in the installation of the plant for the manufacture of these limbs, and found that the work was very much behind. The manager of the factory, himself an amputee, is doing all that is possible. If the manager is hampered through lack of staff, or of material, or plant, I appeal to the Minister to make good the defect, so that artificial limbs made of duralumin may be made available ab the earliest possible date. There are about 3,000 returned soldiers still using artificial limbs of a design which was decided upon in the early days of the war. Australia has not taken advantage of the improvements in these limbs which have been adopted by other countries. I appeal to the Minister to ascertain the cause, of delay, and to expedite tbe delivery of artificial limbs made of duralumin. Sir NEVILLEHOWSE the matter. wish to refer to a matter which should be of great importance to Queensland and to Australia generally. I refer to the sisal hemp industry. On the 13th instant I asked the following questions: f. What is the value of sisal hemp grown in (n) each state, and ('(>) Australia? 2. Where is this hemp used in Australia, and for what purposes? 3. What tariff protection is. given to the sisal hemp industry in Australia? The replies that I received wereJ. So far as can bo ascertained, sisal hemp is not now commercially grown in Australia. 2: Seereply to No. 1. Experiments have 3. British preferential tariff, 1.0"" per cent.; intermediate tariff, 15 per cent.; general tariff, 20 per cent. I desire to point out to the Minister that sisal hemp is grown in Central Queensland, at Bajool, about 23 miles' from Rockhampton. This industry would be suited to the tropical p:srts of Australia, aud, moreover, the plant can. be grown in inferior soil, and is drought-resisting. I suggest that the Tariff Board be asked to inquire into the question with a view to the Federal Government granting a bounty to assist Postbe industry for a number of years. A large sum of money goes out of Australia every year for the purchase of this material, whereas if ' it were grown here, an industry which would absorb a number of additional settlers would be established Some years ago the Federal Government granted a bounty of 10 per cent, on the value of the fibre grown in Australia, up to £6,000 a year for nine years, in an endeavour to establish the industry. Prices then for this material were much lower than they are to-day. A large plantation was started at Childers, in Queensland, but the land was too rich for the production of this fibre, and it is now devoted to the production of sugar cane. An attempt to establish the industry at Port Moresby was also made, but, although the plantation flourished, for a time, it failed through inefficient management. This is an industry in which dairymen, cotton growers, and others following in agricultural pursuits may engage as a supplementary crop. After four sears theplant can be utilized for the manufacture of hemp. Except for about 40 acres near Bajool, in Queensland,, the whole of our sisal hemp requirements are I shall look into imported. The farm at Bajool has beeu worked spasmodically only. There are several varieties of. the sisal plant, the best of them being one named Agave Rigida l f«' Sisalana,. though all tbe 7 species which were introduced into tropical Queensland flourished. Various species of sisal were introduced into Florida, the West Indies, Papua and German East Africa, in all of which the industry was at one time Minister for Lands in Queensland, introduced it into that state. He obtained plants of the variety known as .'I gave Rigida. V w Sisalana from the Bahamas, where the Germansi n East Africa, who quickly realized the value of",52,Austin Chapman W H E N Necessarily Opposed To I T

168,"Successfully Established. Mr P. Mclean,","the plant, also obtained their requirements. The plant was successfully grown in Queensland, at tbe penal establishment at St. Helena, where it yielded excellent results. It was distributed from St. Helena to a number of districts, and among other places, to the plantation at Bajool. The importations of sisal hemp, and of New Zealand flax, into Australia during the five years from 1916-17 to 1920-21 were as follow: Year. tons. 1 910-17 1917-18 1918-19 5.007 293,056 1919-20 1920-21 n 1920-21 the i m ports in to the various Australian states were':State. tons. New South Wales .. 2,270 Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Total One advantage of the sisal hemp crop is that it can be grown without any care. On the tropical coastlands of Queensland its cultivation can be carried on successfully. The plant does best on poor, rocky, dry, gravelly soils, rich in lime. It is estimated that sisal hemp is worth £40 per ton, and presuming that it would yield a ton per acre, a man might make a fairly good living in Central Queensland from a 40-acre farm devoted to its cultivation. suitable machinery for the treatment of the plant has been one of the obstacles in the way of the industry. I brought under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) the fact that it was impossible to get siiitable machinery in Australia for the purpose, and I think he met my wishes with a view to assisting the present owner of a farm in Central Queensland, to which I have able member seriously suggesting that I referred, to secure the special machinery should move a vote of censure and throw required for dealing with the fibre. In the Government out. view of the information I have given I hope the Minister will have the matter tleman meant business, and put the oldconsidered by the Tariff Board with a age and invalid pensioners first, he view to a decision as to-whether it is should, as a member of the Cabinet in advisable to grant a bounty to encourage 1923, have induced the Government fo in the growing of sisal hemp. As one who crease the pension to £1 per week as the Mr Forde. has inspected the Central Queensland farm, I believe there is a good chance of making its cultivation a flourishing industry in Queensland, thus giving employment to a considerable number of men.

Theyhave been expecting the increase, and have asked honourable members when they are to get it . If . it was not the intention of the* Government fo pay the increased pension immediately, the Treasurer should not have mentioned the proposal to increase it . The present pension of 17s. 6d. per week is of no more use than was the pension of 12s. 6d. per week when that amount was being paid, because the cost of living and house rents have gone up and pensioners have a hard struggle to exist at present. I ask the Treasurer to make the statement that the Government intend immediately to introduce an Old-age and Invalid PensionB ill to bring the pension up to £ 1 per week. I am sure that no member of the House -would offer any objection to such a measure. There are one or two anomalies connected with the payment of old-age pensions to which I should like to refer; If a man and woman have a home of their own, and through circumstances over which they have, no control are compelled to leave the district in which their home is, the fact that they let the home deprives them of their pension, notwithstanding the fact that they have themselves to pay rent iuthe place to which they have gone tended by this Parliament. These people have struggled to obtain a home, and they should .not be penalized if , for health and other reasons, they have to leave it to reside in another district. Sometimes a husband deserts a wife. He may be in another state, and because he is earning' wages, although contributing nothing to the upkeep of his wife, she is ^debarred from obtaining a pension. -I know of men who have been pensioned from the railway service.

They are investigated, and the officers of the department say"", "" W h a t can we do; we know it is a genuine case, but the act prevents us from paying the pension."" I ask the Treasurer to do all in his power to remedy these anomalies. I 'happen to represent part of a large manufacturing district, and I can assure the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) that the delay in putting the amended tariff schedule on the table has greatly inconvenienced nianufacturers, who cannot sell their goods, and in consequence thousands of people are being deprived of their means of livelihood. Under the present tariff, owing to changes that have taken place in Europe and the exchange rate, a 30 per cent, duty is not worth 15 per cent., and, in consequence, Australian manufacturers cannot compete against the large foreign i m portations. If we are protectionists let us give protection. I am not in favour of protection for every article. I do not favour a duty on kerosene or petrol because they are not produced in Australia. It is no excuse for the Minister to say that he is waiting for the report of the Tariff Board' before he takes action. Former Ministers amended the tariff without the assistance of the Tariff Board. The present Minister knows as much about the tariff as does the Tariff Board. He knows the condition of industries, and he should place the amended tariff That was surely not inschedule upon the table of the House, so that manufacturers may be guided in their operations. I commend the men who have put money into many of our secondary industries. I recently visited the Davis' gelatine works at Botany. That firm is pioneering, and should receive every encouragement. The same remark applies to other industries. I had the opportunity of inspecting the hosiery works of George Bond and Company, and also their new works for the production of cotton goods. These firms cannot exist unless they receive assistance through the Customs. I agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr. Fenton) that the mere fact of the Governor General'?Speech containing the announcement, that the Government would revise the tariff has caused a large Yes , and because increase in imports which will have Honourable members will have any effect at all.

I welcome the decision of the Government to increase the pension to £ 1 per week, but I am glad that the honourable member for Capricornia. ( Mr Forde) has shown whence has come the driving force which brought the Government to that decision. Some time ago I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) whether he proposed to amend the tariff in order to give greater assistance to the producers in Papua. When I visited the Territory I was told, as no doubt other honourable members have been told, that the producers cannot get any consideration from the Commonwealth in regard to the admission of their products to the mainland. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) referred to the growth of sisal hemp. I visited a hemp remove plantation, covering about 2 square miles, in the vicinity of Port Moresby. Because the growth of this crop was found to be Sons or unprofitable, the plantation has become a neglected wilderness, but the hemp is ' growing luxuriantly and is of excellent quality. I was informed that although sisal hemp could be grown extensively in Papua, and considerable quantities are . imported into Australia, yet the Commonwealth gives no fiscal help to producers in the Territory. The same complaint is made in regard to rubber, cocoa, cotton, coffee, and suga'r.

Last year the Government introduced a measure to enlarge the foundation and constitution of the Commonwealth Bank in order to make it a truly national in stitution, and to convert it into a bank of issue, discount, reserve, and exchange. This year, on that broadened base, the Government desires to build a rura l credits department to still increase the bank's importance and usefulness large. During my recent t r ip abroad I and London the Commonwealth Bank Act of last year was regarded as the greatest advance ever made in the banking history of Australia. This bill proposes a further advance, the importance of which cannot be over-estimated. On the one hand, the measure may be described as the charter of the farmer. It aims to give the organized producer freedom to control his produce during the whole period of its distribution throughout the year. On the other hand, the bill may be described as the insurance of . the consumer. It provides a means whereby tbe consumers themselves may, if the producers neglect to do so, build up a reservoir of the necessaries of l if e and regulate their distribution at an even volume or pressure throughout the year.""

The Government w ill not operate that machinery-actio n and initiative on the part of the producer must set it in motion. No government aid will be sought or given; transactions wil l be strictly on a commercial basis. The individuality and enterprise of the producer, not the Government, in future w ill control the disposal of his produce. Agri culture is the foundation of our whole economic and business structure. If agriculture prospers, and the farmers and the others who derive thriir incomes from the land are able to purchase freely, all business is prosperous. When they are in serious difficulty, and are unable to maintain their buying power, all business shares in the consequent blight and general distress. Unemployment and depression then attack every city calling. The recent period of depression in America, which crippled agriculture first and afterwards spread throughout the nation, brought this fact home to bankers, manufacturers,' and business men in every part of that country, and forced a greater realization of the dependence of all industry on the stability of agriculture and allied further industries.

Th6 outstanding feature of the towns are farmer's industry is that his crop is harjust as intimately related to vested in a short time, but is consumed oyer the whole year. financing him, then, should adjust themselves to this natural process of production and distribution. the point where the need for theorderly marketing of agricultural products must be frankly recognized, and an effort made to provide the necessary financial machinery. must be adjusted, if necessary, with this end in view, and especially to make it possible at all times for co-operative marketing associations, which permit of the continuous ownership of the crop by the producer, to obtain adequate funds for their operations in the direction of orderly marketing. The necessity, for this has been felt already in Australia. Attempts have been made to overcome it by direct Treasury advances in the case of the Producers' Wholesale Federation, and the Port Huon Co-operative Company, and by guarantees in the case of certain pools. These at best are spasmodic efforts. The realization of a definite principle is needed by the establishment of a permanent organization that will operate on a commercial basis without regard to the political aspects, and will always be available. A t the present time the basic business of Australia is the production and distribution of agricultural commodities. finance for the manufacture of raw materials into the finished goods and for the export of manufactured goods-whic h is practically the position with which British finance has come to concern itselr and which the British banking system, of which the Australian system is more or less an out-growth and an imitation, is designed to meet-is not entirely suitable for a country mainly dependent on agriculture. The operations just mentioned are continuous. They are more or less regular in volume over the whole year. The operations of agriculture are quite different in their nature. A t the present time an extra good' crop increases the difficulty of financing, it tends to tighten of production, because of the extra up credit, forces upon the market an abnormally large volume of products and sometimes even capital stock in an unusually short period of time, and may make a bounteous season a curse in stead of a blessing to the producer. What is necessary is that we shall establish some machinery that will render financial assistance applicable to the essenspent by Federal and State Governments tial requirements of agriculture. We frequently find that under the present Our processes of system the production of a bumper crop renders the financing of it more difficult. As already indicated, credit is tightened We have reached up. We had an experience of this last year in connection with the wool clip. We had an exceedingly good clip, with anexpectation of big prices, but that very fact, tended to generate Existing banking facilities a condition of fear and lack of confidence in the community which was only overcome by the prompt action of the directors of the Commonwealth Bank in making advances to the associated banks to enable them to handle the wool business. It may be urged that the present system has carried us on for a long time, and consequently is satisfactory, and that the condition of agriculture in Australia is such that the industry needs no special treatment; but several things indicate that it is very unsatisfactory. We have only to look at the difficulties experienced in financing our various crops, especially the major crops, during the last three years to realize that it is most unsatisfactory. If we look at the relative increase in the number of producers to the total population We see that the conditions are at any rate not sufficient to encourage agriculture. The figures of the census of the last ten years indicate that The system of the number of persons engaged in manufacturing industries increased roughly at the same rate as the general Increasei n population, that is, 21 per cent.; that those engaged in transportation and distribution increased at a rate of 50 per cent, greater than the general rate of increase in the population-actuall y 30 per cent.,as against 21 per cent -and that primary producers increased by only 9 per cent., or less than half the total rate of progress of the population as a whole. Actually, in relation to the other industries of Australia, agriculture retrogressed in respect of the number of persons engaged in it , although it did not retrogress in the matter work done and the better methods adopted. This relative retrogression -took place despite the fact that very big efforts had been made by both the Federal and State Governments to help to settle people on the land. U p to the present some £77,000,000 has been on the resumption of estates and in land settlement schemes, including soldier settlement schemes. A good deal of financial machinery has been built up in that connection, but solely in relation to capital charges, and having no application whatever .to ordinary marketing. finance for the immediate disposal, of a farmer's crop has been provided by three agencies-the and the storekeepers. banks do not like farmers' accounts as much as they like ordinary accounts. They are not as active or quickmoving as the others. agent buys a farmer's diately passes out of the hands of the producer.. farmer while he is selling the crop in the ordinary regular way, but because his business is not that of banking, he must make certain charges either by increasing the price of his goods or by increasing his interest he has given. provement formation of the Commonwealth Bank last year into a central bank, by making re-discount. to have the currency for seasonal just as is done under the system federal reserve system States and that than central bank to deal with the question of the orderly marketing of our crops, especially for the national handling of them in the most efficient and economic way.

This change involves risks and speculative elements which are ultimately charged to the marketing costs. Denmark can supply her English customers the whole year round, which fact, together with their uniform standard of quality, makes it easier and cheaper handling for the merchant to handle Danish butter than the butter from, any other country. The result is seen in the constant difference in price institution between Australian butter and Danish butter. This statement of an impartial observer is striking testimony of, the importance of institutions, the matter and of the necessity for Australian action. Before outlining the Government's plan to put Australia into as good a position as other countries .to deal with this matter, it is worthwhile in this direction has been examining what is being done by other countries in somewhat similar circumstances to our own, especially the United in States of America, and also to analyse the present position at which Australia has arrived. In Europe, before the war, the finances of agriculture were largely arranged by co-operative banks, formed by the farmers themselves, as the ordinary commercial banks found difficulty in gauging the credit of the small farmer by personal knowledge, and did not find the account very attractive in itself. The work was done, therefore, by such in stitutions as the Raffeisen system of banks, or by rural credit societies in Germany, the Credit Agricolei n France, or by various modifications of these in other European countries. It is noteworthy that in France the Government considered the question of the provision of agricultural credit of such importance that, when the charter of the Bank of France was renewed, in 18P6, the Government inserted certain new conditions to assist the formation and functioning of rural credit organizations. An annual subsidy of a certain fixed portion of the yearly profits of the Bank of. France was provided to assist the organization and formation, of these rura l banks. France was also required to advance 40,000,000 francs to the Government, free of interest, for use in subsidizing these organizations. The effect of the action of these institutions in Europe has been a double one. First, a credit system has been established to meet the essential requirements of the agriculturist, and, secondly, there have been secured for h i m rates of interest consistent w i th the security of his business. Agricultura l security has been shown by the operations of these organizations during many years to be of the best possible character. Consequently, the interest has been at low rates. In times of national stress it has often happened, as in Germany, that the rural banks have been able to issue bonds at a less rate than even the Government itself has found possible. All these institutions were in operation for many years before the war, and part and parcel of the national life, and have not been interfered with by the war or its reactions. The condition of these countries, however, is to some extent different from that of Australia. It is worthwhile to examine more closely' the position of newer countries having similar problems. of America, very little action towards securing this for m of agricultural credit had been taken prior to the Great War, and during the war the business of the farmer suffered complete disorganization. [70] Asi n Australia, his goods were commandeered, their prices fixed, and special methods of finance became necessary to deal with his produce during that time, and especially during the period of dislocation that ensued after the war. During the war exports of all products were, to a large degree, financed by government loan. When the war ceased, the loans also ceased. It was necessary then to create some kind of agency to take their place in order to ensure the continuance of the flow of exports. The War Finance Corporation, which had been created for the purpose of handling exports during the war period, was then used as a reconstruction agency. It carried on its work as an emergency machine up to the beginning of last year, but its work was found to be so valuable that an organization of a similar nature has been given a permanent place in the financial maThe Bank of chinery of the United States of America by the passing of the Intermediate Credits Actf or the specific purpose of ensuring the orderly marketing of American products. The effect of the War Finance Corporation and of the federal intermediate credit system in stabilizing prices and assisting the orderly marketing of exportable goods has been out of all proportion to the capital employed and the goods it controls. To illustrate its psychological effect, it is worthwhile examining the way in which it operated in the case of one of the great exportable commodities of the United States. Cotton compares with the balance of the raw products of the United States of America as wheat or butter compares with the total of Australian raw products, and perhaps it is the best example to take, because, though a large proportion is used at home, a substantial percentage is exported. In 1921, a peculiar situation was encountered. Not only did European buyers lack funds to buy the bulk of the year's supply shortly after the harvest, as had been their custom in the past, but they were unwilling to do so, because of the fluctuations in exchange. They preferred to.take the chance of having to pay a In the United States higher price later on for a portion of their needs rather than take the risk involved in buying ahead large quantities of cotton that would have to be paid for in American dollars, and sold in European currencies. They therefore changed their method, and adopted the policy of buying more or less on a basis, and spreading their purchasesover a longer period. proximately 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 bales of cotton that ordinarily would have been exported in the first six months of the cotton year, had to be carried over to the second six months, stored during that time. carrying this cotton was thus from the European buyer and financier to the American grower and his bank. They were not equipped -to meet the emergency, because they had depended largely on others to take care of the time element in marketing the crop, and had developed no adequate machinery for taking care of it themselves when changed made it necessary for them to do so. The point that I wish to stress is that to stabilize the market it is not necessary to ensure the orderly marketing and financing of the whole of the crop, but only of a percentage of it. Care of a substantial percentage of the crop creates confidence, and ensures orderly ing, especially when it is understood orderly marketing, holding, is the real policy. gress of the ""United States of was so impressed with the work that had been done in this connection by . the War Finance Corporation that it gave the corporation authority by the Credit Acts to make advances to banking institutions associations for any purpose with the growing, harvesting, for market, and the marketing of agricultural products, or for the breeding, raising, fattening, stock. It fixed the maximum amount of loans that might be outstanding one time export §1,000.000.000. loans for export and for agricultural and live stock purposes were granted to the extent of $650,000,000. their experience with this system the following two years, a definite conviction was arrived at that the processes of financing should be made to adjust themselves to the natural processes of production and distribution, the processes of production and distribution should be forced to adjust to systems of finance created entirely for commercial and industrial purposes. Dr. Earle Page. this object in view, the Federal Interhand-to-mouth mediate Credit Banks were created as part of the system of agricultural finance, and This meant that apwere placed under the control of the same executive which controlled the Federal Farm Loan Banks. Thus the Federal Reserve Bank system provided for the discounting of short term paper, and the and financed and Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, The burden of as their name implies, were detransferred signed for the purpose of supplying intermediate credit for the farmer. In Australia, government assistance to the marketing of our products has been along no definite lines. There have been guarantees to compulsory pools and to voluntary pools, and there has been assistance to pools which were not conditions pools at all like the f r u it pools. There have been advances to industries. The outstanding feature of all these methods has been the arbit r a r y amount fixed by way of advance when the Government came into the matter. As well there has been conmarkettinual uncertainty as to whether governthat ment aid would be available at all. and not speculative Approach to Parliament at any time is The Cona risky matter the issue of which cannot be America foreseen. Conditions unfavorable to the producer might easily be insisted on by a chance political majority. The only healthy state of affairs is that in which Agricultural the producer is able to look after himself and arrange his business on regulated and co-operative marketing commercial lines. Last year the Goconnected vernment acted on this definite principle preparation in its export control legislation, which put the control of the exportable surplus in the hands of the industry itself if it and marketing of live thought fit to organize. . To enable this principle to be applied generally at any throughout industries, machinery must for both agricultural and be available by which organized induspurposes at £200.000,000, or tries could automatically secure the Inside three months necessary finance on a commercial basis. The Government believes that this can be done by the claims of the various in As the result of dustries being examined on their merits during by an impartial commercial institution -without any political consideration at all.

That such machinery does not exist, or if it does exist, does not function in Australia is demonstrated by the experience of the Western Australian voluntary pool la3t year. Federal Government to make themselves, as f a r as possible, independent of government control, the farmers in the state of Western Australia attempted to form a voluntary pool with free finance. W it h out a State Government guarantee, the financial found to be insuperable, because the conditions were intolerable and unacceptable to the farmers. The farmers persisted, however, in their pooling scheme, but to get the necessary finance were finally compelled to enter into an agreement with a financial organization in England. Even when these arrangements were made, negotiations with the Commonwealth Bank and other banks to bring moneys out f r om England occupied a considerable time, and caused much vexation and uncertainty. Australian banks agreed to provide the exchange, and the wheat was moved. Difficulties, such as these, and the necessity of relying on oversea institutions, will be avoided when the machinery provided by the new bill is established. The bill before the House is designed to arrange the necessary assistance. Briefly, the Rural Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank is to be distinct from all other parts of the bank, and its funds are to be provided in the following way. The Treasurer may lend the Rural Credits Department up to £3,000,000, and 25 per cent, of the net annual profits of the Note Issue Department is to be paid into the Rural Credits Department unti l the amount so paid reaches £2,000,000. This will, of course, not provide sufficient funds, and the b ill , therefore, provides that the bank may raise money by the issue of debentures up to an amount The actual financing for the i m which must not exceed at any time the amounts advanced by the Rural Credits Department on primary produce, or four What is necessary is protimes the amount of the aggregate of the following sums, namely:-(1 ) Sums lent by the Treasurer; (2) Moneys paid from profits of the Note Issue Department; and (3) Half of the accumulated profits of the Rural Credits Department. The limi t of the debentures is to be the greater of the amounts just indicated. The dates for the redemption of the debentures shall be arranged so as to coincide, as nearly as practicable, with the dates at which advances made by the Following the advice of the Rural Credits Department are repayable. The general bank also may make advances to the Rural Credits Department. Incidentally these short term debentures will help to form a short loan market in Australia. The advances to be made by the Rural Credits Department shall be made on the security of primary proobstacles in Australia were duce placed under the legal control of the bank. These advances may be made to the general portion of the Commonwealth Bank, to other banks, to co-operative associations, and to such corporate or incorporate bodies as may be specified by proclamation. No advance may be made for a period of more than one' year. In lieu of making the advances referred to, the Rural Credits Department may, on behalf of any of the institutions indicated, discount bills secured upon produce placed under the legal control of the A t length the bank. The assets of the Rural Credits Department shall be available, firstly, for meeting the liabilities of the department other than loans made to it by the Treasurer, and secondly, for repaying those loans. The profits of the Rural Credits Department are to be dealt with as follows:-First, one-half is to be placed to the credit of the Rural Credits Department Reserve Fund ;and, secondly, one-half shall go to the credit of the Rural Credits Development Fund, to be used in such a manner as the board directs for the promotion of primary production. The operation of the bill is best seen by a practical illustration, and, therefore, I shall submit a statement showing exactly how last year's Victorian Voluntary Wheat Pool could have been handled under this scheme. The experience of the Victorian Wheat Pool shows that, . in addition to the corporation's funds, assistance would have been required on the basis provided for in this bill as follows : For7 months, £100,000. For 6* months, £100,000; progressive total, £200,000. For6 months, £150,000; progressive total, £350,000. For 4£ months, £250,000; progressive total, £600,000. For4 months, £500,000; progressive total, £1,100,000. For 3J months, £400,000; progressive total, £1,500,000. For3 months, £250,000; progressive total, £1,750,000. For 2} months, £250,000; progressive total, £2,000,000. For2 months, £250,000; progressive total, £2,250,000. For 1£ months, £250,000; progressive total, £2,500,000. For1 month, £250,000; progressive total, £2,750,000. As will be seen, the maximum required in Victoria £2,750,000, and then only for one month, for handling 15,000,000 bushels. the bill now presented, debentures could be issued for the amounts and the periods indicated. are of very short duration. mum amount of debentures issued, which would only be outstanding for one month, would be £2,750,000, £200,000 in respect of wheat pooled of the value of £4,500,000. holder would be safeguarded by the aggregate of advances by the Treasurer, and the capital and reserve of the Rural Credits Department in addition to the value of the wheat. It has to be remembered, too, that the general credit of the Commonwealth is behind all the liabilities of the Commonwealth Bank. of the Rural Credits Department as of all other departments monwealth Bank. interest' payable on the debentures should be at the cheapest possible rate, and, of course, this would be reflected in the interest charged to the producers. value of the pools is to place the collective credit of the industry behind the individual. signed to enable that to be done. operation is certain growth of co-operation generally producers. the community of such co-operation have been shown. this bill, if brought into operation export control machinery nature fo that provided for butter and Dr. Earle Page. dried fruits last year, will permit the producer to obtain all the advantages of a compulsory pool as regards his exportable surplus, at the same time that complete control remains in his own hands. The objection to compulsory pools under Government control has always been that, if the Government makes the advance, it takes the right to fix prices and conditions for local sale. The present machinery will permit the farmer's ideal to be realized of complete control over export by the industry itself, without Government interference. He will be in this position, because he will be dealing with a financial institution on a commercial basis, and not w it h a Government asking for political favours. Advances may be made by the rural credits department, upon the security of primary produce placed under the legal provision control of the bank, to the. bank or other would have been banks; to co-operative associations formed under the law of the Commonwealth, a Under state or a territory under the authority of the Commonwealth; and to such corporations or unincorporate bodies, formed It will be seen that the periods under the law of the Commonwealth, a The maxistate or a territory under the authority of the Commonwealth as are specified by proclamation. Any organization that reducing down to likes to form itself into a body sufficiently substantial will be able to get these adThe debenture vances. I trust that my explanation of this bill has manifested its necessity, and the nature of the help which the Government desires to afford our primary producers. I have tried to show that the principles that are involved in its constitution are not revolutionary, but are matThis is true ters of course in many countries. Ausas well tralian experience for the last ten years of the Comindicates urgency and necessity. The In view of this, the beneficial results of this legislation w ill not be sectional, but w ill be reflected throughout the entire community.
