It is expected to be completed soon. 8 As the report does not contain recommendations, a response is not required. 9 The response is being finalised. 10 The report is being considered and a response will be provided shortly. 11 A response to the report will not be tabled as mature age employment issues will be considered as part of work being undertaken on Australia’s changing demographics, which has been identified as a whole-of-government policy priority. This will cover issues relating to maximising labour force participation, including mature age participation. 12 The response is near completion and will be tabled shortly. 13 The response is under consideration and will be tabled shortly. 14 The response to the two reports has been delayed to take account of changing strategic circumstances and government consideration of the Annual Strategic Review. The response is likely to be tabled in the Autumn 2003 sittings. 15 The response is under consideration. 16 The response is being finalised and is expected to be tabled shortly. 17 A draft response is under consideration. 18 The recommendations are being considered in the light of current practices in the Houses. 19 The Government does not intend to respond further as the response has been overtaken by the agreement reached at COAG in April 2002 to implement nationally consistent legislation in this area. The resultant Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002 and the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 are currently before the Parliament. 20 The response is being finalised and will be tabled shortly. 21 A response is expected to be tabled after a visit to Norfolk Island by health officials. 22 The response will be tabled shortly. 23 A draft response is under consideration and will be tabled shortly. 24 The response is being finalised and is expected to be tabled in the 2003 Autumn sittings. 25 The government is considering the recommendations. 26 The government is presently conducting a “Review of Governance Arrangements of Statutory Authorities and Office Holders”, and finalisation of the response is expected following the Review. 27 Preparation of the response has required extensive consultation within government portfolios and the response will be tabled shortly. 28 The proposed response is being considered and will be tabled in due course. 29 In response to Recommendation No. 5, the Treasury developed a methodology to quantify, where possible, the economic benefits of double tax agreements and presented it at an informal meeting with the Committee members, including the Chair, Ms Julie Bishop, on 27 August 2002.

The difficulty turns on Centrelink’s requirement that, in addition to establishing their own identity, carers must produce 100 points of identification to establish the identity of the loved one for whom they care. I agree that it is important that applicants for benefits establish their identity to stop welfare fraud. While putting together the necessary documentation might be a relatively minor stumbling block or inconvenience for you and me-it certainly would not be too difficult for us to collect our drivers licence, passport and evidence of bank accounts-it is difficult for some people. In those instances, I believe that a good case can be made for Centrelink to show a bit of flexibility, waive the 100 points requirement and, in so doing, lift a weight from the minds of my constituents at Christmas time. Mr Alex Scheffer of Capalaba was understandably distressed when he found out that, despite having been naturalised in 1958 and having been paid a pension for many years, his fer’s Australian citizenship. Having had the misfortune of being burgled a few years ago, during which, amongst other items, Mr Scheffer’s original naturalisation certificate was stolen, getting the 100 points was not going to be an easy task. The task was made even more difficult by the fact that he was asked to pay a $55 fee to obtain verification of his Australian citizenship from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. He was told that the process could take up to six weeks. As I said, Mr Scheffer is a pensioner and so $55 is not an amount of money that he finds easy to come by in a hurry. It seems ridiculous that his carer, who is saving the Commonwealth a considerable amount of money in aged care services which Mr Scheffer would otherwise need, should have to wait weeks, and possibly months, until he can get together the administration fee, plus the six weeks more he would have to wait for the request for proof of naturalisation to be processed. It is ridiculous not only because of the hardship it would cause Mr Scheffer and his carer but also because Centrelink would already have evidence of Mr Scheffer’s citizenship status on file from when his application for his pension was processed. The same principles apply to the Riddel family, although they find themselves in a very different set of circumstances. Their son Mark suffers from cerebral palsy. Although he is 35 years old, his condition means that when given a list of forms of identification that might be put together to reach the 100 points needed before his mother could obtain carers payments, they could produce only one-a birth certificate. Mark has never had occasion to open a bank account or apply for a passport or a drivers licence. The family simply has no way of meeting the 100 points requirement. However, Mark has been on Centrelink’s books for some 20 years as a disability support pensioner. There are other people in the same situation, and there are precedents where Centrelink has waived the requirement. This is bureaucracy gone mad. I call upon Centrelink officers and those that make the policy to ensure that they look at these circumstances and, where it is ob-",311,Adjournment Dren Who Lost Their Mother To Lung Cancer

(Time expired) Petrie Electorate: Funding of Community Groups Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (9.43 a.m.)-It gives me great pleasure to be in the House today to talk about some local funding successes in my electorate of Petrie. The Petrie electorate, like most electorates, represents a population of very diverse interests, ages and nationalities. In October, the Redcliffe Historical Society received $2,500 for an oral history project based on the lives of the men and women who lived in Redcliffe during World War II. The members of the historical society are very active and their love and enthusiasm for local history is demonstrated by their ongoing commitment to exploring the unique history of the Redcliffe peninsula. Also in October, St Joseph’s Primary School at Bracken Ridge secured a capital grant of $200,000 for the establishment of new classrooms and equipment for preschool students. Bracken Ridge is one of those areas which has had very strong residential growth in recent years, and the expansion of St Joseph’s demonstrates this with the growing success of this school and its community. In the northern part of the electorate another growing school, this time a secondary school, secured capital funding of $98,000 for a car park and associated roads. Congratulations to Mueller College on its funding success and also for its continued academic and sporting successes. With the growth of the global market, I am always delighted when a new business in the Petrie electorate secures funding to expand into a wealth of opportunity. Recently, the Poly Flex Group Pty Ltd at Clontarf secured an export market development grant to expand their business into the chemical product manufacturing sector. They are one of many local small businesses who have shared in over $3 million in EMDG funding since 1996. The busy intersection of ANZAC Avenue and Sutton Street, Redcliffe, has been awarded $250,000 in the latest round of federal government black spot funding. Since 1996, over $850,000 has been granted to local projects in the Petrie electorate under this program. The Petrie electorate is home to some wonderful cultures. I was delighted to congratulate Xi Rang Liu of Chermside for securing $25,000 for the Australia Council for the Arts. Xi will produce a publication in Chinese, which will look at changes in marriage customs in Australia and China over the generations. That should be a very interesting publication. Another local success was the Buffalo Memorial Homes for the Aged at Kippa-Ring. They secured 16 lowcare places in the latest 2002 aged care approval round and a capital grant of $900,000-well done to them. Finally, I would like to congratulate two local winners in the National CommunityLink Volunteer Awards; that is, the Kingfisher Recycling Centre at Aspley, which was the Queensland winner in the environment, conservation and heritage section, and the Cerebral Palsy League of Queensland. The Cascade Community Garden Group at Redcliffe was highly commended in the same category. Congratulations to all these worthy recipients. (Time expired) Shortland Electorate: Christmas Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.46 a.m.)-I would like to bring to the attention of the House a different aspect of Christmas. The Anglican Church at Belmont North, with the support of local businesses both small and large, prepared a sights and sounds of Christmas display for people of the area. It was assisted by other churches in the area and the parishioners all worked very hard to prepare everything from making costumes to 1,000 calico take home Thursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10575 bags for children. They prepared all the props, the electrical work and the scenery and they hand made items for the children that attended. Last Friday night, I visited the church and saw the sights and sounds of Christmas. It really demonstrated to me the true meaning of Christmas and how, if a community works together, it can show its strengths. The sights and sounds of Christmas were set up in five sections. The first section highlighted the pressures and the commercialisation of Christmas and how people are being forced to just think of buying presents and are not thinking and caring about each other, which is the meaning of Christmas. The next section looked at the importance of the Christmas tree. There was then a section showing the contrast between Christmas in Australia and Christmas in Latvia and, Anna, who is from Latvia, described for the people attending what Christmas is like in Latvia. Then it went on to a scene with two Santa Clauses-one very fat and rotund Santa who had been delivering presents and the other Santa who was very thin and was very sad because he was not able to deliver as many presents as he would like to those children that were living in poverty. The last section was a nativity scene, which emphasised caring and looking after everyone in our community. One thousand children from the various schools in the area and 270 adults visited the sights and sounds of Christmas. There were students from Belmont North, Redhead, Jewells, Blacksmiths and Lakeside special school. Everybody that attended enjoyed it and came away with a different idea of Christmas and they were able to focus on the importance of caring for everyone in the community, and on what Christmas is all about. I thank and congratulate the church. CSM Group Ltd world-class Australian services company, CSM Group Ltd, which is at the forefront of some current exciting new business developments. CSM started nearly 20 years ago with just four staff as a computer company servicing government and business in the Northern Territory. Like many small companies competing against multinationals, CSM had to reinvent itself in the late 1990s, introducing a talented management team of local business people and shifting the company’s core business to provide IT solutions for mediumand large-scale organisations. In the global IT market, it may seem strange to develop such a business in remote Darwin, a long way from any significant IT hub, but the company developed a team of IT innovators that today competes with the best in the world. Many of the IT professionals at CSM came through a graduate training program initiated by the company in 1995. So far 43 graduates have undergone training and all have high-level jobs in a part of Australia where they would otherwise have little or no such opportunities. CSM Knowledge is a private TAFE which meets the training needs of companies and individuals across Australia. CSM has also developed an internal service delivery ethos founded on world’s best practice. In 1999, CSM successfully bid for the Territory government’s first outsourced IT contract. The competition included multinationals: IBM, Compaq, Lotus and Microsoft. Earlier this year an independent benchmark report on the service by Washington based Osterman Research showed that CSM had achieved or exceeded world’s best practice standards in most areas. The CSM contract was renewed this year by the newly elected Northern Territory government. The Territory boasts the first truly connected education system in Australia. Every primary, secondary, Catholic and independent school within the Territory is now connected by computer, providing student communication, teacher collaboration and education resources",313,Representatives Main Committee
753,Mr Tollner (Solomon) (9.49 A.m.),"I wish to speak on the contribution made by a10576 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 for some of our most disadvantaged schools. It took a disciplined and experienced company to deliver that result. CSM flew more than 56,000 kilometres, drove more than 40,000 kilometres and crossed 21 waterways to deliver computers to children in remote Australia. At a time of the worse drought in 20 years, this company went to Marla Bore, Tennant Creek, Katherine and Woomera to provide services where they are needed. CSM recently won a number of tenders in information technology in Victoria, beating more multinationals along the way, and recently acquired the accounting business Horwath SA & NT. This accounting division has a 30-year history in Darwin with one of the founders and current chairman, Mr Richard Ryan AO, being awarded the Order of Australia on three separate occasions. We should congratulate companies like CSM Group Ltd-a Northern Territory company that is now competing with multinationals on the world stage-for proving what can be achieved with hard work and commitment. (Time expired) Howard Government: Education mas to you and your family and to everyone else here. This is a time for reflection and I thought I would use a couple of examples to reflect on the very distant past and the recent past. If Aristotle and Plato came back today and looked at the coalition government and its lack of leadership in education, they would curl up in a foetal position and burst out laughing. Aristotle believed that education was too important for it not to be public. We find in his writings on politics that he believed in the public good. He would be horrified at what is happening to education in this country. Plato had a different view of education. He would also roll up and burst out laughing if opposition members started arguing on choice. He would call that fatuous and stupid. The only way to select people for education is on merit and talent. Those two issues-the public good and talent-give me the introduction to say thank you to my long-serving staff members. I have been very fortunate in this place in that I still have my original staff after 15 years. I am very proud of that. One member of staff left nine months ago to go to higher places in the state government. Pauline Mannix, who is my office manager, specialises in immigration matters and has been with me for a long time. She is very efficient, does not beat around the bush and is a good leader in the office. Luisa Halacas, who has also been with me for 15 years, is the epitome of diplomacy. You need people like that in your office. She is a good listener, very caring, loving, gentle and thorough when dealing with and responding to constituents. I have also had Patrick Hansen working for me, and he has moved into the state government to work for Patrick Conlon in emergency services as an adviser. He concentrated on social security matters and was probably my campaign manager. He organised political campaigns and was the political activist in the office. He made a significant contribution and I am very pleased for him in his new position. We edit the Labor Herald in our office, and for that we are indebted to the great strength of Gary Orr, who works in my office and is the editor of the Labor Herald. He does that as a part-time position; other than that, he is basically my researcher and he does my speeches and my newsletters. Gary, Pauline, Luisa, Patrick and a new member, Daina Wilson, have been a significant team for the people in Port Adelaide. (Time expired) McCabe, Mr Alan support of Alan McCabe and his family.

Alan is still in hospital in Sydney in the spinal unit. Because of this tragedy, the community has rallied behind the McCabes and is raising funds to assist them in the challenges that lie ahead. Julie McCabe is a teacher at St Augustine’s School. It is a good school with excellent values. It promotes academic excellence, excellence in sport, family values and Christian values. Those values are reflected in the way that many of the teachers and families from the school are supporting the McCabes in their attempt to raise funds. The Coffs Harbour Harlequins Rugby Club has also got behind the family at this very difficult time. I would also like to commend the members of the McCabe Trust, who are committed to raising funds on behalf of the McCabe family. In particular I would like to commend Maureen Kennedy, Alan Sparkes, Dwayne Vignes, Robert McCabe, Ross Burton, Julie Wills, Ngaire Robinson, Carolyn Perkins, Narelle Coreless, Michaela O’Shea-Miller, Kyanne Kachael and Jenny Ryan. I understand that through the work of the trust they have managed to raise in the order of $45,000 to support the family. There was an INXS concert and the proceeds from the concert went to the McCabes. There were also various raffles and a community fun day. Alan McCabe, in his attempts to achieve rehabilitation, is an inspiration to us all. Likewise, the members of the McCabe Trust are an inspiration for the hard work that they are putting in to support a very much valued member of the community. I would also like to commend the people of Coffs Harbour who have rallied behind the McCabes. There are many drains on the funds of families these days, and people have been very giving in contributing financial support to assist the McCabe family in what is going to be a very great struggle ahead. The trust are not resting on their laurels. Their work is ongoing and they are planning a range of events over time. One of the members of the trust, Mr Alan Sparkes, has a brother who was also made a quadriplegic in a rugby accident, and he is fully aware of what the McCabes must be going through. He has focused on the fact that the community has to keep supporting the McCabes over a long period of time. This is something that they will have to live with over a long period and we are certainly focused on the fact that community support for the McCabes will have to be delivered over a long period of time. concluded.

I am pleased to be able to speak to this legislation. The legislation aims to improve the position of renewable energy and electricity generation in this country, and that is a worthy cause. I do not need to remind members of this chamber of the need for Australia to reduce its greenhouse gases. It is certainly understood on this side of the House, but if it is understood by the government it has not been translated into much action on its behalf. The importance of renewable energy in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in this country should be obvious, and I am sure it is, to all members of the parliament. Its importance cannot be underestimated. This bill amends the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. The intent of the bill is to finetune the act and attempt to make it more workable.

These are the windfall gain for hydro-electricity generators and the use of native forest waste as a renewable energy source. I am sure we will hear a lot more about that from my friend who will follow. The opposition supports the bill in its present form but there are issues which must be dealt with following the review process which is currently under way. The aim of the original legislation was to accelerate the uptake of renewable energy and electricity generation in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It also aimed to provide an ongoing basis for the development of commercially competitive renewable energy and to contribute to the development of internationally competitive industries that can participate in the growing Asian energy market. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act established the mandatory renewable energy target. The target requires Australian electricity retailers and large buyers of electricity to collectively source 9,500 gigawatt hours per year of electricity from renewable energy sources by 2010. It establishes a system whereby renewable energy certificates are generated by accredited power stations that produce excess electricity from renewable sources on a 1997 baseline. One certificate is generated for every one megawatt hour of excess renewable energy-electricity. These certificates can be purchased and used by electricity retailers and large buyers of electricity to reduce the renewable energy shortfall charge that would otherwise have to be paid when sourcing non-renewable energy. The aim of all this is to stimulate demand for renewable energy consistent with the provisions of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. In doing this and by boosting investment in renewable energy, greenhouse gas emissions, will, it is estimated, be reduced by about seven million tonnes a year by 2010. I am sure that the benefits of reducing these emissions are clear to all. Regrettably, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 is the only mandatory greenhouse measure that has been adopted by the Howard government. It often pulls out this sole piece of legislation establishing the mandatory target to demonstrate its supposed commitment to abating the greenhouse problem. As most observers will know, this government has a deplorable record when it comes to the environment. It is one of the only governments in the world refusing to ratify the Kyoto protocol, and it played an obstructive role in the recent Johannesburg Earth Summit. It seems rather inconsistent having such domestic legislation encouraging renewable energy and electricity generation while at the same time opposing measures to address climate change at a global level. The regime that the act sets up is a step in the right direction towards a cleaner, greener nation, but it is far too little. The government has done almost nothing to ensure the preservation of the environment for our children and our children’s children. It has been prepared to play politics with the environment, hoping for some shortterm gain. This type of short-termism is one of the defining characteristics of the Howard government and history will not be kind to it if the government cannot see beyond the next poll. I want to relay some information about renewable energy projects in the Northern Territory. There is no doubt that Australia has the potential to be one of the leaders in the field of renewable energy. It is doubtful, though, that we have the wit to take up that mantle. I say to the government that this is an opportunity that we should not miss. Certainly in my own electorate of Lingiari there is a fantastic opportunity to use and develop renewable energy sources, particularly solar energy and, to a lesser extent, wind power. The government must do a lot more to promote the development and use of these technologies. The potential for the use of renewable energy in remote communities is enormous. Many communities in my electorate are leading the way in the successful use and development of Thursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10579 renewable energy sources, and a couple of outstanding projects need to be mentioned. One of these, fortunately, does include work from the Commonwealth government. I just want to give some background here, though. When I first started living in the bush, in the late 1970s, in a very remote community-some 12 hours drive from Alice Springs in the north-west of South Australia-the only power source was a generator that used diesel. The communities in that region started to think, ‘Well, what we ought to be doing is looking at alternative modes of power delivery.’ So there was an exercise that engaged a number of people looking at how they might get hybrid systems set up involving wind and solar energy. Over time some of these were experimented with. I might remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I am talking about the late 1970s and early 1980s, in the very remotest parts of Australia. This exercise was driven by a desire to get away from diesel and to use renewable energy that could be provided through the resources of the sun and wind. One project I want to highlight is Bushlight. It is a model for renewable energy programs, particularly in remote and Indigenous communities. I was privileged to attend the opening of this project in Alice Springs in May. This initiative will give 200 Indigenous communities across Australia the opportunity to benefit. The project will take nonpolluting, cost-efficient, reliable sources of energy to remote communities; furthermore, there is very important and strong emphasis on providing local training and employment opportunities for people who live in these communities. Bushlight is funded jointly by ATSIC, the federal governmentthrough the Australian Greenhouse Office-and the relevant state and territory governments. Managed by the Centre for Appropriate Technology, CAT, and the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Renewable Energy, the project aims to improve the efficiency of remote renewable energy services as well as to establish best practice for small renewable energy systems. The energy problems in these Indigenous communities are considerable. Energy sources, typically diesel generators, are often too unreliable and too costly to provide for the energy needs of an entire community. They are also significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, as we well know. Luxuries that those of us who live outside of these communities take for granted, such as having a washing machine, are often not possible for people in such communities. The Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Renewable Energy estimates that currently around 108,000 Indigenous Australians live in approximately 1,200 discrete Indigenous communities across the Northern Territory, Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia. The centre’s research shows that these communities consume over 40 million litres of diesel per year in order to generate electricity. Adding a simple four-kilowatt photovoltaic system to a typical outstation in one of these places can reduce diesel consumption and cut greenhouse gas emissions by between 10 and 13 tonnes of CO² per annum. One of the important things about this project is that it has been developed in partnership with Indigenous people. CAT, one of Bushlight’s joint managers, is a nonprofit organisation with an Indigenous board. It ensures that the project take a capacity-building approach in the communities where it is providing energy services. The project’s mobile service teams provide not only technical support to Indigenous communities but also training in the maintenance of the systems. The project is also establishing a network of regional offices, each employing an Indigenous liaison officer and a regional manager who will work with the local communities. The success of this Bushlight project is based on these community driven processes and should be used as a model for other renewable energy programs throughout rural Australia. The use of solar energy in these communities has been remarkably successful and also has a great deal of potential to deliver further benefits. 10580 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 The Bushlight project is an example of how the CRC for renewable energy is helping remote and regional Australia and, at the same time, is reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This project would never have seen the light of day had it not been for the funding from the renewable energy CRC. But astoundingly, as we heard on Tuesday, this CRC for renewable energy will be defunded. It is rather ironic and pretty sad that in the same week that we are debating this bill, which purports to encourage a renewable energy industry for government, the government announced the defunding of the CRC for renewable energy. What is this about? We do know that it reflects badly on the government and potentially badly on the Australian community generally. When the government announced that they were defunding the CRC they also announced that they will be giving $68 million of new moneys to the mining industry for renewable energy. In the end, as we know, this money will end up in the hands of multinational, multibillion dollar mining companies like Rio Tinto. I think Rio Tinto have done a very good job over recent years in environmental management. I do not want to disparage Rio Tinto or the work that they are doing. But I want to highlight the contradictions and the absolute conflicts of interests. The chief scientist employed by Rio Tinto is giving that company access to these moneys. I would have thought that any reasonable person could adjudge that there might well be a conflict of interest. Why wouldn’t you if you were an ordinary Australian living in the western suburbs of Sydney or in Alice Springs, Katherine or Darwin and you heard that the company for which the chief scientist, the chief adviser on these matters to the federal government, works is going to receive money for renewable energy research at the same time that the government is defunding the CRC? We had a discussion about money for mates yesterday in the main chamber. It is appalling that in the week we are debating this legislation that this apparent and readily identifiable conflict of interest appears. But there is not even a blush from members of the government. The government said in the public domain that there was nothing wrong with this, that it is all above board. What would happen if you use the rules that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs uses for ATSIC? They would not be getting the money, because one of the main advisers to the government on decision making in these areas is going to indirectly be a beneficiary of these moneys through the funding of his organisation, Rio Tinto. It is a bit whiffy. It is very clear, based on this example alone, that the government has got the balance in this CRC funding dreadfully wrong. I have no problem with moneys going to these mining companies in some form or another, but the way in which this issue has been handled is abysmal. It says a lot about the way in which the government operates, what its intentions really are and its inability to come to terms with its obligation to fund appropriate energy research outside the corporate sector. The government’s decision to de-fund the renewable energy CRC is the latest in a long line of decisions which shows that the government has no commitment to the environment. The Energy Research and Development Corporation was shut down by the Howard government upon coming to office. The Australian Greenhouse Office has now exhausted its funds for supporting renewables. The Photovoltaic Rooftop Program will run out of funds in mid-2003 and Pacific Solar laid off its R&D team last week. What does that say about the government’s commitment? In contrast, on Monday this week the Labor Party demonstrated its real commitment to the environment by announcing support for an increase in the mandatory renewable energy target. Labor believes it is vital to the development of the renewable energy industry and to reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. Thursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10581 There are a few other Territory based projects that I want to mention. The first is Powercorp, which has developed a new wind turbine technology. Powercorp is a successful Northern Territory company which has recently patented new technology that will revolutionise how wind turbines deliver electricity and has the potential to earn millions of dollars. The name of the technology is ‘dynamic grid interface’. It smooths out the variation in the supply of electricity which until now has been the greatest hindrance to small-scale wind power generation. The new technology will mean an end to flickering lights, and ice cold water coming out of a hot tap. The founder of Powercorp, Alan Langworthy, a prominent Territorian, should be congratulated for his achievements in developing what is truly revolutionary technology. This piece of cutting edge technology has stunned the world scientific community, as well it should. In basic terms, the DGI technology is a power equaliser tool that uses sophisticated electronic and computer software to regulate the supply of electricity. It allows variations in wind turbine power to be evenly distributed through diesel power grids. Without DGI, strong gusty winds blowing to a wind turbine diesel power grid would result in wild fluctuations in supply. The end result of all this is a perfectly stable electricity system. This is nothing short of a breakthrough for those people who live in remote communities and who have had to put up with flickering lights at dinner time. I want to mention the Northern Territory’s photovoltaic commercialisation project at Bulman-Watarrka. This is a prime example of the new Northern Territory Martin government’s push to promote the use of renewable energy and to use it themselves in the supply of energy to communities in the Territory. The two-part project is worth about $4 million and will provide a total of 55 kilowatts of solar generated energy at Bulman and 225 kilowatts at Watarrka, or King’s Canyon National Park, making it the biggest solar photovoltaic project in Australia. PowerWater, the NT electricity retailer/generator, owns and operates the Bulman Power Station and has been responsible for the overall implementation of the project. It is expected that savings in diesel costs over the 20-year life of the project will repay the system’s installation costs. These are very important initiatives, and in relation to the Bulman project it is worthwhile pointing out those people involved. The Northern Territory Centre for Energy Research played a key role in developing the project’s concept and design and technical aspects of the project. Advanced Energy Systems provided detailed design, construction and commissioning for the project. Ecoenergy, an Alice Springs based organisation, was the main subcontractor to AES and completed much of the on-site installation. The Bulman community gave permission to use the land and has given enthusiastic support to the project, allowing it to proceed smoothly. Finally, I want to mention the Alice Springs Cool House, located in Araluen in Alice Springs-a great example of adapting to the environment and a cooperative project between the Northern Territory government and the Arid Lands Environment Centre. It is using very innovative design to conserve energy and provide innovative designs for housing construction and the use of water and electricity. I commend this legislation. Amendment Bill 2002 is to make legislative adjustments to the electricity from the renewable energy sources scheme. The original scheme required Australia’s electricity retailers and other large buyers of electricity to collectively source an additional 9,500 gigawatt hours per annum of electricity from renewable sources by 2010. This measure was to increase the level of renewables based electricity generation from 10.7 per cent in the late 1990s to a projected 12.7 per cent by 2010.",317,Representatives Main Committee
758,Mr Adams (Lyons) (10.19 A.m.),"The purpose of the Renewable Energy (Electricity)10582 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 It was also designed to increase investment in the renewable energy sector and was estimated to potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about seven million tonnes per annum by 2010, through renewable energy electricity generation displacing high emission intensity fossil fuel based power generation. The scheme established the mandatory renewable energy target, MRET, which was a token effort to address greenhouse gas abatement. The amendment is designed to improve the administrative integrity, effectiveness and efficiency of the Renewable Energy Act 2000. It removes the MRET, which has only been in place for two years. Many of the larger enterprises have used it to develop the baseline for their expansion into renewable energy power sources. Tasmania, of course, is the home of renewable energy, starting before the Snowy scheme. Our first hydro scheme was at Duck Reach on the South Esk River in the late 1890s. Tasmania has used hydro power to build its economy since then and it has produced 60 per cent of Australia’s renewable energy. Hydro Tasmania and its various business units-Transcend and Aurora-still employ a considerable number of people in Tasmania; not as many as they used to, but they are still a major employment source. They also have the ability to develop new technology and use their expertise to help other countries to develop their renewable energy capacity through their consultancy arm. With any energy source, it is important to seek new ideas and develop ways to upgrade existing schemes. But unless there is an incentive to do so and the people to use the output, then the status quo will remain and little will change. When MRET hit the deck, Hydro incorporated into its future planning to look at ways that it could improve its alternative renewable energy. It started with what it could improve in its existing infrastructure, which will include one major upgrade and 11 minor ones other than the normal maintenance round. Wind power has been discussed for some time and when the MRET became an incentive, there was serious interest in looking at using wind as a good, clean method of power development. But it cannot be developed in isolation. Other power sources are needed to ensure that the spikes that are inevitably there with wind can be ironed out and boosted when needed. We have just heard my colleague from the Northern Territory, the member for Lingiari, speak about a major breakthrough in this regard by a person in his area. Hydro power is an ideal joint partner because water can be adjusted quickly and cheaply to regulate the power generation. So it seems to be the right direction in which to be moving. But the development of wind energy is not as economically feasible as the development of hydro power. It needs more of a push to get it into the mainstream. When the MRET was established it became feasible to consider including wind power in the renewable energy grid. The criticisms of the system were that baselines for existing generators had been incorrectly set, which was stopping investment in new renewable energy developments, and that it would fail to substantially increase Australia’s uptake of renewable energy, thus having a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. It is argued that the existing target of 9,500 gigawatts by 2010 is too low and that the design of the MRET scheme does too little to encourage investment in new renewable energy businesses. It seems that Hydro Tasmania have been criticised for taking advantage of gains that have been made by existing hydro-electricity generation. Critics of the current scheme say that the use of the 1997 baseline data means that Hydro generators can supply all mandated RECs until 2007 without investing in new capacity and can enjoy a significant share of the REC market thereafter. However, that is not what Hydro did. They have worked hard to comply with and develop the MRET scheme. They do not believe it is perfect-they feel the baselines are too low and the target needs to be increased by 2010 by at least a true two per cent addiThursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10583 tional renewable energy. The program has been useful in pushing the direction of renewable energy. Five hundred and sixty-eight megawatts of wind farms have obtained planning approval for construction. One hundred megawatts have been constructed and 158 megawatts are under construction. This far exceeds earlier government predictions about how MRET will stimulate new renewable energy projects. This program is made commercially feasible by the MRET scheme. Investment in the upgrade program has increased from $16 million per annum pre-MRET to $66 million per annum. That is a considerable amount of investment in the state of Tasmania. Having inspected the wind farms and seen some of the potential upgrading under way in the older hydro generators-that is, using water more efficiently and effectively-it seems that this has indeed encouraged a greater intensity into improving Tasmania’s capacity for power production. With the Basslink about to come into being in the next few years, this extra power will be a welcome addition to the mainland and may well encourage subsidiary industries to be attracted to the island. One such is the building of a Vestas factory on the north-west coast and the other is the Hydro’s ability to continue to research and develop new directions for wind generation. I think the original objectives of the bill are being met. The uptake of renewable energy in grid based applications to reduce greenhouse emissions is under way. Renewables are being stimulated, which is providing a base for further development of commercially competitive renewable energy. It will lead to the Hydro and many private companies contributing to the development of internationally competitive industries which could participate effectively in our part of the world. Development of new technologies is expensive for both existing and new companies. I believe MRET gives opportunities for small companies to piggyback on the infrastructure and expertise of the bigger companies to develop new directions. Continuing with the amendments in this act will effectively prevent the continuation of much of the development work already under way and it has enormous budget implications as companies cannot just stop what they have been planning over the last two or three years. It seems to me that it is ludicrous to introduce legislation at this stage to change the interpretation of the act. Some individual accreditor might rule that a new power generation scheme is not eligible because the system in the application effectively represents an expansion or modification to an already accredited power station rather than a new, separate power station. Any sort of power station takes an enormous amount of capital to bring up to standard to attach to our electricity grid. Fledgling companies do not have that capacity. However, small companies working with an established electricity generator could develop significant differences. Should we not gear the MRET to help existing companies become mentors and have partnerships with new technology rather than throw the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak? I think some changes can be made to MRET to answer some of the concerns raised, but to develop the sorts of directions that are being suggested in the amendments frankly adds police state dimensions to something which really could be a useful technology development tool. Renewable energy certificates should simply be gained by any company involved in energy and power development, providing there is substantial proof they are contributing to the demolition of greenhouse gases. Australia is a bit of a joke anyway in this area after refusing to adopt the Kyoto protocol. To deny existing clean power generators to continue to research new directions seems to be a contradiction in Australia’s position. I suppose nothing is really new under the Liberal government. They are so full of contradictions, it is not surprising that big and small business finds this confusing. The cutting of the CRC on renewable energy and the taking away of funds last week proves that this government is heading in a nonsensical direction when it comes to renewable energy. The big argument is lower prices, although I do not see a lower price for power for consumers. I believe the industry should gain some addi10584 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 tional incentives to keep the price of power within the reach of ordinary Australians. Nowhere in any of the discussions have I seen any interest in this; it is more about how our environment has to be saved from us. There is always a social dilemma to that argument which needs consideration. Biomass fuel production is another source of argument in this place. The CSIRO report on environmental matters relating to biomass fuel states that the environmental concerns can be adequately managed and biomass fuel production can make a very significant contribution to the reduction of Australia’s greenhouse gas production. If someone wants to put in the investment and make it work, it seems that once again we are throwing away opportunities by placing barriers, which are being suggested, in the path of investors. Sensible and sensitive development is a plus, not a minus, for our society. We need to encourage people to develop new ideas using international guidelines. We should ratify Kyoto and get on with developing ways in which we can meet those targets. Time and again, we hear arguments about how to stop various activities from occurring without any base knowledge of what they have contributed in the past and what potential they have. We should build on the expertise, guide the investment into sustainable areas and encourage change by example and incentive. Bans and restrictions only serve to persuade people to find ways around them. We want to use their inventiveness more productively. The forestry and energy industries-two of Tasmania’s vital industries-can be influenced by people working with them. The Senate report which came down a week or two ago vindicates what I have said. There is a need to continue with the MRET scheme and encourage its positive review in the new year. The Parer report and its recommendations do little to encourage business to take up new directions. It is negative. It seems to want to change everything before it has been properly tried and tested. We can certainly do better and we need to better in the future. Ms KING (Ballarat) (10.34 a.m.)-The future role of renewable energy is an important issue not just for Australia but also for my electorate. You would have heard during this debate that Labor supports an increase of the mandatory renewable energy targets from two per cent to five per cent by 2010. This would mean that, under a Labor government, by 2010 Australian energy providers would purchase five per cent of their fuel from a source that is renewable. Labor is committed to strengthening the MRET scheme-unlike the government, which appears set, under the draft Parer review, to walk away from it. For too long we have focused solely on nonrenewable energy sources. We have failed to invest strongly in technology that develops new renewable energy sources. In fact, on Tuesday we saw in the government’s CRC announcement that it is abandoning the CRC for renewable energy. The government has no credibility on the issue of renewable energy. The government shut down the energy R&D corporation, the Australian Greenhouse Office has exhausted its funds for supporting renewable R&D programs and the Photovoltaic Rebate Program was underspent this year and runs out in 18 months. If this government were serious about encouraging renewable energy, it would invest in R&D, not disinvest in it. We have also not invested sufficiently to provide incentives to industries to develop a cheaper and more efficient use of nonrenewable energy resources. We must act now to encourage the development of alternative energy sources that are renewable, clean and have as little impact on our environment as possible. Labor is committed to increasing MRET and hence a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, the Howard government’s history on this issue is poor. For example, at the recent Earth Summit in Johannesburg, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage sat back as country after country backed the Kyoto protocol Thursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10585 and promised to ratify it. First it was China, then India, Thailand and Canada that led the way. However, the minister continues to stand with the United States in opposing the ratification of the Kyoto protocol and seeks to fight actively against emission reductions. Only a couple of weeks ago the minister for the environment stated in a speech to Australia’s peak business organisation, the Business Council of Australia, that our environment was vulnerable to climate change, and yet he still will not bow to pressure for his government to ratify the Kyoto protocol. The United Kingdom has done what many progressive governments in the international community have achieved, and that is to set sustainable targets on renewable energy. The Blair government has set a target of 10 per cent by 2010 and 20 per cent by 2020. This is an outstanding target. I should remind the House of the history of the British manufacturing industry, its pollution and its overwhelming use of non-renewable energy such as coal. If Britain can improve, so can we. It is therefore justifiable that less than a month ago the UK environment minister, the Hon. Michael Meacher, criticised the Howard government for its inaction. He argued that the Howard government’s inaction over the ratification of the Kyoto protocol was designed to ‘curry favour’ with the US. In the Financial Review last month, Ms Lenore Taylor quoted the UK minister as saying: “Australia has been very close to the US and I doubt they would have taken the view they have if it hadn’t been for the US.” The UK minister is saying exactly what the Labor Party has been saying about the Howard government throughout this year. Its failure to ratify Kyoto is yet another example of the Howard government’s inaction over greenhouse emissions and renewable energy. I would like to turn to the importance of the review of mandatory renewable energy targets. There are some important issues within my electorate that the review needs to take into consideration-when it eventually starts-before handing down its findings. These include the impact of MRETs on native forests as well as the impact on energy pricing. In the recent Victorian state election, the now Premier and the Labor team committed their second term to rescinding the lack of leadership by the Kennett government on the use of our natural resources. With a commitment to end old-growth logging in the Wombat State Forest, I was also pleased to hear of the progressive approach the Bracks government took on native forest residue as a renewable energy source. Their commitment was to ban the use of native forest residues for electricity generation. The ramifications of recognising native forest residue as a renewable fuel source under this act are in the early days of investigation. I remain concerned that this bill continues to signal to the industry that this use is available and does not do enough to encourage the use of other possibly less damaging renewable fuel sources. I note in the report Review of the science relevant to the sustainable use of native and plantation forest harvesting residues for energy production in Tasmania, published by the CSIRO in May this year, that the jury is still somewhat out on the ramifications of the use of native forest waste as a renewable energy source. In the report, the CSIRO state: Harvesting of fuelwood is a new activity in Tasmania’s wet eucalypt forest, and as a consequence there are uncertainties associated with the economic supply of fuel, the nature and intensity of harvest on particular coupes and the impacts of removal on environmental values. I am concerned about the consequences that the use of native forest waste will have on our forests, both in terms of its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and its effect on the biodiversity of our native forests. Due to the infancy of the CSIRO’s investigations, I am not adequately assured that it will not have a detrimental impact on forests in my electorate. I must admit that I support the ban proposed by the Bracks Labor government in relation to my forest, the Wombat State Forest. For too many years this natural resource has been used and abused. I have a recent list of endangered species in the Wombat State Forest from the World 10586 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 Wide Fund for Nature. They include the powerful owl, swift parrot, orange-bellied parrot, plains wanderer, eastern barred bandicoot, superb parrot, Australian grayling, regent honeyeater and the spot tailed quoll. The MRET review needs to take into consideration all effects that the removal of native forest waste would have on the biodiversity of these species. The MRET review needs to assess any implications that this would have on net greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity and the level of biomass extraction under the RFA agreements and the plantation industry. At the same time we need to concentrate on building incentives to encourage other sources of renewable energy. Take, for example, the recent announcement made by the state member for Ripon, Mr Joe Helper MLA, as part of the Bracks government initiatives on renewable energy. The member for Ripon recently took part in a ‘turning the turf’ ceremony to mark the beginning of construction of the Chalicum Hills wind farm at Buangor. The Chalicum Hills wind farm will involve the construction of 35 wind energy generators that will be the first to be supplied under an agreement between Pacific Hydro and Danish wind generator manufacturer NEG Micon. Wind power is an increasingly significant source of power. The wind farm initiative in the member for Ripon’s electorate will generate enough electricity for more than 25,000 Victorian homes. This development will provide a major boost to the regional economy from construction through to operations, maintenance and its potential for tourism. The local community have offered strong support for this development. We need to support advances in the field of renewable energy. We must also support industries that are taking steps to provide cleaner energy from non-renewable resources. That is why I support the steps being taken by the CSIRO in finding cleaner and more efficient ways in the preparation of coal for the domestic and overseas markets. Most coal is cleaned, and some of the mineral matter, or ash, is removed to make it more valuable. This small step offers significant financial benefits by improving handling and transport, reducing pollution from coal-fired power stations and improving the quality of our coals. I am pleased to stand here and say that Labor is committed to increasing the mandatory renewable energy target by two to five per cent by 2010. It is a target that is both sustainable and progressive. It is a target that, under a Labor government, we would be committed to reaching. The MRET review needs to take into consideration what direction Australia needs to take to satisfy its energy needs. It needs to look at ways to strengthen the MRET program and it needs to make sure that, as a policy instrument, it is doing what is in the best interests of the future of our environment. I would urge the review to seriously examine the effect that the inclusion of native forest residue will have not just in forests in areas such as Tasmania but also in forests such as those in my electorate, particularly the Wombat State Forest, which has been overlogged and not managed in the best interests of the local forestry industry or other members of the local community. Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (10.43 a.m.)-In summing up the debate on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2002, I want to say that the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target scheme is a cornerstone of the Commonwealth’s strategy for growing the Australian renewable energy industry and it is a world first in creating a national renewable energy market that is backed by legislation. Section3 of the act sets out the objectives for the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target. These are: to encourage the additional generation of electricity from renewable sources; to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases; and to ensure that renewable energy sources are ecologically sustainable. Essentially, the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target scheme, which I will refer to as MRET, aims to increase the share of electricity generation from renewable sources by providing a guaranteed market for an additional 9,500 gigawatt Thursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10587 hours of electricity per year from eligible renewable sources and, by 2010, is envisaged to achieve greenhouse gas abatement of between 6.7 to 7.8 megatonnes of carbon dioxide per annum. The mandatory renewable energy target demonstrates that a combination of regulatory and market based approaches can help minimise compliance costs of the measure by enabling participants greater flexibility in their decision making to seek out and utilise cost-effective eligible abatement options. Since coming into force on 1 April 2001, the measure has performed strongly, with some 170 power stations accredited, representing a broad diversity of eligible renewable energy sources and technologies throughout the country. The member for Ballarat criticised the Australian renewable energy target as less stringent than the United Kingdom’s renewables obligation order, which mandates an increase in renewable energy share of 8.5 per cent by 2010. She should know and understand-but obviously she does not-that in the UK the electricity growth is only half as great as in Australia and electricity prices are high, making the environment already competitive for renewables based electricity. We have a very different environment and a very different energy sector in Australia. As most people on this side of the chamber would understand, it has been coal based traditionally, which presents a very different challenge for our government. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2002 amends the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 by addressing minor deficiencies in the administration of the original legislation. These amendments are needed to maintain the integrity of the legislation. The changes proposed include the clarification of key definitions, including eligible renewable energy sources. The Renewable Energy Regulator is provided with a capacity to vary decisions or suspend accredited power stations in limited circumstances, including where there is thought to be gaming-gaming is where the output of a group of power stations has been manipulated for the purpose of creating more renewable energy certificates than otherwise would be the case. The bill also provides adequate safeguards in that decisions by the Renewable Energy Regulator are reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. Other amendments included in the bill are the introduction of information-gathering powers to underpin the monitoring, auditing and compliance requirements and to bring the mandatory renewable energy target into line with similar pieces of Commonwealth legislation. The bill provides for the appointment of employees of state and territory governments, as well as Commonwealth officers, to operate as authorised officers for the purpose of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000, and therefore to enable them to monitor compliance with the act. Finally, the bill addresses a potential double liability situation. The changes are administrative in nature and are required now to provide certainty to the renewable energy industry and liable parties on the operation of the renewable energy trading system. These changes in no way impact on the government’s commitment to conduct an independent review of the legislation as mandated under section 162 of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Again, if the member for Ballarat had understood what she was talking about, she would have known that that independent review does include a consideration of the extent to which non-plantation forestry waste has been utilised. It is a shame she did not do her homework. On 29 November 2002, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage confirmed that the independent review of the operation of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 will commence very shortly, in January 2003. The minister has indicated his intention that the review be conducted in a timely, open and transparent manner. As a first step, the minister has already written to all major stakeholders requesting their input into the scope of the review. It 10588 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 will consider a range of matters, including the level of the target, the mix of technologies that has resulted from the implementation of the act, the level of penalties and the need for indexation to maintain the real value of the penalty charge, as well as some other environmental impacts. The Commonwealth has a suite of renewable energy policies. Members of the opposition speaking on this bill seem to have overlooked this entire suite of renewable energy development policy worth $377 million. They include the renewable energy commercialisation program of $54 million, the renewable remote power generation program of $264 million and the supporting photovoltaic systems of $31 million. I was very pleased to hear the member for Lingiari refer to solar photovoltaic systems that he had observed in the Northern Territory. He said that, as they were a good idea, why didn’t we do something about them. He would be aware that there is significant Commonwealth funding in those Northern Territory solar photovoltaic systems. We have the Renewable Energy Equity Fund, $17.7 million; the Renewable Energy Action Agenda; and the renewable energy technology road map. The action agenda is in partnership with the renewable energy industry. This partnership has also launched a renewable energy agenda, which provides a strategic policy framework for the development of a sustainable and competitive renewable energy industry in Australia that aims for growth in annual industry sales to $4 billion by the year 2010. We have heard a number of opposition speakers refer to the cooperative research centres announced just in the last 48 hours, concerned about the renewable energy CRC. They need to look at the entire suite of CRCs announced in the last 48 hours. The Howard government has announced funding exceeding $46 million for three cooperative research centres that will aid in abatement of greenhouse gases-namely, the CRC for Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems, $23.54 million; the CRC for Greenhouse Gas Technologies, over $21 million; and the CRC for Greenhouse Accounting, $1.35 million. Therefore, we have more than taken care of the research and collaborative research needs of this particular significant issue. The decision not to fund the Cooperative Research Centre for Renewable Energy for the second time must be seen as a result of the competitive bid process. Let me talk about our future. The member for Lyons talked about the fact that Australia continues at this point to not ratify the Kyoto agreement. I stress again, the government is committed to playing an effective part in the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and is taking action on both the national and international fronts. In fact, we are leading significantly in some of the work associated with the carbon sequestration through vegetation planting. When I was in Japan in January of this year, I was very proud to stand up and talk about how Australia is doing significant work-in fact, world’s best practice work-in terms of understanding the carbon sequestration cycles. What we have done in Australia is world beating. The government has consistently stressed that, to be effective, action to address climate change needs to include participation by all major emitters of greenhouse gases. The United States has said that they are not going to ratify the Kyoto protocol-and they are the most significant emitter. To date, there has been no clear pathway for the involvement of developing countries in the Kyoto process. Without their involvement, there are risks of an energy-exporting country such as Australia burdening its own industry with additional costs. We are concerned about our Australian work force and our Australian industry and its competitiveness both domestically and internationally. The government is committed to continuing to develop and invest funding in domestic programs to meet the 108 per cent target that it agreed to at Kyoto. The national greenhouse accounts released in August show that Australia is on track for this target. I conclude by saying that the refinements contained in this Thursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10589 bill are another step towards achieving enhanced uptake of renewable energy and ensuring the emerging market in renewable energy generation is functioning according to the intention of this parliament. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Debate resumed from 3 December. Second Reading move: That this bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the proposed amendments to the Plant Breeder’s Rights Act 1994 is to: clarify the rights of plant breeders in certain circumstances where restrictions are imposed enhance the access of breeders to the Plant Breeder’s Rights (PBR) scheme, and improve the administration of the act and of the PBR scheme. I take this opportunity to flag the simple fact that plants are indispensable to our daily lives. Pharmaceuticals, fruit and vegetables, insecticides, industrial starch, field crops, essential oils, flowers, dyes, wine and beer, textiles, livestock forage, edible oils, timber, glues, rope, ethanol, varnish, paper-an endless list testifies to the importance of plant life to human life. Of course, the benefits that derive from new plant varieties do not simply fall into our hands. They are the result of significant intellectual effort and the skilful application of knowledge. Australia is fortunate to have innovative people skilled in the breeding of new plant varieties, because innovative varieties are essential to meet Australian and world demands, providing, inter alia: the building blocks for a diverse range of industries competitive, high quality food and fibre products to meet increasing world demand and practical solutions to health and environmental concerns. The act is based on Australia’s membership of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) 1991, a United Nations multilateral agreement establishing an internationally harmonised regime for exclusive intellectual property grants relating to new plant varieties. The UPOV scheme, built on uniform, clearly defined principles, encourages investment, innovation, multiplication and release of new plant varieties in, and between, member countries. Australia’s PBR scheme is a significant success story. One new variety is registered each day, with over 20 new major export crop varieties registered each year. PBR also stimulates a steady flow of new varieties from overseas, bringing investment and technology. Approximately 60 per cent of all applications for registration are from overseas. Australia’s achievements in plant breeding are significant in their own right. We need look no further than CSIRO, which is leading the world with its seed retaining phalarises, highyielding rust resistant winter wheats and starch-enhanced barleys. Similarly, the export flower",321,Representatives Main Committee
759,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10.54 a.m.)-I10590 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 industry is based on our unique native varieties, so well displayed in the 2000 Olympic bouquets. However, in this competitive world others are also capitalising on our plants. If we are to make the most of our unique mega-diverse flora, we have to encourage plant breeding. The PBR scheme provides such encouragement, directly promoting innovation by establishing a legal intellectual property right in a new plant variety. The certainty of this legal ownership and the opportunity to commercialise the innovation stimulate the intellectual effort, private investment and technology transfer that Australia requires. The PBR owner is provided with opportunity for reward, subject to certain provisions which safeguard the public interest. Under the act, PBR is the right to disallow others from acts of production, reproduction, conditioning, offering for sale, sale, import, export, and stocking for any of these purposes of propagating material of the plant variety. It is not the right specifically to carry out those acts. This is because PBR is a form of patent legislation, as confirmed by a recent High Court ruling. Implicitly, PBR coexists with other laws of the land and those laws may, for example, be capable of regulating PBR commercialisation activities. For instance, competition policy legislation may regulate PBR related commercial activities, or state legislation may regulate the sale and marketing of varieties. In other words, there are a number of potential public interest influences affecting the exercise of PBR. All the proposed amendments are consistent with Australia’s membership of UPOV and have wide industry and community support. I am pleased that the Senate has supported the government’s bill. The Senate debate canvassed and rejected a number of non-government proposals that were not the subject matter of the bill, were inappropriate and were only distantly related to PBR. An ALP amendment to add two members to the Plant Breeder’s Rights Advisory Committee was supported by the Senate. I do not believe that these two extra members will add much to the PBRAC, which seems to have operated satisfactorily to date. Nonetheless, in the interests of securing passage of this bill, the government will not oppose the expanded committee membership. The wording of the ALP amendment is not entirely consistent with the existing relevant provision of act. In the interest of speedy passage of this important bill, I will not make an issue of this. However, I give notice that the government will seek to tidy the amendment up at a later date without altering its intent. This bill includes significant clarification to section 18 of the act. Section 18 was designed to protect public interest concerns regarding limitations that might be placed on the use of the propagating material, for example, reflecting the concern that the PBR owner should not be able to prevent, say, the making of bread or the brewing of beer from legitimately purchased grain. However, it should not deny the holder of PBR the opportunity to exercise their right of exclusion regarding normal commercial activities, including, for example, the first point of sale in the trading of food commodities. Section 18 is interpreted by some people as a means of avoiding the PBR owner’s right of disallowance in normal commercial circumstances. As a consequence, significant quantities of PBR protected grain varieties in Australia pass through the commercial system without the PBR breeder having any opportunity to seek reward for their innovation. Thursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10591 The inequity of this is obvious. Moreover, it is a clear disincentive to investment in plant breeding and is a likely explanation why innovation in plant breeding in the field crops sector is lagging that of other sectors. By deleting section 18 of the act we remove the possibility of such an interpretation, promote investment in plant innovation and better align the act with UPOV 1991. Public interest concerns related to preventing limitations on how propagating material may be used are picked up under the amended section 49 which empowers the minister to set conditions relating to existing and proposed PBR grants. A further amendment, to be inserted as new section 18, allows for certain public interest restrictions to be placed on the exercise of PBR. The amendment provides that when other laws of the land restrict the normal exercise of PBR, and when such legislation authorises a person to do an act that would normally be subject to the PBR owner’s right of disallowance, ‘equitable remuneration’ must be paid. For example, the amendment will ensure that statutory marketing authorities are able to exercise their legally enforceable rights regarding exports and that PBR owners will receive remuneration if their rights are restricted as a consequence. This restriction is entirely consistent with public interest considerations and with international best practice as exemplified in the international treaty on these matters, UPOV 1991. In summary, section 18 amendments clarify that the PBR owner has the opportunity to exercise their right of disallowance in normal circumstances. They confirm that coexisting legislation, implicitly in the public interest, may modify the exercise of PBR, and, in certain circumstances, the breeder must be remunerated. They reaffirm the intent of the legislation; promote greater harmony with the UPOV international intellectual property system; provide more certainty for our international trading partners; and, thereby, facilitate the inflow of plant variety investment and technology transfer. The remaining amendments are administrative. They are diverse and include: providing for equity between domestic and imported varieties in the use of synonyms and making the unauthorised use of a synonym an infringement; clarifying the circumstances in which the breeder’s right is exhausted; providing discretion to cancel provisional protection in certain circumstances; correcting inequities regarding the payment of fees; further protecting commercially sensitive information and compelling the reasonable provision of materials for test growings; clarifying the priority date for lodgement of application; making explicit the grantee’s right to initiate infringement actions; extending the Plant Breeder’s Rights Advisory Committee including the term of appointment from two to three years; amending and making cross-references, correcting transcription errors, various clarifications and associated simplification of language. I will not comment on each of these amendments. However, let me take as an example the amendment that facilitates experimentation. I refer to the proposal to exempt on-farm testing and research as activities that could threaten the ability to register new varieties. Researchers must enlist the help of farmers to test new varieties and products in normal farming situations. This practice is essential if the true potential of the innovation is to be realistically evaluated. 10592 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 While in no way offsetting their contribution, farmers expect, in many cases, to harvest the residual material and to dispose of it in the marketplace along with their normal commercial product. Under PBR this could qualify as a ‘sale’ of the variety and start the ‘one-year’ time clock within which a PBR application must be lodged. However, many varieties take more than one year of testing. Some take two, three or more years before a decision can be made to register and the new variety can be released. Activity enabling the registration of new varieties in the circumstances that I have outlined should be recognised as valid, and is consistent with what is envisaged under UPOV. Therefore, the government proposes to recognise extended periods for on-farm and experimental testing as valid pre-registration activities. In conclusion, these amendments will clarify certain aspects of the legislation, enhance the access of breeders to the PBR Scheme and improve its administration. The amendments underpin the broader initiatives announced by the Prime Minister in the Backing Australia’s Ability package. They will further improve the environment for increased plant innovation and investment in Australia and for our exports of IP intensive products and services. I commend the bill to the Main Committee, and I present the revised explanatory memorandum to the bill. in the Plant Breeder’s Rights Amendment Bill 2002 is to clarify the rights of plant breeders in certain circumstances where restrictions are imposed; enhance the access of breeders to the Plant Breeders Rights-PBR-Scheme; and to improve the administration of the PBR Scheme. I note with interest that the Australian plant breeding industry has a turnover of something like $1.2 billion per year. I understand that Seed Industry Association members have an annual turnover themselves of $500 million. Employment in related areas of the plant breeding industry involves 10,000 jobs, including seed growers, plant breeders, seed processors and seed merchants, distributed throughout all states in Australia. The export value of the industry is about $200 million per year. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry referred to the fact that growth in the number of registrations under the PBRA since its enactment in 1994 has been impressivemore than 3,300 applications for registration have been received, with one new variety added each day. A figure of 317 new applications was recorded in 2000-01, which represents an increase of 21 per cent on the figure for 1998. Up to 100 new breeders enter the scheme every year. Approximately 60 per cent of all applications are from overseas. Most applications, I understand, are from the private sector and at least 20 new varieties in the major export crops category are being registered per annum, with 680 new varieties of field crops and pastures processed since the inception of the scheme. What does the PBR Scheme do? It provides certain rights to breeders of new plant varieties in order to encourage plant breeding and innovation. A PBR right entitles the grantee to exclude others from doing certain acts in relation to the propagation of plant varieties for which a grant is held. The scheme does not prevent someone using a PBR variety to breed another variety. In fact, the PBR Scheme exists to encourage plant innovation. New varieties bred in this way must meet the standard PBR test-that is, the new plant variety must be distinct, uniform and stable. A PBR right is limited to 25 years for trees and vines and 20 years for all other plants. The act coexists with other legislation that may impact on the use of a registered variety, including prohibition on its growing or commercialisation.

760,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (11.06 A.m.),"The purpose of the amendments containedThursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10593 also subject to competition legislation, including the provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974. The amendments contained in this bill, as the minister pointed out earlier, are predominantly administrative and include a significant clarification to section 18 of the act. Section 11 of the act establishes the right of breeders to disallow certain acts of production and other activities in relation to a plant variety. Section 18 was designed to acknowledge public interest concerns regarding the limitations that breeders can place on the use of their propagating material. For example, it is not in the public interest to allow breeders to prevent the making of food staples such as bread from grain. However, the current section 18 has been interpreted such that it has denied plant breeders the right to deny any normal commercial activity in respect of their propagating material. This was not the intention of the legislation. Accordingly, the bill provides for a deletion of section 18 and the insertion of a new section that allows for certain defined public interest restrictions. Sensibly, the new provisions provide that a breeder is able to exercise their right of authorisation of acts under section 11, except where the right is restricted by Commonwealth, state or territory legislation. Where such restrictions apply, equitable remuneration must be paid to the breeder-a provision that is consistent with Australia’s obligations under the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants 1991. The bill also clarifies the power of the minister under section 49 to impose conditions on existing and proposed breeders rights on public interest grounds. The Plant Breeder’s Rights Act 1994 is based on Australia’s membership of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants 1991. This is a United Nations multilateral agreement establishing an internationally harmonised regime for exclusive intellectual property relating to new plant varieties. The act is a form of patent legislation that coexists with other laws. The evolution of this legislation commenced in the 1970s and has been the subject of public debate over many years. The Fraser government attempted to push a plant varieties scheme through the parliament in 1981. That scheme was considered deficient. It was left to the Senate to work through many of the unresolved issues-a situation which continues, I believe, under the current coalition government. The issue of plant breeders rights was then the subject of an exhaustive inquiry by the then Senate Standing Committee on Natural Resources, the committee handing down its report in May 1984. It recommended that a plant varieties rights scheme be established and that legislation be drafted to conform with the 1978 UN convention relating to new varieties of plants. The committee also recommended that the then Department of Primary Industries closely examine all the evidence that was critical of the original bill. The end result of that proper and exhaustive process was the enactment of the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. That act enabled plant breeders to apply for and receive proprietary rights for new varieties of plants they developed. It was designed to stimulate plant breeding in Australia for both our domestic industries and for export. Despite the exhaustive consultation that preceded the passage of this legislation through the parliament, significant uncertainty about the impact of the scheme remains in some sections of the community. Concerns remain about the impact on the developing world, management of worldwide plant genetic resources, the ownership of essential food resources, market structures and basic consumer interests. Proprietary rights are designed to provide plant breeders, both public and private, with a means of recouping some of the development costs incurred in the breeding of new plant varieties. Plant breeders rights are exclusive commercial rights to a registered variety of seed and are a form of intellectual property similar to patents and copyright. The Plant Breeders Rights Scheme seeks to encourage innovation and gives 10594 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 innovators legal protection from commercial exploitation of their products by other parties. It is therefore an essential protection for an industry that drives domestic industry development and generates, as I mentioned before, export income of some $200 million per year. Ongoing innovation in the seed industry, driving the development and commercialisation of new seed varieties is the key to sustaining our major rural industries. The recently formed Australian Seeds Authority is a nonprofit organisation established to manage seed certification and accreditation in Australia. The establishment of this authority is an important step in the evolution of the Australian seed industry and will underpin development of this emerging rural industry. In addition to seed certification, the Australian Seeds Authority is responsible for matters relating to international seed trade and the development and implementation of an industry-wide quality assurance system. The Labor Party has some questions relating to the impact of Australia’s international treaty obligations on the Australian seed industry-questions that go to the heart of the regime managed by the Plant Breeder’s Rights Act as amended by this bill. The questions concern the decision taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, to sign the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation summit on world hunger in Rome this year. Does this treaty, for example, require Australian farmers to pay the United Nations a share of profits from crops grown from seeds stored in a global seed bank? Does the treaty, for example, establish a worldwide seed saver network designed to protect biodiversity and give developing countries access to new seed varieties? As this government refused to sign this treaty between 1996 and 2001, what was the basis of Minister Truss’s change of mind in June this year? According to an article in the Australian on 10 June this year, the minister had a number of concerns about the transfer of genetic assets under the treaty, but decided it was better to be involved to protect Australia’s interests. The Labor Party and the plant breeders industry need to know the details of these concerns. The same press article reported that the United States and Japan have refused to become parties to the treaty. Did the minister make himself aware of the positions of the United States and Japan and, if so, what is the position of these major seed technology innovators? It appears that decisions will be made by the United States and Japan about a range of seed technology issues outside the architecture of the treaty. Clearly, Australia’s involvement in the consideration of these issues by the United States and Japan will be limited. What are the decision making processes under the treaty and the opportunities for signatories to have input into these processes? The opposition is interested in the treaty’s royalty program. We believe that at the time of the signing of the treaty the royalty details were not established. Have the details of the royalties and how they will be distributed yet been determined? If so, what are the details? Minister Truss is reported as saying that Australian plant breeders will profit from the new system because they can access foreign crops from the seed bank. The opposition assumes that they will have to pay for that access and we seek advice on how that access will work. I trust that the minister will assist the opposition in better understanding the operation of Australia’s seed technology regime by seeking answers to the questions raised in the Senate by the shadow minister for primary industries and resources, and here today. However, the Labor Party is pleased to indicate its support for improvements to the Plant Breeder’s Rights Act that will clarify breeders’ rights, enhance access to the Plant Breeder’s Rights scheme and improve its administration. there are quite significant revolutions which change the way in which whole societies are or-",332,Representatives Main Committee
761,Mr Martyn Evans (Bonython) (11.19 A.m.),"Often in the affairs of human societyThursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10595 ganised. There was the Industrial Revolution of a few hundred years ago, the discovery of printing technology a few hundred years before that and the discovery of mathematics a few thousand years before that. In our own lifetimes, of course, we have seen the IT revolution and the biotechnology revolution, which we are living through at the moment. The predictions are that this will be the biotechnology century. I do not think the biotechnology revolution will last as long as a century. I am sure it will be well through its progress long before the end of this century. The underlying principle of both the IT discoveries and the biotechnology discoveries is not revolutions in themselves. The underlying principle behind them both is intellectual property and knowledge. In fact, we should describe this current period as a knowledge revolution-it is not an industrial revolution, as we had previously, but a knowledge revolution. That is what underpins both the IT revolution and the biotechnology discoveries that we are currently beginning to explore. Intellectual property is the underpinning basis of this legislation and the parent act which this bill seeks to amend. As my colleague has outlined, the Plant Breeder’s Rights Amendment Bill 2002 seeks to protect the intellectual property contained in the changes to plant breeding which plant breeders and farmers have undertaken in traditional ways and in the new and exciting ways which biotechnology now permits. At the moment we are starting to sequence the genetic make-up of a number of very important cereal crops. We have already fully sequenced a number of basic plants. Aradopsis was one of the first organisms to have its genetic make-up fully sequenced, and rice and other important cereal crops will soon be fully sequenced in turn. It will not be long before all the major crops and all major animal species-as with humans-will be fully sequenced, and our understanding of those sequences will be much more complete. It will be much longer before we understand the meaning of each of the genes within those sequences, so we might well have a map of the highways but we do not yet have a street-by-street and house-by-house map of each of the towns and cities along the way. But at least we are getting the map of the basic highways, and certainly a map of the countries and the states in each of those countries. That is very much the outline of what I would like to talk about. Plant breeders undertake a very important task, because without them from day one humanity would have been very hard pressed to form the basic civilisation which we have now. Without the domestication of crops we would have been very hard pressed to form the civilisation which we now enjoy. Crops provide the basic sustenance which allows us to enjoy our current lifestyle. Crops provide energy for us all and without energy we would have nothing. Those plants have matured enormously over the years. For example, the wheat which we now use as a basic and staple commodity in all our lives was the first genetically engineered crop. Oats, barley and rye were combined in a very fundamental way in that first genetic engineering experiment of early plant breeders to produce wheat. Those who see wheat as a staple and fundamental commodity would, I am sure, be very surprised to find that it is a genetically engineered crop, but that is fundamentally what it is. That points to the fundamental fallacies in the arguments of many of those who oppose so vigorously the use of genetic engineering and biotechnology in our society today. I would like to examine more closely some of those issues in my commentary on this bill which is before the Main Committee today. Plant breeders have a great deal of intellectual property to protect. It does not really matter whether they undertake their work in the highly traditional way used on farms for decades, as has been the case in my own state at Roseworthy College, which has a fundamental and longestablished reputation. The college has done a lot of work over the decades on improving wheat and other cereal crop varieties, but in the early days it took a very long time to produce an improved crop variety. And, over decades, gradually and slowly to see those fundamental 10596 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 improvements come to light in crops was a very worthwhile experiment and one from which farmers and society benefited. However, it took a great deal of patience and was a hit-andmiss affair. Now, of course, technology has improved the way in which plant breeders go about their work. In recent years, the more fundamental process was to induce mutations in the seeds. That could be done by introducing chemical mutagens to the seeds or, in more dramatic ways, by exposing them to radiation and forcing the seeds to mutate, planting large numbers of seeds and seeing which seeds survived, which produced useful mutations and which produced harmful mutations. If you planted enough seeds and exposed them to enough mutagenic chemicals and radiation you might well gain some mutations which were helpful to your breeding program. Then you were able to backcross those seeds with your fundamental stock and thereby produce an improved variety. This allowed a much faster tracking process, but I doubt that the public would be as impressed with that as they would have been with the more traditional but much longer process that was involved in the original plant breeding activity. But that never got the publicity which biotechnology has, even though it involved changing the DNA of the plant and cereal crops in very fundamental and large-scale ways, and in ways about which the plant breeders had absolutely no understanding. They could see the outward signs of that DNA change, they could see the expression of that DNA in the outward appearance of the crop but they had absolutely no idea of how the DNA had changed within the crop itself. Largely the green movement and those who opposed genetic modification of crops had no real idea of how that modern plant breeding technology was undertaken. Then along came the genetic engineering technology-biotechnology-and we started to understand how DNA worked its magic in the breeding of plants and how genes came to express individual characteristics of plants. They came to express the amount of starch and protein in a cereal crop, the height of the plant, the way in which the leaves grew and how quickly the plant would flower and the like-all of those characteristics which are so important to farmers and ultimately to the consumer as they affect the amount of crop, the amount of food and the price of the commodity, vital things to people in developed countries and absolutely fundamental life and death issues to people in the least developed countries. These things became much easier for farmers and plant breeders to do but also started to take on political significance. A country like China, for example, combines the issues of the developing world and the technology of the first world. China, with its vast population, relatively hard-pressed economy and many people who have basic and subsistence lifestyles also has the technology of the First World in many ways and many highly educated scientists who are able to apply biotechnology. China is an interesting case study which I think we should all learn a little bit more about. In fact, China’s farmers purchase and apply some $US5 billion of pesticides each year, which is a very large amount of pesticides, and many of those are long term residual organophosphate pesticides. China’s farmers, in recent years-for example, in 1995-were applying something like $US100 per hectare of pesticides on the cotton crop alone. That is a very substantial amount. For their cotton crop, they were applying $US500 million dollars of pesticides annually. China’s scientists have started to develop, as Monsanto did in the West, the BT cotton gene, because BT is a naturally occurring bacteria which produces a very significant toxin which the primary pest of cotton finds quite toxic. When that gene is expressed only in the leaves but not in the cotton itself or in the oil, the cotton pest eats the leaf and is affected quite fatally.",334,Representatives Main Committee
762,Mr Georgiou,"It dies.Thursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10597 the cotton pest. In 1997 China planted some 2,000 hectares of BT cotton, as it is known. But by the year 2000 that had spread, China being what it is, and China had planted some 700,000 hectares or 20 per cent of its cotton crop with BT cotton. By now, 2000-03, I am sure the volume is even greater. Farmers who did not use BT cotton varieties sprayed pesticides on an average of 20 times per season. Some households of small farmers-because these are small farming households-applied pesticides as many as 40 times a year, and every two or three days by the middle of the season. By contrast, BT cotton farmers applied organophosphate sprays only six times a year on average. They were applying only 11 kilograms per hectare; less than one-fifth of the quantity of pesticides used by non-BT cotton farmers. That is a dramatic difference. By 2000-and of course these estimates are a couple of years old because it is very hard to get the latest figures out of China, and it is hard to keep statistics-the estimates were that they had saved nearly 45,000 metric tonnes of formulated pesticide by using that BT cotton, and that was only with planting 20 per cent of China’s cotton crop with BT cotton. That is a major reduction in the use of organophosphorus pesticides, which are mainly used in China. Organophosphorus pesticides are very toxic to humans. Although it is very hard to get the statistics out of China, I believe-and so do many in the field-that these pesticides are a significant cause of death and injury in China. Middle-class Europeans-and, indeed, some in Australia and some in a chamber not far from where I speak-believe that it is easy for us to protest and say, ‘We will not use these kinds of genetically engineered products.’ Even though there are no genes in the cotton that expressed this BT cotton-so this shirt that I wear would contain none of those evil genes-and even though it is not toxic to humans, the reality is that some are prepared to sacrifice the lives of Chinese farmers, who would otherwise use that 50,000 metric tonnes of organophosphate pesticides saved when only 20 per cent of the crop was planted with BT cotton. Those lives would be saved immediately and directly by the use of BT cotton. We can sit in our lounge rooms in Australia and take the very privileged view and the highly theoretical position that we will not favour the use of these genetically engineered cottons, but of course mankind has been genetically engineering plant and cereal crops for thousands of years. We did that in ways we did not understand, such as leaving the plants alone in the barn at night and letting them do their own genetic engineering, and we had no concept of how the DNA was being modified. But, of course, when scientists modify plants in ways we fully understand and move only one or two genes around, that is totally unacceptable. We are prepared to directly put the lives of Third World farmers at risk from organophosphate poisons, the effect of which we understand very well. We are prepared to put the lives of people in Zambia at risk because we say they cannot eat food that is genetically engineered because it is unacceptable for them. Those lives are immediately and directly at risk, and we can measure that effect immediately and directly. We can no longer afford to take that kind of highly intellectual position. That is the kind of decision we must weigh in this genetic engineering and biotechnology debate. We must set those kinds of factors on the scale as well when we have our intellectual discussions about genetic engineering. Those issues must be put and weighed up in this debate as well. We must be very careful about looking at this on just an intellectual basis. Second-generation BT cotton is being examined now, where multiple genes are put in to prevent resistance developing and so on, so these technologies and that intellectual property will move forward. We must look across the whole range of this intellectual property, which bills like this seek to protect. It is not just an industrial revolution before us here; it is an intellectual revolution.

That is the practical, end of the day consequence for10598 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 amine the technology is to overlook the whole basis of this revolution. The technology itself is almost irrelevant; the focus is the intellectual property that stands behind it. Even though it looks relatively mundane on its surface-and even though it is debated in the Main Committee, and few people necessarily contribute to that debate-I am sure that the minister and our colleagues in the chamber understand the fundamental importance of this kind of legislation in underpinning the revolution in knowledge of human affairs that is before us. This is the legislation that will form the basis of the knowledge revolution of the 21st century, which is in effect as fundamental as, if not more fundamental than, the industrial revolution of previous centuries. This is the debate that will be the basis of that knowledge revolution. This is the kind of legislation which underpins that knowledge revolution. I think that this bill, along with its companion acts, the Copyright Act and Trade Marks Act, are the legislation of the knowledge revolution. The parliament should endorse them. Of course, we will have our differences about the precise terms, but that is the kind of legislation which this parliament must give the greatest attention to over the next decade or so. reply-I thank the members who have made a contribution to this debate. As this Plant Breeder’s Rights Amendment Bill 2002 has been developed over several years, there has been quite a bit of controversy surrounding it. The fact that there were only a small number of speakers demonstrates that the issues that have been around have been able to be negotiated and that there is general support for the content of the bill. I particularly compliment the honourable member for Bonython for his comments and for his contribution to the bill. I think it is a pity that more people around Australia do not hear the sort of message that the member for Bonython has just delivered to the Main Committee. It is important that people have before them a balanced presentation of the issues in relation to genetic modification. There is such hysteria, and nonsense being spoken in many instances, about genetic modification that the potential exists, as the honourable member for Bonython has rightly said, to delay the development of the best technology in Australia and to even risk Australia missing out on the best varieties and the new technology that farmers and other users of plants are enjoying around the world. His story about the use of chemicals on cotton in China is a story that is obviously repeated in Australia, the United States and a whole stack of countries. Cotton farmers have been one of the major users of organophosphate chemicals. Anything we can do to reduce the use of those chemicals is good for the environment. It is also good for the economics of farmers and, frankly, it is in the overall interests of the nation. Whilst the example of cotton is perhaps the most spectacular, and in many ways least controversial because very little of the cotton product is ever consumed by humans, the same principle can apply to other crops. The advantages to the Third World of the development of genetically modified crops are potentially enormous. Hybridisation was a major step forward in agricultural production, but the benefits of hybridisation have never extended to the Third World because of the high cost of seed and the inability to keep the parent stock. GMOs offer the real potential for the best varieties and the best advances to be available to farmers around the world. That does not mean we should take risks. Obviously, everyone wants all of our food products to be safe, and that applies whether they are genetically modified or not. We do need appropriate regulatory machines but, more than anything, we do need some confidence building around the nation about the safety of these products. The sorts of comments that the honourable member for Bonython has just made will certainly help to contribute towards the public debate and a better appreciation of the potential value of genetic modification to Australian agriculture, to our environment and to the nation as a whole. Actually this bill is not specifically about genetic",337,Representatives Main Committee
764,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (11.35 a.m.)-inThursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10599 modification, but I know the debate in the Senate and also here managed to bring those subjects very much to the fore. A number of questions were asked during the debate and I am happy to try and respond to them. I understand that queries were raised about whether the treaty requires Australian farmers to pay the United Nations a share of profits from crops grown from seeds stored in a global seed bank. I know that that issue has been canvassed from time to time also in the rural media. The treaty provides in general terms for payments to be made to a UN fund in some circumstances. This obligation would arise only in relation to plant genetic resources falling within the scope of the multilateral system established under the treaty. The obligation for such a payment would arise in those circumstances where a commercialised plant genetic resource, using material accessed through the multilateral system, is not available for ongoing research and development. The manner, form and level of payment will be determined by the treaty’s governing body in line with commercial practice. The payment system in the treaty implicitly recognises the freedom to operate characteristics of PBR. Commercialised plants for food and agriculture protected under plant breeders rights would be exempted from the payments because PBR legislation specifically requires new varieties to be available for ongoing research and development. However, payment may be required under other intellectual property systems such as patents, unless the patentee agrees not to limit further research and development. Australian farmers would benefit under the treaty. They would have continued access to new varieties of plants developed by Australian plant breeders using plant genetic material resources from overseas. It was also asked whether the treaty establishes a worldwide seed saver network designed to protect biodiversity and to give developing countries access to new seed varieties. The treaty establishes a binding international framework for cooperation in the conservation, sustainable use and exchange of plant genetic resources, which is open to developed and developing countries alike. The treaty builds upon the existing system established through the Food and Agriculture Organisation in 1983, recognising the need to protect the genetic diversity of plant genetic resources. The system includes important world-class collections held in trust for the benefit of all countries, under the management of the International Agricultural Research Centres. The centrepiece of the treaty will be the multilateral system of access and benefit sharing. The multilateral system sets out a facilitated access regime to govern access to, and the exchange of, plant genetic resources for food and agriculture-PGRFA-that is included in an annex to the treaty and which is under the management and control of the contracting parties to the treaty and in the public domain. The treaty contains measures to encourage individuals and organisations such as the IARCs that hold PGRFA to include that material in the multilateral system. There were some questions about Australia’s role and the time taken for it to become a signatory to the treaty. Australia’s decision to sign the treaty did not involve any change of mind. The treaty was still being negotiated in the period 1996 to 2001, and so it was inappropriate to really make a commitment at that time. When the negotiations were finalised in 2001, Australia joined with other countries in adopting the treaty text. Australia has actively participated in the development of the treaty because it believes in the need for open exchange of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture based on a fair and equitable sharing of the benefits. Australia supports the treaty’s objectives and adheres to the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources, which the treaty will replace. 10600 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 There were also some questions about whether I had concerns about the transfer of genetic assets under the treaty, and reference was made to an article in the Australian in June of this year-an article which I have to confess I do not particularly recall. Australia’s participation in the seven-year-long negotiations demonstrated our commitment to developing an effective, open and fair system of transfer of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. During the course of these negotiations, and in its comments when adopting the treaty text, Australia made it clear that the treaty must respect the national intellectual property rights of the contracting parties. The treaty does not change existing rights and obligations under other international agreements. The multilateral system must be applied in a commercially realistic way to facilitate open exchange of PGRFA based on fair and equitable sharing of the benefits and on the need for the list of crops included under the multilateral system to be assessed and extended at the earliest opportunity to enhance the benefits and potential achievable through the treaty. There is also a query about the position of the United States and Japan in relation to this treaty. Both the United States of America and Japan have participated actively during the negotiations. No country voted against the treaty text. Both countries abstained when the vote for the treaty was adopted in November 2001. Both the United States of America and Japan can become parties to the treaty, and on 1 November 2002 the United States signed the treaty. There were also questions about the processes and opportunities for signatories to have input to the processes of the operations of this treaty. When the treaty enters into force, the governing body comprising those countries which are contracting parties will become the forum for decisions about the treaty’s implementation. Those countries that ratify, accept, approve of or accede to the treaty will become eligible to participate in the governing body. Decisions of the governing body will be by consensus, unless by consensus they decide on some other decision making approach. An interim committee open to all countries will undertake work in anticipation of the treaty’s entry into force. There are also some queries about the details on royalties and their distribution which were not in place at the time of signing and a question about how these will be progressed. When the treaty text was adopted by the FAO conference in November 2001, provision was made for the establishment of an expert group to develop the terms of the material transfer agreement to underpin the multilateral system. This expert group will also be given responsibility for developing recommendations on the commercial benefit sharing obligations, as outlined in my response to a question which Senator O’Brien put some time ago in relation to the payments to the UN fund. The interim committee met in October at the FAO and developed terms of reference for this expert group. Any payment under this scheme would be payable into a mechanism established by the governing body to receive and utilise funds and become part of the funding strategy. The treaty’s funding strategy provides the priority to be given to the implementation of agreed plans and programs for farmers in developing countries, especially in less developed countries and in countries with economies in transition who conserve and sustainably utilise plant generic resources for food and agriculture. There were also some questions about the basis upon which Australian plant breeders access foreign plant genetic material and whether they will have to pay. The Australian food and agricultural sectors depend to a significant extent upon access to overseas sources by PGRFA for continued plant breeding and improvement. The treaty will help secure Australia’s plant breeders access to these crucial overseas sources. The treaty will build upon and replace the non-binding international undertaking on plant genetic resources established by the FAO in 1983, which has been of great benefit to Australia. If Australia were a party to the treaty at the time it entered into force, it would enable Australia and Australian plant breeders to access Thursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10601 tem of conservation, use and exchange. Under the treaty, contracting parties must provide to other contracting parties facilitated access to plant genetic material held under their management and control and in the public domain. Such access would be under the terms of a standard material transfer agreement agreed to by the governing body. As already indicated, there may be a payment obligation in some circumstances. If Australia were to become a member of the treaty, we could have a say in the governing body’s formulation of the payment obligations, details and materials transfer agreement. This could be particularly important because our intellectual property system-for example, our patents-has the potential to trigger the mandatory payment arising when commercial materials are not available for further R&D. Finally, the treaty does not require recipients of material from the multilateral system to subsequently take out intellectual property rights on new varieties. Overwhelmingly, the amendments are routine and will make administrative improvements promoting access to and improving the efficient operation of the PBR scheme. We explained the uncertainty that exists in relation to current section 18 of the legislation and, importantly, the changes that have been made to section 49 to ensure that conditions relating to existing and proposed PBR grants are appropriate. Again, I thank the opposition for its support for the legislation. As I have indicated, the government has agreed to an ALP amendment in relation to extending the size of the committee and will move to add those two members to the committee as soon as possible. In the spirit of bipartisan support that has finally been achieved in the Senate after a very long debate, I thank the Main Committee for dealing with it promptly. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Transport: Flags of Convenience Vessels Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (11.51 a.m.)-I take this opportunity to raise concerns and opposition voiced by many of my constituents in relation to the reflagging of Australian ships under flags of convenience and their subsequent recrewing with foreign crews. We know that often these crews are working under very appalling and exploitative conditions. It is a tragedy that the Howard government continues with a concerted policy to abandon Australian shipping and Australian jobs in favour of cheap foreign crews. We have seen this policy since the election in 1996. Average Australians believe that shipping is a vital Australian industry and plays a very important role in providing employment for many Australian coastal communities like those in my electorate of Throsby. I want, in particular, to raise the case of the docking of the Ikuna at Port Kembla last Sunday. The docking of that ship met with a community protest. This ship was formerly an Australian flagged and crewed ship out of Newcastle, then called the MV Wallarah. The Akuna is now flagged out of Tonga. Its 17 Australian crew have been sacked and replaced with a Tongan crew who receive much lower rates of pay. I think that has been the whole incentive to deregulate the shipping industry, so that the shipowners can employ crews at less than the prevailing conditions of employment that have been long built up in this nation through the efforts of the union-originally the Seamen’s Union, now part of the",338,Representatives Main Committee
765,Mr Georgiou (Kooyong) (11.50 A.m.),"I move:10602 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 MUA. If you do not believe me, I will quote from Mr Lachlan Payne, the executive director of the Australian Shipowners’ Association, who said in a recent article: ... an Australian seafarer earns about $52,000 a year. Wages under $10,000 ... can apply to some vessels operating under a flag of convenience. Regrettably, the plight of the discarded MV Wallarah crew is not unique. Since 1994 the number of Australian flagged ships has almost halved from 74 to 47. This government’s continued vendetta against the Maritime Union, its support of the deregulation of the shipping industry, the exemption of foreign crews from work visa hurdles and the allowance of single voyage permits which enable foreign nationals to work on our domestic runs is occurring at the expense of local jobs and is destroying one of Australia’s oldest industries. I think it is important to note that those who oppose the use of foreign crews on these ships of shame do not harbour any ill feeling towards the crew members. As Dean Summers, the International Transport Federation convenor, said recently in one of our local papers, ‘They’-meaning the foreign crews-‘suffer under this system as well. They need to be paid a minimum wage rather than be exploited.’ The impact on local employment is devastating enough but so too is the potential impact on the environment. The recent spate of international maritime incidents involving flags of convenience vessels, many of which, by the way, have visited Australian waters, illustrates just how vulnerable our coastline is to the ships of shame. If we look at the recent tragic incident involving the Prestige on the north-west coast of Spain, again a flag of convenience ship out of the Bahamas, the impact on the environment of such a disaster in Australia would be absolutely catastrophic. Imagine the effect such a spilltwice the size of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska-on the Barrier Reef. A repeat of the Prestige incident in our waters would destroy not only the reef but industries such as fishing and tourism as well. This government is hell bent on destroying local jobs in the shipping industry and endangering other industries and our fragile environment as well. I want to finish by paying tribute to the efforts of the MUA and the South Coast Labour Council. Their continued campaign in support of Australian shipping, Australian jobs and our environment, and for the elimination of foreign crew exploitation is to be commended and supported by all who believe in Australian shipping and its importance to our island nation. Paterson Electorate: Medical Services of the current doctor shortage in the Port Stephens area of my electorate. By way of background, it was around this time last year that we had the death of the doctor in Karuah and we also lost a doctor in Medowie at the beginning of 2001. As such, the patients in these areas have had to go to other general practitioners, predominantly in the Raymond Terrace area, which has seen waiting times go up excessively. Karuah is a unique little town at the northern end of Port Stephens. It is some distance from Raymond Terrace and there is a lack of regular transport for people to get in to Raymond Terrace to see the doctors. Karuah also has a very large aged community that are in receipt of the pension. Unfortunately, most of the doctors in Raymond Terrace do not bulk bill and that has exacerbated the situation. Medowie is a town of some 6,500 constituents, which probably rolls out to around 8,500 people. It is halfway between Karuah and Raymond Terrace. We have been fortunate that the Port Stephens medical practice has established a practice in that town to take up some of the slack. Unfortunately, in the past few weeks, Dr Suraya Felix has decided to leave Medowie. She is an excellent doctor with some 4,000 patients-about triple the list that most doctors in the metropolitan areas see. This has created some problems. Whilst the Port Stephens medical",341,Representatives Main Committee

In addition to this, in Lemon Tree Passage this week, the community have been alarmed to hear that Dr Jarvis, a fine doctor, has been suspended by the medical registrations board for financial impropriety. That has exacerbated the situation because, as a peninsular community, it also suffers from a tyranny of distance and a lack of public transport when they need to get to doctors. Straight after the loss of the doctors in Karuah and Medowie, my office approached Kay Patterson, the Minister for Health and Ageing, and received in-principle support for two overseas trained doctors to come to Karuah and Medowie. The biggest problem we have had at the moment is that whilst we have met with a lot of doctors, shown them around the town and provided what support we have, their qualifications have not met the requirements to get medical registration and take up those positions. I also get very concerned when the Hunter Area Health Service CEO, Katherine McGrath, comes out on the ABC, as she did recently, saying there is no substantiated case for a doctor to be located in Karuah. I find that very disappointing from a medical professional when you have to address the needs of the community, not just the needs of an area health service. My other concern is the RAMAs. In Port Stephens, we have differing RAMA areas. Tomaree Peninsula, which is quite a wealthy area, is a higher level of RAMA than that of Medowie and Karuah-both areas of need by my interpretation. This is based on the fact that there are a lot of people there with low level medical services. Any doctor coming into either of those towns from tomorrow would have full books. It would not be a case of sitting down and scratching around for work. The need is critical and they would have full books instantly. I know this problem is replicated in other areas. The call today is going out to the Hunter Area Health Service, as the health professional organisation, and the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice. I have spoken to Arn Sprogis from that organisation to do what they can to attract the doctors so that we can support them. There is a misconception that I, as a federal member, should be able to advertise, interview doctors and get them into a town. I do not have that expertise; these medical professional units do. In the discussions with Arn Sprogis from the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice this week, there was an in-principle agreement for the division, at the Maitland After Hours Emergency Care, to provide after hours emergency care for the people of Karuah and Medowie. That is most welcome, and it will be welcomed by the community. Finally, last Monday night in Medowie there was a meeting put on by the Labor Party to discuss the doctor shortage. I welcomed the initiative they took. They said they were going to debate me. They rang my office to find out if I would be in parliament and then put out a press release saying they were going to debate me at the meeting whilst I was in parliament. I think that is most unfortunate. (Time expired) Environment the future of our country. Climate change is a reality, as is land degradation, salinity, the deterioration of our water quality, loss of native vegetation and loss of biodiversity. As just one example of the environmental degradation facing Australia, one only has to look at the latest report by the Bureau of Statistics on salinity, which shows that 1,989,000 hectares of farmland, or just under 20,000 farms, are affected by salinity problems.

767,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (12.01 P.m.),"The health of our environment is crucial to10604 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 We must learn to live with our environment rather than constantly battle against it, in order to create a sustainable future for our people. This is an area of policy that requires national leadership and cooperation with all levels of government. We need a coordinated approach to tackle the problems that are currently facing us and those yet to surface. Unfortunately, the government does not seem to believe in national leadership. The environment is not listed under section 51 of the Constitution, so the government passes the buck to the state governments and only makes a token effort itself. This simply is not good enough. The Labor Party does not believe in passing the buck. One only has to look at Labor’s policy to understand this. The shadow minister for the environment and heritage, the member for Wills, has stated Labor’s position clearly in two separate policy documents released this year. The policy paper entitled Tackling Salinity: Labor’s policy framework for sustainable land and water use’ states: To address environmental, sustainable land use and regional development issues effectively, a national effort is required from all sectors of the community and industry, with leadership from the Commonwealth, and coordinated action amongst the states. The policy paper entitled Combating climate change: Labor’s policy framework for a sustainable future with quality of life and a healthy environment states: We desperately need a federal government that recognises the importance of this issue and will lead national action to reduce emissions in partnership with all sections of society. Labor’s policy is clear: we will sign the Kyoto protocol and create huge opportunities for local companies to expand and grow. Environmental protection does not have to mean economic ruin. There is an opportunity here for the government which it is not recognising but which the opposition sees. There is flexibility built into the Kyoto protocol that will allow Australian companies to expand into the export market and earn credits for Australia’s national greenhouse gas emission account, grow the economy, protect the environment, create jobs and wealth, while at the same time protecting the earth and our natural resources for the future. This is a win-win situation. Times have changed and we are far more aware of the consequences of our actions than at any stage in our past. We recognise now that we cannot continue to damage our natural environment with impunity. Only Labor, however, has the policies that will address the problems and create the opportunities that we need to drive our economy forward. Strategic partnerships and cleaner industries will position Australia at the cutting edge of the new economy. Sustainable jobs in sustainable industries-surely that is the target that we should set ourselves for the nation. The Prime Minister has a ‘kinda-sorta’ policy. He wants us to meet our Kyoto greenhouse gas emission targets but, by not signing up to the document as a full partner, he is preventing Australian companies from benefiting from the international trading opportunities that are available. Labor has a strategy; Labor has a policy. The salinity policy has been available since February and the climate change policy has been available since July. These are just two of a number of policies that have been released by Labor since the comprehensive policy review process began after the last election. There are opportunities-and I know the member for Mitchell will agree with me. There is economic growth, sustainable jobs and a protected environment. It is a win-win situation, but only if we act now and only if we lead from the front. Labor’s policies, and only Labor’s policies, will do that. Drought FRAN BAILEY (McEwen-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (12.05 p.m.)-On1 November, Goulburn Valley Water introduced stage 9 water restrictions to comThursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10605 munities in my electorate, including Broadford, Kilmore, Seymour, Wallan and WandongHeathcote Junction. At the same time as these restrictions were announced, Goulburn Valley Water enacted an emergency management plan which involves transportation of 600,000 megalitres of water from Seymour to Broadford daily. This equates to around 22 large semitruck loads of water a day at a cost of around $100,000 to $150,000 per month. If the dry spell continues-and there is every indication it will-the amount of water required could double by the end of the summer. All these communities are supplied water from Sunday Creek Reservoir. With no prospect of rain and low water levels, these communities are growing increasingly concerned about the shrinking supply of water and the water quality. Their fears are not being allayed by Goulburn Valley Water. It plans to pipe water from Tallarook to Broadford to shore up diminishing reserves for towns south of the divide, such as Wallan and Wandong-Heathcote Junction. This means the rural catchment that has long supplied water to Broadford will be piped across an extended mountain range to supply townships that border outer metropolitan Melbourne. In other words, water will be taken from north of the divide and piped south. Meanwhile individuals, families, the elderly, traders and small business operators in Broadford this summer remain dependent on truck loads of water arriving from Seymour to supply them with their most basic need. For the third successive year the people of Wallan are on severe water restrictions throughout the summer period. There is no doubt that drought has taken hold in rural areas. The victims are not just constituents in my electorate but constituents around Australia in the electorates of many of my colleagues. What concerns me is the ongoing mismanagement of this finite resource in a rural region regarded as the food bowl of Australia. Seven firms in this region are included in the national top 200 export earners. The water authority also declares in its own promotional material that the water it supplies ensures the smooth operation and delivery of 25 per cent of the state’s rural output-such as dairy, beef, fruit and vegetables-with export earnings of over $1 billion. But Goulburn Valley Water simply does not have a strong record of consultation with its customers, whether they be farmers or householders. It has proved this over and over again, and this is of course reflected in the distrust of the authority shown by so many sectors of the community. For example, the water authority collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in bulk water fees by selling drinking water to irrigators this year at the same time as it was imposing water restrictions right across the Goulburn Valley. This decision has left local residents and traders feeling utterly betrayed. The Weekly Times reported that shire councils had not even been informed of the decision, even though the water authority insisted that a program of consultation had been undertaken. The question remains: with whom? Goulburn Valley Water chief executive, Laurie Gleeson, has since confirmed that the authority has made 9,000 megalitres available to irrigation farmers through the water exchange over the past two years because ‘water has been in excess of current annual domestic and industrial requirements’. Perhaps he could explain in more detail to my local communities exactly what excess water he managed to identify and how many of my towns, especially the towns that are on water restrictions, will be affected. And where exactly was this so-called excess water sold? Certainly the water authority has not taken up any opportunity offered to it to explain so far. Mitchell Shire Council recently coordinated a meeting of concerned residents and traders in Broadford which I attended. The water authority replied that it was unable to attend because of caretaker conventions in place for the state election. I have never heard such a blatant excuse to avoid facing up to a group of concerned residents in my life. I want two things to happen in regard to this issue: Mitchell Shire to stop all new development and the Goulburn Water Authority to answer its customers. (Time expired) 10606 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 Prime Minister: Christmas List the Prime Minister down wants to put on the red suit and cash in on Christmas. SoI wonder what Santa will leave in the Prime Minister’s stocking at Kirribilli House this Christmas. Of course, it will all depend on whether he has been bad or good. I can just imagine the Prime Minister sitting on Santa’s knee at the local shopping mall and Santa asking whether he has been a good boy this year and whether he has told any fibs. Not even to questions about the ‘children overboard’ incident? And what about good manners? He did say ‘Yes sir’ every time to George Bush, but he did not say he was sorry to Justice Kirby. Has he been kind to older and less fortunate people? Well, there was that little matter of wanting to increase pensioner payments for prescriptions and also wanting to stop people getting access to disability support payments. But then he did give $2.3 billion to subsidise private health insurers so that they could give people free golf clubs, camping tents and music CDs. And what about all that money for Rio Tinto and Manildra? What will the Prime Minister be asking Santa for this year? Will it be the set of Henselite bowls or the Reader’s Digest Book of Caravanning Around Australia? Or will it be the Smokey Dawson rocker and a subscription to Wisden’s Cricket Almanac? Will he be sitting back and enjoying retirement before the next year is over? Or if he is still Prime Minister, maybe he would prefer the GI George doll that nukes Iraq when you press the red button. Just what does the Prime Minister want from Santa that his cabinet colleagues have not already given him? The Treasurer gave him the Sergeant Pepper’s album for his 63rd birthday, so he will not want another one of those. Senator Coonan offered him the use of her weekender over the holidays, but he would not want to be seen down there. The minister for immigration sent him a landscape painting of the Woomera detention centre with a razor wire frame. That will look very nice over the mantelpiece at the Lodge. Senator Alston sent him a Batman walkie-talkie set. He will get better service on that than on his mobile phone. And Danna Vale sent him a plastic battleship to play with in the bathtub. Now he can be the admiral of ‘the mightiest little navy in the world’. But he does not know what he will do with those oversize torpedoes that Senator Hill sent him. Maybe he could use them as paperweights in the office. And what was the Minister for Foreign Affairs thinking of when he sent him a suspender belt? The minister for education sent him a portrait of himself with the instructions to hang it behind the door. He could think of one small room where it would look just perfect. But what can he do with the present from the minister for workplace relations? He is still trying to clean up after those rottweilers that Peter Reith gave him. How will he cope with a pair of Welsh corgis as well? It is very hard being the Prime Minister who has everything. What can he ask Santa for this Christmas? But it is a different story for many ordinary Australians-those families who were looking forward to their tax return to buy gifts for their children but who got a bill to pay instead; those families with relatives overseas who cannot get a visitors visa to Australia in order to share the holiday season with them. And there are so many; I can name at least 14 cases in my electorate alone. What about those families who did not work for his brother Stan and who lost their entitlements when they were retrenched? What about those families that look at the bigger slice that income tax takes out of their pay packet each week? But at least for the time being we may have a peaceful new year. I just hope that the Prime Minister asks Santa for that-a peaceful new year. Merry Christmas and a peaceful new year to all the staff, members of parliament and to all Australians.",343,Representatives Main Committee
768,Mrs Irwin (Fowler) (12.10 P.m.),"The silly season is now upon us and everyone fromThursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10607 Youth: Waverley Action for Youth Services of parliament, in contrast to listening to the member for Fowler, is to be able to observe the work of so many organisations that help those in our community, particularly the disadvantaged. Those organisations rely on the voluntary efforts of members of the community, along with professional staff whose dedication, often at salary levels that do not reflect the importance of their work or the hours and stresses they face, make our society a more compassionate and caring one. One of those organisations in my electorate is Waverley Action for Youth Services, known as WAYS. WAYS has operated in the eastern suburbs of Sydney since 1979. In that time it has been at the forefront of assisting young people in the area through a wide range of services. I know that it has made a tangible and positive difference to the lives of hundreds. Indeed, every week WAYS works with over 900 young people. WAYS has established itself as a one-stop shop for young people, aiming to provide the full suite of services that they might need. Its programs include sport and recreational activities; mental health programs; counselling; school education programs; and housing, employment, training and vocational programs. It is assisted by the generous support of many within the local community. It is also the recipient of financial support from councils and the state and federal governments. In the latter context, I know how important support from the federal government has been to the service, and I was therefore delighted that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs had the opportunity to visit WAYS earlier this year as part of National Youth Week. Federal funding for WAYS is provided through a number of programs. It is part of the Job Network intensive assistance program, through which it provides case management services to people referred by Centrelink. It assists clients overcome some of the barriers to employment in areas such as housing support, mental health issues, drug and alcohol problems and numeracy and literacy skills. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations also supports WAYS through the Job Network matching program. Through the Job Network, WAYS assists in filling employment vacancies with unemployed clients. WAYS also is an active participant in and beneficiary of the Job Placement, Employment and Training Program, known as JPET. JPET funding has allowed WAYS to help people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness who need a range of assistance with accommodation, legal counselling and personal support, with the aim of remaining in employment or returning to school. I know that JPET is a vital part of their services in the eastern suburbs and, in an area with many disadvantaged young people, continued support from the federal government is extremely important. WAYS is an innovative organisation and works closely with other community groups to deliver outcomes for young people in the most effective way. In this respect, I was pleased to be able to support the launch of a new program by the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the member for Bradfield, which has brought together the skills and experience of both WAYS and the Salvation Army’s Oasis Youth Support Network. A new joint initiative called FLOW is a pilot program funded by the Commonwealth department of education and aims to bring young people back into the mainstream educational and vocational training sessions. Like many community organisations, WAYS does rely on the generosity and support of the community. Just this month it launched the ‘buy a brick’ campaign to help it purchase the old police station at Bondi, which it hopes to use for accommodation for homeless people as well",346,Representatives Main Committee

It has 600 bricks left to sell and I encourage members of the eastern suburbs communities to support this fundraising program for what will be an important addition to WAYS’ ability to assist young people in my area of Sydney. I place on record the thanks of all the residents of Wentworth for the work of the WAYS board, its dedicated staff, led by Amanda Webster, Russell King and John Gilbert, and all those who give a hand to a service that I believe is one of the nation’s very best. Parliamentarians: Backgrounds that is perpetrated in this place. It is repeated every day with zeal by the member for Warringah and other government members in their attempts to displace the public view in terms of working people and average Australians. This parliament is subject to insult after insult about the backgrounds of members-where they grew up, where they reside, where they were educated and where they educate their children. But the attacks put forward by the government are not so much an attack on politicians as an attack on working people and their families. Working people, ordinary Australians, are the backbone of this country. They are the lifeblood of industry, they are the consumers, they hold the values and ideals and, most importantly, they are the people that we all represent as members of parliament. The background and choice of employment of members of parliament before being elected is important. But, in itself, it means less than the ideals and values that we all hold and how we represent our constituents. The continual perpetration of this urban myth that all politicians are cast from the same mould and are a homogenous, bland group is completely false and without basis. Members of parliament are representative of their own electorates and, in a broad sense, are a microcollection of the Australian people. Labor representatives are no different. In fact, they are more closely representative of their constituents through their own experiences, lives and, in particular, their formative years and their professions. The official record of data and detail about politicians contained in the Parliamentary Handbook of 2002 is a fantastic record of all sorts of information. Unfortunately, it is not expansive enough to include all of our professions and past jobs but rather only what we did just prior to entering parliament. I have conferred with Labor members of parliament and consulted the Australian Political Almanac of 2002. It is a completely different picture from what is portrayed in the Parliamentary Handbook. For example, in Queensland, Senator John Hogg was a teacher with a science degree and taught for many years in schools. Joseph Ludwig, a senator for Queensland, grew up in Roma, lived in public housing and worked on weekends at a fruit shop and also as a TAB ticket writer. That is quite interesting. He studied law part-time while working and spent a decade in the Army Reserve. He also worked as a public servant as an inspector in industrial relations. George Campbell, from New South Wales, became a shipwright’s apprentice after leaving school. He came to Australia and worked at the naval dockyards at Williamstown. Senator John Faulkner was taught in a public school and taught children with disabilities after getting his degree. Senator Hutchins, from New South Wales, went to a Catholic school and gained a degree but, interestingly enough, worked as a garbo-he tells me he was not a garbage collector; he was a garbo. He was a forklift driver with TNT before joining the Transport Workers Union. Gavin Marshall, from Victoria, was an apprentice electrician and an electrician. Trish Crossin, from the Northern Territory, was an early childhood teacher. Jan McLucas, a senator for Queensland, was a primary teacher and a city councillor.

Graham Edwards, the member for Cowan, left school at 15 to work as a sheet metal worker before joining the railways. At age 21, he was working as a fireman. He served in Vietnam and, as we all know, he lost his legs there to a landmine, but when he was discharged from the Army he worked as a hospital clerk.

Steve Gibbons, from Bendigo, was an apprentice motor mechanic who left school at 16. electorate as well. and studied law part-time while being a mother. John Murphy, the member for Lowe, spent 28 years as a Commonwealth public servant. The member for Greenway, Frank Mossfield, left school at 15 and joined the railways as an apprentice.

Sidney Sidebottom, the member for Braddon, was a student at a monastery and studied there for three years. He was a school teacher and a musical director. And then there is me. I am a migrant. I grew up in Inala, worked at a number of labouring jobs and spent two years in the RAAF. I was a trades assistant and an apprenticed electrician. I am a tradesman and I have done a range of other things. WhatI am saying is that the Labor Party has got a rich, colourful, diverse background.

While some of New South Wales has received rain, Cobar and many of the surrounding districts are still very much in the grips of drought. The Rotary Club of Kariong Somersby felt that because the hinterland of the Gosford Shire is one of the largest producers of spring water in Australia it was appropriate to send our product to Cobar in western New South Wales to show our genuine concern for the predicament that many of our western communities face. The water was donated by Peats Ridge Springs. They have donated, as I said, 44 pallets-approximately 34,000 litres-of their excellent packaged spring water. That is a very generous donation from this company, which is a Central Coast company. It is a family based operation and has grown from a very small operation to a multimillion dollar business in a few years. I congratulate Livio Pace and the Pace family for this wonderful donation and for all the other things that they do for the Central Coast community. They are a very generous company. Linfox Australia Pty Ltd, a transport company who are also based in Somersby, have generously agreed to transport the load to Cobar free of charge-again, a very generous donation. The Rotary Club of Cobar and the drought relief committee of Cobar have secured a warehouse, compliments of Mackenzies Transport, to store and distribute the water. The Rotary Club of Kariong Somersby are also helping out by agreeing to cover the cost of the packaging of the water. So Saturday will be quite a special day for the Rotary Club of Kariong Somersby. Unfortunately I do not think that I will be able to be there because of the vagaries of the parliamentary sitting. This being the last parliamentary sitting of the year, I am not sure what time we will get out of this place today, tonight or tomorrow. Everyone keeps asking me when. Ms Burke-You’re the chief whip! could get their act together and let some of the legislation throughties and constituents to assist them with many projects, such as this wonderful project which is a symbol of the concern that many of us in the cities and regional areas that are not affected by drought have for the people in rural New South Wales and Australia. We do have an understanding of the difficulties they are going through. We have an understanding of how important the rural communities are to our economy. Whilst some of us in the larger regional centres might take it for granted that we can walk into our supermarkets and have a wonderful range of fresh produce, we do know that it comes from the hard working people of the rural areas and we know how much they are suffering at the moment from this terrible drought. I am very pleased to see that some communities in northern New South Wales have received considerable rain over the past week. It is certainly not enough to break the drought. This very generous donation of two semitrailer loads of bottled drinking water from Peats Ridge Springs is very much a symbol of the Central Coast’s concern for those communities. I congratulate the members of the Rotary Club of Kariong Somersby for putting together this unique idea. The Rotary Club of Kariong Somersby is one of the more active rotary clubs on the Central Coast of New South Wales.

Newcastle Electorate: Aviation Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (12.30 p.m.)-I wish to take this opportunity to share with the parliament some of the regional consequences, particularly in my region, of the international aviation crisis post September 11 and to pay tribute to the board and management of Newcastle Airport Ltd for their initiative, effort and determination to provide the best opportunities for the aviation sector and the travelling public in Newcastle and the Hunter region. Since the demise of Ansett and the collapse of the local cut-price operator Impulse Airlines, air travel to and from Newcastle has been more difficult than ever. With the added burden of skyrocketing insurance premiums, it was a challenge to service regional routes-a challenge no-one seemed anxious to take up. But with the Impulse fleet taken over by Qantas, fortunately the service was maintained. However, before long it was obvious that Qantas was unwilling to persist with the less financially rewarding frequent short trips to and from Sydney, and in July it axed 42 return services a week between Williamtown and Sydney. It was also obvious to the paying passenger that cut-price fares would not be offered again. The 19-seat Impulse aircraft were not so popular, particularly at the higher fare regime that was implemented, and soon these aircraft were withdrawn. Although services were replaced with the older aircraft of the Dash8 Qantas link fleet, the consequences were dearer fares and less frequent flights. In our nationalised and globalised economy, the changes had serious impacts on the many businesspeople who choose a quality of lifestyle offered outside Sydney but need to commute daily or regularly to maintain their business activities. The provision of a very early daily service to Sydney each morning is essential if businesspeople are to be able to connect to capital city flights and spend a full working day at these locations. It is an area that needs urgent attention by Qantas. It has been reassuring that Qantas has retained its jet maintenance facility, as a result of direct representations to its manager of regional aviation, Narendrah Kumar, by the airport manager, the chairman and me. The performance of this facility remains high, and it is hoped that Qantas will recognise that investment in regional aviation needs a holistic approach. Qantas’s sponsorship of the Knights football team is an investment the region will return to it through loyalty, if that investment is maintained. Competitive price structures are desperately needed and are important to retain the travelling market. The impact of cut-price services offered originally by Impulse, before the regional aviation downturn, is that people did choose to fly. In fact, the Qantas market grew by 50 per cent during Impulse’s Newcastle operation. There is certainly a lesson there for those interested in sustaining and growing the aviation industry. Fortunately, we have continued and persisted. I would like to pay credit to Newcastle airport and to congratulate Newcastle Airport Ltd on gaining a commercial partner, Sangreal Holdings, to develop and manage $80 million worth of infrastructure on site development. It is wonderful news for Newcastle and the Hunter region. The new infrastructure could deliver 350 new jobs. It also means an exciting new direction, creating economic growth and associated spin-offs for the local economy, particularly in the field of aviation services, support services and the avionics and engineering industry that is associated now with our airport. Unfortunately, the government has done very little to assist regional aviation, but fortunately for Newcastle and the Hunter a proactive 10612 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 board and management team have tackled this challenge very well. I congratulate them on their determined efforts. I also congratulate Horizon Airlines for taking up the Sydney flights. As Newcastle regional airport also share their facilities with RAAF Williamtown, it is fortunate for us that that is a positive and complementary relationship. It is also important for Defence that they assist in building a skills mass in avionics and aeronautical engineering. They cannot be the only industry incubators, and certainly partnerships like those posed by the regional airport will be to their advantage. In concluding, I would like to say that I have just returned from the Australian Defence Force Academy’s graduation parade and I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate all the midshipmen and officer cadets of the 2002 graduation class. I also convey my appreciation and congratulations to the commandant, Air Commodore Julie Hammer, on an excellent outcome from her academics, staff and cadets. I also extend my appreciation to Rear Admiral Adams for his generous hospitality. Parliament: Services Gilmore Electorate about the member for Fowler’s disgusting speech in the chamber just a few moments ago. What absolute garbage she spoke. I hope her constituents feel as ashamed of her as I did. But then, like a fool, I used to think she was okay. I wonder how her family feels about the filthy use of words she displayed in this House. Since coming to parliament, I have stood up on many occasions and spoken on a range of subjects, many of which have long been forgotten. TodayI rise to acknowledge the contribution of those people who make it logistically possible for me to do so. I am sure many of us think we are an island: that we can stand alone and that we can do it by ourselves. A moment’s quiet reflection will tell you otherwise. We may not be an island, but we politicians are the tip of an iceberg. Like an iceberg, many of the people who help and support us are unseen, whether by choice or circumstance. I would like to personally and individually thank each of those who make it possible for me to stand up here and speak on behalf of so many people. That is quite an obligation-and it is an honour-and I am thankful that there are people here and in my electorate to help me. In this house things do not happen by accident. The old cliché is right: many hands do make light work. Here in the house there are hundreds of people supporting my activity and that of other members, and making sure things move as smoothly as possible. Their collective efforts, whilst they are often unnoticed, at the end of the year are certainly appreciated. From Danica, the lady who collects the rubbish from my office and cleans the bathroom, to the support services in the library, the IT staff, the security staff, the clerks, the ‘grey and greens’ sitting here in this room, and especially Carol in our corridor, and the Hansard staff and Broadcasting people, they all fulfil their duties with courtesy and grace. I extend special thanks to Monica and Nelka from the Hyatt breakfast staff. You are two very special people. How can I forget the fixers of our fax machine when we forget to turn it on? They work in relative invisibility. Theirs is an attitude of: ‘We are here to help others’. The least I can do, as a politician who uses the house they protect and look after, is thank them. We come here regularly. We see everything in its place, and when we need things they are always there. We need to take the time to deliver a sincere and heartfelt thank you. I would like to mention every one of the parliamentary staff who have assisted me throughout the course of the year.

You have all done a wonderful job, and I appreciate your commitment and dedication in coming back day after day to make my life easier. When thanking people, I cannot forget those people in my electorate of Gilmore who did so much last Christmas and who did so much again this year. I thank all those who contributed to fighting the fires-there are so many of you; you are too numerous to mention. I thank the ordinary people who gave donations of money or time to the drought relief program and all those who responded to the Bali tragedy. The community got together to share in the grief. Thank you for showing solidarity in the face of adversity, for getting together as a community and for the spirit you have shown in those hard times. When the time comes, we all work together to help and support each other. In a way, we are part of a team that makes things happen. Do not underestimate yourselves. Without you, my job would be a lot more difficult. A lot has been said in relation to the media, but we in Gilmore are fortunate to have a very community oriented media. Because they are from the community, they report fairly and in the best interests of the community as a whole. They understand the community and, because they are part of it, they feel for what they are reporting on. I am indeed grateful to the journalists and staff of 2ST, the ABC, the South Coast Register, the Kiama Independent, the Southern Highlands News, WAVE FM, the Milton Ulladulla Times, the Sussex Inlet Times, WIN4 and the Illawarra Mercury. That is not to forget all those villages in Gilmore who produce their own newsletters. Whilst there may have been a few occasions where the media and I might have agreed to disagree, they have always acted in the best interests of the community. They have followed issues that concerned the community and reported the facts without fear or favour. We are indeed fortunate to have such dedicated and loyal people in our midst. Thank you for all your support throughout the year. I look forward to working with you once again in 2003. Cricket: The Ashes shown by the member for Gilmore for the staff of the parliament. Indeed, all members would concur with those sentiments. One hundred and twenty years ago, on Christmas Eve, the Ashes-the historic trophy coveted by the two cricket nations, England and Australia-was born. In order to properly commemorate this anniversary, I thought it was fitting to commence a ‘Return the urn’ campaign. In 1882 at a social match at Sunbury, where I live, a resident tendered the renowned urn to Ivo Bligh, the then English cricket captain. After his death it was given to the Marylebone Cricket Club. For over 70 years, the urn has been locked up at Lord’s. To rectify this injustice, I wrote to the McC on 26 June and requested: ... on the occasion of the upcoming English tour in 2002-2003, that the M.C.C. release The Ashes and deliver them to Steve Waugh, as captain of Australia, the current ‘holder’ of The Ashes. That is an unusual phrase, since we have never had the urn in Australia. I added: Moreover, the trophy should only be returned to England when their cricket team has defeated Australia. On2 JulyI wrote a letter to the Prime Minister along the same lines, asking him to indicate whether he supported the idea. I have yet to receive a response on this matter from the Prime Minister. I did, however, receive a response from the McC. On5 July they responded that they would not accede to this request because: ... the urn is very old, extremely delicate and utterly irreplaceable. In our view, cricket fans ... would not forgive us if anything happened to harm this most historic and fragile of sporting artefacts ...",352,Representatives Main Committee

But I should not fret, because in the letter they did indicate to me that they have a crystal trophy modelled on the Ashes urn, which is now presented to the winner of each Ashes series. With all respect to the gentleman of the rarefied dining room at Lord’s, this response is inadequate and says more about why the English team is in such a parlous state than anything else. The fact is that, as I said in my letter to them in June, despite Australia and England having played for the ashes for 120 years and despite Australia having won the last seven-now eight-Ashes series in a row, the actual trophy has never left Lord’s. Even on the occasion of the Centenary Test in Melbourne in 1977 it was only seen fit to send a replica of the urn. ThisI believe is contrary to the spirit of the original gift made at Rupertswood, Sunbury, and is moreover contrary to the spirit of cricket itself. Even the New York Yacht Club, after its first defeat in the America’s Cup, saw fit to unbolt the trophy in 1983 after 132 years and deliver it to the new winner. There has been no respect shown to the Australian cricket team and the Australian public with respect to the Ashes. It is a sad reflection on the Marylebone Cricket Club. It is sad reflection on their lack of understanding about how important that urn is to the people of Australia. A ‘Return the urn’ cricket match is to be played on the original site where the urn was handed over on 24 December 1882. We are holding it on 22 December this year, the Sunday before Christmas. The game will be played between Rupertswood Cricket Club and the Abbotsford Anglers. It is about time that the English understood that this urn is something to be shared. It should be possessed by the winners. We have won the last eight series in a row and it is about time.

The matter involved trying to get an Australia Post post box installed at the Centenary Place Shopping Centre in the suburb of Riverhills, which is a very nice part of the electorate of Ryan. One of the reasons why a gentleman by the name of Walter Wood, who runs the Riverhills newsagency, contacted me was that during the previous 12 months a substantial number of people had raised the matter with him, as the proprietor of the local newsagency. They asked him, ‘Why isn’t there a post box here when there is clearly huge demand for one?’ I was delighted to be able to get in touch with Australia Post and make representations on behalf of those people in Riverhills. We put together a petition, and a considerable number of Ryan residents came together on the issue. They were delighted that the federal member for Ryan was able to contact them and meet them.

He has certainly given me feedback that the people that he has since spoken to have been very complimentary regarding the federal member for Ryan. In recent weeks a considerable number of residents in Toowong got in touch with me because Australia Post was again on the move. This time they were going to take away a post box, which seemed quite astonishing to me, considering that this post box was in a location that was very popular, particularly with elderly residents, many of whom used it. Again, as the new federal member for Ryan, with a great deal of enthusiasm, I contacted the local Australia Post people and asked them whether this was true. Indeed, it seemed to be in the pipeline, but through the good office that I hold-and it is a great privilege to hold it-as the new federal member for Ryan, I was delighted to be able to make representations on behalf of the people of Toowong, who represented to me very strongly that they did not want this post box taken away because it was used frequently by elderly people. It was strategically located so that elderly residents did not have too far to walk in order to post letters. This part of Toowong is a hilly area and it would have been very inappropriate-indeed disgraceful-if Australia Post had removed this post box. As the new federal member for Ryan, I had the great pleasure of getting in touch with Australia Post and making representations to them. I think that is what being a local member is all about. As a junior member of this parliament, I am delighted to see my friend and colleague the member for Flinders in the chamber. I know that he is doing a wonderful job in his electorate.

I have the pleasure of sitting next to him in the chamber, and I am delighted to say that we are working well together in this parliament and are representing our constituencies to the best of our abilities. Australia Post is certainly an agency that holds a very important place in our country. It is incumbent upon all members of this parliament, when they receive overtures from their constituents, to do the right thing by those constituents.

Interventions are not allowed at this stage. are well recorded and have been referred to the Independent Commission against Corruption in New South Wales. The hypocrisy in all of this can be found in the member for Paterson’s long-running campaign to protect the local environment and in particular plant life in that local area. In fact he has been the champion of urban housing guidelines which he is now contravening. His hypocrisy has caused local developers in the area to refer to the member for Paterson as ‘Bob the Builder’ because they feel there is one rule for them and another for local developers. But there is more, Mr Deputy Speaker. Following a story about Bob the Builder’s antics in the Daily Telegraph on 27 November, the member for Paterson had his lawyers fire out letters to the Newcastle Herald and the Port Stephens Examiner, warning against printing stories similar to that which appeared in the Daily Telegraph. In the letter, the member for Paterson’s lawyers claim that he has complied with his conditions of consent. This is despite the fact that the council’s general manager has publicly acknowledged that this is not true. As I said, the matter has been referred to ICAC and I and residents in the Paterson electorate eagerly await the outcome and the response of the council. The member for Paterson has been a pretty busy boy. In addition to his development activities he maintains a consultancy business, sits both in this place and on the Port Stephens council and until recently sat on the insurance inquiries and complaints board, appointed by Minister Hockey. I note that the member for Paterson informed the Clerk only this week of his departure from that board in November. I also note that until September, when I raised in this place the matter of his place on the council, the member for Paterson had not declared his position on the council on the register of members’ interests, nor had he declared the allowance he receives as a councillor on Port Stephens council. He had listed his position on the IEC, he had listed his consultancy, but somehow he failed to remember to list his position on the council. This raises questions about the member for Paterson’s concern about his eligibility to sit in this place under section 44 of the Constitution. There is a large body of legal opinion-it has not been tested in the High Court-that local government representatives do hold an office of profit under the Crown.

Roads: Safety by Mr and Mrs Elso of Palmerston Avenue in Dromana in my electorate of Flinders regarding road safety. Colin Elso is a fine example of a citizen who has identified a problem, acted on it and brought together a democratic coalition in order to achieve the outcome he seeks. Colin Elso and the residents of Palmerston Avenue and the neighbouring avenues are concerned about road safety on the Mornington Peninsula freeway between Dromana and Arthurs Seat. They face a series of challenges. VicRoads, which I respect as a body and which does great work, has nevertheless failed to maintain to an adequate, acceptable and respectable standard the roads, fencing and general area. Mr Elso and 180-plus residents have gathered to produce a petition. That petition calls upon VicRoads to fulfil its obligations to maintain that area. The principal concern is road safety for both the road users and the residents. Of concern to the residents is the significant number of holes, breakages and gaps in the fencing, all of which pose a risk of small children entering this busy freeway. The consequence of that could be a very real human tragedy. To give due respect to the petition, I read to the House the core concerns that the residents of Palmerston Avenue have in relation to the failure of VicRoads to uphold the full safety standards that you would expect along the Mornington Peninsula freeway between Dromana and Arthurs Seat. The residents note that they have the following problems: firstly, large branches that have fallen from trees either onto the road or in the immediate vicinity of the freeway; secondly, large amounts of rubbish against the fence and along the roadside edge; thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, numerous holes in the wire fencing along the edge of the freeway and along the Palmerston Avenue side-each of these is a potential point of access for small children to the freeway site-and, fourthly, as has been noted in the Age newspaper and various local newspapers recently, the increase in traffic along the Mornington Peninsula freeway over the last three years due to the increase in both permanent residents and temporary holiday makers on the Mornington Peninsula. The high speeds along these areas lead to a great deal of noise. Residents would like to decrease the speed so as to decrease the noise level. In respect of all of the above, the residents as ratepayers and as residents have petitioned VicRoads to reduce the noise levels and to provide a much safer environment for the many young children who reside in and around the area. Ultimately this is an example of community participation in helping to protect the safety of a community. Democracy is not an easy process. Communities do have to work to achieve the outcomes that they want. I commend Colin Elso, Mrs Elso and all of the residents of Palmerston Avenue and the neighbouring streets on their activism. I have made representations to the Chief Executive of VicRoads, Mr David Anderson.

800,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (12.55 P.m.),"I am delighted to support a representation made to me10618 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 Forestry: Management Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (1.00 p.m.)-In February last year the Gallop Labor government was elected in Western Australia, in part due to its policy of ceasing logging in old-growth forests. This is a matter that is very important to Western Australians and that they feel strongly about. With few areas of tall forest in WA, these relatively small but unique areas in our south-west are important to us. The world’s only jarrah, karri, tingle, wandoo, blackbutt and tuart forests grow there. The decisions we make with respect to logging and mining in these areas must be informed by careful evaluation to avoid wherever practicable serious or irreversible damage to the environment. It was an integral part of the WA Labor election commitment that a comprehensive industry assistance package worth $123 million would be provided to support the policy. This included $15 million promised by the Commonwealth as part of the original regional forest agreement. The WA state government has now increased its contribution to $136 million. The federal government, on the other hand, and in stark contrast, has reneged on its promise and is refusing to develop a joint approach with the state for the expenditure of these funds, at a time when they are most needed. The Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Mr Tuckey, and the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Senator Ian Macdonald, are dictating to WA the level at which jarrah yield should be set before they will consider releasing the funds. At a time when the pressures on the Australian environment continue to grow and communities are demanding that environmental values are taken into account there is no place for these tactics being employed by the federal government. Managing the activities of people in a way that conserves habitats, while sustaining resources and industries, is extraordinarily complex and difficult. Logging forests is not just about the wood or the trees. Frankly, neither Minister Tuckey nor Minister Macdonald can see either. To their credit, the Western Australian state government have established a robust and legitimate process whereby the WA Conservation Commission will determine appropriate yields. This process, which provides for public review under the relevant state legislation, will be open, transparent and involve the community. The WA Conservation Commission is responsible for the preparation of the proposed forest management plans. The new FMP, which will be implemented from 1 January 2004, will be referred for environmental impact assessment to the Environment Protection Authority. The WA government will stand behind the EPA assessment and make decisions on yield after they report. This process for determining the ecologically sustainable yield for our forests deserves the full support of the federal government, as do the local communities in the south-west, including the timber workers. For ministers Tuckey and Macdonald to be withholding funds to support this process and these people on the grounds that WA is not cutting down enough trees is environmental vandalism. Many environmental issues cut across industry and government portfolios, which means that responses need to be integrated and coordinated. Ecosystems and ecological processes are not sympathetic to political boundaries, election cycles or the timing of government budgets. The days of placing economic and political interests ahead of our environment are gone. Western Australians have spoken on this issue. Timber workers in the south-west of Western Australia are waiting for resources from the federal government, and ministers Tuckey and Macdonald should accept their decision, stop holding the people of my state to ransom and honour the promises that were made prior to the election. Thursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10619 I agree with Premier Gallop that their demand for Western Australia to increase our jarrah yield to the vicinity of 200,000 cubic metres before funds will be released is both disingenuous and environmentally irresponsible. In the interests of the community, not only in Western Australia as a whole but in particular in the communities in the south-west, many of which are dependent upon the timber industry, I urge the ministers to reconsider their position and to ensure that the $15 million that was promised prior to the federal election is released so that those communities can be supported having regard to the changes that are needed in our forest industry. Ministers Macdonald and Tuckey should reconsider their behaviour and stop acting so immaturely. In closing, I join with the members for Gilmore and Burke in recording my thanks to all the staff of the House. I convey my best wishes to them for the holiday season and for a peaceful new year. Forestry: Management Education: Murdoch University gional campus, I must answer the member for Hasluck. Geoff Gallop has not had the guts to go to Manjimup and speak to the timber workers. The timber workers in Manjimup and in the south-west forests region are without jobs. The Labor government have promised to deliver funding for these workers, but they have not delivered any money at all. They want the federal government’s money, yet they do not want a sustainable industry. They want an industry of 104,000 cubic metres of timber, yet they will not provide enough resources for these people to have jobs. It is an absolute disgrace. Geoff Gallop is an opportunist who has hoodwinked the workers of the south-west forests in the state. He should be ashamed of his disgraceful behaviour. He should show some guts and go to the south-west forests and visit these poor workers whose jobs he has taken. He does not care about workers; he is more interested in opportunism and the green side of the equation. There is no such thing as old-growth forests in the area that he is talking about. We are talking about forests that are 100 years old that have regrown. Old-growth forests are in a very small area around Manjimup. Yet in the area around my electorate of Canning-around Jarrahdale and Dwellingup-there are no oldgrowth forests. They are all regrown forests, yet Mr Gallop has locked these up away from the workers. In the couple of minutes I have left, I want to congratulate the federal government, which has recognised the importance of the Murdoch campus in the Peel region. After strong representations to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, this campus has been awarded, out of the government’s $42 million capital funding for universities, $2½ million for the establishment of capital works in the region. This region has almost 70,000 people, yet they do not have access to decent tertiary education. It is interesting that the member for Brand, who shares that part of the electorate with me, has made no representation on this issue. He has not tried to help the region in getting this facility for the area and, as a result, it took a visit on the ground from Brendan Nelson, the education minister, to see the need. It is really great that Murdoch University, headed by Professor John Yovich and supported by Professor Kateryna Longley, has been a part of securing this project for the region on behalf of the Peel Development Commission. Not only is there a huge need for education for young people in the area; there is also a very large youth unemployment level in this region, thought to be up 35 per cent. This government is delivering for the region. Ultimately, this project is going to cost something like $4.6 million or $4.7 million, but I feel very sure that",357,Representatives Main Committee
801,Mr Randall (Canning) (1.05 P.m.),"BeforeI speak about the funding for the Peel re10620 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 the balance of this program will be delivered by the minister next year. The $2½ million allows this university to begin. What is going to be built as a result of this? There is going to be online education through three 80-seat video communications rooms, three 30-seat breakout rooms and one multipurpose laboratory and office for technicians, administrators and academic staff. It is going to be shared jointly with the Challenger TAFE, which is good dual use of learning facilities. The university learning centre will also have video and electronic communication links through Rockingham and Kwinana to the Murdoch campus for online access to courses, learning and resources. The Peel region, as I said, has persistently high youth unemployment and also 14 per cent general unemployment. This is a great delivery to my electorate. It is the federal government going into the regions and providing education for those most in need. It is moving away from being city centric, where the larger universities tend to gobble up all the capital and cash. Finally, we are taking education to the areas of need and to the people who need it, particularly the young people in my region. I am very pleased to be part of a government that has recognised this and is doing this. Mayor Keith Holmes of the City of Mandurah is excited about it. The Peel Development Corporation, the local government authorities and the education authorities in the region are very excited. Most of all, the young people are excited and happy. (Time expired) National Security parliament rises, I would like to wish everyone here a very happy Christmas and a prosperous new year. I wish the same for Australia and particularly for the people in my electorate of Braddon. I would like to speak about my electorate today. On6 November 2001, I wrote to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, about the absence of airport security at the local airports at Burnie and Devonport in my electorate. This followed in the tragic wake of September 11, 2001. Since that time, with basically no reply from the minister, I have raised this issue in the House. This has occurred whilst we have had a continual gradient of terrorist alerts and security alerts and also budgetary expenditure on increasing security for airports. Do not for a moment think that I do not recognise the need to secure our major domestic airports in terms of both their international capacity and their domestic capacity. During this time, with this increased gradient of security measures-and we are currently on an aircraft security alert, we are being asked to be vigilant-nothing has been done about the airports at Burnie and Devonport. This is despite this campaign from not just me but the state government, my local communities and also our regional media, which have taken up this case. So yesterday I waited with eager anticipation-after my unforgivable outburst in the House the other day in questioning the minister; and mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa on that-for the Deputy Prime Minister’s National Press Club comments about airport security. I waited to get my questions clarified. I was none the wiser after hearing those comments. I share that with members of the other side. In question time, I pitter-pattered over to sit with some of my parliamentary colleagues on the other side to ask them how they interpreted the Deputy Prime Minister’s message at the National Press Club and, lo and behold, we were all scratching our heads because we could not understand what he said. The press reported: All airports that handle scheduled jet operations will have to conduct passenger and carry-on baggage screening, the federal government announced today. Fair enough. The report continued:",359,Representatives Main Committee
802,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (1.10 P.m.),"In case I do not get another chance beforeThursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10621 Transport Minister John Anderson said that included propellor-driven planes, thus affecting some regional airports. Burnie and Devonport have turboprops and I said, ‘Hello, this is interesting. It looks like we might get a bit of an upgrade here.’ The report went on to say: The government will also mandate screening for passengers and carry-on baggage where the airport operator or airline requests itin other words, ‘We’ll tell you that you’ve got to do it if you ask us to.’ What does that mean? I asked colleagues on the other side, because they obviously are far more in tune with the minister and they boast that they have regional seats, and they did not have a clue. The report continued: It will also introduce 100 per cent checked bag screening for all international services by the end of 2004. Well, whoopy-do, fantastic, that is great. Then you ask how much it is going to cost, and the conservative estimate is $180 million. Where is that money going to come from? ‘It won’t be a tax. Maybe it’ll be a levy. Maybe it’ll be a $5 a ticket levy.’ I worked out that, conservatively, about 170,000 people use Burnie and Devonport airports and at five bucks each-and I am not too good at maths-that is about $850,000. Will that money then go into this mandated security system that we begged the Deputy Prime Minister for and we have to pay for? This is national security we are talking about. It is a federal responsibility, and we want assistance for this. NowI am told, ‘There is not much of a threat around your way, so we will not mandate it at all.’ If there is no threat around our way, why on earth are we asked to be vigilant? Why are we on a terrorist alert nearly every second day? You are talking about a security chain and a link in that chain, but where there is no security there is no link. It seems to me quite extraordinary that we have this bumbling, confused, nonsensical comment from the minister. When you ask for clarification, you hear, ‘Well, it is a secret; it is security.’ it is not good enough and we will fight on. (Time expired) Mitchell Electorate: Bushfires have been really serious. I want to describe to the House the commitment of firefighters, the dedication of volunteers, some of the tragedies that have occurred and some of the follow-on that will occur after the fires. The fires started and travelled at a rate of roughly 10 kilometres an hour through rugged country and eucalyptus bush. Lawns that appeared to be devoid of grass because they were cut so short actually burned with flames a foot high. The intensity of the heat, the dryness of the environment, and the fuel load that was on the forest floor created circumstances that have not been seen in known memory of bushfires in that area. The speed with which the fires travelled, the intensity of the heat and the significance of the burn was such that there were ember showers throwing thousands of embers hundreds of yards ahead of the actual flames, and spot fires were starting a kilometre or two ahead of the actual fire front. We tragically had a loss of two lives-one directly related to the fire and one indirectlyand a number of injuries. Thirty-two homes in my electorate were lost, and a larger number across the whole area were lost. The scale of the burn was roughly 50 kilometres by 50 kilometres across the north and west of Sydney, on the fringes of the city, with the real risk, if there had been a wind change at a certain point last Sunday, that the fire front would have swept deeply into the suburbs of the north of Sydney-into Glenhaven, Annangrove, Kenthurst, Galston and Dural, across to Hornsby, Hornsby Heights and Wahroonga and right",360,Representatives Main Committee

Fortunately, the wind and weather conditions changed and the fire has been brought under control. There were approximately 1,500 firefighters engaged in the event. In addition to those firefighters, something over 200 firefighting units were out continuously. In addition to that, there were the volunteers of the State Emergency Service-a great organisation-doing traffic control and giving backup to the fire services, going out into dangerous areas to provide sustenance to the firefighters so they could stay on the job. In addition to that, in the fire centre at Kenthurst, which the Prime Minister visited last Sunday, we had working side by side the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, who were in charge of the process, under Mr John Hojel; the SES, as I have said; the New South Wales Police; the New South Wales Fire Brigade; the ambulance people; local government authorities; St John’s; and VAD. All of those organisations related to bringing this emergency under control were working side by side in cells, managing their particular responsibilities in a unique and intense circumstance, but with great cooperation and goodwill. I know that the volunteers supporting this process included elements from local Red Cross branches, the Country Women’s Association and local churches. People just dropped things to come to the centre to cut sandwiches, prepare food and do anything possible to comfort families who had lost their homes, including providing accommodation and support. There were hundreds of individuals involved, and I want to pay tribute to them. Our community is going to pay tribute to these volunteers and firefighters on 26 February. We are going to gather at the Dural Country Club and pay tribute to these people who were involved. I would also like to mention Ben, a 14-year-old volunteer who was there day in, day out, doing a great job; and Allison, a part-time worker in the fire centre, who whinged so much they eventually gave her a uniform to fit her out like a traditional firefighter.

A lot of us lead very dislocated lives, coming from different parts of Australia to participate in the national life of this great parliament. It would not be possible without the incredible support that we get in all of the multifaceted ways from various staff. SoI begin my remarks by thanking them and wishing them all a merry Christmas and a happy new year. I hope that we all have a peaceful one. That brings me to the gist of my remarks. Some weeks ago the opposition foreign affairs and defence committee met with a former ambassador for disarmament, Richard Butler. He has played a leading and very praiseworthy role over the years in that area, particularly on the elimination and non-proliferation of chemical and biological weapons, which Australia led under former foreign minister Gareth Evans. Ambassador Butler told members of the opposition-and I am sure these views are reflected amongst members of the government, too-that, whatever one’s views on policy with Iraq, he had been there many times and he had studied the situation of the people of Iraq, and he said that none of us in this great democratic parliament should have any illusions about the regime in Baghdad. He said, as many people have, that this regime is one of the worse violators of human rights in world. When speaking on the various policy options that we have-including the opposition’s policy, which all of us support, that, if there is to be action against Iraq, we should have United Nations action approved by the Security Council-we should all preface our remarks by underlining what an appalling regime exists in Iraq.",361,Representatives Main Committee
804,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (1.20 P.m.),"On this last day of the sitting of the HouseThursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10623 I feel at this time that someone must speak up on behalf of the millions of people in Iraq who are being murdered or tortured all of the time. It is all very well for people simply to focus on what might happen if there is a military conflict. People made very exaggerated scenarios when it came to Afghanistan. We do not want a military conflict, but, if it does come, the opposition says that it must come with a United Nations Security Council approval. But let us be under no illusions. Let us not create the Potemkin villages with Iraq that some people used to create in regard to the former Soviet Union. Saddam’s regime practises genocide against the Kurdish people in Iraq. The infamous Anfal campaign, on which I have an answer from the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Notice Paper today, killed over 100,000 Kurdish people in a deliberate act of genocide. It included the use of poison gas against civilians. This dreadful Baathist regime is best outlined in the great work on modern Iraq by the great Iraqi scholar at Brandeis University, Professor Kanan Makiya, called Republic of Fear. Unfortunately, I appear to be the only parliamentarian to have read it since June 2000. Makiya describes the Stalinesque regime that exists in Baghdad and its systematic killing of all kinds of political opponents, including radical opposition such as the Communist Party. A majority of Iraqis also live in total fear. The Iraqi regime does have a relationship with terrorists. President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia did say that Mohamed Atta definitely did meet with Iraqi intelligence officers prior to September 11. This does not prove that Iraq was involved in September 11 but we should have no illusions. In Kurdistan at the moment the Kurds will tell you that the Iraqi service is working very closely with an al-Qaeda aligned group in Kurdistan to upset the great democracy that is spreading in that northern region, with 30 free newspapers and great human rights. Let us have no illusions about Iraq. (Time expired) Murray Electorate: Drought Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (1.25 p.m.)-I would like to spend the next four minutes putting on the record in this place some details of an extraordinary circumstance affecting my electorate of Murray right now, and that is the failure of the irrigation system. For the first time in 100 years we have been faced with a situation where Eildon Dam is virtually not able to deliver any more water and we have had the lowest inflows in 102 years to the Goulburn, Loddon, Campaspe and Broken rivers. The great Goulburn, Loddon and Murray valleys are of course the food bowl of Australia. In the Goulburn system we are looking at less than 50 per cent of water allocation in an area where farms have been built to use 120 to 150 per cent, and more, of water allocation. In the case of the dairy industry this has meant that some 10,000 animalshighly valuable dairy cows-have so far been slaughtered or agisted to other parts of the state. Besides the loss of income, which is obvious when you have some 30 per cent or more of your milking cows removed from your property, there is also the loss of a whole generation of young people-the trainees and apprentices who are no longer able to work in the dairy industry and who may go to cities and other parts of Australia. One of the things that we want to ensure is that the trainees and apprentices in the horticultural and dairy industries understand that there is a future-to reassure them that after every drought it rains, and indeed every flood subsides. I am therefore so glad that yesterday, and in the last 48 hours, our Prime Minister announced a new scheme to assist, called Drought Force, where young people who are facing unemployment because of the drought can still work on local properties and continue their training-not leave the region-and have financial support. I also want to put on the record my extraordinary thanks to the effort of groups, often of women, that are putting together special days out for the women who are holding up in these 10624 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 December 2002 very sad and difficult circumstances, day in and day out-looking at which cattle to cull and which employees to let go. They have special days where they have, say, hairdressing or financial counselling. It is a time to sit down and talk together. There are now days out being organised for men to try and relieve some of the frustration and despair that these farming families are feeling. I want to commend the work of Centrelink in our regions. The staff in Echuca, Shepparton and Swan Hill are taking the brunt of visits from many anxious, frustrated and despairing families, with both new customers and clients who are coming back with greater problems than they have ever had before. They are bearing up in the most magnificent way. We have got donated fodder pouring into the area at the moment. I want to thank those who have donated that fodder and to note that we have had the tragedy of several fires in the last few days as a result of the instantaneous combustion of green fodder, cut too early, which does have that combustion potential. So thousands of bales have been lost in the last few days. But the announcement that exceptional circumstances relief will be delivered into this region is going to give a number of people a happier Christmas. It will not help them in the year to come when they have to work out how to buy back and reinstate their dairy herds-animals costing between $1,500 and $2,000 each-when their levels of debt are now so extraordinary. But at least between now and, we hope, an autumn break to the drought there are more families with more hope as a result of the nearly $1 billion of drought support that this government has put into the system-the biggest support that this country has ever seen for drought impact. Finally, I commend the work of the Bureau of Meteorology, which not only helps with situations like the bushfires in Sydney we just heard about but also has been trying its hardest to help farmers and the industries that depend on farming to understand what the El Nino means, and what the likelihood is for the autumn break so that those affected can make the most rational decisions about investments for the future. SoI commend the Bureau of Meteorology most heartily. Let me say, too, that I have sympathy for the associated businesses-for example, the transport operators, the hairdressers, the shoe sellers and the people who produce fodder in these regions who have no crops; all of them are going to be helped a little through the new EC special criteria. They too suffer, just like the primary producers, and we must never forget them because they make up the rest of the economy in rural and regional Australia, all of which is dependent on the seasons. ment of the Main Committee for the final occasion this year, I would join with a number of members who have spoken throughout this debate in placing on record the gratitude of members of the Main Committee to all those who enable this place to function-the attendants, Hansard, the sound and vision office, the clerks at the table and all the others who work behind the scenes in such places as the Table Office, the Assistant PLO, security, and others that I have not enumerated.",362,Representatives Main Committee
805,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Jenkins),"Before putting the question for the adjournThursday, 12 December 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 10625 The Main Committee is a great success. It frees up the legislative logjams and, as has been exemplified today, it gives private members additional opportunities to ventilate their views. This cannot be achieved without the flexibility that is shown by not only members but all those who assist the Main Committee. I think that on this occasion we should place that on record. Main Committee adjourned at 1.32 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Indigenous Affairs: Native Title (Question No. 969) Mr Gibbons asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 14 October 2002: (1) What is the status of the Yorta Yorta land claim in Victoria. (2) Has his attention been drawn to Justice Olney’s statement that the Yorta Yorta people’s traditional laws and any real observance of their traditional customs had not survived European settlement and the tide of history had washed away the native title claim. (3) What has been the impact of this statement on the Yorta Yorta land claim. (4) What is the impact of this statement on any subsequent native title claims. (1) I understand that in his question upon notice Mr Gibbons is referring to the application for a determination of native title under the Native Title Act 1993 by the Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community (‘the Yorta Yorta claimants’). In the Federal Court on 18 December 1998, Justice Olney determined that native title does not exist in relation to the claim area.1 The Yorta Yorta claimants appealed his decision to the Full Federal Court. That appeal was dismissed by a majority of the Full Court.2 The Yorta Yorta claimants then applied for, and were granted, special leave to appeal to the High Court. The appeal was heard on 23 and 24 May 2002. The judgment of the High Court was reserved. (2) I am aware that the December 1998 judgment of Justice Olney contained the following passage: The facts in the case lead inevitably to the conclusion that before the end of the 19th century the ancestors through whom the claimants claim title had ceased to occupy their traditional lands in accordance with their traditional laws and customs. The tide of history has indeed washed away any real acknowledgement of their traditional laws and any real observance of their traditional customs. The foundation of the claim to native title in relation to the land previously occupied by those ancestors having disappeared, the native title rights and interests previously enjoyed are not capable of revival.3 (3) The consequences of the findings of Justice Olney (reflected in the passage quoted above, and elsewhere in his reasons for decision ) led him to find against the Yorta Yorta claimants’ application for a determination of native title and determine instead that native title does not exist in relation to the areas of land and waters claimed by them. As a consequence, the Yorta Yorta claimants appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court, but the appeal was dismissed. The applicants then appealed to the High Court. The High Court’s judgment is reserved. (4) The specific findings of Justice Olney in the Yorta Yorta case are particular to that case. Whether a similar finding is open in other cases depends on the evidence adduced in those cases. That said, the principles of law that underpinned Justice Olney’s findings were the subject of argument in the High Court appeal. Accordingly, the potential impact of Justice Olney’s finding on other applications for determinations of native title depends on the outcome of the High Court’s consideration of the appeal heard in May 2002. The decision of the High Court will be binding on all Federal Court judges making native title determinations in the future. ------------1 Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria and others, Federal Court (Olney J), unreported, 18 December 1998 (matter number VG 6001 of 1995). 2 Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria (2001) 110 FCR 244; (2001) 180 ALR 655. 3 Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria and others, Federal Court (Olney J), unreported, 18 December 1998 (matter number VG 6001 of 1995), paragraph 129.",364,Representatives Main Committee
806,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Finance and Administration: Superannuation (Question No. 1052) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 22 October 2002: (1) With respect to the Minister’s Department and each agency for which the Minister is responsible, what is the total number of (a) male and (b) female staff.

Foreign Affairs: Church Property in Romania (Question No. 1075) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 11 November 2002: (1) Has his attention been drawn to international articles concerning the restoration of Roman Catholic and Greek Catholic church property in Romania. (2) Has the Australian Government received advice on this matter from the (a) Romanian Government, (b) US Government, (c) Roman Catholic church, (d) Greek Catholic (Melkite) church and (e) Romanian Orthodox churches; if so, what was that advice. (3) If no advice has been received, will he obtain advice from these and any other relevant authorities with respect to (a) the Greek Catholic community being less successful than any other group in regaining its properties, (b) recent events in Ocna Mures, Romania, (c) the estimated 2,012 Romanian Catholic churches handed over to the Orthodox Church and the petition of 160 of those churches’ right to share in the use of a further 227 other parish churches that were in Catholic hands, (d) that to date, only six Churches have been handed back to Catholic Parishes and not one petition for joint use of a parish church has been accepted and (e) the restoration of the monastery at Nicula. (4) Will he make representation to the Romanian Government through its diplomatic mission in Australia on these issues and call on the Romanian Government to honour its constitutional and international obligations in ensuring that religious freedom prevails through the restoration of these properties to their rightful former owners; if so, when; if not, why not. My attention has been drawn to the issue of the restitution of Roman Catholic and Greek Catholic Church property in Romania, including the restitution of buildings, agricultural lands, churches and related properties. I note the background information provided to me by Mr John Murphy MP, in his letter dated 31 October 2002. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has also obtained further information and advice from the Australian Ambassador to Romania, who has also engaged the Romanian Government in informal discussions on the matter. On the basis of this information, it is my understanding that the Romanian Government has undertaken, through the adoption of legislation, to return property taken from these churches during the communist period. In 2001, a legal framework was adopted to facilitate the restitution of buildings. Similar measures have been taken regarding the restoration of agricultural lands and the Romanian Government has set itself the target of restituting 90 per cent of agricultural lands and forests by the end of 2002. In July 2002, the Romanian Parliament adopted legislation that clarified the process of restituting property confiscated from churches, however churches themselves were not included. In relation to this, the Romanian Government has stated it would prefer that the Romanian Orthodox and the Romanian Catholic Churches find a mutually agreeable solution. The matter is currently being examined by the European Commission in the context of Romania’s accession to the European Union. The Commission’s 2002 Regular Report details the progress made but finds that it has been “hindered by weak administration and the absence of implementing legislation”. It also notes the absence of a legal framework for the restitution of churches. The Commission states that Romania needs to implement further judicial reform and improve legislative processes. Given these are internal matters and there are significant domestic sensitivities, the Australian Government does not intend to make representations to the Romanian government on this issue. Immigration: Asylum Seekers (Question No. 1115) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 14 November 2002: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 692 (Hansard, 23 September 2002, page 6806) concerning crew members of foreign ships entering Australia, has his Department considered tightening the checking of all crew on foreign vessels entering Australia since 11 September 2001; if so, what changes have been or will be made. (2) On what date did shipping companies become liable for the cost of detention and removal of crew who desert their vessels and become unlawful non-citizens in Australia. (1) As indicated in my response to question 692, the Australian Customs Service (ACS) checks details of all crew and passengers on each ship entering Australia against ACS and DIMIA alert lists and reports to DIMIA if there are any persons of concern on the ship. Following the events of September 11, 2001 Parliament passed the Border Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 which amended the Migration Act 1958 to enable DIMIA to require airline and ship operators to provide advance passenger and crew information. DIMIA is working towards the implementation of this. Additional resources have been provided to DIMIA’s regional officers to enable closer supervision of checking procedures at seaports. (2) The Navigation Act 1912 at s186 provides that the Commonwealth may recover from the owner, agent or master of a ship expenses incurred in sending a seaman who did not depart with his ship to a place outside Australia. This provision has been in force since 1958. foreign Affairs: International Court of Justice (Question No. 1120) 2002:",367,Commonwealth Grants Commission

The Australian Government welcomes the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s draft settlement plan to resolve the long-standing dispute on Cyprus, which was presented to the Greek Cypriot leader, Mr Glafcos Clerides, and the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr Rauf Denktash, on 11 November 2002. The Government shares the United Nations Secretary-General’s hope that this initiative will help the parties to focus on the decisions that they should take in order to bring about a settlement to the Cyprus dispute. The Government is pleased that both Mr Clerides and Mr Denktash have resumed proximity talks aimed at negotiating a comprehensive settlement. At this important time, we urge all parties to make every effort to bring about an end to the division of Cyprus. The Australian Government continues to support the United Nations Secretary-General in his efforts to achieve a just and lasting solution to the Cyprus dispute that meets the needs of all Cypriots. The Australian Government’s appointment of a Special Envoy for Cyprus underlines its deep concern about the long-standing division of Cyprus. To this end, the Australian Special Envoy for Cyprus, the Hon. Jim Short, remains engaged in support of the efforts of the Secretary-General. Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Board Membership (Question No. 1168) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 3 December 2002: (1) Is the Minister aware of the numerous recent media reports that the former Liberal Party Member for Flinders and Defence Minister in the 39th Australian Parliament is reported to be the next person in line to be appointed to the Board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). (2) Is the Minister aware of criticism of the politicisation over the years, by both sides of politics, of Government appointments to the ABC. (3) Will the Minister immediately rule out the possibility of Mr Reith being appointed to the ABC; if not, why not. (4) For the purposes of future appointments to the ABC Board, will the Minister adopt the Nolan rules model of the Blair Government in its appointments to the BBC’s Board of Governors; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) Claims of politicisation of the ABC Board were considered by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee Inquiry into ABC Board appointments, entitled Above Board? Methods of Appointment to the ABC Board that was tabled on 25 September 2001. The Government considers that the Chair’s report failed to substantiate its statement that there is a widespread public perception that appointments to the ABC board are made on the basis of political affiliation. Opposition Senators noted that no one was able “to provide proof demonstrating that the [ABC] board has acted in a politically partisan manner.”",370,Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board Css Public Sector Superannuation Scheme Board Pss
