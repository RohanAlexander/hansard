One sees that that tax cuts apply from I November and that the infamily is $3.04 worse off, or if they rented their crease in family allowances does not apply until I house, $7.02 a week worse off. So much for this November, one sees that a family, such as the family Budget. This is no family Budget which Treasurer describes, for the full year 1982-83 as gives great hand-outs to families. This is a Budget against the previous year, has real tax cuts of only which gives nothing to the majority of families. $2.03.
