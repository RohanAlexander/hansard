A Herald-Sun editorial of 19 June, entitled It is obvious that what many of those news'An incentive to learn more' best sums up paper editorials and the media community, what this government is trying to achieve.

It some cases, young people are paid more to stay on is an income support payment to around the dole than to go on Austudy. This absurdity 560,000 young people, including students and ignores the reality that young people with the least education face the biggest hurdle in getting jobs. those looking for work.
