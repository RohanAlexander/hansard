3,Mr Townley,"The latest inforAustralian delegation to the conference on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is Mr J. Tonkin, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. Whatever Mr those #overnmenta Tonkin says at that conference is said in accordance with instructions given to him by this Government. In a speech to the conference, he has drawn attention to the fact that certain concessions to Australia by the United States of America which were negotiated at the 1947 conference, have not, in fact, ibeen made available to Australia. He has spoken about that ' matter in quite positive language, and he has been followed hy a number of delegates of other countries, particularly countries interested in the sale of dairy products to. the United States of America. Mr Tonkin has not used the word "" r e t a l i a t i o n T h a t is in accordance with instructions. I have said in this chamber, speaking on behalf of the Government, that if, as an outcome of the inquiry by the American tariff committee into duties upon imported wool, the concession that was negotiated in 1947 in respect of duties upon Australian wool were reversed, the Australian Government would have seriously to re-examine the whole position. the Minister for Supply say whether the assets of the Commonwealth Handling Equipment Pool have been offered to certain private undertakings, including the Master Carriers Association of New South Wales, and that those undertakings have been given one week in which to make application for the purchase of the assets ? If that be so, does such action indicate ihat State Government instrumentalities and departments, as well as local government and wharf organizations, to wbich the equipment was offered first, have signified their lack of interest in the acquisition of the equipment and thereby, have shown their satisfaction with the present control of the equipment by the Commonwealth Handling Equipment Pooli that letters were written to the various State governments offering them some equipment from the pool. Replies have been received from some, if not all, of o n their own behalf or on behalf of the boards and instrumentalities under their control. I cannot tell the honourable member any more about the matter from memory, but I do not think that the assertions he has made are eorrect. However, I Bhall have the matter investigated and let the honorable gentleman have a reply to his question. Minister say whether it is correct that the Queensland Government has at last agreed to join in the Commonwealth's hospital scheme? If so, are there any new terms or conditions in the agreement arrived at which were not available .to the Queensland Government in the original proposal ? Finally, is there any justification for the Queensland Premiers claim that he has had a win at the expense of this Government, or is his statement to that effect simply an attempt to cover up the mistake that his Government made in not accepting the scheme when it was originally proposed ? Government has agreed to join in the federal hospital scheme, but the agreement arrived at includes no new terms or conditions-that were not available to the Queensland Government in the original proposal. Thc Commonwealth has always been willing to execute such an agreement with the Queensland Government, provided that Government made satisfactory arrangements to increase hospital revenue in Queensland. I have now received an assurance from the Queensland Premier that the allocation of beds in public hospitals in Queensland will he varied to enable hospital revenue to be increased. In view of the compliance by the Queensland Government with the Commonwealth's basic stipulations, it has now been possible to conclude a fresh agreement. In order that the people of Queensland will not be deprived of the benefits made available by tbe Oommonwealth as a result of the tardiness of the",13,Employment

The Commonwealth has proposed that the agreement shall tion of the Minister for Immigration to operate with retrospective effect to the the fact that Canada, which is one of the 21st August last, the previous agreement most prosperous and expanding countries having expired on the 20th August last. the Treasurer on the explanatory notes Canada's experience, will the Minister on the Income Tax and Social Services consider the desirability for Australia to Assessment Bill (No. 3), at page 39, one have an assimilation period in which the paragraph of which begins as follows:One view, upon which many income tax immigrants here will be spent in order to assessments have heen based, was that the assist to effect the thorough absorption in transfer of interests in partnership assets, the community of those persons who have including trading stock, amounted to a. conalready arrived in this country? structive disposal of those assets. The following paragraph begins:A contrary view is that section 30, as at present enacted, does not apply to the transfer of a fractional interest in trading stock . . . I direct the Treasurer's attention to the fact that what is called, in the first of those two paragraphs, a "" view"", is, in fact, the practice of the Commissioner of Taxation; and what is called a "" view "" in the second paragraph is, in fact, a decision of the High Court in the Rose case. I ask the right honorahle gentleman, first, why phrases are used in that explanatory note which can only he deliberately designed to conceal the facts from the Parliament; secondly, why no reference is made in the notes to the Rose case, although it underlies some of the amendments; and thirdly, whether the Treasurer will take steps to ensure that the reasons for the amendments are in the future accurately explained. know whether or not the question is in order, hecause that matter is before the House. question, and I can assure the right honorahle gentleman that it is in order. place the honourable member's complaint before the Commissioner of Taxation. There is neither design nor attempt to conceal the faets of the case, particularly the underlying factors with regard to the Rose case. I can assure the honourable gentleman on that point. However, I shall have the matter clarified. in the world, has found it necessary practically to suspend its immigration programme, hecause the future employment moneys now heing expended on bringing the reference of the honourable member for Mitchell to the situation in Canada. I visited that country not long ago, and had the pleasure of talks with the Minister for Immigration in that great dominion. If I recall precisely the information that he gave me, it was to the effect that Canada would be taking nearly 190,000 immigrants this year, and was planning to take approximately 200,000 next year. He and I discussed the, relative employment situations in Canada and Australia, and I was interested to learn that although Canada, partly as the result of seasonal factors, had a much higher degree of unemployment than Australia, that dominion was pushing ahead with its immigration programme, realizing the great strength that it was giving to the Canadian economy, and the developmental addition that was being being made to the resources of that country. The Australian immigration programme was examined earlier this year by the Government when the budget was under consideration, and a public statement of the proposals for the ensuing twelve months was made. A good deal of misconception exists among the puhlic ahout the composition of the programme. When we state an all-round figure, it is erroneously assumed that it relates to the number of breadwinners. Actually, only a small proportion of the total number of immigrants consists of the persons who compete for jobs. The other immigrants are wives and dependent",14,Healt H And Medical Services

14,Mr Holt,"I am surprised to hearchildren. One of the criticisms of our immigration policy in the past has been that it has an inflationary effect. The critics cannot very well have it both ways. If the immigration programme has an inflationary effect, it normally creates work opportunities and does not deprive people of them. I ask the Minister for Immigration concerns a British immigrant who came to Australia about a year ago, later attended the so-called peace conference at Peking, is now stranded there, and is appealing to Australians to subscribe an amount of £120 in order to bring her back to Australia. Is the background of such immigrants carefully scrutinized by the Department of Immigration before they come to Australia, and can they be returned to their native country if they engage in treasonable activities in their adopted country? aware that the procedures adopted in relation to British subjects are not the same as those that apply to foreign nationals who come to Australia to settle. Circumstances such as those to which the honourable member has referred have not been presented to me previously. I shall examine the f u ll implications of the story as he has told it. for Air inform me whether the Department of Air and the Department of Civil Aviation have yet reached an agreement on the safety factor involved in the establishment of a civil aerodrome at Hexham, near Newcastle? Has the special committee which was appointed to investigate that matter, met recently? If it has met recently, can the Minister inform me of its recommendation? have been addressed more appropriately to the Minister acting for the Minister for Civil Aviation but as the Department of Air has taken part in the negotiations, I consider that I am in a position to give the honourable gentleman an answer. The approach of the Department of Air to this problem has been that, although it is undesirable to establish a civil airport at Hexham, it is of the opinion that a civil airport can be established there, provided that the closest liaison is maintained between the Department of Civil Aviation and the Royal Australian Air Force. I think that the authorities concerned have come to the conclusion that, if agreement can be achieved, and land lines can be laid between Hexham and Williamtown, they will consent to the use of Hexham as a civil airport. I have the full report on the matter in my oflice, and shall make it available to the honourable member for Newcastle if he desires to examine it. acting for the Minister for Civil Aviation aware that a recording apparatus records precisely conversations that take place between pilots of commercial aircraft and officers in the control tower that relate to landing instructions? Will he ascertain whether it is a fact that in respect of two important incidents, one involving an Ansett DC3 aircraft and the other a DC4 aircraft at Mascot, a f u l l record of such air to ground conversations does not exist? question that the honourable member has asked to rhy colleague and obtain a reply as soon as possible. DRIE D FRUITS. Minister for Commerce and Agriculture a question concerning the dried fruits industry. By way of explanation, I bring to his notice the apprehension felt amongst producers of dried fruits at the recent action of the British Government in purchasing 50,000 tons of raisins from the United States at the comparatively low price of £52 a ton. In view of the fact that American dried fruits are heavily subsidized, and that the United Kingdom is Australia's principal export market, will the Minister make representations to the British Government in this respect during his forthcoming visit to London? sold in the forthcoming season in the terms of the existing contract with the",15,Immigeation

Earlier, I myself, and our official negotiators, put to the Minister for Food and his officials that the opporof entering into an arrangement with the tunity of the British Government to buy cheap American subsidized raisins should not be quoted against us in our negotiations about price. I am glad to say that during the last two years that argument has been accepted, and we have in fact received a price for our raisins that is almost double the price paid by the United Kingdom to the United States of America for subsidized raisins. So long as our price is not prejudiced it is not our line to urge that the United Kingdom should not avail itself of cheap food wherever it is available. I shall certainly go on producing irrespective of market be insistent, so far as I have any influence, on maintaining our right of entry to the United Kingdom and the benefits of the preferential tariff that we Australian Fruit growers Association. enjoy there. for Social Services aware that payment of age and invalid pensions falls due on Christmas Day? Will he arrange early payment of these pensions, and advise honourable members, with the least possible delay, of the day on which payment will be made? When examining this matter, will he give consideration to a special Christmas grant to pensioners to allow them to enjoy the festive season? sion pay day falling on Christmas Day has been brought to my attention, and my department is now discussing with the postal authorities, who make most of the pension payments, the day that will be most suitable as pension pay day. In regard to the second part of the honourable member's question, I inform him tliat recently the Government increased age and invalid pensions by 7s. 6d. a week, which sum will be far more than the amount that could be made available by a special grant for Christmas. There is no provision in the Social Services Consolidation Act under which such a Commerce and Agriculture inform the payment could be made. addressed to the Minister for Commerce particularly frui t and vegetables, have to be grown before they oan be processed, will the Minister explore the possibility British Ministry of Food so that an advance estimate might he made of the quantities of canned foods likely to be required in any one year, to enable producers to plan in advance a production programme to meet the demand, and thus avoid a repetition of the crisis of scarcity which preceded the outbreak of World War II .? fruits rather than canned vegetables, such fruits are the product of orchards which conditions. Yesterday I received a deputation in Melbourne from the Australian Canners Association and the That deputation followed one on the same subject a few weeks earlier, in which co-operative canners, private canners and growers joined in asking that I should request the Ministry of Food to agree to a long-term contract for the purchase of Australian canned fruits, stipulating particularly the quantities that the Ministry would take in each year of the contract. I have informed all the interested parties who have approached me in this regard that I will discuss the matter with the Ministry of Food and report back to Cabinet in due course. The desirability of there being an assured market for a product, such as that of a tree, which occurs annually, is obvious to every one. We have had discussions with the British Ministry of Food with respect to its requirements of canned vegetables, in the event of war occurring, in conjunction with other defence exploratory talks that have been proceeding. But in time of peace, when purchases are not made in bulk, the Ministry's requirements are not either predictable by it or within its control.

COAL. aware that a crisis has arisen in the coal-mining industry in Tasmania and that unemployment is imminent because the consumption of coal in that State is lagging behind production which, at present, is a record ? Has the Tasmanian Government asked this Government to assist it in meeting this problem? If no such request has been received, will the Government help Tasmania in its search for markets for its coal outside of that State even, if possible, in Pakistan as the Tasmanian Minister for Mines has suggested ? matter that the honourable member has raised with the Minister for National Development. that Australia's overseas balance increased by the satisfactory figure of £10,000,000 during last week, I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government will consider easing the restrictions on imports of raw materials that are required by Australian industries. very closely the progress of events that are related to our overseas balance because, as the honourable member is aware, we have no desire to continue beyond the necessary point of time the present restrictions either in full or even in part. But I think that it would be premature to come to a conclusion based on the figures in respect of one month. ' We have been hoping that our overseas balance would improve because it is necessary that we should have a strong overseas balance. We shall watch the whole matter closely, having regard to the idea that the honourable member has put forward. Social Services aware that certain Melbourne estate agents are advertising in the "" Houses and Land for Sale"" columns of daily newspapers inviting ex-servicemen to arrange purchases of vacant properties under the War Service Homes Act through them? Is he also aware that negotiations with some of these agents have elicited the misleading assertions by the said agents that they receive preferential treatment from the War Service Homes Division, that their contacts with the department assure speedy decisions on applications for loans, and that their experience in planning means a saving to prospective purchasers? As all of these claims are without foundation will the Minister publish a disclaimer to the effect that no preference is shown in respect of applications that are made by agents and that all applications are considered in accordance with the usual departmental practice? advertisements to which the honourable member has referred, nor, of course, am I responsible for anything that may be done by estate agents in Melbourne. However, I assure the honourable member that there is no collusion between the War Service Homes Division and estate agents, and any suggestions by agents that they receive any priority from the department are utterly untrue. I shall be pleased to examine some of the advertisements so that I may have an opportunity to tell the truth about them and let ex-servicemen know that there is no -justification for claims such as the honourable member has described.",17,Northern Territory

That year stabilization plan for wheat? ment parties declared, both when they were in Opposition and since they have been in power, that they would support wheat stabilization on terms acceptable to the industry. I have negotiated the details of such a plan with representatives of the industry since I have been in office. The Government has told the industry, through the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, that it accepts, either in particularity or in principle, every point on wheat stabilization that the industry has asked for and that fhis Parliament has authority to grant. It has not been possible yet to reach agreethe permanent head of the Department ment with the State governments on if.e all-important aspect of a wheat stabilizaresentatives of the National Council of tion plan that falls within the constitutional authority of the .State parliaments, the domestic selling price. This situation impelled the Australian Agricultural Council to recommend to the seven governments concerned that the existing plan be extended for one year on modified terms that woulcl be in the interests of the wheat industry. This Government agreed to adopt the recommendation. However, the South Australian Government has declared that it is not able to proceed with the stabilizathe statistical record service provided by tion plan for an additional year.

A few weeks ago, I received a deputation from the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers and the Australian Wool growers' Council. In my discussions with the deputation, the purpose of the wool statistical service was made clear. There was a general understanding of the high importance of the statistical records compiled by the Australian Wool Realization Commission in the international wool negotiations that have taken place during the last eighteen months, upon which hinged the fate of the Australian auction system for the sale of wool. Yesterday, a conference was held in Sydney between of Commerce and Agriculture with repWool Selling Brokers, the Australian Wool growers' Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation. As a result of the conference, it was agreed that, for a trial period of three months, the wool statistical service now operating should be continued and that, concurrently, a method of supplying the basic information put forward by the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers should be tried. It was understood that if, at the end of the trial period, the brokers was adequate and could be accepted both here and overseas as authentic and complete, the Government would be read to agree to this modification of the statistical service. the table reports of the Tariff Board upon the following items:Aluminium foil and aluminium foil paper.

By this amendment, the new section, as it applies to certain transactions in partnerand the 18 th September, 1952, will operate more advantageously to the taxpayers concerned. The effect of proposed new section 36A is to treat transfers of stock, as disposals of that stock.

41,„ Sir Arthur Fadden (Mcpherson,"owners. In other words, upon unanimous agreement, the parties may decide to treat the business as a continuing one, and to defer taxation upon profits arising from the stock until an actual sale has taken place. If the parties to the transposition, has not been seriously chalfer do not unanimously agree to be treated as a continuing business, the value Government, however, indicate that the included in the assessable income , of the former owners and allowed as a deduction to the new owners is the market value of the trading stock. Section 36A does not give expression to any new principle in income tax law. For many years it was thought that section 36 of the principal act required the market value of trading stock which was the subject of a transfer of partnership interests to be brought to account in computing taxable income. This interpretation of section 36 had been accepted both by the Commissioner of Taxation and by Taxation Boards of Beview. It was only in November, 1951, when the High Court delivered judgment in the Bose case, that the failure of section 36, as at present enacted, to give effect to its original purpose in this connection was disclosed. It is proposed, in the new section 36A, to give clear expression to that original purpose and, at the same time, to allow the parties to transfers of partnership interests considerable laticommittee is asked to accept is designed tude in determining the incidence of taxation as between themselves. Whilst the proposed new section 36A will preserve the principle of treating transfers of partnership interests in trading stock as disposals at market value, the parties may, upon unanimous agreement, as I have already mentioned, elect to he treated on the alternative basis of a conbill was introduced, it is proposed that the tinuing business. That right of election, however, is subject to a very necessary safeguard. It will be exercisable only where, after the transfer, one or more of the former owners retain at least a 25 per cent, interest in the transferred trading stock. This safeguard is, as I have indicated, very necessary if anomalies are to be avoided. If there were no such restriction, a person disposing of his business could avoid taxation on the proceeds by the simple expedient of retaining some nominal or fictitious interest in the business. The object of the proposed limitation, therefore, is to restrict the right of election to those cases where, notwithstanding some change in ownership, there remains a substantially continuing business. The propriety of this limitation, as a general prolenged. Representations received by the proposal places an unintended restriction upon some taxpayers who transferred partnership interests between the 5th November, 1951, the date of the Bose decision, and the 18th September, 1952, which was the date on which I introduced the bill. Such transactions were effected, in many instances, in the belief and on the understanding that the principles of the Rose decision would apply, and that no taxable profit would arise from the transfer. Of course, where former owners retained at least a 25 per cent, interest in the transferred stock, the parties will have the right of unanimous election to be treated as a continuing business. Under the measure as originally drafted, however, parties to transfers where an interest of less than 25 per cent, was retained by former owners would have no such right to be treated as a continuing business, even although they may have entered into their transaction relying upon the Rose judgment. The amendment which the to remove any suggestion of hardship in these latter cases. Whilsti t might be justifiable to grant relief in respect only of transfers between the date of the Rose decision and the 18th September, 1952, the date on which the modification provided for in the amendment will operate from the first day of the year of income in which the decision was given-that is, the lst July, 1951or the beginning of any accounting period substituted for that year of income. Shortly stated, the effect of the amendment will be to grant a right of election, in certain circumstances, to be treated as a continuing business, where a transfer of interests occurred ""between the lst July, 1951, and the 18th September, 1952, even if an interest of less than 25 per cent, were retained in the transferred stock by the former owners. In order that the operation of this modification may not he hampered by arbitrary restrictions, it is proposed to give the Commissioner of Taxation wide powers of discretion in determining what percentage retention of interests should qualify the parties for the right of election to be treated as a continuing business. The number of partners in the new business will be a relevant factor in making such a determination. For example, where a father took four sons into partnership at any time during the period mentioned, and retained at least a 20 per cent, interest in the stock, the parties will have the right of election. Where circumstances warrant, the commissioner will be authorized to accept such an election where an even less percentage was retained. The discretionary power which is proposed to be vested in the commissioner will extend also to a determination of the bona fides of the new partnership. This is necessary to ensure that the right bf election is restricted to genuine cases. The amendment provides a further safeguard in every case where the parties entered into transactions in the light of the Bose decision. I commend the amendment to the committee. Opposition) [4.15] I move That the amendment be amended by adding at the end thereof the following proviso:"" Provided that the section inserted in the principal act by this section shall not be construed or applied so as to increase the amount of tax that was paid, or [payable, in respect of income of the years of income which commenced on the first day of July, 1950, and thc first day of July, 1951, and in the further period ended the 18th .September, 1952, except insofar as may be necessary to give efTect to the notice of agreement given under sub-section (2.) of the section inserted in the principal act the action which they have in mind. by this section."". The purpose of the amendment is to deal with the matter of retrospectivity or retro-activity in the new provision. The Bose decision was given in 1951, but it was in respect of the previous income year. In other words, the transaction under review in the Rose case, which related, of course, to the transfer by partners, among themselves, of holdings in partnership assets, had reference to the previous year. The High Court held, not for the future, that the law means only that, in a transfer of partnership interests, there was no disposal of assets, and therefore such a transfer was not covered by the law. The Government has heen driven, step by step, to a position that is fundamentally unsound if it really is against the retrospective operation of the taxation statutes simply to close a gap that the courts have exposed. What our amendment seeks to do is to say, in effect, "" Treat the Rose decision according to its true meaning and interpretation as covering not merely the year in which it was announced, but also the period in respect of which it was given-that is, the previous year and make the decisive point as the 18th September, 1952, when this proposal was announced by the Treasurer to the Parliament"". In other words, the Government should accept the decision of the nation's supreme tribunal. The whole matter should be treated according to the spirit, as well as the letter, of the interpretation. Instead of that, the Government is adopting a mealy-mouthed way of attacking this problem of retroactivity. On the 9th October, the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) indicated the principle that he proposed to apply in connection with a much more serious case, which he described as being extremely important. He saidI desire to make it clear that the Government will, as soon as practicable, introduce legislation for this purpose, and that the legislation will certainly be made retroactive to the date of this announcement. 1 am referring, not to this particular matter, but to the principle involved. The Treasurer continuedIn other words, those who, from this time onwards, seek or intend to employ these devices are put on plain notice that the legislation to be introduced will he aimed at invalidating Then he said that whatever law was appropriate to deal with the problem would operate from that night the 9th October, 1952. Had the Treasurer said, in September, that the new law would operate on and from the 18th September, that would have been reasonable. The law would have operated prospectively. However, the intention is that the operation of the law shall be made retrospective. Such a decision will lead to all sorts of anomalies.

We should ask ourselves the broad question whether that approach should be adopted, or whether the Government should make this lawoperative as from September last. TheH i g h Courti n the Rose case, interpreted and determined the law. The Treasurer did nothing in the matter, for practically twelve months after September, 1951. During that period, he practically told all persons concerned that the decision of the H i gh Court would stand. He created that impression by Lis failure to take any action in the matter.

45,Dr. Evatt,"I do not say that 1have retrospective legislation; but they must be very exceptional occasions. Sir ARTHUR. FADDEN -The qualification is necessary in view of the right honourable gentleman's own history. The Treasurer should consider his own more recent history. Retrospectivity is required in some circumstances. In the situation under consideration, people have acted in good faith, upon the decision of the High Court, and I submit that the facts should be recognized that the transactions took place, and that the Treasurer did nothing in the matter for twelve months. If he desired to introduce a retrospective provision, he should have taken the necessary action at once, but he omitted to do so. He permitted time to slip by, and some people acted in good faith. The reason for the second part of my amendment is that, to the extent that a benefit is created in this context, it should be permitted to continue. The decision given by the High Court in the Rose case in September, 1951, only meant that that part of the assessment act did not cover, and was not intended by the Parliament, on a true interpretation, to cover, the transaction in a change in the ownership of, or in the interests of persons in, a property. It did not mean that the transactions, if they were pretended, or were not honest, could escape the operation of the law. That matter is covered by section 260 of the act, which is always in reserve for the taxation authorities if they can prove, in the judgment of the court, that a transaction is not a bona fide one. It should follow, from those remarks, that the commissioner should not be the final judge to determine whether the interest retained by a partner is reasonable. The only consideration that should concern the Parliament is whether or not the transaction is a bona fide one. I sum up my submissions by saying that this legislation makes provision for retrospective applied, notwithstanding a delay of twelve months. The Treasurer should have announced his intention in the matter long ago. The amendment which I have moved to the amendment made by the Senate, if it is adopted, will correct the position, and leave the matter, as from the 18th September last, to be governed by the law I submit that proposal as the solution to this problem. Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has moved an extraordinary amendment in a most extraordinary speech. The circumstances are all the more extraordinary because the right honourable gentleman was, for some years, a justice of the High Court of Australia. I have always understood that a law remains in operation until such time as it is declared invalid by the High Court. The Leader of the Opposition has produced a theory to-day in which he suggests that it should not apply from the date of the decision of the High Court, but should apply from some considerable prior date. If one takes that argument to its logical conclusion, surely in relation to income tax it would be correct to go back to the time that the law was first enacted, because the law as it was first enacted had been proved to be wrong, or not in accordance with the understanding of the Parliament at the time it was passed. Mr J. R. FR-ASER,-The honourable member could not have been listening to the Leader of the Opposition. ing to the right honourable gentleman, but I have also read his amendment. I suggest that that is more than has been done by the honourable member for thc Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser). I believe that when this law was enacted, it was the intention of the Parliament that certain transactions should be taxed on the basis of the market value of the stock actually transferred. The law was carried out until the Rose case was decided in November, 1951. The reason why the Government introduced an amendment to the bill first presented a few weeks ago, in relation to the period from the lst July, 1950, was that that was approximately the time of the commencetaxation, deliberately ment of the Rose case. All persons who were members of taxable partnerships, and who believed that their circumstances were the same as the circumstances of the Rose case, had a perfect right to lodge objections. Had they done so, the decisions in the Rose case would have applied",23,Income Taxa Nd Social Services Contribution Assessment Bill No 3 1952 Interests In Trading Stock Including Live

48,Mr Hulme,"Not only was I listento them. I believe that the great majority of taxpayers operated in accordance with the then understanding of the law, that is that taxation would be levied on the transferor at the market value of tha transferred property. It appears to me that the Leader of the Opposition desires to make political capital out of retrospectivity in relation to income tax, because he believes that there is a popular outcry against retrospectivity in certain sectioni of the community. He is prepared to ride his hobby horse as hard as he can. able member would not suggest that the Leader of the Opposition is a cheerchaser ? suggest that. While this alteration to ths method of assessment, brought about by the Rose case, conferred an advantage on the transferor, the transferee suffered a disadvantage. When a taxpayer transferred assets on the basis contemplated by the principal act, if the book value was £10,000 and the market value £40,000, the transferor was required to pay income tax on the difference-£30,000. ' Following the Rose case, the £30,000 was transferred to the transferee so that eventually when the stock was sold the transferee would pay the tax on it. Therefore, this is not a matter of one-way traffic. It is to be an exercise of discretion by the Comthe advantage of the transferor but to the disadvantage of the transferee. Let as now consider what might have been behind the Rose judgment. In the Rose case, the retention was 33^ per cent., and many people have tried to work out a partnership on the basis of a retention much lower than 33J per cent -som e perhaps as low as 12 per cent, or 5 per cent. The Government decided that in all such cases there should be a reasonable retention, and determined that it should be 25 per cent. The Leader of the Opposition said that twelve months elapsed before the Government did anything about this matter. As a matter of The honourable member for Petrie( Mr fact, the Government is not only giving Hulme) said that he supports the an advantage to taxpayers to the time amendment of the Treasurer ( Sir when the Rose case was decided in Arthur Fadden) ""with considerable November, 1951, but it is also giving that enthusiasm"". He did not say that advantage, according to the Senate's he supported it with whole-hearted amendment, to the lst July, 1951. enthusiasm. Therefore, even those persons who did not lodge an objection will receive a benefit as far back as the lst July, 1951. Honourable members and others should realize that this Government is being very generous in its attitude in this amendment. I believe that the Treasurer's amendment does carry out to the full the High Court's judgment in the Rose case, but it has to he proved in all such cases that a bona fide partnership is in existence, and there must be unanimous agreement about that as between the parties. The Leader of the Opposition has suggested that it is wrong to leave the decision whether a partnership is bona fide or not to the Commissioner of Taxation. However, the right honourable gentleman did not suggest who should make the decision, and I believe that tbe matter of the discretion of the Commissioner of Taxation did not receive much consideration by the Labour party when it was in office for eight years. If honourable members read the history of the federal income tax law they will discover that there have always been substantial discretions within the power of the Commissioner of Taxation. My experience in dealing with the Commissioner of Taxation has been considerable, and I have always found him most reasonable in the exercise of any discretions vested in him. There will missioner of Taxation in this matter, and through my experience I suggest that the discretion will be exercised to the advantage of the taxpayer. I support with considerable enthusiasm the amendment of the Treasurer, and I completely reject the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition is merely seeking to obtain political capital out of this matter because he believes that a considerable section of the people oppose what he calls "" retrospectivity "".",24,Income Taxa Nd Social Services Contribution Assessment Bill No 3 1952 Interests In Trading Stock Including Live

The committee attached to its report a draft amendment, but the -Government's first proposal went further than the recommendation that the committee made. I am not so sure that the -Government's present proposal also does not go further than that recommendation. The incidence of tax imposed by this amendment, even retrospectively, is far wider than the committee ever recommended. The Treasurer has landed himself in trouble in respect of this and other instances of retrospective legislation. I am not concerned about the other cases, because I do not know the degree to which they actually involve evasion; but I submit that transfers made by primary producers could not possibly involve attempts to defraud the revenue of the kind which it is insinuated have been made in dealings by persons other than primary producers. Therefore, the new law should apply as from the date on which the Treasurer originally announced that it would apply and should not cover primary producers as well as all other persons who, it has been alleged, have knowingly or unknowingly, evaded payment of tax. The new law should not be applied to primary producers in the way that it is proposed to apply it to other persons. The observation that the Leader of the Opposition made was perfectly fair and proper. I have no doubt the Treasurer himself, if he were in Opposition, would make a similar observation. When the Curtin and Chifley Governments introduced legislation of this kind, he criticized the retroa technical defect that had been disclosed spective provisions. The Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison), or any other supporter of the present Government, when he was in Opposition, never missed a chance to protest against the retrospective application of legislation. Honourable members opposite will have an uphill fight to justify this proposed provision before the people. Certainly, they will not justify it before the primary producers who, in any event, are now fed up to the teeth with the present Government and to whom this proposal will be the last straw. trust that the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), if he should ever attain to the treasury bench, will not attempt to protect taxpayers in general with the same childlike faith that he has just exhibited.

The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has proposed an amendment to the Government's proposed amendment, to which he has objected on two grounds. His first objection is in respect of the area and scope of tax transactions that are covered by the High Court's decision in the Rose case; and his second objection is in respect of the discretion that is to be given to the Commissioner of Taxation in deciding matters of this kind. I wonder what the right lionorable gentleman's attitude was in 1947 when the Ohifley Government introduced an income tax assessment bill which corrected in relation to tax on dividends received from ex-Australian companies? Speaking on that measure, Mr Chifley saidSince 1941, these dividends have been included in the assessable income of the Australian resident shareholder, who has been entitled to a deduction of the ex-Australian tax paid on the dividend. A decision delivered last week by the High Court is to the effect that dividends from ex-Australian companies which are subject to ex-Australian tax are exempt from Commonwealth tax. While remedying the defect disclosed by the court's decision, it is .proposed to modify the basis of assessment.",26,Income Taxa Nd Social Services Contribution Assessment Bill No 3 1952 Interests In Trading Stock Including Live

60,Mr Feeeth,"The amendment proThe remedy went back to the lst July, 1946. Had the right honourable gentleman decided to rectify the defect for the ful l period of its operation, the amendment would have been made retrospective to 1941. However, he was influenced by the fact that, prior to the decision of the point at issue is that the Commissioner of court, people had acted in accordance with the law as they then interpreted it. In this instance, persons who made partnership transactions prior to the decision in the Bose case acted in accordance with the law as it was then interpreted. Mr has been made to evade tax than it is to Chifley considered that persons who had acted in good faith on the basis of a court cases which properly should come within decision were entitled to the benefit of that decision, but that others were not entitled to the benefit. The Leader of the Opposition now proposes that the effect of the Government's amendment should apply to all transactions of the tax gave its decision in the Rose case, over year prior to the announcement of the Bose decision, when taxpayers could not have known that the court would interpret the law as it did. At that time, taxthat 25 per cent, of the property should payers must have accepted the law as it had been laid down by several decisions of taxation boards of review. Therefore, the amendment proposed by the Opposition is completely illogical. ber know which year the decision in the Rose case referred to? that ended on the 30th June, 1951. Any taxpayer who entered into a partnership transaction during that year must have believed that he would be liable to taxation on the market value of his stock, because he could not foresee the decision of the High Court on the 5th November, 1951. The right honourable gentleman suggests that it is the duty of the Governtion has said, in effect, that he does not ment to give back a certain amount of tax on the ground that such a taxpayer might have been able to foresee a pending High Court decision. I have never heard such a suggestion before, and I do not think that the right honourable gentleman can expect it to be taken seriously. The second ground for his objection to the Senate's amendment is the proposal to vest discretionary power in the Commissioner of Taxation. He stated correctly that section 260 of the principal act provides a remedy that may be exercised by the Commissioner in the event of a deliberate tax evasion by conspiracy. However, the right honourable gentleman must be well aware of the extreme difficulty of securing a conviction under the terms of that section. The Taxation has a duty to protect the taxpayers generally against the activities of persons who rightly should be taxed, but who, in fact, evade tax. It is much more difficult to prove that a deliberate attempt extend the principle of this section to the provisions of section 36 in relation to the disposition of property. The honourable member for Melbourne suggested that there could he no evasion of tax. I understand that, after the High Court 3,000 new partnerships were entered into in New South Wales alone. What percentage of these arrangements provided be retained in the original ownership we do not know. However, any of them could have retained only .01 per cent, of the original interest in the ownership, and, technically, they might have -been able to get by under the terms of thc decision of the Rose case. I have used the qualification, ""technically"", because the High Court in the Rose case simply laid down that the formation of a partnership did not come within the provisions of section 36 of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act. However, we should remember that the decision in that case was based upon a certain set of facts. The court might well have reached a different conclusion if a different set of facts had been submitted to it. The Leader of the Opposiobject to the idea of a bona fide partnership having to be established, but that he objects to the Commissioner of Taxation having discretion to decide whether or not a bona fide partnership has been established. The decision must be made at some stage. Either it must be laid down in the act by specifying a certain figure-and the Government proposes that 25 per cent, shall apply in the future -o r it must be left open to litigation, a process that involves an undesirable",27,Income Taxa Nd Social Services Contribution Assessment Bill No 3 1952 Interests In Trading Stock Including Live

62,Mr Freeth,"Yes, the income yearstate of uncertainty. The two objections law to remain unaltered for ahout a raised by the Leader of the Opposition year cannot withstand close exaniination. In the first place, he has said that taxpayers the ful l benefit of the Bose decision since are entitled to have the benefit of a legal then. decision only if they have acted in good faith on that decision. In this instance, taxpayers could haye acted in good faith the practice is wrong. The Treasurer on the court's decision only after the 5 th should have introduced the amending hill November, 1951. Any suggestion that as soon as possible after the court individuals who acted prior to that date announced its decision in the Rose case. are entitled to the benefit of the decision is fantastic. honourable member's time has expired. The Government has itself to blame for taxation law. The Opposition is centhe criticism that it has suffered as a suring the Treasurer for hisfailure to result of the introduction of the bill and make appropriate provision at the time the amendment that has been made to when it should have been made. the measure on its behalf by the Senate. The fact is that, for many years, it has taxpayers the f u ll benefit of the decision. been the practice to regard a disposition of property in the circumstances specified in section 36 of the act as a sale. sure. I do not feel very happy about the The High Court decision cited by the Senate's amendment. It appears to me Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) was that the Government is again shedding its announced on the 5th November, 1951. responsibility, because it has proposed that This Parliament was in session until the benefit shall apply only when there the 30th November, 1951.

80,The Chairman,"Order! Theand the dreadful consequences of such legislation. The Leader of the Lahour party in the Senate made a similar statement. He had the audacity to say that the Labour party had never been responsible for retrospective income tax legislation. Let me put some of the facts upon record. I have been the victim of a scurrilous attack by the press in connection with retrospective taxation legislation, and the press has been aided and abetted by the puritan attitude that has been adopted by the Lahour party to the matter. A classic example of retrospective taxain December, 1941. It made provision tion legislation is the amendment of the taxation laws that was proposed by the late Mr Chifley in 1944. At that time, there was evidence of legal tax avoidance by the expedient of acquiring ownership of, private companies which, in previous years, had made substantial losses, and using the entities so acquired to carry on new and profitable businesses. The effect of that expedient was to enable the losses of the old businesses to be carried forward and to be treated as deductions from income earned by the new businesses in later years, even though the ownership of the companies had completely changed. An appropriate amendment of the law was made. The late Mr Chifley said that it was designed to prevent that legal method of tax avoidance. The amending measure was enacted on the 3rd April, 1944, but it applied retrospectively to the 1st July, 1941. On another occasion, the High Court delivered a judgment, the effect of which was to exempt from Australian income tax dividends received by Australians from ex-Australian companies. judgment of the High Court was delivered on the 20th March, 1947. Legislation was drafted by the Chifley Government to overcome the effect of the judgment of the court. The legislation, which was enacted on the 3rd June, 1947, applied retrospectively to all assessments posted to taxpayers on and after the 20th March, 1947-the date of the judgment. In effect, the benefit of the judgment was preserved only for the successful appellant and for other taxpayers whose objections or appeals upon similar grounds has not been determined. In 1948, when claims had been advanced that, by reason of an apparent defect in the law, payments of social services contributions were deductible under the concessional allowance provisions, the Chifley Government, in which the present Leader of the Opposition was Attorney-General, introduced legislation to remove any grounds for such claims. That legislation, enacted in 1948, was made retrospective to the lst July, 1945. The first income tax assessment bill presented by the late Mr Chifley as Treasurer was brought before the Parliament for the disallowance of concessional deductions for children in respect of whom child endowment was payable, and for the substitution of a rebate for the deduction previously allowed in respect of payments made in response to calls by mining companies on their shareholders. Both those amendments of the law applied to assessments of income for the year that commenced on the lst July, 1940. The record of the Labour party proves that the statements that honourable gentlemen opposite have made recently about retrospective taxation legislation are sheer political humbug. In 1948, the Chifley Government presented a bill that was intended to rationalize the code for the taxation of the profits of private companies, and, in particular, to correct an anomaly that had existed since 1934. The legislation became operative on the 22nd December, 1948, but it applied retrospectively to assessments of income for the year that commenced on the lst July, 1947. That is the record. The Leader of the The Opposition was then Attorney-General, the ministerial head of the legal department that was responsible for the drafting of that legislation, yet he has the audacity to try to make the country believe that the party that he leads is opposed to retrospective taxation as being against the best interests of the country and the taxpayers generally. That is the undeniable record which we place before the Parliament, which shows the political hypocrisy of the party opposite when it tries to cash in, with the dirty newspaper organization that has attacked me, with respect to retrospective taxation. AllI have to say in conclusion is that there have been more dissension, confusion and political hypocrisy with regard to this measure than any one could have believed possible. In all the circumstances the measure does nothing other, and it will be proven to do nothing other, than give a retrospective concession to all those taxpayers who come within its ambit. Nobody will be detrimentally affected by it. body will be benefited by it, except people who have not lodged their tax returns at the proper time, and nobody can look after that kind of person. No taxpayer who has lodged his return for the financial year 1950-51 and has been assessed, or will be assessed, prior to measure, will be affected. As far as people to whom the Rose decision applies are concerned, the Government has made the provision retrospective to the lst July, 1951. The only modification that has been made to the original measure is to remove what might be-and it only might be-some disadvantage in cases where a lesser proportion than 25 per cent, of the partnership assets has been retained and there has been disagree^ ment between the contending parties. As the honourable member for Petrie( Mr Fadden, SirA r t h u r Hulme) rightly said, the Government had to consider both parties to such transactions. The Rose case did not go far enough. The court had to decide only one point of law, and it left, still unresolved, the broad issue of the disposal of the partnership assets. The honourable member for Petrie rightly said that we had to give consideration to two parties. There are always at least two parties to a contract. Eor every transferor there is at least one transferee. We had to hold the scales of justice evenly and wisely between the parties. The best way to do so was the most practical way, which was to provide them with an opportunity for agreement by election, and to have a safeguard whereby fictitious transactions that would be to the disadvantage of the revenue could not be entered into. Twenty-five per cent, retention was, therefore, considered to be a reasonable percentage having regard to all the facts, particularly in the Rose case, in which a percentage of Sir Arthur Fadden. 33J was the salient retention. I realized, after the measure had been introduced and had been canvassed and debated, that there were genuine cases in which the 25 per cent, retention principle might be harsh. That is the reason why the amendment has been introduced, and why we are pleased, as a Government, to accept it. [5.19] Mr Chairman put,T h a t t l i e question bc now put. The conimittee divided.

Apparently my fear is well founded. We shall not have an opportunity to raise urgent matters on the motion for the adjournment at the end of each day's sitting. The House, presumably, will sit until 3 a.m., or 4 a.m., each day, and at such an hour Ministers will not be in a mood to listen to our representations.

He stated that the motion would not be necessary if the House were to sit for a few more days. He knows, as does the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan), that their statements, like theflowersthat bloom in the spring, have nothing to do with the case. The purpose of this motion is to enable the Government, if necessary, to introduce new legislation between 11 p.m. and midnight.",33,Pairs

Yet the honourable member for Melbourne and the honourable member for Eeid object to a motion that will enable the Government to introduce new legislation between 11 p.m. and midnight. is not relevant to the motion. merely reminding Opposition members of the true position. The provision of "" Grievance Day"" has nothing to do with this motion. I remind the honourable member for Melbourne that when I was sitting in the comfortable chair that he is uow occupying, members of the Opposition at that time were subjected to a number of all-night sittings until we all reached a state of complete exhaustion. Labour Ministers retired to their offices, rested on their settees, and returned refreshed to the chamber, but private members were completely exhausted. Since this Government has been in office, there have been fewer all-night sittings than under any previous government. During this sessional period, we have had only one late night. To-night may make the second late night for the period if Opposition members insist on talking at great length in an attempt to gain party political capital. As I have explained, the reason for this motion is simply to allow the Government, should it so desire, to introduce legislation between the hours of 11 p.m., and midnight. Question resolved in the affirmative. (EESIDUAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1952. That leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to give the force of law to certain regulations and orders, and for other purposes. read a first time. for Defence) [5.43] -by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. The House will be glad to learn that the object of the bill is to dispose of, once and for all, the few surviving national security regulations and orders. For the last half dozen years, successive Defence (Transitional Provisions) Bills, each prolonging for a year at a time the gradually shrinking bulk of national security regulations and orders, have been a feature of the end-of-the-year sittings. We have seen the last of them. The Government proposes to replace them with a new act, which will keep on foot for varying periods the small residual groups of regulations and orders which are listed in the schedules, and which will not have to come before the Parliament again. One group of regulations, three in number, which are listed in PartI . of the First Schedule, will he continued for only the first six months of 1953. The first is the Apple and Pear Acquisition Regulations. Their only function now is to authorize the board to complete the re-assessment of compensation for fruit acquired during the war, in accordance with a judicial decision. The re-assessment is nearly complete, but cannot be finished before the end of December, when under the present Act, the regulations would expire. The other two regulations in this first group-the War Deaths Eegulations and regulation 66 of the General Eegulations-wil l be replaced by regulations under permanent legislation which is now before the Parliament-the Defence Bill 1952 and the Explosives Bill 1952. It may not be possible to bring these bills into operation and promulgate new regulations nnder them until the early part of next year. The proposal to continue the existing regulations is designed to avoid a gap. The two orders listed in the the end of 1953, and will then lapse if not earlier revoked. They are the Cordage and Fibre Order and the Jute Goods Order. The transition from emergency conditions has not progressed as rapidly or as far, in respect of these",34,Pairs

I am advised that the continuance of these orders will command general consent in the industries to which they relate. There remains the group of regulations listed in Part II . of the Eirst Schedule. Broadly, the position with these is that they do not draw their support from the defence power, and that they are not now needed except for winding up or for transitional purposes. However, it is not quite clear how soon they can be replaced or dispensed with. In these cases, therefore, no time limit has been fixed. Indeed, no time limit is necessary, because their continuance does not depend on an emergency or on emergency powers. I shall say a word or two about each of them. The group of General Eegulations, which are listed first, authorizes the continued occupation of property of which possession was taken during the war, and provides the necessary machinery for assessing compensation. These are necessary only for winding-up purposes. So also is the last item listed in this group (regulation 2 of Statutory Eule 205 of 1945), an external territories regulation which will permit the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory to finalize certain proceedings transferred from the external territories during the war years. The Shipping Co-ordination Eegulations permit the exercise of certain powers in relation to interstate and overseas shipping, and will eventually be replaced proposedby permanent legislation.

This bill and two cognate measures should be discussed exhaustively, particularly having regard to the strong difference of opinion that exists between the Government and the Opposition on the matters with which they deal. Apparently, some Government supporters are satisfied that the GovernOpposition that the four bills could be ment is taking the proper course; but the Opposition regards this measure as a foul bill. able member must deal with the proposed allotment of time. greater opportunity should be given to the House to debate measures that are so important as these bills are. In the period of five minutes, which is to be allotted for the second-reading debate, one could barely mention the principles of these bills. If I were permitted to do so, I sliould describe the Government's tice on the part of an Opposition. On action in much more forcible terms. I was not given any indication that the Government intended to limit discussion on these measures. My colleagues and I have prepared copious notes, and we sliould be given the opportunity to place our views before the House and the people. this contemptuous treatment of the Opposition. Government is unable to stand up to criticism of the proposals that are contained in these measures. During the 25 years that I have been a member of Parliament I cannot recall an occasion on which a Government has shown such contempt for the Opposition. able member's time has expired. remarks of the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) could be dealt with in vacuo there might appear to be something in them; but plaint against' the background of this measure and cognate bills it is clear that he has been shedding crocodile tears. that when the honourable member for This bill is one of a series of four measures, the principal of which was debated at length last week. I remind the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) that the majority of Government supporters but only a few members of the Opposition remained in the chamber when discussion on the second reading of the principal bill proceeded until 2 a.m. on Wednesday last. An understanding was reached with the debated simultaneously on the motion for the second reading of the principal bill. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) can gnash his teeth and roll his eyes as much as he likes, but heleaves me unmoved. Members of the Opposition clearly understood the arrangement that was made on their behalf that during the second-reading: debate on the principal bill, honourable members could debate any of the three cognate measures. The display that the Opposition is now putting on by crying' bitterly over the proposed allotment of time is, of course, a well-known pracmany occasions, since I was elected to this House three years ago, I have witnessed similar exhibitions. BeforeI had the honour to serve as a member of the Parliament, I was well aware of this practice through the interest that I took I protest against in proceedings in the Parliament. Thia display of indignation on the part of It is clear that the the Opposition is a parliamentary technique. I make this point clear particularly for the benefit of the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ewert), who has just been elected to this House and who might possibly be moved to tears by the complaints that have just been made by his colleague, the honourable member for Maribyrnong. Such protests are not so serious as they may appear to be. I point out that it is the practice of the British House of Commons to place definite limits on the discussion of bills of even great importance, and that in the Mother of Parliaments only a limited number of speakers is allowed on any measure. In contrast when we examine his comwith that practice, generous opportunities are afforded in this House to debate measures. I direct attention to the fact",36,Allotment Of Time

The Opposition naturally and honourable members the fact, which some properly objects to the "" guillotine"" on of them appear to have forgotten, that this occasion; and that completes my before the House proceeded with the reference to the French Revolution. debate on the Civil Aviation Agreement Bill, which is the principal measure in this series of four bills, and which was motion proposed hy the Vice-President passed last week, I was asked whether of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. I would permit the four bills to be deHarrison) provides that the second readbated concurrently on the second reading. ing of the debate shall conclude at 8.5 Honourable members unanimously agreed p.m. In view of the fact that it is now that that course should be followed, 8.12 p.m., will it be in order for the and that each bill should then be dealt Chair to put the motion to the House? with separately at the committee stage. I am not a party but a witness to that at the point that the honourable member agreement.

The motion proSpeaker, have recalled with exactitude, vides that the second-reading debate shall when the first of the series of bills of conclude at 8.5 p.m.; that is, five minutes which this measure is a part was introago. I do not know how you, Mr duced, the House agreed to follow a proSpeaker, will rule on that matter when cedure under which the. four bills would the division is taken, because if this be debated simultaneously on the motion motion is agreed to the period of five for the second reading of the Civil AviaIninutes proposed to he allotted for the tion Agreement Bill. That debate prosecond reading will not be so allotted ceeded at great length last week. At the as that period has already been consumed same time, an agreement was made beby the honourable member for Evans( Mr tween both sides of the chamber, without Osborne) in telling us how he used to one honourable member expressing dissent, listen to debates in this House before he that the vote should be taken separately became a member of the Parliament and on each measure and that the committee how impressed he has been with proceedstage of each measure should be taken ings in this chamber since he was elected separately. to it. It may be some comfort to the agreement, which the Government has honourable member to know that very honorably observed, adequate provision is shortly he will again he able to listen made in the proposed allotment of time to our proceedings from outside the chamfor the taking of a vote on the second ber. It is absurd to allot only 50 minutes reading of this measure, and for the for the committee stage of a bill that is debate in committee to proceed for a so important as this one is and under period of 50 minutes. I point out that which the Government proposes to give this measure embodies only two operative away a considerable amount of the clauses, the first of which refers to a people's money. The Government allowed only nine hours for all stages of the Civil Aviation Agreement Bill and, consequently, only eighteen out of the total of 123 members of the House were given an opportunity to speak on that measure. I can see no reason why the Government should not be prepared to continue the sittings next week in order to give honourable members an opportunity to consider measures of this kind fully.

I do not think that the people desire that the proceedings of the Parliament should be permitted to drag on hour after hour when it is possible for the House to dispose of its business promptly and with a certain degree of economy of time. What we are witnessing at the moment is, not a resolute contribution to the subject of civil aviation, but an attempt to stage a demonstration, and to do nothing else. I submit that the agreement to which you, Mr Speaker, have referred, and to which you have said that you were a witness, should be honorably observed hy honourable members on both sides of the House.

[8.15] -I , too, protest against the action several pages of printed matter and sets of the Government in trying to withhold from members the opportunity to debate this important bill, which is designed to give certain privileges to the wealthy company, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. I remind the Government that honourable members are paid over £2,000 a year each and that they are supposed to devote the whole of their energies to the task of representing the views of the people who have elected them and who pay their salaries. We have no right to decide that we shall devote only five minutes of our time to the discussion of such an important measure as the Air Navigation (Charges) Bill. The people are just about fed up with this Government's methods of preventing proper discussion. The people who elected me to represent the Division of Hindmarsh expect that I shall be given an opportunity to express their views in this House, and the people as a whole will view adversely the decision Speaker.

The decision is absolutely outrageous. It . is all very well for the Government totalk about parliamentary democracy, but,, after its exhibition to-night, it ought to make a written apology to the shades of Hitler and Mussolini and to Stalin. The Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) has suggested that the Opposition was a party to an agreement. the nature of the agreement. Does the honourable gentleman suggest that the Opposition was informed that only 35 minutes would be allotted for the committee stage of this bill ? He knows very well that, while there was an agreement to debate the general principles of the various related measures during the second-reading stage of the Civil Aviation Agreement Bill, nobody could possibly do justice, in the limited time proposed, to the schedule to the Air Navigation (Charges) Bill, which consists of out in detail the Government's plans in relation to air-route charges. The Minister may think that this is a small subject, but I consider that air-route charges have a relationship to a number of important questions, including that of safety. Ministers and their supporters constantly suggest that the procedures that have been enforced in this House under the direction of the present Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) have been customary for many years. That is wholly untrue. Statistics that have been supplied to me by the Clerk of the House show that the Chifley G6^ vernment, in 279 sitting days, applied the closure on 72 occasions, which represents an average of once in four days.

Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is to be called upon to pay only £337,000 for air-route charges, although it owes approximately £1,000,000. The Department of Civil Aviation did not impose the charges for the purpose of making a profit. They cannot be described as unreasonable charges, because they compare favourably with those made by other countries. They were intended to provide only 20 per cent, or 30 per cent, of the cost of the construction and maintenance of aerodromes and of the provision of air-route and airway facilities, meteorological services and search and rescue services maintained or operated by the Commonwealth.

133,Mr Deakefoed,"The bill providescharges because it raised legal objections to paying them. ivas finally disposed of without having been brought to trial. vernment has every reason to be ashamed of not having brought the case to trial, because the odds were in favour of a decision being given against Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. It is unforgiveable for the Government to permit the company to get away with a failure to pay charges in this country that it has had to pay elsewhere. While Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited operates an air service for Air Ceylon, it has to pay air route charges and airport dues in countries other than Australia in which its aircraft lands, but, in Australia, it escapes payment. The fact that we have been unable to collect air route charges from Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited -probably has prevented the Department of Civil Aviation from obtaining revenue from overseas airlines, because, under an agreement that we have made with other countries, we cannot charge, for instance, American and Canadian operators more than we charge our own operators. We have not charged our operators anything for the use of our aerodromes and air route and other facilities, although they have had to pay for them in other countries. It is a recognized airline principle originally prescribed have been included that charges should be imposed for the use of those facilities, which, in Australia, are very good. Overseas airline companies recognize that such charges are part of their operating and working costs, but in this country they have been allowed to use our facilities free of charge. When the Department of Civil Aviation was preparing the table of charges, it investigated conditions in other countries. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and the Ansett company-which privately owned airline in this countrydecided to lodge with the High Court of Australia an objection to the payment of the charges, but the action was not brought to trial. This Government could have brought the action to trial at any time during the last three years, but, Mr Drakeford. instead, it has been devising ways and The case means by which to favour Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited The Goand to help that tottering private enterprise to stand up against the competition of a government airline, which honourable gentlemen opposite said at one time could not succeed. They laughed at the idea of a successful government airline, but it has been demonstrated in this country that such an airline can be run successfully and that a private airline cannot compete with it unless it is propped up by guaranteed loans of public money, made without the consent of the people. I suggest for the consideration of the Minister for Territories and those who are advising him that they should analyse the basis upon which the Department of Civil Aviation founded its scale of charges. They will find that the department has a record of the facts upon which the original charges were based. How can honourable gentlemen opposite justify the action of the Government in permitting Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited to avoid the payment of charges that are recognized elsewhere as fair? Some airlines in this country are receiving fairly large subsidies, and I agree that they should do so. Many of the subsidies have been increased in recent times. The air route charges that were in those subsidies. TJnder this legislation, some of those companies will receive a refund of payments made in respect of charges which they regarded as legitimate. The companies may not have been very enthusiastic about the charges when they were imposed originally by the Chifley Government, but I cannot remember any whole-hearted protest being made against them, other than by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and the Ansett company. There has been a lot of talk about the is the only other major pioneering of air routes in this country. The real pioneers were the companies that received subsidies in the early stages of air transport in Australia. The MacRobertson-Miller organization was the first pioneer of commercial airlines in this country, and Qantas was the second. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited came into the field later, and exploited air services between our capital cities. honourable gentleman's time has expired. Territories) [S.44] -This is a very short measure and, to my mind, rather a simple one. It consists of a few brief clauses and a few schedules. Honourable members will recall that during my second-reading speech on the Civil Aviation Agreement BillI made reference to the decision of the Government to reduce air route charges in order to relieve all airlines in Australia of the heavy burden that the payment of those charges imposed upon them. It was decided that the air route charges payable up to the lst July,' 1952, sbould be reduced by 50 per cent., and that those payable after 1952 should be reduced to an even greater degree. This bill is designed to give effect to that decision. In the three schedules, the exact means by which the decision can be carried into effect are set out. Furthermore, the bill introduces one other proposal inasmuch as it gives power to amend the schedules by regulation if necessary. The purpose of that provision is to give flexibility to the operation of the act, so that if it be found necessary to raise the air route charge because of increased costs of the services provided it will he possible to do so by regulation without the necessity of going through the lengthier ' processes of introducing and passing a bill. That regulation-making power is limited to the purposes of this bill, and must not be used in a way that is inconsistent with the bill. The meat of the bill is contained in the schedules. The first schedule deals with the charges payable by the holders of a irline licences in respect of all operations conducted by them. Honourable members will know that the Air Navigation Regulations provide for the conduct of regular public transport operations by the holders of charter licences in certain circumstances. These are also charged in accordance with the First Schedule. The method of charging for those operations is generally similar to that which has operated in the past. Each aircraft is given a unit charge depending on the weight of the aircraft, and each route israted having regard to the nature and Order! The extent of the facilities and services onthat route. charges ? member's question suggests that he is at variance with other members of his party on that matter. the Minister answer the question? favour of retaining charges is that services are provided, and that some charge should naturally be made for such services. Wecannot make an exact and neat calculation of the amount of an air route charge in relation, say, to the capital cost of the services provided. As the line of the Government's argument proceeds, honorahle members will realize that an air route charge which had a precise relation to the cost of furnishing the services would perhaps, in certain instances, be too onerous for the operators to carry. The Government could levy a charge that has an exact relation to the cost of the services provided or it could levy no charge at all. It has chosen to levy a charge, but to make it a moderate one that will be within the capacity of the airline operators to meet. I emphasize that the bill does not discriminate between one set of operators and another. The provisions apply equally, without favouritism or preference, to all airline operators who come within the ambit of the various schedules. In the case of Trans-Australia Airlines and those operators who have in the past paid air route charges, there will be a refund of the amount paid in excess of the new rate struck. Other operators who have not paid air route charges will become liable for the amount now levied on them. I return now to my discussion of the schedules to the bill. The unit charge to which I have referred is ascertained by multiplying the aircraft charge by the route rating. The First Schedule also makes provision for charges in respect of",41,Pairs

Honourable members will realize that in the operation of air transport services it is necessary to conduct a variety of test flights for the purpose of ensuring the airworthiness of the aircraft and the competence of its crew. As such flights are aiecessary in the interests of safety it is aiot desired to make charges in relation ito them. The Eirst Schedule provides tfor their exemption from any charge. The Second Schedule deals with charges payable by the owners of aircraft registered under the Air Navigation Regulations who are not covered by the Eirst Schedule. Here again, the scheme is broadly the same as that which has been operating in the past. allotted for the committee stage of the bill has expired.

It is now my purpose to try to present as clearly as I can what exactly are the provisions of the measure. Chairman. I ask Avhether it Avill be possible for the Minister to answer questions which may arise during the discussion in committee, if he speaks first. The honourable member is out of order. to explain the provisions of the bill, and I want to explain them in detail, clause by clause. It is a bill to amend the Australian .1945-1947. Conversation being audible. Thc CHAIRMAN Avill have to come to order, or I shall take action. the bill has tAvo objectives. First, it seeks which consists of more than 25 members, to vary certain sections of the principal act, Avhich it is considered require amendment in the light of experience gained by the Australian National Airlines Commission in its operations under the act. The objective of this measure can properly be said to be to amend the principal act, because in the course of its operation during the past feAv years the Australian National Airlines Commission has found such amendments to be necessary. Opposition understands that because of an any interest that a director has. directly agreement between the Government and or indirectly, in any contract or proposed the Opposition the second-reading debate contract with the company. has been dispensed with.

The second purpose of this bill is to import into the principal act provisions designed to give effect to the Government's desire that the operations of the Australian National Airlines Commission shall be National Airlines Act conducted under conditions similar to those that apply to other airline companies. The amendments that come within the first category are embodied in The committee clauses 2, 3, 4 and 5. Clause2 seeks to amend section 14 of the principal act, which provides that a commissioner Avho is a director of a company and which may be interested in or benefit from a contract made betAveen the company and the commission, is deemed to have vacated his office as a commissioner. This provision appears to be undulyonerous in that a commissioner may be disqualified unreasonably, or for very slight cause. Further, it restricts the field of prominent members of the commercial Avorld who may be appointed as commissioners.

The CHAIEMAN -The honourable member has not raised a point of order. No limitation of time is placed upon a Minister when speaking in committee. the fact that the time for which I have been speaking is probably less than half that which has been taken up by attempts by the Opposition to prevent me from continuing my remarks. A provision is also being included to declare the commission's capital to be repayable as well as a provision to cover repayments to the Government of any profits on its investment. surer may recall the whole of the capital ? tended to be ultimate in the event of the commission becoming over-capitalized. In this instance also, the views of the commission are required to be taken into consideration. The principal act does not permit the commission to borrow other than from the Treasurer. This position is now being changed and, henceforth, the commission will be enabled to obtain bank overdraft accommodation up to £1,000,000 at any one time for temporary purposes; and it may charge its assets as security for the repayment of any loan so raised. To complete the changes necessary to implement the conception of noninterest bearing capital, the existing sections of the principal act that deal with reserves and application of profits are being amalgamated in a new section which prescribes the meaning of profits and provides for the application of profits. The first application will be the payment as a return on capital which I have mentioned. Any balance will be dealt with as determined by the Treasurer and the Minister after having considered the advice of the commission on such application. These amendments will have the effect of providing statutory backing for the commission to operate as nearly as possible like a public company, the commission taking the place of the board of I rise to order.

This will give effect to the decision that the Government has made for the establishment of fair and equitable competition between airline operators. [9.16] -This bill, which the Opposition must oppose, is a part of the general plan to help Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited at the expense of tbe community. Some of its clauses might be acceptable to us if it were not for the fact that it and the related bills that have already been passed are designed to prop up the tottering structure of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited in every possible way. The Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) had a full chance to explain the purpose of the bill when he made his second-reading speech, but he did not do so. I suggest, therefore, that the measure was so hurriedly prepared that he was not fully briefed to make an explanation at the second-reading stage. in hand for six months. have been kept in the Minister's pocket, in accordance with the Government's method of keeping its plans secret for as long as possible so that the Opposition and the public will not be given an opportunity to study them before they are put into effect. If thc bill was drafted six months ago, as the said, why was a complete explanation not given to honourable members at the second reading stage? The Opposition takes strong exception tosome of its clauses. Apparently, clause 2 will provide for the appointment to the Australian National Airlines Commission of commissioners who may be interested, in another capacity, in the making of contracts with the commission.

The provisions of the bill should have been explained fully at the second-reading stage, so that we could study them in detail. However, with about five minutes left foi the committee stage, the Minister foi Territories has made some sort of explanation months old. Why were we kept in the dark for so long? We object strongly to the method of forcing the measure through all stages without allowing us to devote more than a few minutes to an examination of its provisions. The Government has told the public as little as possible about its plans, and debate has been gagged at every possible opportunity. comment is out of order. truth, and it cannot be denied. do with the discussion. have time to discuss every clause of the bill. Therefore, I shall refer next to clause 6. Sub-clause (4.) provides that the capital of the commission shall be repayable to the Commonwealth at such times and in such amounts as the Treasurer determines. We can imagine what will happen if that power is exercised by a Treasurer who is hostile to Trans-Australia Airlines. I remind the committee that some honourable members on the Government side of the chamber have revealed an uncompromising hostility to the people's airline. well as I do that my statement is true. There was hostility to Trans-Australia Airlines amongst members of the present Government parties from the establishment of the organization, but that hostility could not be justified because of the success with which it functioned. These honourable gentlemen cannot afford to reveal themselves publicly now as Therefore, they propose to place its fate in the hands of a man who may be hostile to it, and who may be influenced to a considerable degree by outside interests White, when he represented the electorate of Balaclava before his knighthood was conferred upon him, took advantage of every opportunity to attack Trans-Australia Airlines. His hackles bristled whenever the government airline wa3 mentioned. He was only the mouthpiece for many of his colleagues, who were equally hostile to it. new aircraft when he was Minister for Civil Aviation. said that an order for the purchase of Order! That six Vickers Viscount aircraft for Trans-Australia Airlines lay on his desk for six months and was not approved because the acquisition of those aircraft would have put Trans-Australia Airlines ahead of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. At any rate, the activities of Trans-Australia Airlines were restricted, as they will be restricted by this bill. TJnder clause 6 (4.), the Treasurer will be able to demand immediate repayment by the Australian National Airlines Commission, this is, Trans-Australia Airlines, of its capital. That is a shocking provision. The situation will be similar to that which would exist if a bank were able to foreclose on an overdraft at any time. I strongly object, as a representative of the people, to the Treasurer having the power to close down an air service that is operating in the interests of the people. Every reasonable person agrees that it is to the advantage of the people that Trans-Australia Airlines should continue to operate. Tbe government airline in New Zealand provides a splendid example of the success of such undertakings. It operates almost exclusively as a monopoly.

Edward Nixon, at the request of the -Government, compiled the report on the financial position of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited .and Trans-Australia Airlines, and thc honourable member for Eorrest has the audacity to ask me to inform him of the amount that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is paying. How can I be expected to have that information? Why should Government supporters be permitted to know more than -we are allowed to know ahout the amount that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is paying ? This Parliament is rapidly being reduced to a position where the Government says, "" We will put through this legislation as quickly -as possible without allowing the Opposition an opportunity to express its views. That state of affairs would not be -tolerated in any other Parliament. Only -one Opposition member will be able to make an adequate speech on this bill. I direct attention to the following passage in the latest report of Trans.Australia Airlines:In] 947-48, the year in which air route -charges were first imposed, payments by Transsive rate-and those contracts were not Australia Airlines to Commonwealth Eevenue in respeot of Fuel Tax totalled £330,000.

I -do not desire it to be placed in such a -favorable position that other companies -cannot compete with it. However, as soon as the decision of the High Court was given, we allowed it to compete with them in every possible way. that Trans-Australia Airlines should compete with the other companies without restriction. Some Government supporters have been bludgeoned into voting for this legislation. announced that they would not support any interference with Trans-Australia under discussion is taxation Airlines. of their attitude at the next general of time. election. They are not really in favour of this legislation, but they are silenced with parliamentary procedure, and I ask by the Government's policy. Some of your indulgence, Mr Chairman, in doing them indicated their intention to speak Sir on these measures, but they -have withdrawn rather than express views totally different from those that they expressed on previous occasions. I do not believe that some Government supporters like this bill. I can hardly believe that they are convinced of the merits of this legislation. Even the eloquent speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) last week on the Civil Aviation Bill 1952 could not convince anybody who chose to analyse it. On that occasion, the right honorahl"" gentleman engaged in special pleading. This is one of the beneficiary acts to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, and I strongly object to it, and shall ask my colleagues to vote against it, so that the people will know, at the next election, what attitude various honourable members have adopted on it. Their protestations are not worth anything. Trans-Australia Airlines has paid, and will continue to pay, a considerable sum by way of taxes. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited began with every possible advantage, l t was first in the field in inter-capital city transport. It was given mail contracts-in my view, at an excesdisturbed because the war was in progress. At the end of hostilities, we took the contracts away from. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and gave them to Trans-Australia Airlines. Honourable members opposite have bewailed that fact for years. In my opinion the Government has used the forms of the House in order to stifle criticisms that would be voiced by the opponents of this legislation.

The honourable member will not be in order in discussing that matter now. shall be in order in saying, and I do not believe that you, sir, wish to prevent me from saying, that the way in which this bill is being handled will prevent the kind of discussion which the people expect in this Parliament. We should be allowed ample opportunity to discuss all the issues involved in these matters. When the time for discussion is limited, as it has been, so that the bill must pass the committee ' stage by 11.5 p.m., only a few honourable members will have an opportunity to speak. The remaining stages of the bill must be completed by 11.20 p.m. I claim that this bill is the culminating act in a cunningly devised plan to enable a private company, which does not produce balance-sheets and conceals its financial dealings from the people, to benefit substantially at the expense of the Government airline, which operated efficiently until it was loaded down by legal enactment in favour of the private company, so that it cannot show up the private commercial airline in contrast. The haste with which these bills are being rushed through this chamber, the secrecy which is being used, and the refusal to allow honourable members to know the result of the investigations conducted by an expert into the affairs of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, make one feel that honourable members are asked to be a party to what amounts to a deliberate swindle of the Australian people by a reactionary government. I believe that to be so, and I emphasize my view. I propose to resume my seat in order to give Government supporters an opportunity to defend this bill, if they can. Of course, there is no defence for it. This legislation is a beneficiary act to a private commercial airline, owned by wealthy shipping interests, which are not allowed to function in airline operations in the United States of America and certain other countries. This Government intends to propup the tottering private airline at any price, at the expense of the effortsThe that have been made to establish something to the permanent benefit of. the people. shall be brief in order that some Opposition members may be able to participatein this debate. I hope that they, will not, argue about the allotment of time as the honorable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) has done, otherwise-they willi not achieve any useful purpose.. He described this bill as a beneficiary act toAustralian National Airways Proprietary Limited. That remark was a perfect; illustration of the one-eyed view which Opposition members take of what is, or what is not, fair competition.. The mere fact that Trans-Australia Airlines, a government instrumentality, has to pay taxes to the Government does not inflict any hardship on the Government or on the airline, but merely enables us to see, in proper perspective, the respective operations of Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. In other, words, we shall be able to see for the first time exactly how Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines compare when they have tooperate on the same basis. balance-sheets of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. ber for Ballarat( Mr Joshua) will seethem. Trans-Australia Airlines hasclaimed for some years that it has been, operating at a profit. During the first, two years of its existence, the Government airline did not pay any income tax. because it was operating at a loss. In that period Australian National' Airways Proprietary Limited paid tajxes to the Government. In fact, the privately-owned airline has paid £3,000,000 in income tax alone.

If done to reduce sales tax on school equipthe Labour party wishes Trans-Australia Airlines to operate in fair competition with Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, it should agree that the conditions governing the competition should be the same. The suggestion of the honourable member for Maribyrnong that this legislation is a beneficial act to given to the chamber about the financial Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited seems to indicate that Trans-Australia Airlines cannot operate so -efficiently as Australian National Airways (Proprietary Limited. I do not propose 'to labour that point, but point out that the whole of the argument advanced by the honorahle gentleman falls to the ground. It was obviously manufactured for the purpose of trying to give Trans-Australia Airlines protection which would put it on a better footing than Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. The honourable gentleman also directed -attention to other matters such as the fact that Trans-Australia Airlines paid .a certain amount in petrol tax and air route charges. Naturally, Trans-Australia Airlines has paid those taxes, and obviously, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited pays petrol tax and pay-roll tax at the same rates. Why should not the two organizations be placed on a comparable basis? The argument advanced by the honourable member defeats itself. He says that Trans-Australia Airlines pays all those taxes, and 'complains that it has to pay ""another tax that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited has paid for years. I support the bill. help contrasting the treatment which the action to be necessary if honourable mem^Government is giving to Australian bers were to be in a position to know National Airways. Proprietary Limited whether Australian National Airways with the reception given by the Treasurer proprietary Limited required assistance. ( Sir Arthur Fadden) to a request that II am not astonished that the Government made a few months ago with respect to the imposition of sales tax on school equipment. The right honourable gentleman replied that no rebate could be given, because the amendment of the act which provided for the reduction of sales tax on such equipment, would come into operation at a certain date, and that the Government could not be expected in any circumstances to make the provision retrospective. Of course, nothing can be ment or any other social requirements, but the Government finds no difficulty whatsoever in placing on the statute-book an extraordinary provision to assist a privately-owned airline. The simple fact, which Government supporters cannot deny, is that no information has been affairs of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, yet we are now being asked to grant hundreds of thousands of pounds to that organization. The Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck), who is in charge of the bill, referred briefly in his second-reading speech to an examination that had been conducted by an independent authority at the request of the Government into the financial structure and operating costs of Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited respectively. As the result of that examination, the Government has made up its mind to grant substantial assistance to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. Yet the Minister referred only briefly in his second-reading speech to a loss made by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited in the last two years. No further information has been given to honourable members about the financial position of that enterprise. Some months ago, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) spoke of the examination of the financial affairs of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, and I asked him. whether he would consider the advisability of making the report",58,Paiks

The Liberal and Australian Country parties believe in free enterprise, private enterprise and fair competition. ' The Labour party has demonstrated its attitude clearly and has stated that it is determined by one means or another to establish socialist monopolies in this country. The Opposition has fought this bill, which is designed to provide for fair competition between airline operators and in its fight it has used every means at its disposal.

The 'Labour party had the biggest thrashing that it has ever had in this country over socialism, and we is completely shall fight it on that issue any time it likes. This bill and others that have been before the committee to-day, are designed to establish free competition. I remind honourable members opposite that three out of every four employees in Australia are employed by private enterprise. I also remind them that the attitude of the Labour party has shown that its desire to create a monopoly in airline operations is merely the forerunner of its attempts to create monopolies in the medical profession, banking business and other fields of activity. This Government, which believes in private enterprise and free competition, does not oppose State ownership in proper cases. We are not abolishing Trans-Australia -Order! The Airlines, which we recognise as an effective service. We believe in competition between Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. Both companies are rendering magnificent service to the people, and we propose to maintain that excellent service which is infinitely better than the service provided by the monopolist State railways or other monopoly transport services in this country. We have heard much during this debate about the merits of Trans-Australia Airlines. I do not deny that it is an effective concern, but no one should hold the idea that it has been a great and profitable government undertaking. The Auditor-General's report about the company's finances was distributed to honourable members to-day. The Auditor-General states that during the year ended the 30th June, 1952, Trans-Australia Airlines suffered a loss of £74,438. Its accumulated loss to the 30th June, 1952 is now £870,000. Honourable members opposite have mentioned school equipment. Would it not be much better if that £870,000 had been spent on school equipment rather than that it should have been lost on a government enterprise ? the honourable The only justification for expenditure on Trans-Australia Airlines is that it is providing means to maintain competition",60,Paiks

I do not complain because Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited have both sustained losses. That is the reason why the Government has seen fit to reduce landing charges. The measure to reduce those charges was strenuously opposed by the Labour party. Apparently the Labour party wants to impose prohibitive charges on the people and industry of Australia. It opposed the proposal to reduce taxation, and now it is opposing the proposal to make a statement on the unemployto reduce landing charges. The matter has already been dealt with. The honourable member must deal with the matter contained in the bill. with arrangements between the two companies. The CHAIEMAN -Order!

Both these concerns have been suffering losses, therefore the Government has reduced taxation and fees to an amount within their capacity to pay. The position of the companies is not unusual. report, British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines are shown as having lost £88,000 during the year. Consequently, it is clear that the taxes and charges which have been imposed on airline concerns in general during the last few years have been in excess of their capacity to pay. This Government, taking a realistic attitude, has reduced those charges, has provided for fair competition and has given both Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited an opportunity to carry on successfully on a competitive basis.

Opposition) [11.1] --The honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson) claimed that this measure is designed to encourage active competition between Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. That statement is completely incorrect. This measure is the culminating point of a number of bills that will practically end competition.

All their talk about monopolies is untrue, because they favour the establishment of monopolies so long as private profit will result therefrom. It is clear from this bill that we are reaching a stage at which the whole legislative power of this Government, wbich is supported by parties which favour monopolies and exploitation for private profit, is being used in the interests of those who stand to gain such profits. I suppose there has never been a precedent for this measure. The bald position is that for the last five years Australian National Airways Proprietary be reported w it h o u t amendment. Limited, which is owned by the shipping combines, has in defiance of a regulation delayed payment of a sum in respect of ( THE CHAIRMAN-MR . C. F. ADERMANN.) air-route charges amounting to approximately £1,000,000. Under a cognate measure, that company is to be let off with the payment of £330,000 in respect of such charges. That means that the Bute, Jeff Government is putting into the pockets of Beale, those who own Australian National Bland, F . A.

The CHAIEMAN -Order! right honourable gentleman must confine his remarks to the bill. with the honourable member for Sturt in respect of the Government's plan as a whole. I deny that the Government proposes to establish free and fair competition. Indeed, every proposal under this measure and cognate measures will put a stop to active competition. But, at the same time, the Government is doing everything in its power to ensure that the shipping combines which own Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and which are making enormous profits shall get the full advantage of these measures. Under this bill alone, the advantage that those companies will derive during the next fifteen years will be worth probably, from £5,000,000 to £6,000,000. The CHAIEMAN -Order!

HARRISONThat the bill be now read a second time. important bill to amend the Customs Act will empower the Government 'to make regulations in order to cope with a new situation that has arisen as a result of the development of air transport. A large volume of imports is now brought to Australia, by air and discharged at airports. Therefore, it is essential that the customs authorities should have greater power than is now provided by the Customs Act to police the entry and [130] despatch of goods by air. The bill also includes provisions to facilitate the removal of goods from bond by importers for the purposes of exhibition in show cases and similar places. Other provistores and will enable the Department of Trade and Customs to protect the revenue by policing the use of such commodities. Generally, the nieasure will remove anomalies that have become apparent as a result of the passage of time and the expansion of air transport services. The measure is very extensive and the House should have been given However, it does not include any objectionable, provisions and the Opposition will uot oppose its passage. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: The bill. I refer to the power, which will be conferred upon the Governor General by clause 7, to make regulations to prohibit the importation of goods. I have no doubt that that power already exists, but it is to be exercised by prohibiting the importation of goods absolutely, by prohibiting the importation of goods from specified places, and by prohibiting the importation of goods unless specified conditions or restrictions are complied with. There is a good deal of public interest in the question of restrictions upon the importation of goods. At the present time, the Government, by regulation, is excess of 20 per cent, of those within a certain category, and 40 per cent, of those within another category. This might be an appropriate time for the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) to say when the Government intends to let trade flow a little more easily, so that a lot of factories that are now closed can be re-opened and a lot of people who are now out of employment as a result of the Government's import policy can be re-employed, which is much to be desired. It is proper that attention should be drawn to the fact",64,Pairs

275,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [11.29].,"that never before in Australian history have import restrictions been applied for so long. At only one other period in the history of Australia has a total prohibition upon the importation of goods been maintained for a period. That was in the days of the Scullin Government, and it was only for a short period. We have no information about when the Government proposes to l if t the restrictions that are now in force. As far as we know, the restrictions may remain in force for another year or for another two years. Doubtless, when the Vice-President of the Executive Council leads his cohorts in the Bradfield by-election campaign, he will be asked many questions about that matter. He would save himself much time if he made the position of the Government clear now. -Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) [11.32] -The effect of the repeal and re-enactment of Division1 of Part4 will be that goods which are now prohibited imports will be prescribed in the regulations. At the present time, goods which are prohibited imports are enumerated in the Customs Act, in the Customs Regulations and in the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. The powers already in this division, which relate to prohibiting the importation of goods absolutely or from specified places or subject to certain conditions or restricmeaning of the phrase "" Commonwealth tions being complied with, are proposed to be re-enacted. A new paragraph has been included which provides that the importation of goods may be prohibited unless licensed in terms of the regulations, and that such licence may be subject to conditions or requirements to be complied with before or after importation. Provision is made also for the furnishing of securities for compliance with bhe legislation, and for compliance with the conditions of requirements to which the licence is subject. That is all the amendment is designed to do. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), in his reply to a question that was addressed to him to-day about overseas balances, made it perfectly clear that the Government is watching import restrictions very carefully, and that, when the time is right to take the necessary action to l if t them, we shali certainly take such action. Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment j report adopted. Bill-by leave-rea d a third time. Debate resumed from the Sth October (vide page 2688), on motion by Mr That the bill be now read a second time. The Opppsition has no objection to the bill as it appears on the surface. 1 understand, however, that several, if not all, of the State governments have expressed some concern about it. A regulation, called regulation 66, was promulgated in war-time to facilitate the handling and transport of explosives. The Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck), in his second-reading speech on the measure, has pointed out that it is intended to continue regulation 66, though in statutory form, because it is necessary in peace-time, as in war-time, to avoid delay arising from normal methods of handling explosives. The bill appears to relate only to Commonwealth explosives, which are explosives required or utilized by the Commonwealth for defence purposes. Clause2 defines the explosives "". The Minister, in his second-reading speech, said alsoI t has been found necessary, therefore, to continue the operation of regulation 06 up to the present time. A review recently made at the direction of the Government revealed the need for the Australian Government to have permanent powers governing the safe and expeditious movement of explosives to meet the defence requirements of the Commonwealth in both peace and war. The Opposition does not quarrel with that statement. But, as I have said already, several, if not all, of the State governments have expressed concern about .the measure. Erom what we have heard from our colleagues in State parliaments and from members of the Senate who have been associated with the handling of explosive materials, it",65,Oustoms Bill 1952 Second Reading
276,Mr Eric J. Haeeison (Wentworth,,66,Haslucki
277,Mr Tom Btjeke (Perth) [11.34],"appears that safety factors are mvolved. In a letter that I have been given by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate it is statedThe Tasmanian Government, under certain circumstances, are concerned with the possibilities under this bill. Their first concern appears to be the hazards associated with handling munitions. They believe that, in an endeavour to get expedition, the Government may be sacrificing safety and indulging in assurance from the Minister and from the Government that no safety measures w ill be sacrificed in order to get expedition. It is clear to the House that steps taken to handle munitions expeditiously could cause a great tragedy. An explosion could occur, the results of which would be much worse than would be slower handling of explosives with better safety precautions. Some, if not all, of the State governments believe that Commonwealth intervention in this matter might slow down and not expedite the handling of explosives. In the opinion of some State governments, the effect of the operation of the measure could be to delay the turn-round of ships and the general handling of explosives. At this stage, we cannot say whether the objections of the State governments have been met. We do not know whether the State governments have been consulted upon the matter, or whether they have agreed with what the Government now proposes and with an amendment which, I understand, will be moved in the Senate. We ask the Government to give full consideration to representations made by the States. The State governments have issued regulations and installed facilities for the handling of explosives. After long experience, they have evolved the safety measures that are required. Their wishes should be considered, and their methods of handling explosives should be taken into consideration. This is a measure upon which unanimous agreement should be reached between the Commonwealth and the States. It may be said that the Opposition should have ascertained whether the objections raised by the States have been met, but I point out to the House that, until half an hour ago, honourable members on this side of the chamber were unaware that the Government intended to proceed with the measure. Some time ago, we were told that the measure had been deferred, pending consultation in an endeavour to achieve unanimity of opinion among the various authorities. We have not been told whether such unanimity has yet been achieved. We are concerned only ' that the methods of handling explosives shall be such as to ensure, not only expedition but also the unnecessary hazards. We seek an maximum degree of safety. The Minister for Mines in the Tasmanian Government, in a letter addressed to Senator McKenna, has said that if the measure is to be used solely to expedite the handling of Commonwealth -supplies for military and other purposes, there appears to be no valid objection to it, but the Tasmanian Director of Mines, in a memorandum, has pointed out that if the measure is intended to cut across the powers of the States with regard to ordinary commercial cargoes, some real difficulties may arise. The Opposition says that those matters ought to be resolved, in consultation with State authorities, to the satisfaction of all concerned. There appears to be no reason why that should not be done. Itmay be said by the Minister that ths powers envisaged by the bill were exercised by a Labour government in war-time. That is true. But in war-time we sacrificed many things for the sake of expedition. The urgent need for haste that exists in war-time does not necessarily exist in peace-time also. Therefore, we ask that the claims of the States be met, and that the arguments that they have put forward be examined, so that the measure in its final form will represent a unanimous agreement between the States and the Commonwealtb Opposition) [11.42] I wish to supplement the remarks that the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) has made about this measure, which is not an unimportant one. In time of war, the Commonwealth has complete authority, not only in relation to explosives but also in relation to the places in which explosives may go. If a Commonwealth explosive, or an explosive which the Commonwealth is using or is about to use, has to go to a certain place in time of war, the Commonwealth, under the defence power, can",66,Haslucki
278,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Leade r of thecontrol the wharf there. But there are clauses of this measure whicli, unless they were operated in co-operation with the States-whic h means with the consent of the States-coul d not be justified under the defence power. Let me give an illustration. The definition of Commonwealth explosives covers ordinary explosives which are in the possession, control or ownership of the Commonwealth. It includes explosives that are capable of being used by the naval, military or air forces of the Commonwealth. It could cover an explosive of which the Commonwealth did not intend .to take possession. It would probably be held that the defence power did not give the Commonwealth authority over any explosive simply because it was capable of being used by the Commonwealth for defence purposes. ' Almost any explosive could come within that definition. Clause5 (2.) (6) proposes that the Commonwealth shall have power to make regulations for or in relation to the mooring, berthing or other movement of vessels, and vessels in the vicinity of vessels, in which Commonwealth explosives are, or. are to be, loaded. Such regulations would give the Oommonwealth power, not merely over the transport of the explosives to a vessel in a truck but over surrounding places which were under the complete control of a State. Clause5 (2.) (e) would authorize the issue of regulations relating to the handling of substances other than Commonwealth explosives at, in or upon a place, vehicle, aircraft or vessel at, in, upon or in the vicinity of which there were Commonwealth explosives. This provision is an attempt to apply, in time of peace, regulations that were valid in time of war when the defence power of the Commonwealth were so extensive. It is a most doubtful method, and the lesson to be learned from it is simply that those regulations cannot safely operate, from the legal point of view, in the various States without the consent of the State departments that control explosives. If , however, that position is safeguarded, there can be no objection to the bill. It is essential, however, that there be co-operation between the Commonwealth and States in this matter. Without such co-operation the Commonwealth might Or. Evatt. attempt to exercise powers that could be held to be invalid. Given co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States, however, Commonwealth action would not be challenged. support the views of my two colleagues that we, as an Opposition, cannot reasonably take exception to the Commonwealth's assumption, by act of Parliament, of effective control over Commonwealth explosives and, for that matter, over all explosives. I take it that it is the intention of the bill, although rather vaguely defined, to control, in certain circumstances, explosives belonging to State governments, semi-government authorities within a State, and private enterprise in the various States. I believe that this is the first measure to deal with explosives that has ever been put on the Commonwealth statute-book. It is true that during the war we had the National Security Act and the regulations thereunder, which empowered the Commonwealth to take effective control over the movement, storage and safe handling of explosives. The point I wish to emphasize is that whilst an apparently effective control of explosives operated during the war, there might have been an element of good luck as well as good management in the effectiveness of that control. It is an outstanding fact that in no State of the Commonwealth has there ever been a really serious explosion as a result of the bad handling, storage, or movement of explosives under State control. Possibly that statement is also true in respect of Commonwealth explosives. The Minister's second-reading speech included no assurance to this Parliament that the Commonwealth authorities who will police the measure will take every care to ensure that the authorities in the various States which have so successfully dealt with this problem in the past will be consulted effectively regarding the future control of explosives. No assurance is given that fire brigades, who after all, are the authorities which have to take the risks when there is an explosion in a port or harbour or explosives reserve, will be consulted in respect of any regulations that it is proposed to make. I wish",67,Haslucki
279,Mr Pollaed (Lalor) [11.48],"Ito emphasize for the information of the House and of the authorities that will administer the legislation that the Commonwealth should go to very great lengths to ensure that there shall be the most effective co-operation in the future between the Commonwealth and the State authorities that administered the control of explosives so efficiently in the past, as well as with fire brigades. Unfortunately, public welfare has been endangered in the past as a result of a lack of co-operation between has been most effective, and I hope, that governmental authorities within the States, and between the Commonwealth itself and State authorities. Sometimes actual disaster has overtaken people as the result of the utter disregard of the need for such co-operation. ber said only a moment ago that no disasters had occurred in the States. Why is he wasting time ? member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) had a little more intelligence he might have been able to .divine the point that I am leading up to. I was about to give a concrete example of such a lack of co-operation as I have mentioned. It does not directly affect explosives, but it is a House. pertinent example of past cases of carelessness that have resulted from lack of co-operation between two State authorities, which has occasioned great loss of life and property. The co-operation for which I plead would obviate such damage and loss of life. I refer to the fact that in Victoria there has been almost a complete lack of co-ordination between Victorian railway authorities and the Forests Commission of Victoria in respect of the fire-burning activities of the railway authorities. The Victorian Railways Department is now very active in its desire to co-operate with the forestry authorities in order to avoid future disasexplosives, but relates solely to Commonters in Victoria, because in a recent court wealth explosives. The second point case heavy damages were awarded against the railway authorities. I wish to emphasize that without a high degree of cooperation in regard to explosives between the Commonwealth and States, disasters could easily occur. That statement does not nullify my previous remark that in the. past we have been very fortunate in that we have had no serious explosions in this country. My electorate includes, the Altona explosives reserve, which, under State control, has shipped and stored explosives for as long as I can remember. When World WarI . broke out I was called on, as a member of the Citizen Military Foroesj, to go on guard duty at the Altona explosives reserve. That reserve ie still there. The work of the State; authorities in the control of explosives the Commonwealth will ensure that every care and consideration will be given for human life and the protection of .property in the future. Other countries 'havesuffered shocking disasters caused by explosives. Everybody remembers theHalifax disaster. The Commonwealth^, freedom from serious explosions in ports and harbours .during the last war was; perhaps due more to good luck than to. good management. I hope that we shall' not thereby be lulled into a false sense off"" security, and that the staff established topolice the law, and the Minister in charge of that staff, will take every care 'toensure that there shall be the utmost co-operation between all the interested authorities. I commend the bill to the Territories) [11.57] -in reply-The bill relates to Commonwealth explosives only, and "" Comonwealth explosives"" are defined in it as meaning explosiveswhich are the property of, or are in the possession or control of, the Commonwealth .and are for use, or are capable of bemg used(a) by the naval, military or air forces of the Commonwealtli; or (6) otherwise for, or for purposes related to, the defenoe of the Commonwealth; This is not a general measure regarding; that I wish to deal with is that raised! by the honourable member for Perth( Mr. Tom Burke).

Those harbour authorities and governments wanted it to be made clear in the measure that the actual allocation of berths, the movements of vessels in ports and the safety measures that were to be taken in ports, would remain the functions of the appropriate harbour authorities. It was never intended that this bill should interfere with the powers of the harbour authorities, but, in order that the position might be made abundantly clear, a series of conferences was held between representatives of the harbour authorities and representatives of the Commonwealth departments concerned with the movement of explosives. As the result of those discussions agreement has been reached on a number of amendments to clauses 5 and 6. These amendments will preserve to the harbour authorities the internal control of their ports and will also enable the Commonwealth to provide for the safe and expeditious handling'of 'Commonwealth explosives. Provision will also be made for consideration to be given by the Commonwealth, before regulations under this bill are drafted, to any recommendations made by the harbour authorities. Those two matters are both to be expressed in amendments to be introduced when the bill is before the Senate. The reason for the proposal to introduce the amendments in the Senate instead of in this chamber is simply that that procedure will achieve a certain economy both of time and expense in relation to printing. Any amendments to be moved in the other chamber will be submitted in due course to this House. I assure the Honse that the amendments to clauses 5 and 6 will produce the results I have mentioned. I also wish to add that the existing legislation under which consultation must be had with the appropriate authorities before orders are made, will be continued in relation to orders made under this bill. In that connection I direct the attention of the House to thc fact that in the past three years twelve orders have been made under the existing legislation, and all of them were made after consultation, and in complete agreement, with the State authorities, concerned. That system will certainly continue. I also wish to assure the honourable member for Perth that no safety Mr Hasluck. measure will be sacrificed simply for the sake of gaining more speed in"" handling. The whole purpose of the measure is to ensure safety and to make it absolutely certain that any expedition in handling will not be achieved at the expense of the requisite standard of safety.

Debate resumed from the 23rd October (vide page 3660), on motion by Mr able in abundance. That condition no That the bill be now read a second time. --The Opposition does not oppose this measure, but I take this opportunity to make a few remarks that are pertinent to it. Although the-Minister for Social Services( Mr Townley) is in charge of the measure, it has a slant that relates to immigration because its object is to legalize a practice that has beeii in vogue since 1947. I refer to the provision of social services benefits to immigrants and the making of a deduction from such payments in respect of the board and lodging of immigrants at departmental hostels which are now controlled by Commonwealth Hostels Limited. A vast difference exists between the reason for making such payments to immigrants in 1947 and that which exists for making them to-day. In 1947, it was merely a matter of assimilating immigrants who were flowing into this country at a time when they could be readily absorbed in industry; and were boarded at hostels until employment was found for them. In those days, immigrants seldom had to wait longer than six weeks-in many instances the period was much shorter-befor e they were placed in industry. During that period they were given a rudimentary grasp of the language and were conditioned to some degree to' help themselves when they went to work in primary or secondary industry. To-day, however, these hostels are becoming the last resort of the immigrant who is unemployed. Therefore, it is appropriate to refer to the immigration position as a whole. This bill provides that a proportion of us back home "". On that point, they are social services benefit payable to immi-at one with the honourable member for grants shall be retained by the hostel Henty( Mr Gullett). The hostels are authority acting for the Government, and that the remainder of the benefit shall be made available as pocket money to them. The provision of accommodation at hostels-thi s applies to both restricted immigrants and British immigrants-is becoming something of a racket. Originally, it was intended that the hostels scheme, which has not previously come before the Parliament for consideration, was to be only a phase through which the immigrant passed to work that was availlonger applies. Whilst it might be fairer to increase the unemployment benefit payable to immigrants, such a proposal cannot be considered because under it immigrants would receive benefit in excess of the rate being paid to Australians who happen to be unemployed. The immigration plan in general has deteriorated with the result that to-day these hostels are merely holding camps for immigrants who are unemployed, whereas previously they were staging camps through which immigrants passed as hurriedly as possible to an economy that was demanding men and women to fill a long list of jobs in numerous categories. To-day, when there are at least 100,000 persons unemployed in this country, the position has radically changed. These immigrants have been brought to Australia under contract which I for one, when I was engaged directly in immigration matters, thought was a guarantee of work for two years. The mere fact that the department has asked that the practice of making deductions in . respect of board from social services benefit be legalized is an indication of the widespread discontent that now exists among many immigrants. Recently, riots, or demonstrations, by Italian immigrants have occurred. their own country. here, we have a responsibility, in decency, to ensure that something is done for them. The charter of the immigrant was concise, clear, and unanswerable.

The Government must admit that it cannot have a full or reduoed scheme, or even the unhappy remnants of a once vast immigration scheme, without the prerequisite of full employment. There must be jobs available for immigrants who look for them. Unfortunately, jobs are not now available and, as a consequence, this hostel problem has arisen. Eecently, a number of Italian immigrants marched from their hostel into Sydney and demanded of their consul that either jobs be found for them or they be repatriated to Italy. According to some reports, those immigrants had been unemployed for periods up to ten weeks. They pointed out that they did not come to Australia either to live in a hostel or to draw a dole. submit that the honourable member is not dealing with the bill before the -Chair. member to confine his remarks to the bill. Mr Speaker, and I dare say that the Government is very happy that this is such a restricted bill. I have wandered a little in order to seek an explanation of why the bare bones of a bill like this should be brought down at this time of the morning. Perhaps the reason is the Government's anxiety in connection with the crowded hostels. Since the debate has been restricted I shall content myself by saying that there is nothing wrong with the business principle involved, but there is a great deal wrong with the immigration system, which has gone to pot. The bill is merely a futile attempt to stop up some of the holes. If the Government wants to get back from the immigrants the value of the food that it has given to them while they have been withering away in crowded hostels, it should restore a condition of full employment.

I desire to take this opportunity to direct the attention of the House to a most serious and urgent matter, upon which I had expected the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Holt) to make a statement to-day. It is the situation that arises out of the disturbances by Italian immigrants in Sydney. They protested against the Government's refusal to carry out the promise that it made to them when it induced them to come to Australia. The serious aspect of the matter is that the Minister has endeavoured to get around the difficulty by once again using the old stock argument that the Communists have been responsible for I bow to your ruling, stirring up the trouble. On the other hand the Italian Consul in Sydney has made definite statements that these men have no -fixed political opinions, and that all they want is work. The Consul stated that, in any case, they were not Communists when they left Italy. The logical inference to be drawn is that if they have been influenced towards communism it is as a result of their treatment by the present Government, which has refused to honour its promise to provide them with work. The Minister admitted in a statement that he issued to the press that the Government is under a moral obligation to find work for these people. Initially, he tried to escape any responsibility by saying that there was no legal obligation on the Government to provide them with work. Australian ex-servicemen and others have been dismissed from various government establishments, including Royal Australian Air Force stations, and replaced iby Italian immigrants. The Minister has admitted to almost 300 such dismissals. If there is p. moral obligation on the Government to",74,Townley

Government to provide work for Australian ex-servicemen. The Goverament is not honouring that obligation. It proposes now to scatter the unfortunate people that have been brought to Australia on false pretences *hronghout the country areas, where, supporters of the Government hope, they <wili have less opportunity to take direct -action and demonstrate against the vfioverament. .Although the labour position in this xjountry was already very acute, the Minister proceeded overseas and signed further immigration agreements to bring additional immigrants to this country. The Government now hopes that some of the immigrants may he absorbed in harvesting work, which is a seasonable occupation, and that it may be able to find a few other jabs for them here and there. The Minister for Social Services{ Mr Townley) stated in answer to a question in the House yesterday that 30;000 persons are registered for unemployment benefit. If we multiply that numthat the immigration programme has been ber by four, we may gain a picture of the true position, which is, that approximately 120,000 people are unemployed in this country and eager to obtain work. Many of them are ex-servicemen. The Minister for Immigration has stated that there is a moral obligation on the Government to provide work for the immigrants. Certainly there is an obligation on the Government to find work for immigrants that it has brought to this country under false pretences. Rut there is also an obligation on the Government to provide work for Australians, particularly ex-, servicemen, to whom the Government has promised so much. The Minister has also stated that, as the Government could not cut off the immigration scheme completely, it reduced the proposed intake during this financial year from 160,000 to 80,000 immigrants. guess work on the part of the Government to conclude that that number of jobs was available for skilled men, and that there were no skilled men here seeking them. The press of foreign countries is now very critical of the attitude of the Australian Government to the immigraMr Ward. tion plan; I prefer to think of it as an immigration scheme, because there has been no actual planning at all. That is my great complaint in regard to it. The Government has set out to get numbers regardless of quality and whether or not there is adequate housing available in Australia ""for the immigrants. Before the Parliament goes into recess the Government should tell the House and the people what it proposes to do to fulfil the promises that it has made to the immigrants, and also what it proposes to do to absorb unemployed Australians. Many women, including single girls, who are dependent on their earnings for their livelihood, have been dismissed from government departments. The various State governments have been compelled to dismiss many employees who have been engaged on public works. Despite this state of affairs, the Government still persists in bringing immigrants to Australia. Why was not immigration completely cut off .until the country had had an opportunity to absorb all of the immigrants who were already here? I do not think the Minister will deny highly inflationary. It has placed an additional strain, for example, on our educational and hospital facilities and upon our food supplies. Furthermore, it has swollen the ranks of the unemployed. The Labour Government argued that, if Australia was developed rapidly, we could absorb additional settlers without damaging the economy. But this Government is not planning development. It is carrying out a programme of deflation and. throwing men out of work on essential undertakings while, at the same time, it continues to bring thousands of immigrants to the country. It is of no avail for the Minister to try to dismiss the disturbances in Sydney by saying merely that they are due to Communist agitation. The Italian Consul-General denies that It was mere assertion, and no sensible member of the community will accept it as an explanation of the trouble. It is true that the Communist party as a political organization is fully alive to the advantages that it can gain from every such situation. But it did not bring the immigrants to Australia. ' It did not promise them employment. It did not promise the community that full employment would he preserved. Responsibility for the honouring of those promises rests with this Government, and it cannot escape that responsibility merely by saying that the Communists are stirring up trouble. There will be much more trouble unless the Government carries out its undertaking to provide full employment both for Australian citizens and for new settlers. BeforefcheParliament goes into recess, the Minister should submit some practical plan to us instead of indulging in long, wordy statements such as he has been accustomed to make and for which he is now being criticized by newspapers that normally support the Government. That is the only course of action that will, will consult the results of the last general satisfy the immigrants. One can readily understand their feelings. No doubt they have families to support overseas. They were brought to Australia on the understanding that they would be provided with work. Now they are housed in hostels under very unsatisfactory conditions and with very little money with which to provide the necessaries of life that are not supplied at the hostels. The Government should act by calling a halt to immigration immediately. able member's time has expired. It seems to me to be absurd, simply because a few hundred Italian immigrants have seen fit to stage some sort of a riot in Sydney, to condemn the whole immigration scheme, which this Government, in fact, inherited, for better or for worse, largely from the Labour Government. It is rather unsatisfactory, and even contemptible, of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who was the great champion of immigration, and other honourable members opposite to sit back quietly and give tacit support to the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr that the people who have come to AusWard) when he declares that the whole immigration programme should stop. The honourable gentleman expressed a point of view, but we must make up our minds that, if the whole immigration programme does stop, we shall lose this country in the course of the next 50 or 100 years. We cannot' possibly maintain it as a white man's country at our present rate of intake. That is the hard core of the matter, whether we like it or not, and nobody realizes the fact more clearly than does the honourable member for Melbourne. We bring immigrants to Australia, not necessarily because it delights us to do so, but because we know that we must do so. I return to the subject of the disturbances in Sydney. I say that Italians are unsatisfactory as immigrants. Let us not bring any more of them to our country. If those who are here are trouble-makers, let us send them back to Italy. It is all very well for the honourable member for East Sydney to say that there are no Communists among them. How does he know that? If he election in Italy and see what proportion of the population voted for Communists, he must surely agree that, amongst the thousands who have come to this eountry, there must be some Communists. Of course there are very many Communists among them. I say now, as I always have said, that we have made a grievous mistake in placing the accent on numbers in our immigration programme. Of what service is it to the defence of this country to bring thousands of men of that sort here? Where will they be in time of trouble? The situation is absolutely ludicrous. The time has come for us to run the rule over our sources of immigration. Unless we do so and put an end to this policy of bringing people to Australia from here, there and everywhere, simply because they think they would like to come here, we shall find ourselves in the not distant future, like South America, nothing better or worse than another "" dago "" nation. a.m.] I should not have risen to engage in the debate but for the display of racial bigotry by the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett).

310,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [1.16,"good. Contemptuous references to people from Italy as ""dagoes"" are just the sort of vulgarian, brutal of fascism. That sort of talk is designed to prevent the assimilation of these immigrants. People may talk of German immigrants as "" H u n s a n d apply other derogatory expletives to Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian immigrants, but the truth is that there flows in the veins of most Australians of second-generation birth the blood of two or three different races. There are few Australians of pure English, Scots, Irish or Welsh descent. A mixture of bloods makes for virility. We should take note of the example of the United States of America, because that country is the leading power in the world to-day, and we are glad to recognize it as such. We are wondering at the moment whether the next President of the United States of America will be a man with the not Eisenhower. That gentleman is a very distinguished American. The attitude of the Labour party on immigration was clearly defined in a statement that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) made at the beginning of the current sessional period. The right honourable gentleman declared then that, because of economic conditions, immigration ought to be temporarily restricted to the families immigrants coming here both this year of those who are already in the country and to individuals with special skills. Of course, we cannot interfere with those who pay their own way or whose passages are paid for by relatives and friends. That is the policy that the Labour party has defined, and I see no reason why I should rise in order to explain it whenever the honourable member for Henty makes a wild and irresponsible attack upon some group of immigrants or comes, unsolicited, to the defence of the Minister for Immigration ( Mr from Canada and Australia. He said, Holt). I think that the Minister could do very well without the doubtful assistance that the honourable member thrusts upon him. This talk of sending people back to their native countries will not help to solve our problems. They are here. We should make them happy. We should try to employ them. I believe that the trouble that this Government is experiencing in the absorption of immigrants is due to economic factors and the absence of full employment. I agree with the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) that an immigration scheme can function only if we have full employment-no t over-full employment, but full employment. If we are to have a number of people continuously out of work we shall run into difficulties such as the United States of America has experienced from time to time. Since 1924, that country has restricted immigration to approximately 150,000 persons a year I hope that we shall never be obliged to adopt that policy. I believe that unless we fill this country we shall lose it. I wish to see immigration succeed. I do not want to see people unhappy in Australia. Nobody in this country defends what those Italians did in their recent demonstrations, but all over Australia there is a tremendous wave of sympathy for them in their very Anglo-Saxon name of present predicament. It seems to me that they would be quite happy if they were properly employed, and I hope that the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Holt) will be able to find ways and means to employ all those who are being brought here. In my opinion the Minister is wise in temporarily restricting the numbers of and next year. However, under no circumstances should we say to British or non-British persons who wish to come here under their own steam, "" These doors are shut to you "". They cannot be shut. There will always be failures with immigration schemes. I remember well the words used in the House of Lords by young Lord Tweedsmuir when he was discussing the question of British immigrants returning to the United Kingdom"" These people are displaying more wishbone than backbone "". That may not be true in every instance, but it has a general ring of truth about it.

312,Mr Calwell,"Well, it does smacknow proud that they did so. I think that future* generations w ill be proud that under the last three parliaments we have brought people to Australia to help to develop the country. In my opinion, the Mmister and the Government should devote all their energies to the solution of the problems which confront Australians and nonAustralians alike. Let us not make a distinction between the Australian and non-Australian who happen to be out of work. If we do so we shall generate an antagonism to immigration which is most undesirable. greatly with Australians who are out of work and who consider that immigrants are being assisted by being given a certain amount of temporary work. The Government, at an early date, might perhaps see what it can do to reduce the number of unemployed Australians in order that those who are hostile to immigration shall not be able to carry on their work of poisoning public opinion against it . I do not know whether or not Communists incitedthe Italians recently. There may have been some Communist influence, although I have seen no evidence and have heard nothing to convince me that the Communists precipitated the riot. However, they may have taken advantage of the situation. Of course, they would not be true to their political philosophy and their outlook if they did not try to exploit every opportunity to discredit immigration. Communists do not want immigration to this country to succeed. the honourable member is addressing these remarks to the honourable member for East Sydney ("" MrW a r d ) . ber for East Sydney is entitled to his haphazard approach and a mere search views, which he stated very temperately for numbers, that a very influential, rehere to-night.

His own hostility to immigration is of long standing and has been demonstrated in a special for m during the term of oflice of this Government. H is repeated attacks on immigration, in which he has used any episode that could be diverted or twisted for his purpose, have I can sympathize become notorious. I do not imagine for one moment that he is making these attacks merely because he -feels strongly about the general question of immigration. In his long association with this Parliament he has never missed an opportunity to stir up bitterness and resentment by one section of the Australian community against another, if he thought that by doing so he could gain some political advantage. I am glad to find that in the attacks which he has made 30 repeatedly on our immigration programme he has not had behind him the general support of the members of the Opposition. 1 respect the attitude once more displayed by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) in his sober analysis of the situation as he sees it . It is only in the spirit of a national approach to one of the most vital national questions of our generation that we can hope to make The this programme succeed. If we do not make it succeed, we shall justly earn the condemnation of any later generation of Australians which is placed in peril by the failure of our efforts.

It is for that reason that we still have a few hundred more immigrants to come from Italy before ihese arrangements are concluded. Subject to that, we did everything we could to halt the movement of immigrants, and the numbers are approximately 5,000 less on that account. Mott of them have been successfully absorbed, some in temporary seasonal work but many in permanent occupations. [Extension of Lime granted.] I do not wish to detain the House but merely to get tl.K(acts straight. The honourable member for East Sydney spoke of the need to create additional work opportunities. The difficulty of so doing was stressed hy his colleague, the honourable member for Melbourne, who said that he did not wish to take discriminatory action in favour of one section of the community as against another. member for East Sydney apparently wants action to be taken to absorb these Italian immigrants and in .some way to avoid dislocation in other parts of the economy. That problem is by no means as simple as it looks. J assure the House that the Government is taking such measures as it is able to take to remedv the position. In the last few days arrangements have been made in country districts which should have the effect of absorbing a considerable number of those who are now looking for employment. Finally, let me deal with the charge that we have put these disturbances down to the influence of Communists. I do not say that the Communists have been directly or completely responsible for the demonstrations that have occurred. J assure the House that we have plenty of evidence of Communist activity and interest in trying to stir up these young Italian immigrants. I am certain that, for the most part, the immigrants do not know the people, or the background of the people, who have been trying to stir them up in that way. But we know [1.40 a.m.],I regret very much the their background, and we know what personal attack that has been made by the they have been up. to. ""We know that Minister for Immigration ( Mr Holt) they have been exerting such influence upon the honourable member for East as they can to cause trouble. I do not Sydney( Mr Ward). I deplore the suggest for a moment that these immiattitude that Government members adoptgrants, who were carefully selected and screened by us, are themselves Communists, or realize that they have been made the tools of Communist interests. But the Communist activity is there, and we are watching it as closely as we can. The charge that this trouble represents in some way a failure of our immigration programme is nonsensical. In the postwar years, this country has absorbed about 700,000 immigrants. Only a fractional percentage of that number has been in a position of difficulty during recent weeks. For most of that time, this particular group of immigrants have not been out of work. They have been provided with work as a result of a special allocation of funds that was made by this Government, in order to mitigate any hardship from which they were suffering. It is of interest to note that similar difficulties are not being experienced by immigrants of other nationalities. This year, we have received The honourable as many Dutch immigrants as Italians. We have had no difficulty in placing the Dutch people in employment. I think the explanation, at least in part, is that Dutch immigrants have a better knowledge of English than have Italian immigrants. Finally, I say that the interests of the nation would be served better by honourable members if , instead of trying to use every minor development that occurs in relation to a large immigration programme to criticize and discredit the Government and to weaken the confidence of the peoplo in that programme, they acted with a sense of national responsibility, and tried to give the people a balanced view of the great strength and advantage that has come to Australia as a result of an immigration programme which has heen implemented by governments of both political complexions, with a full sense of their responsibility to this generation and to the generations that will follow it.",79,Adjouenment Immigration Employment Trade
316,Mr Clyde Cameron (Hindmarsh),"whenever that honourable gentleman attempts to present his point of view. that the Minister saw fit to speak for the members of the Opposition and to say that, on this question, the honourable member for East Sydney has not the general support of his colleagues. The honourable member did not condemn the immigration policy to-night. He condemned only the action of the Government in bringing immigrants to this country and not finding work for them. On this subject every member of the Opposition is in complete agreement with the honourable member for East Sydney. We consider that the Government ought not to continue to bring large numbers of immigrants to Australia for whom it cannot find work. We do not contend that immigration should cease. I support completely the attitude of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr election is no excuse for trying to fool the Calwell). The Opposition believes that Australia must have as large a number of immigrants as possible, hut that they should be given work. That is the point of view of the honourable member for East Sydney. If the Government wishes to be able to obtain immigrants it must be able to provide them, with work. Whenever the honourable member for East Sydney protests in this House against the failure of the Government to provide work for immigrants, honourable members opposite allege that there is a difference of opinion persons unemployed Instead of the between that honourable member and the honourable member for Melbourne. We on this side of the House are completely united in our opinion that immigrants should be provided with work. This is a young and rich country and it is an absolute disgrace to every honourable member that we have to admit to the world that we are not able to provide full employment for immigrants. There is no reason why this country should not be able to provide full employment for at least -25,000,000 people and the'sooner we get them here the better. Only because of bad governnient are we unable to find full employment for our 8,500,000 people. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) said that at the commencement of the immigration scheme 140,000 jobs had been available. ilfr. Clyde Oameron. 3rd of October the Minister acting for the Minister for Labour and stated that 20,650 vacancies were registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. Can one believe that figure to be true? When it is compared with figures provided by the Department of Social Services serious discrepancies are noticeable. Which of the two departments can be relied upon to give the correct figures? How much longer must the Australian people be bamboozled with a lot of figures which are completely false or which have been badly compiled ? On the 15th October, the Minister for Labour and National Service declared in a public statement that the employment picture of September had a brighter tone than that of August. He made that statement just before the Elinders by-election but a bypeople into believing that unemployment is non-existent or that it is decreasing when the opposite is true. In the course of the same statement the Minister was forced to admit that the number of people in receipt of unemployment benefit was 27,595. Although the Minister commenced his statement with the announcement that the employment picture had a brighter tone, the Minister for Social Ser-: vices ( Mr Townley) has now been forced to admit that there are over 30,000 picture having a brighter tone, it is becoming worse. As the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Minogue) said, the actual number of people unemployed would be about 120,000 although they vvould not all be in receipt of unemployment benefit. In thc course of the statement to which I have referred the Minister for Labour and National Service said that at the 27th September the number of people in receipt of unemployment benefit in Victoria was 7,010 whilst in reply to a question which I asked the Minister for Social Services he stated that there were 7,033 persons in receipt of unemployment benefit in Victoria at that elate. There was not a great difference between those two figures but the mistake indicates how little reliance can On tbe be placed on the rest of the Minister's",81,Adjouenment Immigration Employment Trade
317,I T Is To Be Regretted Also National Service ( Mr Mcbride),"statement. The Minister for Labour and National Service stated that 954 people were in receipt of unemployment benefit in South Australia but the Minister for Social Services said that there were only 903 in that State in receipt of the benefit. The Minister for Labour and National Service said that 306 persons were in receipt of unemployment benefit in Tasmania whilst the Minister for Social Services said that there were 297 so situated. Apparently two responsible government departments have not been able to compile figures that coincide. The Minister for Labour and National Service said that 43,770 males and 13,062 females had registered for employment at the 26th September, a total of 56,832 persons. He addedBecause of procedural changes for checking that the nation is heading towards a whetlier applicants recorded as unplaced are still seeking employment it is not possible to make a valid comparison between the numbers registered for employment at 26th September and the numbers in previous months. Then, by a careful use of words, he made it appear that the number of people seeking unemployment benefit was gradually diminishing. He saidA valid comparison can be made of the weekly averages of the numbers registering for employment who claimed that they were unemployed. In September the weekly average was 11,238 or 1,000 less than the average for August. He did not state that he was referring to new registrations for employment. He did not state that although another 11,238 people registered as unemployed each week only 4,275 were placed in employment, leaving 6,963 who remained unemployed. If we take that figure as a criterion, the number of unemployed is increasing at the rate of nearly 7,000 a week. I believe that the Minister for Labour ancl National Service will soon issue another statenient for public consumption in view of the by-election that is to be held shortly in the Werriwa electorate. I suggest that before he issues that statement he should confer with the Minister for Social Services in order that he may inform the public of the facts and not issue a statement which, by a clever use of language, will make it appear that all is well. I take a very serious view of the position. I am very seriously concerned with the fact that this Government is destroying completely the magnificent immigration scheme that was instituted by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) when he was Minister for Immigration in the Chifley Government. I believe that the shabby way in which immigrants have been treated in this country since this Government came into oflice has been to the detriment of this nation. able gentleman's time has expired. a.m.] -The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) has attempted to justify the Labour party's cry that unemployment is increasing and depression. Surely this is not a time to be gloomy, to lose confidence in Australia or to do anything, for mere political advantage, that would cause ' panic. Surely this is a time when we should reaffirm our faith in this nation and grasp the opportunities that lie ready to our hand to increase our production and our markets and so increase employment and make Australia as prosperous as it should be. We know that the volume of retail sales in .Sydney is increasing tremendously, and that the public is buying to such a degree in Melbourne to-day as to give every indication that the coming Christmas will be a record Christmas in that city. Increased sales by retail stores will increase employment in tanneries and textile and other factories. Surely this is a time when .we should be ready to go on with the work of developing this country by taking the opportunities that are ready to our hands, so that immigration and employment may be maintained. However, incidents are happening in the electorates of some honourable members that give us cause for disquiet. I refer to the fact that Italians are being given employment in service establishments while Australians who have worked in these establishments and who have their homes near them, have lost their jobs. A constructive approach to the problem of employing Italian immigrants should be adopted. Such immigrants are men who could be housed",82,Adjouenment Immigration Employment Trade
318,Mr Speaker,Orde r ! The honor,83,Adjouenment Immigration Employment Trade
319,Mr Jeff Bate (Macarthur) [1.51,"in hostels or in work canips for two or three years, instead of heing given temporary employment in service establishments. They could be employed in some big national work such as the construction of a railway through central Australia deep into the beef country. Mr Beatty, an officer of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization, who gave an address to honourable members recently, after having made a f u l l investigation of the beef industry, told us that the answer to the problem of the beef industry was transport. A t this time, when sleeper-getters are being put out of work or put on part-time work, and timber workers are also looking for full-time employment, we should make a start on a railway through central Australia. The necessary timber and labour are now available. Italian immigrants would not be averse to going into workers' quarters in central Australia. A t the moment they are doing only a few weeks' work at a. time. E if t y Italians at Nowra have been put on to bushfire work, and their employment has caused temporary unemployment among Australians in Nowra. Italians would be willing and grateful to take the opportunity to go to central Australia to work on a railway line into the beef country. The necessity for that line provides an opportunity for some constructive and creative action that would be of value to us and to future generations. The railway blueprints are ready, and it would only be a matter of getting these men up into central Australia. There are plenty of sleepers stored in ports on thc north coast and south coast of New South Wales, and a start could be made in moving them towards central Australia. We do not disagree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that we must have immigration. It is true, however, that when the immigrants whose employment is at present a problem started on their voyage to this country jobs were available for them, but almost overnight the situation changed temporarily, and it is difficult to find work for them. In such a situation we should go ahead with national work of the kind that I have suggested. Motion putThat the question he now put. Mr Jeff Bate. The House divided. ( MB . SPEAKEB HON .

The importation of newsprint from the dollar area for each financial year since the Ist July, 1945, are set out hereunder:Year ending SOth Jane. Quantity. Value, f.o.b. Tons. £A. 1946 101,728 1,910,831 1947 163,284 4,288,716 1948 117,102 3,549,608 1949 42,549 1,452,776 1950 51,232 1,740,157 1951 3,515 175,727 1952 11,704 654,269 2. The allocation covering the licensing of newsprint from the dollar area is made on a tonnage 'basis and the tonnage authorized for the licensing year which commenced on the l s t April, 1952, is 20,000 tons. The price of newsprint varies according to the size and specification, but the average c.i.f. price per ton may he taken as £A.8o. 3. The quantity of dollar-area newsprint authorized for the current licensing year represents a reduction of 20 iper cent, on the quantity authorized for the previous licensing year. (There is a considerable time-lag between thc authorization of import licences and the importation of the goods.

This information discloses that the present -Government's addition sto section 9 6 M has greatly reduced the importance of the Chifley 'Government's section 96A, which has only once been resorted to since ithe present Government's changes in section 96M. AS we said at the time, prevention is better than cure. Of ithe 31 applications under section 9 6 M , sixteen ;are wholly attributable to the present Government's addition. The remaining fifteen were (made under provisions common to both governments, but only one was made before we amended the act. u p o n notice1.

Is it"" a fact that the Government has -declined to co-operate and has called upon the New South Wales Government to make funds available from Commonwealth A i d Roads Act moneys? 3. Isi t also a fact 'that many local government bodies are finding themselves in a parlous financial position as a result of reduced allocation, of funds, and that the employment of a considerable number of council employees is -endangered? 4. If so, will he confer with the Treasurer on the necessity for reviewing the decision which has been conveyed ""to the New South Wales Government in respect <of flood damage, and also take othor steps ""to -ensure that local -government bodies in all States are assured of sufficient finance to maintain roads in a satisfactory condition, and :also tto preserve continue d employment? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. Successive Commonwealth governments have foUowed the policy of confining Commonwealth flood relief payments to grants for relief of personal hardship. If it became a standard practice to make grants to assist in the repair of State or local authority assets damaged as a result of floods or other causes, the Commonwealth would be committed to the principle of accepting insurance risks on these assets. The Commonwealth therefore considers that as a general rule the cost of repairing such Pantrymen's assets should be met either from funds raised by the authorities themselves or from funds provided by the Commonwealth in accordance with existing Commonwealth-State financial arrangements. Thus in the present instance the Premier of New South Wales has heen reminded that any portion of the Commonwealth aid roads payments may be allocated by the State to local authorities for the repair of flood-damaged roads and bridges. These payments to New South Wales increased from £1^948,000 in 1948-49 to £4,173,000 in 1951-52. The Government has given very careful consideration to this matter and does not propose"" to vary its decision. 3 & 4. As responsibility for local authority matters rests with the respective State governments it would be beyond the province of. the Commonwealth to make grants direct to local authorities or to assume responsibility for their financial stability. It might be noted, however, that, in the current financial year, Commonwealth payments from Consolidated whilst the Commonwealth has also agreed to arrange special assistance of up to £135,000,000 in respect of the Loan Council programmesa total of more tlian £315,000.000. The extent to which local 1 authorities benefit as a result of this Commonwealth assistance is a matter for each State government to decide. the honourable member for P h ill i p ( Mr. F it z g e r a l d asked the f o l l o w in g question:Ist h "" Prime Minister in a position to inform the House the decision made as the result of the petition he received from employees of Commonwealth Hostels Limited?

328,Mr Menzies,"On the 1 8 th SeptemberSince the honourable member asked his question I have ascertained that, when the company took over the management of Commonwealth Hostelsi n January, 1952, permanent officers employed in the Hostels Division of tbe Department of Labour and National Service were given the option of accepting employment with the company or of remaining w it h in the Department itself. When they elected to accept such employment they were granted leave of absence fro m the Public Service by the Public Service Board and were employed under conditions which were f u l l y explained to them in writin g before they commenced employment with the company. In the case of temporary employees, the services of those who wished to accept employment with the company were terminated by the department and engaged by the company, again under conditions which were f u l l y explained. organization recently in the administrative staff of the company in its central and regional offices as a result of which the services of a number of employees have been terminated. Where such employees have been permanent officers of the Public Service, arrangements have heen made either for the department to re-employ them or for them to be placed in other branches of the Commonwealth Public Service. The re-organization has also resulted in a number of employees not permanent officers being retained by the company but in positions of a lower status. employees of the Commonwealth Public Service severed their connection with the Public Service when they took up employment with the company and were employed on conditions laid down by the company. It is for the company, exercising the normal rights of management, to determine whose services terminated. wpon notice1.

DOIXABS. honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua) asked the following question:Yesterday I received a reply to a question upon notice that I addressed to the Minister for National Development. The question sought information as to the amount of hard currency expended on the purchase of motor spirit for each of the last five years. Those figures have not been supplied to me. Will the Prime Minister gay if he has a direct knowledge of the amount of this important expenditure of dollars and, if not, will hc endeavour to obtain it and make it available to lionorable memhers? Further to my promise to have the information made available, I now advise the honorablo meniber that the following table shows the f.o.b. value of imports into Australia of petroleum and shale spirit, including petroleum and shale naphtha; benzine, benzoline, gasoline, pentane and petrol (for practical purposes this can be said to constitute motor spirit) :Imports Year. dollar area. £A.'000. 1948-49 1949-50 1950-61 1961-62 As has been pointed out by the Minister for National Development, these figures should not be interpreted as showing the dollar and non-dollar oost of motor spirit imports. Imports from the dollar area can be taken as costing 100 per cent, dollars, but there is also a dollar element in imports from other sources the extent of which cannot be ascertained because oil payments are dealt with through central accounts in London. upon notice1. Isi t a fact that a certificate of proficiency issued to a trainee under thc Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme upon the successful completion of a course in clerical work is not recognized by the Commonwealth Public Service Board, which rejects applications for employment where the applicant has not passed the leaving certificate examination? 2. Tf so, will he take action to correct this anomalous position? honourable member's questions are as follows:1 and 2. The certificates of proficiency issued to clerical trainees under thc Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme is not accepted for appointment as clerk in the Commonwealth Public Service. Investigation into the standard of the course in each State showed that unless trainees went on to complete public examinations they did not reach a standard equivalent to the examination set down in the Regulations to the Commonwealth Puhlic Service Act 1922-1947 which prescribe examinations accepted in the case of returned soldiers for appointment as clerk, thc minimum being the intermediate standard. Although the minimum qualification required from non-ex-servicemen is the leaving certificate examination or its equivalent, the qualification has been reduced in the case of ex-servicemen to the intermediate or its equivalent.

334,Mr Menzies,"On the 29th October)assumed that this Government approves of the course that is being followed? * It is assumed that the question refers to the recently announced release of Field Marsha] Kesselring and other' convicted German war criminals. The answer is "" No"". Major German war criminals were convicted by international tribunals and others by special national courts. Sentences imposed by the international tribunal at Nuremburg can only be reviewed by the four powers-Tjnited Kingdom, Tjnited States of America, France and Union of Soviet Socialist Eepublics-actin g in concert. No persons convicted by this tribunal have been released before the completion of the sentence passed on them. Eegarding persons convicted by national tribunals, this Government has followed the policy adopted by the Chifley Government, which decided that the review of sentences was a matter solely within the competence of the appropriate national legal authorities. The cases of persons in Germany who have been released on parole or who have had their sentences reduced, have heen reviewed hy advisory bodies representative of the Allied powers acting under the authority of the respective governments. It appears that reductions were granted wherever there appeared a legitimate basis for clemency, for example, where the sentence was not in keeping with the sentences for crimes of similar gravity in other cases; where the reduction appeared justified on the grounds of the relatively subordinate authority and responsibility of the defendants; where new evidence, not available to the court, supported such clemency; or in some cases because of the acute illness of the prisoner or other special circumstances of a similar nature. The Australian Government feels that the review of individual cases can be appropriately dealt with by the Allied authorities concerned.",89,Public Service
