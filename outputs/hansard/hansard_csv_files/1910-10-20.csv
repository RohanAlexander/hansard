The Government is fully seized of the importance of appointing commercial agents in America and elsewhere at the earliest moment possible, and my honourable colleague and myself are in consultation as to the best means of providing for that.

22,Mr Sampson (Wimmera) [10.40],"iapid means of intercommunication by steam and telegraph, we have to face leading nations, not only in Europe, but also in Asia, who have discovered within themselves an inherent strength, and who are reaching out for foreign conquest. It is only by strengthening the Federal union in respect to national life that we can hope to cope with these dangers and difficulties when they arise, l t is admitted on all hands that the Constitution, when it was framed, was a fine, well-balanced piece of legislation for that time; and I think it will be generally agreed that no pressure of circumstances compelled the people ot Australia to agree to a Federal union. Although its leading statesmen and politicians saw the necessity of establishing a Federal union, there was no"" pressure brought to bear upon the people which would compel them to unite for their common defence. I am inclined to think that Australia, having regard to its large territory and its small population, federated a little ahead of the opinion of the average elector. necessary that such a Constitution should be placed before the people as would invest the Federal Parliament with only those powers on which there could be no real controversy, and which, after all, would not materially weaken the sovereignty of the State Parliaments. As was explained by the Leader of the Opposition in a masterful and comprehensive speech, and also by the Attorney-General in an able address, it was pointed out that the Constitution contained a provision for its amendment as public sentiment grew, and the necessities of commerce and of national life required the strengthening up of the Federal powers in certain essential directions. I believe that, to a very large extent, we have reached that stage when it is necessary that greater virility and larger powers in certain directions should be given to this Parliament. In my view, limited powers such as we have, in some directions, for instance, in the industrial sphere, are more dangerous than would be the absence of those powers. I think that, in endeavouring to hamper the will of this National Parliament, cramped as it is by constitutional limitations, there is a very great danger of our passing legislation which might be actually injurious to the people, whereas if our powers were enlarged, and we had a wider scope to meet the legislative need's of the people, we could pass laws which would be extremely beneficial to them. I cannot see where danger lies in this Parliament strengthening up its constitutional powers, so long as it can be shown that that step is rendered absolutely necessary by our enactments. VVe, of course, do not agree with the politics of the party which is now in power. My own opinion is that if the organization had been as complete and as virile on our side as it was on the other side, the last elections would have resulted differently. But, after all, it is a question of trusting the people. In my opinion, a denial of the right of this Parliament, when it finds it necessary to endeavour to increase its constitutional powers, is an admission that it is not fit to be trusted by the people with the exercise of higher powers. That is why I think it is necessary that we should look at this proposal free from party entanglement, and in the interests of the people whom we, although differing in certain legislative views, were returned to serve to tbe very best of out It was ability. The question of enlarging the powers of this Parliament is certainly not a new one. In its early days, that is, before it had acquired anything like the experience which it now possesses, that step was advocated by some of our leading statesmen and founders of the Constitution. About two years ago, I , as a member of the Harvester Commission, had an opportunity of travelling over Australia. I found that there was a difference of opinion amongst the witnesses as to the real necessity of transferring to this Parliarhent the industrial powers now claimed and used in different ways by the States. In Adelaide there was a disposition on the part of various unions, according to their accredited representatives, to transfer such powers to this Parliament. In Victoria the same view was put forward by the accredited representatives of the various iron workers' unions. But in New South Wales there was a difference of opinion on the subject. A very able witness, who has since been elected to the State Parliament, and whose name is mentioned as a possible very valuable evidence, in which he expressed the opinion that the initiative in legislation should be held by the States, and the final power of appeal transferred to the Federal Parliament. That is. I think, a good scheme. The States Parliaments, since they understand local conditions and circumstances, climatic and otherwise, are in a favorable position to judge",16,Second Reading
23,Ministeri Refer To Mr Trefle,"gav e somedifferent characteristics. in any case, an Industrial Appeal Court might harmonize the wages between the various States in case of unfair competition owing to different factories laws. That is a very good scheme, and one which was put forward by the Government at the last elections, but whether it is possible to divide ties, but the former appears to have the the authority in such a way as would preserve the initiative to the States and the final appeal to the Federal Commonwealth is a matter on which I do not feel myself sufficiently well informed to speak, and"" un which I can hardly see that it is possible to make that differentiation. Buti f it can be done it seems to be an ideal scheme. I can find no precedent, however, for refusing to transfer these additional powers to the National Parliament. I have looked into the Constitution of the Central Parliament in various countries of importance, but I have found no such precedent for refusing a transfer of additional industrial powers to the Federal Parliament, except in the case of the United States. In the United Kingdom, of course, the Imperial Parliament has complete control of labour legislation in the Factories and Workshops Act. everything ? to get rid of a lot of it just now. transferring purely local duties to local legislative or administrative bodies. think that the honourable member for Herbert will agree with me that in Queensland there is a very strong feeling in favour of a system of Unification, because a large number of persons scattered over that large territory think that by means of a closer system of local government they are more likely to get a greater multiplication of local Australia, with the history of the world to councils or bodies than they can under present conditions. valent in other States. just as much in Western Australia as they do all over Australia, so that it is very difand privately-owned railways in the United ficult to say that a State boundary gives the State a better claim than the Commonwealth to deal in certain respects with this class of legislation. National Parliament has had control of factories legislation since 1848, and its jurisdiction is supreme. In Belgium the facI believe that, tories laws extend to manufactories, mines, quarries, wharfs, the charitable and philanthropic institutions, and women and child labour. In Holland factories legislation rests with a supreme Parliament. In Switzerland this legislative power is divided between the Federal and Cantonal authoriprevailing voice. The control of mines is left to the States, whilst the employment of child and female labour is regulated by the Federal Legislature. Inspectors are appointed by State and Federal Governments, with the right of final appeal to the Federal power. The control of railways and water power has been assumed by the Federal Legislature. Tn Germany tlic National Parliament _has complete control of all industrial legislation, and it has enacted laws regulating almost all branches of industry except fisheries and agriculture. In all the Scandinavian, as well as Latin, countries of Europe,the National Legislature is endowed with supreme power. The United States is the only country in the world which furnishes a parallel to our present position. Its Constitution was framed 125 years ago. our Constitution from. one of the most modern in the world-ha s the greatest number of limitations to be found in any Federal Constitution. The Constitution of the United States was framed in a very limited sense for very I much the same reason as our own Constitution was framed, and that is, because public opinion was hardly ripe for endowing the Federal authority with supreme power over all essential branches of legislation. I do not desire to cast any reflection on the constitutional powers of the United States, but I wish to point out that we in guide us, should avoid as early as possible the dangers and the evils which have grown up in that country, owing, I believe, to the great limitations put on the powers of its Congress. The growth of private enterprise in the shape of trusts, combines, States has brought a.bout an unequal distribution of wealth and an unequal diffusion of property much more marked than In France the in any other country in the world. The prosperity of the United States has a number of ugly sides to it. We in Australia should avoid the mistakes of that country,",17,Second Reading

31,Mr Sampson,"Our Constitutionwhere 125,000 families, or 1 per cent, of the people, own more than half the wealth; 10 per cent, of the middle classes own 32 per cent.; 38 per cent, of the poor own 13 per cent., and the very poor, or 54 per cent., own nothing. affairs has come about very largely because the Federal authority has been quite incapable of dealing with the large corporations and trusts which, as we know from the Herculean efforts made by President Roosevelt, to a great extent control the United States Senate, a body elected by the State Parliaments. cipal objections to the limited control of industrial matters given to this Parliament by the Constitution is that it carries no power or discrimination or differentiation over the wide area of Australia in respect of climate or local conditions generally. The Harvester Commission gave us a very good insight into the industrial conditions of the iron manufacturing trade, one of the most important in the Commonwealth, and every piece of evidence we took in the country districts went to show that under the rigid system of non-discrimination it would be only a matter of time before the whole of the manufacturing industries in country districts would be transferred to large centres, where the work could be specialized. seriously considered by this Parliament, in view of the advantages of decentralization. To my mind it forms a big justification for the extension of our industrial powers. their report statements made by some of the leading statesmen in the first Federal Parliament, to show that it was anticipated, even by the framers of the Constitution, that the time would soon come when it would be necessary .to strengthen up our powers in some of the respects now indicated by the present Government. In the first Parliament, Mr Justice (then Mr people as is the question of industrial conHiggins movedThat in the opinion of this House it is expedient for the Parliament of the Commonwealth to acquire (if the State Parliaments see fit to grant it, under section 51, sub-section 37, of the Constitution Act) f u l l poweT to make laws for Australia as to wages and hours and conditions of labour. Speaking in support of the motion, he saidWe have the responsibility of dealing with the Tariff for Australia, we have the responsibility of dealing with trade and commerce with .other countries and between the States, and we have the responsibility of dealing with the influx of alien coloured races. We feel that these problems, especially tbe problems of the Tariff, are so inextricably intertwined with legislative attempts to regulate wages, hours, and conditions of labour that we cannot ""properly f u l f i l our functions in one respect without having power to deal with the other. With free trade between the That condition of States it will not work well to let one State have one set of laws regulating the wages, hours, and conditions of labour in that State, and to allow another Stale to have another set of laws dealing witb those subjects within its boundaries. The case was put by that gentleman in a way on which I cannot attempt to improve. He touches the very foundational reasons why we should have an One of my prinaccession to our constitutional legislative strength in respect of industrial matters. We have the full control of importsand exports, and it is our duty to preserve a system of free exchange of trade and commerce between the States, and yet we have no real elastic power to carry out the two great fundamental purposes for which we federated. come when there will be no demarcation lines at all. matter. It has been urged that to transfer to the Federal Parliament industrial powers relating to factories' laws, rates of wages, and hours of labour, will be to That tendency should be initiate a system of Unification. I can scarcely go to that extent. On the contrary, I believe that, as Mr Justice Higgins expressed it, such a power is inextricably interwoven with the control of Inter-State The Commission embodied in and over-sea commerce. Eveni f this additional power is given to the Federal Parliament, the States as a whole will have just as important duties to carry out in their own spheres as we shall have in ours. They will have their railways, charities, education, police, mines, forests, and quite a number of other legislative functions just as important to the interests of the trol. I can scarcely see why there should be any more objection to the transfer to the Commonwealth Parliament of the power to regulate hours of labour, rates of wages, and factories' laws, than there was at the time of Federation to the transfer to this Parliament of the right to control imports and exports and preserve a system of Inter-State Free Trade. In the debate on Mr Higgins's motion, Sir William McMillan, speaking from the opposite side of the House, saidSince we met in the Federal Convention which framed this Commonwealth Constitution there has been a very considerable evolution of",18,Second Reading

The motion approximated very closely to the arrangement made by the late Government with the States at the Premiers' Conference that they should consent to the transfer of. these powers to the Federal Parliament, and the late Government said that if the States refused to make the transfer it would be necessary for the -Federal Parliament to ask the people lo make it for them. In some respects the Bills that are now before this House do not differ materially from some of the proposals regarding this matter put forward by the previous Government. The honourable member for Angas, in his memorandum, also pointed out that an amendment of the Constitution would be necessary to give the Federal authority more effective control of trusts and combines. debate to which I have already referred, Sir Edmund (then Mr Barton the leader of the Convention, one of the draftsmen of the Constitution, and one of our highest constitutional authorities, saidThat there ought to be such a power exercised I am now convinced, and for this reason, that the grant of Inter-State Free Trade which follows the adoption of an uniform Tariff, is likely in many respects to be crippled unless the Commonwealth has power to deal uniformly with the -conditions of employment throughout Australia. . . . . That this grant of the power should be made to enable us to meet the inequalities of condition, which ought not to occur amongst an equal people, I have, on f u l l investigation of this to act as a Court of final appeal which motion, convinced myself. These are very strong and weighty words, which cannot be regarded as having at that time any party complexion. I look upon them as the utterance of a statesman. After the Harvester Commission had very fully investigated one phase of this industrial question, the majority presented a report, and a minority report was presented by myself. The majority recommendedThat paragraph xxxv. of section 51 of the Constitution relating to conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State should be replaced by a paragraph giving the Commonwealth Parliament power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to industrial matters. Mr Sampson. That provision be made for the appointment 1 hail with delight this local or State tribunals to harmonize and adState Commission meet that case? very competent tribunal, and if it were constituted and took charge of the appeals I believe we should very largely get over our present troubles. After all, in the more populous centres we have Wages Boards. I believe that system is the most ingenious and efficient means yet devised of dealing with the industrial question in its initial stages. I can conceive of no better way of bringing employers and employees together than for representatives from each side to meet and discuss their difficulties one with the other. Each side can point out its disabilities, get a better know-ledge of the other's point of view, and each will gain greater confidence in the other. That system, however, like In the most other things that have an Australian operation and break down when they reach a certain stage, is good only so long as the Wages Boards keep within the confines of their own States, under their own legislation. There is bound to be a conflict of legislation amongst the different State Parliaments, each legislating for its own people and having different views as to the particular form that its enactments should take. That is the reason why we want some central authority, to see that the work of regulating industrial affairs, including the wages and hours of the people of Australia, is carried out efficiently, and also shall harmonize or co-ordinate wages as between the various States, in order to prevent one State from competing unfairly with another. The Inter-State Commission would lie a very competent appeal Court. the decisions of the High Court. the Arbitration Court has now the final power to settle questions with respect to conciliation and arbitration on matters of fact. It is only In matters of law that an appeal lies to the High Court, and the Inter-State Commission would not in any way interfere with the powers of the High Court in that regard.

37,Mr Sampson,"The President of the Federal Parliament should not be able from the Seat of Government, whether it be in Vass-Canberra or Melbourne, to exercise powers in connection with industrial matters. We have a central branch of the Post and Telegraph Department controlling the whole of the Post and Telegraph services throughout Australia. This is done by a subdivision of the work, and the establishment of responsible officers in the different States. There is no reason why a similar system should not be adopted to secure a proper control of our industrial affairs. If present methods were to continue to operate, it would only be a matter of time when we should be imposing similar provisions as to wages and conditions in the tropical north as in the temperate south. Buti f we are to develop this great continent, we can only do so by a just and reasonable discrimination to meet the requirements of the various industries concerned in the trade and commerce of the different parts of Australia. For these reasons I am in favour of an extension of our powers in the control of trade and commerce, and our powers of arbitration and conciliation in industrial affairs. I believe also that we should have larger powers to deal with trusts and combines: but that is a matter which may be discussed in Committee. I join with the Leader of the Opposition in regretting that we have not been given an opportunity to deal with these matters in separate Bills. The Government are proposing to deal with too many matters in the one measure. They propose to submit a complication of issues to the people, and in Switzerland, and in the States of the United States, in which the referendum is established in similar circumstances, the people have sometimes objected to express an opinion upon complicated issues, and have referred them back to the Legislature. cated to submit six questions than to submit one? 7 ral elections; two questions were submitted to the electors, but they were clearly differentia fpd. recorded an intelligent vote upon those two a.ue^Ttnt. that now. but if the Minister makes that admission, he should have faith in the caDacftv of the electors to intelligently answer four or six questions. I have given my reasons for believing that we require a strengthening up of Federal powers, and I hope that in Committee the measure may be so dealt with as to secure for it a more general support than it is likely to receive in its present form. I have no doubt that the debate on the second reading of this Bill, and its discussion during the remaining stages through which the measure must pass, will be such as to reflect credit on this House and the country. But I point out that no other measure which has been before this Parliament more clearly marks the parting of the ways. It will, ultimately, be discussed and dealt with by the people of Australia, and whatever its merits or demerits may be, it will be considered practically from anly one point of view. Judging by the speeches delivered by the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders, and the honourable member who has preceded me, honourable members on the other side are not altogether united in the view they take of this proposal. There is a general feeling on both sides that something must be done to bring about industrial peace. the last Government. of that, but my point is that, apart from the discussion of this question in this Parliament, it will be fully discussed outside, not merely in the press, but in every town and township throughout Australia, and I am satisfied that, while in the discussion of the question here there may appear to be some agreement on general grounds, between both sides in this House, when the matter comes to be discussed in the country we shall be confronted with a solid opposition to the Government proposal, and this question will be fought out, not on its merits, but on the question of whether we should have Unification or not. it will. that confirmation of my opinion. Howj ever much honourable members opposite may seem to support this proposal in this House, we shall find them opposed to it in the country.

There are forces at work in Australia which are tending in a certain direction. Those forces existed long before Federation. They are the web and the woof of the life of the people. They will continue to work, despite what we may attempt to do, and must have their natural effect, however much we attempt to thwart them. These forces arise from the natural sentiment ancl fibre of the Australian people. They are inherent in us all as Britishers. To many, this land of their adoption is more than the country from which they came. Some have been born in this happy land, for Australia is a happy land, after all is said, and'offers nite idea of what the law is. But no lawpossibilities of ""happiness to those who are industrious and anxious to do their best for themselves and the country. Whether we are native-born, or have been in Australia so long as to have almost forgotten the country from which' we came, we cannot escape the fact that, after all, we are animated by British institutions, instincts, and traditions of a thousand years. We should not have had Federation in Australia for another generation or two if it had not been forced upon us. Federation was accomplished in Australia because without it it was utterly impossible to bring about Inter-State Free Trade. To induce six different Parliaments to agree to Inter-State Free Trade would be as difficult as it is to induce them to agree upon uniform industrial legislation. There is a section of the Australian people that is well informed. There is a section of those who love books, legal opinions, and law humbug; and a section that is independent ot lawyers and constitutional writers. There is a large section in Australia that, setting all these things aside, is moved by prejudices, passions, and lofty aspirations. It is in the opinion of the people representing this section that we shall find the history of this country written, and not in musty lawyers' books. When the Federal Convention sat in Adelaide, I used to stroll into the gallery to listen to the debates. I could nol help smiling when I did so, because it seemed to me so strange that a body of trained lawyers and able statesmen seemed unable to-realize the fact that they were trying to blend an English and a Yankee Constitution into one. We have Mr Archibald. I in our Constitution a portion of tlie English Constitution. In this House, we make and unmake Ministers. We have some of the Questions of this character American Constitution, which is not so clearly defined. There is not a single line in our .Constitution ithat clearly defines where the authority of the Federation begins and the authority of the States ends. Whether the members of the Federal Convention honestly endeavoured to frame a Constitution is, in my opinion, a matter of doubt. I am inclined to think that there were too many lawyers amongst them. Unconsciously, perhaps, they were looking for opinions, and no two lawyers form the same opinion. It has always seemed a marvellous thing to me that when a lawyer leaves the arena, ancl is promoted to a seat on the Bench, he can always form a defiyer who is not on the Bench either can or will. I should like to know what magic there is in the taking of an oath of allegiance by a Judge to the King to bring about this marvellous change. The men who concocted our Constitution were not like the majority on this side, who have had no legaltraining, and who have spent the greater part of their lives in working at their ordinary avocations. With their rough mother-wit men of that stamp can. see much that is missed by trained intellects. We have blended the English Constitution with that of the United States, which is absolutely the worse in the world to-day. It was created under a nightmare of King George III . , a fact which is not disclosed to us by the lawyers who discuss the question; and the corruption under it is a disgrace to the race. As the last speaker told us, the corrupt Senate has ' ruled that country, not only since Federation, but long before. Ever since the civil war that branch of the legislature has played into the hands of men with princely fortunes, whose object it is to rob the American people. however, the American people are very well off! member and other Australians were subject to the iniquities of trusts similar to those which exist in the United States, they would.

Indeed, I have always held that it is possible to make our laws so simple that a child can understand them.

One has merely to sit in this Parliament and listen to its legal members arguing any question to discover that not two of them are in agreement. I hope that the Australian people will vest this Parliament with full power to legislate in regard to industrial matters. At the same time, I do not desire to deprive the States of any powers which they possess to-day. Time alone will determine the powers which each should exercise. This Parliament cannot go further than the Australian people choose to authorize it to go. They are beginning to feel that the Federal coat is tight, and they will presently tear at it.

Courts of the States, with a number of minor Courts, have a great deal of their time occupied in dealing with petty disputes. great importance to the contending parties, and, since law and order must be maintained, there must be proper legal methodsof ventilating grievances and redressing them. But surely the industrial peace of . 'Australia is quite as important as is 50 per cent, of the work with which the time of our various Courts is occupied to-day. No one should complain if it be found necessary to increase the number of our Courts to deal with industrial matters; and in dealing with such work surely they will be just as well occupied as are many of our Courts to-day. Those who view with disfavour the adjudication of a Court on matters relating to wages and conditions of labour must not forget that this step is of only a preliminary character. No doubt for the next ten years there will be a great deal of contention, and many appeals to the Court, but at the end of that period the industrial community will have clearly defined lines on which to work, and an overwhelming majority of disputes will have been cleared away. Surely it cannot be argued that because industrial legislation will throw upon our Courts an increased ' amount of work it should not be passed. No doubt under this amendment of the law there will be a good many appeals to the Court during the next ten years, but there is no justification for believing that that increase of work will continue thereafter. The unions of employees on the one hand, and of employers on the other, will be familiar with the lines on which disputes have been settled, and any difliculty in regard to tbeir agreements will be adjusted before the Boards or the Commissioners, without any resort to the Court. If we appoint a tribunal to regulate wages and conditions of labour for the Commonwealth, it must be in the interests of the people. It is unthinkable that in this fair country of ours any one should be called upon to work for less than a living wage. If we take a step in this direction, as I think we have a right to do, I fail to see why we should not go a step further, and fix prices. do that, but it was held by the High Court writer in our own language is better worth to be ultra vires. have a right to protect the worker from being sweated, surely we have a right to The Supreme prevent the consumer from being plundered. We are not asking for that power to-day, but it must come. Those disputes no doubt are of ral said that the Government were asking for it. going to ask the people to determine whether we shall have power to deal with such matters! I am not deeply impressed with what I call the shadowy legislation dealing with these matters. My contention is that we should make our legislation effective. The honourable member for Flinders said that he thought we were "" barking up the wrong tree,"" so to speak, and tiiat we sliould not'get what we expected from our Wages Boards and other tribunals for determining labour conditions and rates of pay. Time will prove whether we are right or wrong. It has always been my opinion that such legislation must diminish the purchasing power of the sovereign. A shorter road to our goal-bu t it cannot be taken until the people of Australia desire it is the nationalization of banking. With the nationalizing of banking, we should find the economic law of supply and demand working out such a set of conditions that no manufacturer could compete with the Australian Government in the matter of cheapness. It is inevitable that we cannot go back to the days of our fathers, when the power of capital and the use of machinery made it absolutely necessary for the workers to combine in order to secure the right to live. The days of laissez faire have gone. We may have a long and a hard row to hoe, but we must continue on the lines on which we are working. To my mind, there is much room for a progressive country to work on these lines to-day. I doubt very much whether any material advantage is gained by the quotation of leading authorities on constitutional law, or other great writers. The Leader of the Opposition yesterday made a quotation from Freeman, in which he pointed out that it was an advantage that National Parliaments should have men trained in other assemblies, whose work is not of such transcendent importance.

It is dimcult to understand how men should endeavour to escape from their very nature, as some people seem to clo in these later days. 1 shall not detain the House further, for there is no occasion to go into details. matters have been previously discussed, and I should not have spoken at all, but that I did not wish to give a silent vote. we came down to a little detail. I want, to see a case made out for this grant of power. advise my honourable friend to read the decisions of the High Court during the last six years.' If those decisions have not proved right up to the hilt the necessity for an alteration of the Constitution in these directions, then I am afraid that no argument of mine is likely to convince the honourable member. I was anxious to speak in order to point out that it is useless to fight this issue on the ground of Unification versus Federation. We have to look to the fact that there is a certain movement in Australia, which is growing in spite of writers, in spite of eminent authorities, in spite of the men who pen articles in newspapers. There is a live movement among the people, and, as the result of it, ultimately and surely, our Federation, or whatever we choose to call it-the name is of no concern-as decade follows decade will come more closely to resemble on its legislative side the Parliament of our fathers at Westminster. which, as the needs of the people require, Parliament will change the law and the Judges will interpret the law which Parliament makes. We shall have a system, simple, quick in its operation an3 effective if the people desire changes in the law to be rapidly achieved, or slow and cumberous when there is no urgent desire on their part in any particular direction. Ours is a Constitution that we ought to be proud of, and which is bound, ultimately, to succeed. But it may have to be changed many times before it thoroughly suits the requirements of our people. It would be well for these subjects to be discussed outside, so that the people may become acquainted with the matters at issue. It is not for me to predict what the result of the referendum will be; but this I will say-that if the referendum be unfavorable to the wishes of the Government and its supporters, nevertheless, before long the Australian people will give to this Parliament the power which it must possess in order to make our Federation effective and this Parliament what it ought to beMany of these a body representative of the people, a true reflex of their mind, and capable of giving legislative expression to their wishes. If we do not obtain this power, we shall simply degenerate into a dignified and lofty assembly, in which grand and abtract questions are discussed in an academic manner, but incapable of meeting the requirements of the merchant, the mechanic, the worker in all directions. Without extended powers we shall be as incapable of fulfilling those functions as an ordinary Victorian shire council. -The honourable member for Hindmarsh may be complimented on the very vigorous and robust manner in which he has submitted the case for the Ministerial proposals from the Labour stand-point. He has not sought to disguise or to minimize in any way the possible consequential and ulterior tendencies of the proposed constitutional ' amendments embodied in this Bill. I agree with the honourable member in his concluding remark that this is hardly an occasion for indulging in academic discussion. There is no necessity to do so. This is not a Federal Convention. But on an occasion when proposals are made for radical and fundamental alterations in the instrument of government under which we live, it is but fit and proper-it is but justifiable--that someWe shall evolve a system under thins; should he said in defence of the Federal Constitution. The occasion demands some fuller exposition of the reasons for the proposed alterations than has yet been submitted to us.

It is a sorrowful thing to hear the work of our own hands, the work of the hands of the leaders of the Australian people, ratified by the voice and verdict of those people, spoken of in this House and elsewhere so * slightingly and so disparagingly. The opening words of the Constitution are as followsWhereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South"" Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Here is a constitutional partnership, not thrust upon us by the Imperial Parliament without our will, consent, or sanction; but a deed of partnership drawn up in the first instance by the representatives of the people elected upon a manhood suffrage basis, and afterwards submitted to those people and ratified by them. We should never forget the preamble and recital standing in the forefront of our Constitution. It recites that it is firstly a Federal Constitution, and an indissoluble union under the Crown. provides for its own amendment. although it provides for such amendments or alterations as may be found to be necessary or advisable to meet the growing requirements of the people, those amendments ought, at any rate, to be consistent with the Federal principle, and that any alterations or developments, whilst they may add new particulars to the Constitution, should make no change in the essence or in the Federal character of that instrument of government. I was proceeding to show that these proposed changes are calculated, not to facilitate the orderly and careful improveIt is regrettable ment of the existing instrument of government, but tq introduce organic changes in the fundamental spirit and nature of it. If those changes are made bit by bit, instalment by instalment, as we have them suggested by the honourable member for Hindmarsh-no w a little change, and then a little-wha t will be the result? The result will be that, although we may preserve the Federal character of our constitutional system in form, it will be dead in spirit, in aim, and in activity. If there be any isuch changes in contemplation, it would be better to deal with them by direct appeal to the people upon the general I question as to whether there should be such changes rather than by a gradual introduction of insidious alterations which will sap, undermine, and supersede the powers of the States and destroy the Federal character of our system of Government. believes in revolution rather than in evolution ? consider any change that may be deemed necessary in our form of government if proposed in a proper manner, after proper warnings, and under conditions which wiil give the people an opportunity of understanding the real issue. But I should think that after a brief experience of only about ten years the time is hardly ripe for asking the people to reverse the verdict they solemnly arrived at in the early years of the century, when this Constitution was brought into force. I should like to refer briefly to one or two preliminary matters mentioned by an honourable member who spoke from this side of the House yesterday. He said, in the course of his address, that the Australian Federation was one of the weakest or the easiest Federal unions in the world. I venture to join issue with him on that statement. I deny the conclusion which he has drawn and the proposition that he has affirmed. I deny also that this Constitution has been drawn up in rigid adherence to the American model.

79,Sir John Quick,"I am prepared 'onecessary in order.to meet the political conditions of the country for which we were called upon to provide a system of government. I regretted to hear the honourable member for Hindmarsh refer to the "" Yankee Constitution "" of the American people. Probably the honourable member has not studied the matter sufficiently to know that tliat Constitution-whethe r he calls it a Yankee system or by any other name-was , at the time it was framed, deemed the very best to meet the circumstances of the American people under the conditions of their provincial life and It was the only form of government which could meet the requirements and aspirations' of the people. The problem, then, was somewhat similar to that with whicli the framers of the Australian Constitution had to deal: how to reconcile the necessities of the national life with the preservation of the autonomy of separate coinmunities. The framers of the American Constitution, therefore, resorted to , what is known as the dual system of government, under which there is a partition of sovereignty as a totality, some sovereign powers being assigned to the central or Federal Government, and the residue reserved to the State Governments. gress was invested with certain sovereign powers of wide national and general character, and the residue of the sovereign powers was left to the Parliaments of the States. That distribution was considered to be the best in the circumstances of the time, and when followed in our instrument of government was thought by its framers and the people of Australia to be the best for our requirements. was the best that they could get at the ters, so far as industrial disputes extend time. for meeting the necessities of the time. ters in any shape or form. In that respect The great need then was a union for purthis Parliament is stronger, more repreposes of trade and commerce between the sentative, and more centralized than that States, which was being obstructed by of the United States. jealousy, and hampered by difficulties, leading to reprisals, and almost to civil merce, we have a power over production, war.

The poweT to deal with Federal unions, I respectfully differ from commerce is vested in Congress in a -him; nor is it true ;that this instrument of more limited form than that in which government slavishly follows the American Constitution. In many respects it is more centralizing, and more specific in grants of power. It contains also supplementary or additional grants of power which the American Constitution does not contain. The latter is silent in reference to a number of matters on which the law has since been deduced and developed by judicial authority, but of which there is express recognition in our Constitution, grants of power being made in respect to them, such as the powers to deal with railways, navigation, and Inter-State means of comtheir dawning national life.. munication. All these powers are expressly defined and removed beyond the sphere of doubt. Section 98 provides that the power to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping, and to railways the property of a State. Parliament may by any law with respect to trade and commerce forbid as to railways any preference or discrimination by any State, or by any authority constituted under a State, if such preference or discrimination is undue, unreasonable, or unjust to any State. Our Constitution expressly authorizes the creation of an Inter-State Commission,Conhaving power to execute the laws of the Commonwealth with respect to trade and commerce between the States. This Parliament is armed with express power and authority regarding navigation and the control of rivers, which is much more effective than the provisions of the American Constitution, and beyond the reach of judicial interpretation and diminishment. In two other respects is our Federal authority wider and stronger than that of the United States. This Parliament has beyond the limits of a State.

81,Sir John Quick,"It was the best has no power to deal with industrial matit is vested in this ParUament. Congress has merely power to regulate commerce between the States and with foreign countries, but this Parliament has power over commerce, both Inter-State and generally. Our grant of power over Inter-State and foreign commerce, without limitation by the word "" regulate,"" is wider than the grant to Congress. It is true that we have power to deal only with trade and commerce with other countries and between the States, and it has been argued that we should have had the same power to deal with commerce as was granted to the Dominion Parliament of Canada, in whose Constitution the words "" to regulate trade and commerce"" stand without the "" InterState"" and without the ""foreign countries "" limitation. Constitution, remembering that, they were expected to draw up a Federal, and not a unitary Constitution, recommended the people of Australia not to grant the power over trade and commerce without restriction, limitation, or qualification, but only such power as was necessary to deal with Inter-State trade and trade witli other countries. No member of the Convention suggested that the power over trade and commerce should be unlimited. The business of the Convention was to unite the States in a Federal bond, and to secure Inter-State Free Trade. That was done by a provision in the Constitution stronger than any in that of the United State's, to the effect that after a certain time trade and the same principle was observed as was intercourse between the States must be absolutely free. provision in the Constitution of the United States. charged to do everything possible to guarantee Inter-State fredom of trade, and to prevent any State action which would interfere with or hamper it. HereI would point out that the trade and commerce power cannot be said to be an artificial distinction such as was suggested by the honourable member for Flinders, because the grant contained a full, free, and absolute power over trade arid commerce, without any limitation, except territorial. power over all commerce of an InteT-State character, the only limitation being a geographical one. Surely a limitation of the Federal power to Inter-State commerce, not a limitation of articles or of classes of trade or commerce, but merelv a geographical limitation to meet the Federal character of the instrument of .government, cannot be said to be an artificial distinction. The control of all trade and commerce that is not Inter-State belongs to the State Parliaments and Governments, while the control of all trade and commerce that is Inter-State or foreign is vested in the Federal Parliament. In actual practice there ought not to be any very great difficulty in distinguishing, as far as is necessary for all practical purposes, the difference between the internal trade of a State and that trade and commerce which flows across the borders of one State into another. The outward visible signs and manifestations of commercial life show what trade can cross the borders, and what trade is confined within the borders. It was thought, and I contend, sensibly and The framers of our fairly thought, that trade and commerce which begins and ends in a State ought to be left to the full, free, and unfettered control of its authorities, because, in such a case as that, no Federal question could arise. The State certainly ought to be trusted to deal with the merely domestic, provincial phases and developments of trade and. commerce within its own boundaries, reserving to the Federal authority exclusive power to deal with commercial developments of a wider sweep, either Inter-State or with other countries. That is a logical partition and distribution of power. In the distribution of powers which is to be found in our Constitution, followed in the case of the Constitution of There is no such strong the United States. In illustration of that proposition, I propose to quote from that This Parliament is celebrated article by Mr Woodrow Wilson, on the States and the Federal Government, which was quoted yesterday so effectively by the honourable member for Angas, from the North American Review for May, 1908, at page 688, and which I recommend to the study of honourable members who feel an interest in mastering these important questions. Referring to the principle of distribution, and in support of the contention that it is not an artificial, but a logical distribution, based on reason, comThere was a full grant of mon sense, and political necessities, Mr Wilson savsI f the jealousies of the Colonies and of the little States which sprang out of them had not obliged the makers of the Constitution to leave the greater part of legal regulation in the hands of the States, it would have been wiseit would even have been necessary-to invent such a division of powers as was actually agreed upon. It is not, at bottom, a question of sovereignty or of any other political abstraction; it is a question of vitality. Uniform regulation of the economic conditions of a vast territory and a various people like the United States would be mischievous, if not impossible. The statesmanship which really attempts it is premature and unwise. These are the weighty words of a critic of the Constitution. After reviewing the history of over one hundred years' experience, he affirms, on political, philosophical, and logical grounds, that the distribution of powers between the States and the central Government was a proper one. I affirm that the principle which was followed in the distribution of powers between the States of Australia and the central Government was also a fair and proper one, and that, in the words of Mr Wilson, if the jealousies of the Colonies had not stood in the way of a complete Unification, it would have been wise, it would even have been necessary to invent such a distribution of powers as has been actually followed. It was not solely the demands pt the people of the Colonies in favour of the reservation of certain rights which led to this distribution of powers, but the principle which we all ought to recognise, that in the distribution of powers over such a wide territory as this continent, it was only fit and proper that, whilst endeavouring to build up a strong national life, a central or Federal Government, equipped with all those powers of government necessaiy for the cohesive influences of a great community, we should not in any way sacrifice or impair the vitality of the parts. The whole Commonwealth cannot be any stronger or more national than it has been, or will be, strengthened by the vital energies proceeding from the outlying parts. And if we impair the parts as represented by the provincial life, then to the extent that we do so will the rational life suffer impairment. Returning to my criticism, the trade and commerce power was limited for two reasons; first, because the Convention granted to the Commonwealth Parliament all the power that was necessary for general or national purposes; and, second, because it was deemed necessary and advisable to reserve to the States power to deal with matters which were purely provincial, and in which the Commonwealth as a whole might not be concerned. That distribution of power is to be found, not only in the classification given in section 51 of the Constitution, but also in the very form and structure of the Sir John Quick, organization of government. And prominent among the Federal features of the Constitution in that regard is undoubtedly the structure of the Senate. Why did the Convention, why did the people of Australia agree, to the creation of a Senate in its present form, and invest it with its present Federal powers? It was because the Senate was recognised as part of a Federal system. The strongest argument brought forward in favour of the creation of a Senate, based on the principle of the equal representation of the States therein was, that it was to be the guardian of State rights and interests. It was though^ that in a Parliament, having jurisdiction to deal only with Australian matters,, and not having jurisdiction to deal with purely local matters, a Senate should be constructed on the principle of the equal representation of the States. I know that many of us had a considerable difficulty in fighting the battle in favour of that principle. During the whole of the Federal campaign we were forced to take the ground-and we had no other justification I admit-that ours was a Federal Constitution in which the States were to be represented as State entities; in other words, that the Commonwealth was to be, not merely a union of individual units, but also a union of the preexisting, sovereign entities, known as the States, and that those States, organized as autonomous bodies, were to be represented in a Federal Senate, not merely to exercise the functions of a second Chamber of revision and review as in a unitary Constitution, but to protect State rights and interests whenever they cropped up. Do honourable members think that the people of the larger States'would ever have agreed to engraft on the Constitution the principle of the equal representation of the small as well as the large States in the Senate if it were believed that the Federal Parliament was to have the right to deal with provincial domestic questions? Certainly not. I , for one, would never have been found fighting for the Federal Constitution, either in the Convention or on the platform, if 1 had thought that this Parliament, so constituted, was to deal with local, domestic, and provincial questions. 1 do not believe that the Federal Constitution as it stands would ever have been carried if the people of Australia had not been convinced that this Parliament was to deal with general questions, and not with local questions. We are called upon now to grant power to the Federal Parliament to deal with local questions, that is, questions of domestic commerce, domestic industry and trade, and all that kind of thing. Some honourable members have referred to these Bills as marking the parting of the ways, and undoubtedly they will mean the parting of the ways in many respects, if they are carried. 1 venture to say to the representatives of the smaller States in this House and in the Senate that, as soon as the people of Australia wake up to a knowledge and consciousness that this is no longer a Federal system of government, but is gradually working in the direction of a Unification, in which this Parliament is to absorb provincial powers which ought to belong lo the State Parliaments, there will be an irresistible movement started, not only to amend the Constitution by granting increased powers to this Parliament, but, as a consequence, to take away from the States the right of equal representation in the Senate. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.30 p.m. tion of the suggestion that our Australian Federal union is one of the weakest forms of Federation, I should like to quote a much greater authority than myself, or anybody else in this Parliament,' in Professor Dicey, the author of The Law of ihe Constitution.' The appendix to the new edition, page 529, contains a complete analysis and review of the Australian Federal Constitution. I shall quote only one or two pregnant sentences, and invite honourable members to refer to the book. On the point as to the strength of our Federal authority and powers, and whether we represent a true Federation, Professor Dicey saysThe Commonwealth is, in the strictest sense, a gards other portions of the Dominion ConFederal Government. It owes its birth to the desire for national unity which pervades the whole of Australia, combined with the determinathe provincial Legislatures control over a tion on the part of the several Colonies to retain, as States of the Commonwealth, as large a measure of independence as may be found compatible with the recognition of Australian nationality. The creation of a true Federal Government has been achieved mainly by following, without, however, copying in any servile spirit, the fundamental principles of American federalism. In another passage on page 53T he saysThe founders, then, of the Commonwealth have, guided in the main by the example of the United States, created a true Federal Government; but they have, we shall find, as far as is compatible with the existence of federalism, imported into the Constitution ideas borrowed, or rather inherited, from England. And on page 533The Parliament of the Commonwealth is endowed with very wide legislative authority; thus it can legislate on many topics which lie beyond the competence of the Congress of the United States, and on some topics which lie beyond the competence of the Parliament of the Canadian Dominion; and it is here worth notice that the extension of the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament is facilitated by the fact that on many topics the Federal Legislature and the State Parliaments have concurrent legislative authority, though, of course, where a law of the Commonwealth conflicts with the law of a State, the Federal law, if within the competence of the Commonwealth Parliament, prevails. I commend those passages to the consideration and attention of honourable members to show that, after all, we haye a Constitution worthy of our admiration and support, and one which it ill becomes any member of this Legislature to unnecessarily depreciate or minimize. That passage shows that there is no justification for the assertion that we have a mean, miserable, and impotent form of Federal union. It indicates that we have greater powers of a Federal character than even the Congress of the United States and the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada. Let me refer to another statement made by two learned gentlemen in apparent depreciation of our Federal Constitution and in praise of the Canadian. It was stated that the Canadian Parliament had greater power over commerce than had the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, because the words conferring power on the Dominion Parliament were "" to regulate trade and commerce,"" without the limiting words "" between the States and with other countries,"" appearing in the Australian Constitution. I would, however, point out that that criticism ignores or disrestitution which reserve in express terms to vast volume of the internal trade and commerce domain. Honourable members will see this matter referred to on page 544 of the Annotated Constitution, where it is pointed out that the provinces have power in the following matters :(1) Direct taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes. (2) Municipal institutions. (3) Shop, saloon, auctioneer, and other licences in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local, or municipal purposes. (4) Property and civil",30,Second Reading
82,Sir John Quick,"In further refutarights. (5) Matters of a merely local, private, or tion that is carried on between the ports provincial nature. This shows that, although in the earlier part of the Constitution power is granted to the Dominion Parliament over trade and commerce generally, there are express reservations to the provinces cutting down that general grant of power. On these grounds I submit that it could not possibly be said that if the amendment now proposed is granted, it will merely be conferring upon the Federal Parliament the powers of the Canadian Dominion. If the words "" between the States and with foreign countries "" are struck out, it will grant universal unlimited power over trade and commerce, Inter-State as well as domestic, provincial, and local, to the Federation, without any reservation whatever to the States. It will have the effect of conferring upon this Parliament power to deal with the most minute matter of local commercial and trading concerns. tion where we cannot interfere within the bounds of a State? the Constitution power over navigation is expressly reserved to the Commonwealth in these wordsThe power of the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to be true, as alleged by some here in, Ausnavigation and shipping, and to railways the tralia, and by some in America, that the property of any State.

I am not prepared at present to admit, without fair consideration laws desirable? it is desirable or necessary in all matters of personal, local, or provincial rights. I shall now refer to the various proposals seriatim, only briefly, because, in view of my general observations, it is not necessary to dwell on the details so fully as I otherwise should. It is proposed that the words, "" with other countries and' among the States,"" shall be struck, out of section 51 of the Constitution. The effect of that will be to nationalize or federalize the whole of the power over commerce; and I submit that no sufficiently strong case has been made out for such a revolutionary and drastic proposal. It is quite within the possibility of legislative realization to redress all grievances, or alleged grievances, with reference to trusts, combines, and monopolies by another proposal, without unnecessarily enlarging the area of general control over trade and commerce. If it be found in actual practice, or from judicial decisions, that there are certain lines of contact, so to speak, in regard to commerce, partly local and partly Inter-State-wher e the line of division is so narrow and refined as to make separation impossible-the n I admit it is within the competence and right of this Parliament and the people-and they ought, in fact-to pass necessary amendments to meet difficulties as they arise. It may be that, with reference to one or two branches of trade and commerce law, or one or two aspects of it, there is some necessity for a clearer definition or specification of the Federal power, in order to remove doubts or give a wider range; but I submit that a few isolated cases or instances where re-: forms, amendments, or modifications may be necessary would not, and ought not, to justify this sweeping amendment. It may lead, possibly, to consequences which the promoters and framers of the Bill do not' contemplate, and probably do not desire. I remind them of the provisions of the not Constitution relating to Inter-State trade and commerce, and to the provision for an Inter-State Commission. That Commission, when organized, will have authority to interfere with the administration of the State railways, and to prohibit differentiation or discrimination so far as may be consistent with the Constitution. The poweis of the Inter-State Commission were laid down in the Constitution, and have to be read in conjuncnot uniformity of tion with the' limited Federal control over commerce also provided by the Constitution. The powers are now limited to Inter-State trade; but if the limitation is rejected or removed, then the Commission will undoubtedly have a much enlarged power, not limited to Inter-State trade over railways, but extending probably to the control of railways even within a State. In addition, it is possible that the Federal authority may be extended to navigation and shipping on rivers and on waters purely and simply within the territorial limits of a State. Of course, if honourable members are deliberately marching in that direction, it is just as well that we should understand the position. I submit, however, that we ought not to amend the Constitution in a sort of abstract way for abstract reasons and considerations, but that any amendment ought to be founded on immediate necessities and immediate requirements, and designed to redress grievances which actually exist, or which may be immediately prospective.

I think I have said enough with regard to the proposed abolition of the power vested in the State Parliaments to deal with purely local, municipal, and domestic trade; and shall only add that I regard such a step as a dangerous, useless, and fatal experiment with our local self-governing institutions. I come now to the proposal to amend section 51 of the Constitution by omitting the words "" foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth."" By this it is intended to confer on the Federal Parliament a general power to deal with corporations, including their creation, regulation, control, and dissolution. There is apparently no limit to the class of corporations which are to be dealt with, except corporations formed solely for religious, charitable, scientific, or artistic purposes, and not for the acquisition of gain. This will mean, of course, as pointed out yesterday by the honourable member for Flintice Higgins, an extraordinary provision for the creation of a special kind, or class, of law dealing with corporate bodies as distinguished from private individuals. Under that power there might be a special code of the most penal, harassing, and destructive character, for the purpose, not merely of facilitating the existence of and regulating corporate bodies, but of gradually destroying them, and, if necessary for party purposes, crushing them out of existence. This would come within the definition of the special laws of which we read in the history of England, or the laws of a frivilegium character known to the Roman law, by which particular interests were specially dealt with and penalized. there would be conferred on the Federal Parliament power to deal, not merely with trading corporations and banking and financial institutions, but with all kinds of co-operative bodies whose business might be purely local and provincial, having no Federal outlook, contact, or association. Why is it proposed to secure Federal power to deal [176] with corporations that may be of a purely local or domestic character? Why is it necessary to extend the Federal power in rhis direction? How is labour or capital or any one to gain by this grant of power to the Federal Parliament to tinker and interfere with every form of corporate enterprise throughout the Commonwealtli, with the exception of charitable or artistic corporations? This is a straining of Federal authority justified neither by any circumstances of Australian history, nor by any public requirement. Imagine the Federal Parliament being called upon to pass a special mining Act relating to the administration of the mines of Australia. Honourable members would, perhaps, almost ridicule such a suggestion, yet if this power be granted it will be possible for the Federal Parliament to pass a law relating to the management of mines owned by companies, and of every form of industrial life conducted by corporate bodies. I fail to see that the recent decision of the High Court in the JHuddart Parker case, giving a limited meaning to the term "" foreign corporations,"" in any way justifies this drastic and extraordinary amendment of the Constitution. I wish now tq refer to the proposed amendment of paragraph xxxv. of section 51 relating to industrial matters. When I referred to that provision at an earlier stage as embodying a grant of power to the Federal Parliament greater than that possessed by the United States Congress, the honourable member for Gippsland sneered at it, saying that it had been the subject of litigation and of doubt as to its legal interpretation and application. I am surprised at the manner in which that provision is undervalued and sneered at by some members of the Labour party and others. When it was inserted in the Constitution it was regarded as one of the triumphs of the Democratic party in the Federal Convention. In che teeth of the resistance of the State Rights party they succeeded in placing within the four corners of the Constitution a grant of power to the Federal ParFor instance, liament to pass legislation for the settlement of industrial disputes by the peaceful process of arbitration.

Another decision of the High Court under the industrial provision of the Constitution has been the subject of adverse comment. It is said that paragraph xxxv. of section 51 has broken down in its administration, because it does not confer upon the Federal Arbitration Court power to grant what is called a common rule. It is said that that is a fundamental defect in the Act. What is the meaning of the common rule? remember when it was first proposed by Mr Kingston, and was startled and surprised at the proposition that a Court should be empowered to grant a decision in an industrial dispute between A and B, which would bind others in the industry who were not parties to it, and who had not put their views before the Court, and whose interests were not represented. greatly doubted at the time whether such legislation was within the competence of Parliament, and the High Court has now decided in the Bootmakers' case that the Commonwealth settlement of industrial disputes is limited by two conditions, first, that there must be an actual dispute between defined and ascertained parties; and, [176]2 secondly, that it must be determined and settled by process of arbitration. That decision is founded on reason. What need is there for Federal intervention, except where industrial disputes actually exist? When they occur in concrete form, and are realities, not shams, the Commonwealth Arbitration Court has authority to settle them, but the High Court says that its decisions bind only the parties before it. Is not that finding based on equity and fairness? The obvious remedy, should disputes occur between other employers and employees, is, not to apply a common rule, but to seek another award, which would How could it be a comparatively easy matter. The decision in one case, would, were the circumstances the same, be taken as a precedent to be followed in others. Although the award in the Bootmakers' case bound only the immediate parties, there would be no difficulty in obtaining a like award in a similar case, and the certainty that such an award would be made would have a natural effect in settling disputes throughout the industry. Therefore, there is no need for the outcry about failure in the application of the common rule. the impossible and unattainable to ask any human tribunal to fix rates of pay, hours, and conditions of labour, universally applicable throughout Australia. ceed.

It was not proposed by it to break down the State Wages Boards or the State Industrial Arbitration Courts. bodies were to be preserved, encouraged, and stimulated, and the Federal authority would have the right to interfere only where there was unfair competition in Inter-State trade arising, say, from the lowness of wages or the inequality of the labour conditions as between two competing States. That was a reasonable proposition. The States were then willing to grant that power, but have not since granted it. I think it is now a fair proposition to say that if the States, having promised to grant fact has been, obtained from them more the power, have omitted to grant it, the time has arisen when we can fairly consider whether it ought not to be placed within the competence of this Parliament by independent legislation to create such a central Federal industrial authority. If that be done, I submit that it will remove most, if not all, of the complaints that have been made by some of the manufacturers as to the inequality of the awards in certain trades or callings in certain States. have been made. If there were created a Federal authority, with power, where there is a conflict between the awards of two Wages Boards or Arbitration Courts, to summon those Wages Boards or Arbitration Courts to appear before it and fight the question out there, and if then a decision could be given harmonizing the conflict, that would be a great gain, not only in the interests of labour, but also in the interests of those who have capital invested in these great industrial concerns. That is the extent to which I for one am quite prepared to go, because I believe it would meet all the requirements of the situation. While an amendment in such a manner, and with such limitations and qualifications, might fairly be sustained, I do not think an amendment of the Constitution ought to be advocated with such tenacity legislation dealing with all kinds of indusand force merely because there is a hope and expectation that better awards or better results might be obtained from a Federal than from a State authority. There ought to be no such hope or expectation, because the State authorities are quite as competent That was a very important The award of a Federal authority will not always be dependent upon any particular individual. Men pass away and tribunals may There was nothing in become differently constituted. The workers of Australia ought to be in a position to expect and demand as good and fair treatment from the Wages Boards of the various Those States as from any Federal tribunal. It is a reflection upon the State Boards or Courts to suggest that the workers can get better terms trom the Federal authority than from them. Both these authorities are, after all, created and maintained by the power of the people. If there is any defect in their constitution, the remedy is in the hands of the people. They can be improved and strengthened, and it must be said in favour of local organizations that the redress of grievances ought to be, and in promptly and swiftly than it could possibly be obtained from any central Federal authority. That is proved beyond challenge by the actual work done by the State Wages Boards. What is to happen under the proposed amendment? It is not designed merely to remove ambiguities that may exist in paragraph xxxv. of section 51 with reference to arbitration in "" industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of a State."" This clause is far more It is true that such complaints sweeping. It goes to the extent of actually wiping out that paragraph, and conferring upon this Parliament absolutely supreme and unqualified power to deal with all'industrial matters. Let honourable members consider what that means. Let them remember what the grant of power carries with it. I am not here to consider how that grant of power may be used afterwards. It may be used in a judicious manner if acquired, or in a reckless and destructive manner. We are not now constrained to speculate as to the mode or conditions in which it may be exercised. It will mean, if granted, that the Federal authority will be able to sweep aside and absolutely destroy all the State Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts. They could be wiped out; all their authority would be gone, and there would be one great central Legislature having power to pass universal trial disputes,whether they were merely internal disputes, confined to the limits of a State, or disputes extending over the whole continent. I fail to see what the true* cause of labour is to gain, or the cause of capital is to gain, or how anybody's interest is to be advantaged, by this proposed huge centralization in the Federal authority. It will certainly have the effect of destroying all the local spirit, energy, purpose, and patriotism attached to local self-government, just as a similar federalization of commerce would destroy all local control over commerce. I therefore contend that this power is not designed merely to remove doubts or to strengthen the power of the Federal Arbitration Court to settle industrial disputes. It goes further than that, further than ever any Justice of the High Court or Judge of the Federal Industrial Court has suggested, because it goes in the direction of the complete nationalization of everything. I con-, tend, with great respect, that it would be far better to limit any amendment to the actual requirements and conditions of the present as disclosed by our experience or by the decisions of the High Court. That experience and those decisions do not show that it is necessary to go to the enormous extent of breaking down and obliterating the Federal principle of the existing provision in the Constitution. I pass on to the next provision in the Bill relating to trusts and monopolies. It is proposed to amend section 51 of the Constitution by adding at the end thereof the following paragraphCombinations and monopolies in relation to the production, manufacture, or supply of goods or services. I do not wish to repeat any of the verbal criticism which has been offered respecting the meaning of ''combinations "" or "" monopolies "" but I should like to point out the far-reaching character of the proposal. I apprehend that its purpose is to give greater power to deal with trusts and combines. The amendment involves .the amendment of the commerce power, relates to, and is a branch of the commerce power, and may be said to qualify the commerce power. And yet, by the first amendment, the whole of the commerce power is to be nationalized. Where is the necessity for this particular proposal, when by an earlier amendment, there is full and absolute control over commerce of all kinds and descriptions without reference to geographical -or territorial limits? I understand that it is contended that the power of the Federation over trusts and combines is limited by the Inter-State condition ; but if we abolish that condition, we shall have supreme and unchecked control over everything-combines and monopolies, at any rate, in relation to production and the manufacture of Sir John Quick. goods. There is, therefore, no necessity for this amendment if the first be carried, with one qualification that is significant. I ask honourable members to observe that the last words in the clause are, "" or services,"" so that the amendment relates not only-to the production and manufacture or supply of goods, but also to "" services."" I should like to combat the argument that the Federal power over trusts and combines under the existing law is imperfect or inadequate. Let honourable members examine the Australian Industries Preservation Act, and peruse some of its drastic and penal provisions which give such enormous power to deal with trusts and combines interfering with Australian trade or Australian industries. Probably that is the most severe, comprehensive and drastic piece of legislation in any country in the British Empire. Although many of the prosecutions under the Act are of a quasi criminal character, the defendant has not only to prove himself innocent, but has actually to supply evidence against himself-evidenc e that is sought in the most inquisitorial, direct and scientific manner possible for the cleverest lawyer to devise. No law in the world is so drastic, and, apparently, so effective for dealing with Inter-State trade; indeed, it might be called Draconian in its severity. That legislation is applicable to all kinds of Inter-State trade-al t combinations, including the shipping ring, and so forth. I refrain, however, from mentioning names, particularly as cases are now pending; but honourable members may perhaps remember the companies and persons who are alleged to be monopolizing inter-State trade to the prejudice of Australian industries. I use the word "" alleged,"" and I use it advisedly. A number of the companies that are reputed to be engaged in nefarious conspiracy in restraint of trade are at present, I understand, under surveillance, and the Federal authorities are endeavouring to get evidence so as to secure conviction. One, if not more cases are pending at the present time, and, therefore, it would not be fair to make any comments on matters that are sub judice. But, so far as my knowledge goes, there has never been any breakdown of this anti-trusf legislation, because, up to the present, no case has been brought to trial. The difficulty. I understand, is in procuring any evidence to sustain the suspicions entertained ; but it was the honourable member for Angas, I think, who told us that there are not less than four or five companies or organizations known as monopolies in restraint of trade, and that gentleman speaks with some authority. However that may be, those persons or companies have not yet been placed on their trial, and we ought not to pronounce them guilty until they come, as they will shortly, before the proper tribunal. While there may be numbers of little trades, callings and companies within the limits of particular States that are said to partake of this monopolistic or trust character, I do not know that we have any proof of their existence; but if there is any legislation relating to trusts and combines. proof or evidence, I ask why the local Legislatures have not intervened. Surely those Legislatures are sufficiently close to the alleged offenders to have a better opportunity of finding them out and suppressing them than any distant Federal body? ber think that the Victorian Legislative Council would suppress' the Brick Combine? that the Victorian Legislative Council has ever been invited to do so. I think that the Victorian Parliament is as democratic as any Parliament in Australia. the Parliament. It is not necessary for me to pose as the apologist of this muchabused Legislative Council; I do not pretend to defend the Legislative Councils of any of the States, but I know that in Victoria the Upper House has, at any rate, acquiesced in the creation of some sixty Wages Boards. Boards had to be created with the acquiescence of the Legislative Council. ing with the present; and I say that the Legislative Council has acquiesced in the creation of those Wages Boards. in the creation of which the Legislative Council did not acquiesce. have passed that branch of the subject, and I am now dealing with trusts and monopolies. I am not aware of any State Legislature that has refused to pass laws dealing with notorious cases of local trusts or monopolies in restraint of trade. The members of the State Parliaments ought to be sufficiently vigorous in the performance of their duties; but I do not know that the members of the State Labour party of Victoria ever urged the introduction of anti-trust legislation. I submit that no sufficiently strong case has been made out for the proposed tremendous change in the Constitution, and that the Federal power is quite strong enough, unless, and until, the necessity for a change is established. I'should now like to revert to the words ""o r services,"" and ask what is their meaning. So far as 1 can see, they go further than any previous Hitherto legislation has related to trusts and combines in reference to the manufacture or supply of goods, but now we are introduced to a new form of monopoly or combination in relation to the supply of "" services."" I should like to have a little more information from the Labour party, or the Government, as to the meaning and application of the word, because it seems to me that there is a latent meaning which may carry an application and extension not contemplated by the framers of the Bill, and not demanded in any legislation relating to trade and commerce. Services, of course, have no relation or correlation to trade and commerce; and I should like to know the kinds of services that are referred to in the clause. This provision may have most unexpected operation, inasmuch as it may extend to professions. than transit-it covers services of all kinds, including transit and work and labour. I should think that one development may be to give power to nationalize or control, say, the medical profession, as performing medical "" services,"" because it is supposed that there is a certain combination among medical men to supply services within recognised limits. The provision might also probably be used to nationalize or destroy the legal profession, though probably that would not matter much, in the opinion of some honourable members; and we should then all be converted into a community of lawyers. But the more insidious result would probably be to give power to deal with any organization for the monopoly of labour iii any particular form, and it might result in bringing some of the trade unions within the grip of the combination law. Of course, the Labour party cannot always expect to be in a triumphant majority, because the swing of the pendulum must come in time; and I ask whether this proposal",40,Second Reading

Yet, under this clause, the Federal Parliament will be able tb interfere with and formulate terms and conditions under which combinations of labour may be authorized or prohibited. this is by the way. I have now covered the general grounds of my objections to some of the proposals made, and I say now, as I said at the beginning, that 1 have no objection in theory or in principle to any reasonable or legitimate amendment or extension of the Constitution, provided the amendment or extension does not change the Federal character, substance, and essence of the Constitution. No change should be made in the Constitution unless die practical life and experience of the people shows it to be justiour present position, and in the light of fiable, and no change should be made too far in anticipation of a change in the national conscience. Woodrow Wilson, I believe that great and important changes in the Constitution are justified and warranted only by the aspirations and national consciousness of the people. Such changes may be of slight growth, but it is far better that the Constitution within its national sphere and limitations should gradually change rather than that there should be mechanical alterations of a drastic, far-reaching, staggering character such as those involved in the proposals now before us. -It is unnecessary for any one in Australia to-day to apologize for supporting measures of the character now before the House, for the growing national feeling on every side shows that they are demanded by the people. We have had of late several instances of the direct antagonism of the people of the Commonwealth to anything savouring of State Rights, and of their approbation of a truly national sentiment. The latest illustration was furnished by the State election in New South Wales a few days ago. Probably no more determined effort on behalf of the State Rights party was ever made in the history of this country than was put up in connection with that election, and I believe we have no record of a more crushing defeat than that which the State Rights party sustainedThe only other case of the kind to which I can point is the decision given by the people when an attempt was made by means of the Financial Agreement to sub-' ordinate the national will to State dictaof services, not only of our tion. In all questions of the Commonwealth as against the States, I am out every time on behalf of the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, the framers of our Constitution seem to have followed the lines of the Constitution of the United However, all States rather than that of the Dominion of Canada. It appears to have been the object of the framers of the Constitution of the United States to outline in it the functions of the Federation, whereas the framers of the Canadian Constitution made a strong point of setting forth in it the functions of the States. Had the framers of our Constitution followed the example of Canada, we should have done much better, and should have known exactly what were the functions of the Commonwealth. The Attorney-General has clearly stated experience, there is no escape from the attitude which he took up. Appeals made In the words of on several occasions to the High Court have resulted in decisions showing that we do not possess certain powers which we believed we could justly exercise. The Leader of the Opposition took the honourable gentleman to task for asserting that we believed we possessed certain functions which the High Court had determined we did not enjoy, and I propose, in reply, to quote certain passages from the memoranda issued, one in 1907, and the other in 1908, by the then Deakin Administration. in 1908 by the Deakin Government was prepared after the decision of the High! Court in the harvester case. so. The point that I wish to make is that these memoranda show conclusively that the Government of the day must have claimed to possess certain powers under the Constitution which the subsequent judgments of the High Court clearly showed that the Federation did not enjoy. In the memorandum on new Protection, issued by the Deakin Government in 1908, we have these wordsAs it was under the Commonwealth power of taxation that the manufacturer obtained the benefit of a Protective Tariff, the same power of taxation was sought to be exercised to giveprotection to his employees by means of aa Excise Tariff.",43,Second Reading

It was stated in plain terms by the honourable member for Ballarat. who was then Prime Minister, that since we did not possess that power, according to the decision of the High Court, the Constitution should be so amended as to secure it for us. In this memorandum we have the statementAs the power to protect the manufacturer is national, it follows that unless the Parliament -of the Commonwealth also acquires power to secure fair and reasonable conditions of employment to wage-earners, the policy of protection must remain incomplete. Here is a candid admission that, unless we gain this power, the policy of Protection must remain incomplete. Mr J. H . CATTS -Apparentl y Protection is all right for the manufacturer, but it is not all right for the worker. An attempt to secure Protection for the workers, under the Constitution as it stands, has failed, and it is strange that the Opposition, some of whom claim to be Protectionists, and who supported the Government that issued the memorandum to which [ have referred, should be opposed to this I-roposition. of the Opposition are with us. to know that that is so. In the Excise Harvester Case, Mr Justice Higgins determined that a man should receive a wage sufficient to enable him to keep his wife and family in decency and comfort. That decision on appeal was upset. Yet those who joined the Fusion, having' as one of its objects, as shown by this memorandum, the granting of new Protection, now oppose an alteration of the Constitution to make the new Protection possible. It seems to me lhat they are taking up a very anomalous position. Since the Opposition are never tired of referring to British precedents, and the precedents of the House of Commons, I would remind them that, in Great Britain, the Parliament is supreme, whilst the Reichstag in"" Germany occupies the same position. In Australia to-day, however, those who stand as the champions of the British House of Commons refuse to allow the rule of the National Parliament, which simply means the people of the country, to be paramount. All that we are asking in these measures is that the Parliament of the Commonwealth shall be supremethat the people of the country, so far as these measures are concerned, shall be the masters of their own destinies. Surely that is not too much to ask in a democratic community. It might also be pointed out', with perfect fairness, that unless we can secure uniformity of legislation, manufacturers in one State must be placed at a great disadvantage in competing with the manufacturers of another. Since one of the principal amendments of the Constitution for which we ask is designed to secure uniformity of industrial legislation, those who have the best interests of the manufacturers and their employee's at heart must support our demand. If the workers in aa industry in Tasmania are receiving under a Wages Board award £ 2 ios. or ^ 3 ios. per week, whilst those engaged in a similar industry in New South Wales under no such regulation are receiving only 30s. or 35s. per week, the regulated industry in Tasmania must obviously be at a great disadvantage in competing with the unregulated one in the other State. I know of 110 way by which the uniformity that is necessary, not only in the interests of the. manufacturers, but of the workers themselves, can be secured, save that which is now proposed. The honourable member for Bendigo, who has just resumed his seat, referred at length to the position of the Wages Boards in Victoria. I have seldom, listened to so vigorous a defence of our Legislative Council as that which he saw fit to make j and, as one who has followed the working of our Upper Houses pretty closely, I do not hesitate to say that the Legislative Council of Victoria is not de-. serving of such a championing of its cause. The honourable member referred to a number of industries in which Wages Boards have been granted, but very conveniently forgot to tell us of the many cases in which Wages Boards had been refused by. the Legislative Councils of Victoria andother States. Not long ago the Legislative! Council refused to appoint a Wages Board, in the paper-making trade, although it .was shown that unfortunate women, after work-, ing in the trade for several years,: were receiving only 13s. 9d. per week. I could give other instances in which' Wages Boards have been refused in Victoria and other States. The appointment of such Boards was altogether prevented in Tasmania by the action of the Legislative Council there. But even if the Victorian Parliament were ready to grant every application for Wages Boards, it is possible that the creation of such tribunals",44,Second Reading

There have been too many legal gentlemen engaged in the drawing up and interpretation of the Constitution, and too great an inclination has been displayed by them to use it as a sort of legal nose-bag, from which they have drawn largely. I can understand the efforts put forward in some quarters in defence of the Constitution. The High Court, of course, was appointed to interpret the Constitution, but if there is anything in that instrument which places a barrier irt the way of the expression of the will of the people by legislation, that barrier should be removed at the earliest possible moment. The defence of State Rights, made by the Leader of the Opposition, was in such marked contrast to the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Flinders that I think that some of the members of the party would express themselves very strongly regarding the latter. Mr J. H . CATTS -It was a great speech. all honour to him for it. But the defence of State Rights made by the Leader of the Opposition was received with such enthusiasm by his party that it is safe to say that some of them are graduating for the membership of shire councils or school boards of advice. I never heard of such championing of State Rights. before. Some of the sentiments expressed were unbecoming and out of place in an assembly like this. ber cite one or two of them? lo be found in Hansard. The Leader of the Opposition asked what necessity is there for the proposed alteration of the Constitution. A simple reply is that the necessity exists to-day which existed when he was leading a Government, and published two memoranda pointing out the need for Protection, not only for the manufacturer, but also for the workers and consumers of the country. His speech I have no might be summed up as a plea for the Constitution. He argued that because the Constitution was adopted by a majority of three to one it should remain unaltered. But the people had no other choice than to accept or reject, the Constitution. They were tired of State control, and desired Federation. Just as Socrates took the hemlock from the hands of his executioners, because he had no alternative, so the people accepted the draft Constitution because nothing better was offered to them. To say that because they accepted it there should be no alteration of it now is the poorest logic I can imagine. To-day the Constitution is not responsive to the people's will, and in a democratic country we should make it so at the earliest possible moment. Dealing now with the Monopolies Bill, I would point out that no one would deny that in this young country there is danger that in a very short time trusts and combines may be as rampant as they are in America to-day. Evidence is not wanting that already they are beginning to spread their hideous tentacles, which threaten to sap the vitality of the community, if legislation does not interfere with them before they reach the dimensions which they have reached in other parts of the world. There cannot be two opinions as to the wisdom of legislating to prevent the growth of monopolies. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition said that those on his side were prepared to take a progressive view on the subject. The whole trouble with honourable members opposite seems to be that difficulty may be found in determining what constitutes a monopoly. In this regard we have what I might call a precedent in a case tried by the Supreme Court of the United States, which occupies a similar position to that of the High Court here. It is known as the Munn case, and dealt with questions affecting the control of grain elevators. The decision was a surprise to the legal body as well as to those connected with the case. Instead of expressing the opinion that the power of the Legislature to regulate was based on the grant of some special privilege, the Court heldI think very wisely-that whenever the nature of a business is such that the patronage of the public' is compulsory, the Legislature shall have power to protect the public from extortion.

If the honourable member were less anxious to be sarcastic at the expense of those who differ from him, he would, I think, have made a much better speech. He tried to make merry at the enthusiasm shown by honourable members on this side over a very excellent address delivered by the honourable member for Ballarat. I think, however, that all who listened to that speech, and who have been associated with that honourable member during his career as a Federal politician, will agree that on this occasion he reached a height which was rarely attained by him on any previous occasion. We ought to be proud to have the opportunity of listening to such oratorical efforts as those of the honourable member, and also of the Attorney-General. It is a good thing that enthusiasm has not altogether died down in this House; although at present, amongst our latest additions, it seems to be spent chiefly on the new toy with which they are playing, namely, the Federal Constitution. with the creation of the Constitution as fication; and I , for one, refuse to believe had the honourable member 1 ticians, having been projected by the drafting a Constitution very much in Labour catapult into the Federal arena was young himself once !

I have been asked about the United States Inter-State Commission; and I point out that that body was brought into existence under conditions different from those that now prevail; and, consequently, it has not the necessary power to deal effectively with subsequent developments. in America, who desire to deal with objectionable trusts and combines, do not go so far as is now proposed by the Government. When President Roosevelt sent his special message to Congress-that remarkable message which caused so much interest and attention throughout the civilized worlddemanding that a more effective measure of control should be exercised by the American Federation over trade and commerce, the object he aimed at was stated as follows:The law should correct that portion of the Sherman Act whicli prohibits all combinations whether reasonable OT unreasonable, but this should be done only as part of the general scheme to provide effective and thorough-going supervision by the national Government of all operations of the big Inter-State business conIt was undoubtedly a necessary and benecerns. President Roosevelt asked for power to deal only with those industrial and commercial conditions that are of an InterState character. The Labour party of Australia did not always show enthusiasm for the development of the Federal Constitution, but rather the contrary in most of the States. In Western Australia Labour stood solidly with those who were seeking to achieve Federation; but I fancy that we were an exception in that respect from the rest of the Commonwealth. I am much afraid that the present interest of members of the Labour party, in the development of Federal functions, is largely liecause of their unexpected success at the Federal election. unexpected. terjection, because it confirms me in my opinion that these powers are sought merely for party purposes. It is nothing short of lamentable that a great change of the kind should be advocated from a party stand-point alone. There are two forces in mechanicsthe centrifugal and the -centripetal-and these are duplicated in political affairs by what we call, in a general sense, centralization and decentralization. On the one hand, there are influences at work drawing into a common centre the power of government, and, on the other, influences throwing outwards, rather than inwards, those powers which the people believe can best be exercised in decentralized form. In the history of civilized communities, we have alternatively But reformers this force of centralization operating, and again the force of decentralization. We see now the force of centralization at work; but I feel sure that the condition is only temporary, and that if the object aimed at by the Labour party is achieved it will bring about sooner than would otherwise be the case an inclination to go in the opposite direction. It is interesting, in this connection, to look back into the past, because we know that history is simply philosophy teaching by experience. 1 do not think that even the most ardent advocate of centralization would be prepared to say that the action of the early settlers in the Port Phillip district of Australia in securing its severance from New South Wales was a reactionary or mistaken step. ficent development for the people of Victoria. The same may be said of other cases of breaking away from the parent colony. No one, looking at the map of Australia, will hesitate to admit that the States as they exist are not wholly artificial. They arose largely under conditions that might almost be described as natural. They were the creation of the force of circumstances, and although their boundaries in many respects are artificial, still the collection of population in given centres around our Australian coast was undoubtedly a perfectly natural process that made for the development and progress of Australia as a whole. The beneficial operation of that process has not yet to come to an end.

194,Mr Fowler,"I am glad of the inAfter the States had existed and carried on the work of development in their respective spheres for many years, the influence of centralization began to operate. And why ? Simply because, as the States grew in their commercial relations, they found that a great deal of unnecessary inconvenience was created by the Tariffs which they had built up against each other. In addition to that, the question of defence, as has already been pointed out with considerable force, was pressed upon the people of Australia by the development of the power and the warlike tendencies of those Eastern nations that almost surround us, and even now seem to be waiting an opportunity to land in countless numbers upon our shores. It was realized that in this respect alone some degree of centralization was necessary. that defence was undoubtedly the essential necessity that brought about all other Federations. I am not sure that if we had reached the stage, which I hope civilization will yet attain, of having an effective international tribunal that would make war a thing of the past, the Australian Federation would not even yet have been in the air. I know that in Western Australia we had very considerable difficulty in persuading our people-eve n those who had entered the State but a comparatively short time before-that the breaking down of our Tariff wall against the other States would in all respects be for the betterment of all concerned, or that the advantages we should gain from Federation would not be more than counterbalanced by its disadvantages. advantages more than counterbalanced the disadvantages ? a whole is concerned, Federation has been an undoubted gain, but it is difficult to see any particular advantage at the present time in the case of Western Australia. If we are to be brought into a condition of unification, in which the interests of that great and growing State will be centralized and administered by a Government in the far-away Federal Capital, I feel sure that Federation, instead of proving a blessing, will be an undoubted curse to the people on that side of the continent. never yet made a prediction that has not been falsified. .which Opposition the honourable member is referring, but, in any case, his interjection is such a sweeping generalization that, on the spur of the moment, I cannot endorse it. We have heard the lawyers very learnedly, and abstrusely, dealing with this subject. I do not wish to follow them along those winding legalpaths which only the trained lawyer can follow. I wish to put as briefly as I can a few observations as to what was intended in connection with the Federation movement, and I think that I can do so in a few words. It appears to me that the problem that presented itself to those who were authorized to draw up our Federal compact was simply this: What functions could best be exercised for Australia by a Central authority, and what functions could best remain in the hands of I think it will be found the State Governments? That was the position as I apprehended it, and I believe that 1 am correctly stating it. The work which the Federal Convention was set to do was undoubtedly to try to divide between the two forms of government-the old and the proposed-the various functions that were thought to be best suited to each. On the whole, the work was done faithfully and well, and I hold that we must give the efforts of that Convention an honest trial before we shall be justified in finding fault with them. Although we have heard a great deal about the difference between our Federation and others, when we look at the practical result of the various understandings in the nature of Federations arrived at in other countries we must recognise that they are all substantially upon the same basis. In the case of all other Federations, as in our own, the same question seems to have been operating, in their construction: ""What functions can best be exercised by this new Central authority we are about to call into existence, and what are those that had better remain with the States?"" Accordingly, although we find certain distinctions, on the whole the subdivision of powers in almost every case has been pretty well upon Australian lines. We are told that, in Canada, the Federation is the supreme power; but those who look at the list of functions exercised by the Dominion and those exercised by the Opposition has States will find a division almost or substantially equal to that prevailing in Australia. The same is to be said of Switzerland, allowing for the difference in circumstances. The honourable member for Indi",50,Second Reading

Whilst some of the northern States of the German Confederation have practically surrendered all their governing powers to the Central authority, there are others, such as Bavaria, that still control, not only their railways and the Postal Department, but even the army. Therefore, to speak of the German Confereation as being in some respects superior to our own in the matter of its centralization is to speak hastily, and without knowledge of all the facts. jections from the Government side of the House are not worrying the honourable member. the outset of my remarks, but evidently what I have to say is not palatable to honourable members opposite, and, therefore, I am honored by the absence of those interjectors. tention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.] connection with these various Federations are due largely to local conditions. For instance, in some Federations the Central authority has the control of rivers. In Australia, however, a newspaper which has been one of the strongest champions of an extension of the Federal power has taken up the position that the rivers of its State should not be handed over to the Federal control. Its reasons may be sufficient, but as to that I have no knowledge; I use the fact as an illustration to support .my contention that in all Federations there is substantially the same division of functions between the Central and the State Governments; where they differ, the differences are due to local peculiarities and necessities rather than differences of prinbe possible for the Federal Parliament to ciple. Looking abroad into the world, I am not able to find that unification is proaffect equally and ""fairly industrial condiceeding in any Federation other than this; on the contrary, I find a tendency to crystallize the Federations in many respects, to go no further than has been already gone, and to guard jealously the rights and privileges of the State Parliaments and Governments. thought to justify all attempts to enhance the power of the Federation is the alleged antagonism of the State Parliaments, and particularly of their Upper Houses, to the Federation. If we are to believe the Ministerialists, the State Parliaments are antiquated, effete bodies incapable of doing effectively even the slightest portion of the work intrusted to them. I have no language too severe for the condemnation of the undemocratic attitude of the Upper Houses towards the reforms asked for and advocated on behalf of the masses. But having regard to the immense size of Australia, it must be agreed that, although we have State Parliaments in addition to a Federal Parliament, they are none too many for our requirements. Our population may be a small one for so many Parliaments, but we hope that it will increase rapidly in the future. The difficulty of governing a country effectively is caused not so much by the number of its people as by its geographical conditions. An immense territory such as ours, with settlements separated as widely as ours are, makes State Parliaments necessary for proper development. If we keep adding to the functions of the Federal Parliament as honourable members opposite desire, how will it find time to do its work? Even now we have to spend more time here than we ought to have to spend, and, if honourable members opposite had their way, it would be impossible, even if we should sit all the year round, to pass a tithe of the legislation that would be needed. I am at a loss to understand how a unified Parliament could deal effectively with the multifarious questions coming before the State Parliaments, whose legislation concerns a tremendous variety of interests. The differences of climate, production, and industrial conditions render it hopeless to get one Parliament to legislate effectively for the whole of Australia. bers of Parliament in Australia? presently deal with that matter.

I agree that in some of the States, notoriously in Victoria, it is impossible now to get effective democratic legislation. and disgust the attitude of the Victorian Legislative Council, since I have been a member of this Parliament, towards legislation necessary to the welfare and progress of the State. grave misfortune that the citizens of Victoria have not done something with their Upper House, and it is astonishing that they have not prosecuted an agitation for its reform with more enthusiasm and determination. the task they could accomplish it. There may be constitutional difficulties in the way, but if an appeal to the authorities in the Mother Land were ineffective, Victoria would be justified in following the Cromwellian tradition, giving its Councillors, by force if necessary, a lengthened holiday, locking the door of their chamber, and throwing the key into the deepest pool of Port Phillip. Legislative Council of Victoria does not justify the step now proposed, even though that body, consisting as it does of men whose sole qualification appears to be the possession of wealth, is as anomalous as a Senate composed wholly of bond fide members of trade unions would be. mind, the class distinctions which it represents are more objectionable .than those we see in connection with the Labour movement. It is a serious defect in our Constitution that it contains no provision for the simplification of the State Parliaments. It was expected that, following on Federation, they would have been simplified, and thus made more efficient. The fact that there was not a definite and compulsory provision for this necessary reform is to be deplored. provided, first, for the abolition of the office particular States where one portion of the of State Governor; and, secondly, for the reform of the Legislative Councils. As we are told ad nauseam that this is emphatically the National Parliament, and that it is our duty as Nationalists and Australian patriots to increase in every way the powers of the Federal authority, I would now direct attention to one of the most interesting countries in the world, Switzerland. There we find a Federal Constitution existing side by side with other conditions which, according to the Labour members, ought to be swept away in any democratic community. There is no question whatever as to the democratic character of the Swiss people. They are undoubtedly amongst the most democratic, as they are I have viewed with surprise amongst the most intelligent and patriotic, people, in the world. In many respects they have set the world examples and provided it with lessons in connection with legislation. The country of Switzerland It is nothing short of a consists of some 16,000 square miles only. To make a comparison that brings its size home with more force, I would remind honourable members that Victoria, one of the smallest of our States, is more than five times as large. Switzerland, in 1848, If they set themselves to formed its Federation. Up to that time it had consisted of a number of cantons, or States, separated by natural conditions that probably accounted for their existence. Large and impassable ranges of mountains and other geographical features had tended to develop in the various valleys of that little country a certain amount of isolation, and, therefore, a desire, so far as the But the existence of the people were concerned, to live largely for themselves. As years went on, however, the necessity for closer union became apparent to this intelligent and democratic people. They came together, but they did not form a Unification. They created a Federation not dissimilar to ours in many respects. One would think that in such a little Indeed, to my country, situated in the heart of Europe, and surrounded by possible enemies, if there has been any virtue in unification, the principle would have been adopted with enthusiasm. But we find in Switzerland at present, side by side with its Federal organization, no fewer than twenty-five separate cantonal or half-cantonal Governments, each of these little sections of the Swiss people having almost as much power as the States of Australia have at present. They have even gone further than we have, The Constitution should have because those half-cantons are found in people is rural and the other urban; ancl it. has been considered that there is such a divergence of interest between town and country that, in those cases, the canton has been divided into two portions, the rural portion having one State Government, if I may so term it, for itself, while the city 01 town has another. ,>Those conditions have existed now since 1848, with very slight modifications. Although during that time the mountains have been pierced with tunnels, railways have been built, excellent roads have been made, and with the advent of telegraphs and telephones communication has been rendered simple and easy among the various portions of that little country, its people still retain their State Governments, because they believe it is vitally necessary to their welfare that home rule and centralization should exist side by side. In the movement which gave America its Federation it was the Democrats who opposed the policy of centralization which Alexander Hamilton, the aristocratic autocrat of America during his day, desired to establish. He and those who worked with him made no secret of their desire, as they put it themselves in a famous phrase, to place Democracy in a straight-jacket, when they were drawing up the United States Constitution. They did so, to a very large extent, and many writers on American conditions since then have attributed the decay that has taken place in United States politics generally to the impossible to discuss a question of the gravity poverishment of the States, which resulted from the federation of that great countiy. We have been reminded in this debate of the glorious Constitution of Great Britain. associated with a glorious history, but that history has been created, not so much by virtue' of the British Constitution as, very frequently, in spite of it. At the present time, that Constitution is admitted by all jurists to be an unwieldy, inadequate, and creaking piece of machinery, and it has become imperative that in the near future some devolution shall be accomplished, in order that the Central Parliament, that ancient body, shall be able strongly the view that these Bills, particuto discharge with some degree of efficiency a portion of the work that it is at present struggling helplessly to perform. In Great Britain, at the present time, the cry for home rule is echoing, not from Ireland alone, but from Scotland and provincial England as well. In Scotland, I know the people for many years have been divided between a sense of loyalty to the old compact and a growing feeling of irritation at the uncertainty, slowness, and expense of legislation when attempted for that country in the Imperial Parliament. I have no hesitation, in saying that, if Scotland had had a measure of home rule, her position to-day would have been much more forward, and her people in a happier and more prosperous condition, than has been the case under the system of centralization that has operated so frequently to her disshould each surrender certain powers. In Mr Fowler. advantage. The same centralization policy we have seen bitterly opposed all these years in Ireland. I cannot understand the attitude of many members of this House, and many members of the Labour party outside the House, who, while ardent enthusiasts for home rule in their native country, are bitter enemies of the same policy as we see it in Australia. The two principles of home rule and centralization must co-exist side by side. There are neces sary and useful spheres of action for both the State and Federal Parliaments. I believe it is our duty to continue to carry out this policy of division of labour, which I hold as one of my essential political beliefs to be absolutely necessary both to the welfare of Australia as a whole and to the best interests of its Democracy. I would join with others who have preceded me in the anxious hope that it were of the one immediately before us from a non-party stand-point. I feel that every invitation has been extended from this side that the matter should be so regarded, but lt has undoubtedly been every overture made in that direction has been stolidly resisted, and no encouragement whatever has been given for dealing with the issue in that fashion. I feel, therefore, that to a large extent it is futile for us to attempt to put forward any arguments in connection with the important Bill before us, recognising that to do so will practically have the result of altering no votes. I do not think the Leader of the Opposition emphasized by any means too larly the one altering our legislative powers, will, if carried, have the effect of destroying many of the essential principles of the Federal system. Let us recall the circumstances under which Federation came into existence. It was a purely voluntary act on the part of the States themselves. They were self-governing bodies, each sovereign within its own sphere, but animated, no doubt, by the feeling which pervaded the community, and the experience of what had taken place in other portions of the British Dominions, they determined that it was desirable to establish a central body to deal with various matters of common interest to the whole of Australia. Representatives were therefore appointed, and met in various Conferences, and it was agreed that the States",52,Second Reading
205,Sir Robert Best (Kooyong) [5.40].,"determining the powers to be thus surrendered, the greatest care and circumspection were exercised. The most experienced of our politicians, the most distinguished in their several States, men of great training and political authority, met together. Knowing the conditions of their several States, they realized that certain powers alone could be advantageously surrendered, and these were made the subject of jurisdiction by the central authority. After many conferences and lengthy debates, there resulted a compact or Constitution which, I venture to say, created a contract between the Commonwealth and the States; and, recognising the care shown by all concerned in bringing into life this Federal body, I agree that extreme caution should be exercised in any alteration or amendment. In section 51 of the Constitution, various subjects of legislation creased wages and better conditions. Daily are set forth, following the process of drafting adopted in the American Constitution. The idea in both cases was that the subjects should be barely mentioned, to be subsequently developed or extended, first by the Parliament, and afterwards by the Law Court of the national body. Thus we find it simply provided that the Parliament shall have power to legislate with respect to "" trade and commerce vvith other countries, and among the States."" But each subject of legislation so mentioned represents a vast sphere of activity upon which volumes could be written; and, indeed, volumes have already been written in America. posed to put the Constitution into the melting-pot-fro m that conclusion there is no escape. Has any demand been made by the people that this should be done? His anything taken place in the working of the Constitution to justify such drastic alterations? One of the chief arguments in favour of the Bill before us is that relating to industrial conditions; but that is really founded on the assumption that there has been, to some extent, a failure of the induswas rather that the States and the Commontrial measures passed by the States. That is altogether a wrong assumption; because, prior to Federation, several of the States, including Victoria, made large advances in the establishment of industrial tribunals. I was a member of the Victorian Government in 1896, which introduced, for the first time in the history of Australia, the principle of new Protection. It was realized that the manufacturers alone should not have the benefit of the fiscal system then obtaining in the State; but that there should be granted to employees some guarantee of fair and reasonable wages and conditions; and no industrial system, I venture to say, has proved so successful. From one State to another that system has spread until throughout the Commonwealth, excepting only Tasmania, the Wages Boards have been established ; and the principle has been extended even to the Mother Country itself. Is it not obvious that such a system must be successful? In the first place, it realizes the immediate condition of the several industries, and creates Boards, consisting of experts who are in touch with the interests involved, and capable of deciding what is just in the way of wages and conditions. In Victoriaj there are now upwards of seventy Wages Boards, to the immediate benefit ot over 70,000 employees, in the shape of inand weekly the system is spreading and developing, and proving more and more successful ; and, under the circumstances, it is not an unfair assumption that the workers, who know best what conditions suit them, and who have expressed themselves as gieatly satisfied, do not clamour for what is practically an experiment which may or may not prove successful, or, at any rate, cannot prove more satisfactory than the system now in operation, while it may prove infinitely less so. When we temember that the States, with their industrial legislation, are in a position to deal with the complexities within their own Umits, and are It is now practically prothe best judges of what is adapted to their own immediate requirements, and that the persons adjudicating on the Wages Boards are experts, it must be admitted that, under all the circumstances, such a serious departure as that now contemplated is not by any means justified. In my opinion this legislation will result in fomenting trouble and friction with the States-wil l result in the Commonwealth pulling against the States. The immediate object of Federation wealth should pull together, representative as they are of one people, with an anxious desire to study the best interests and the highest welfare of Australia as a whole. It vvas determined that there should be two agencies, one for the conduct of national affairs, and the State Parliaments as local agencies for the administration of local affairs, work for which no other authority could be better fitted. The honourable member who spoke last expressed surprise that no effort had been made to utilize the Inter-State Commission which is part of the machineryprovided in the Conwill not, I think, be ready to cast that stitution for dealing with industrial matters ; but he must have overlooked the fact that the late Government introduced an Inter-State Commission Bill, which I had the honour of presenting in another place. The Bill was drawn on the principle that the Commonwealth should take advantage of the network of industrial tribunals already provided in the several States. It was recognised by reason of expressions from the Bench, both in tht New South Wales Arbitration Court and in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, that it was possible for unfair conditions to exist owing to the varying decisions of the separate State tribunals; and in order to meet the situation, the BillI introduced contemplated a Federal tribunal. It was not proposed to acquire this power against the determined resistance of the States, but to deal with the vast question, of such moment to us all, by means of a common arrangement. It was provided that the several States should, in terms of the ConI would also urge that the amendment constitution, give to the National Parliament the authority to deal with the differences brought about by unfair competition as between States, with a view to adjustment and settlement; and by this means, coordination and harmonious relationship through the Commonwealth was to be established. But it was suggested and admitted at once that, if the States failed all-important questions separately. to carry out the bargain to remit such questions to the central body, an amendment of the Constitution must be secured to attain the desired end. So far from there having been any failure to utilize that portion of the machinery of the Constitution known as the Inter-State Commission, the lafe Government proposed to bring it into operation by means of the Bill which I introduced. All was to be done in consultation with the States; and I venture to say that that course would have heen more successful than any legislatime to time need only to be brought before tion attempted at the expense and in spite of the States. by the people! be seen. In the meantime, I say that if it were possible for the people to be asked whether they were prepared to accept the alternative scheme to which I have just referred, I should not be doubtful as to the result. Having realized the advantages of the industrial legislation already passed by the States, the people legislation aside for proposals which may or may not be successful. I join in what I regard as a most reasonable requestthat the several questions set forth in the Bill should be separately submitted to the people. It has been suggested that they are all related one to the other; but that, in my opinion, is not correct. For instance, clause 2 provides that section 51 of the Constitution shall be amended by the omission of the words, "" with other countries and among the States""; and that I contend is essentially a separate question from the others. If carried in the form presented in this Bill, it would not render necessary the submission of tlie amendment for which clause 5 provides,'namelySection fifty-one of the Constitution is altered by adding at the end thereof the followingparagraph :(XL.) Combinations and monopolies in relation to the production, manufacture, or supply of goods or services. templated by clause 3 is by no means necessarily connected with those for which clause 2 and clause 5 provide. That provided for in clause 4 is certainly not connected with the others. It is only fair that first of all the Parliament, and, secondly, the people, should have an opportunity to deal with and vote on these I am sure that there are on this side of the House honourable members who are prepared to grant a degree of modificationalthough not of the drastic character proposed in this Bill-to meet the immediate difficulties that have arisen under the Constitution. It is the anxiety of all parties that every facility should be granted for the expansion of the Constitution and the exercise of the jurisdiction for which section 51 and other parts of the instrument provide. Difficulties that may arise from this Parliament in order to be rectified. Let me deal first of all with the proposal to extend the commerce power by striking out the words appearing in paragraph 1. of section 51, "" With other countries and among the States."" The provision as it stands practically follows that in the American Constitution, save that, I think, the subject is made stronger by section 98, which declares thatThe power of the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to",54,Second Reading
206,Mr Carr,B y the will of the States,56,Second Reading
207,' Sir Robert Best,"That remains tonavigation and shipping, and to railways the property of any State. I admit that some difficulties have arisen tn this regard. It became my duty to introduce on two occasions the Navigation Bill in another place, and I had, therefore, to study very closely our power to legislate in that direction. tainly greatly surprised to discover the extraordinarily wide character of our commerce power, and the extent of our jurisdiction under it, as declared by the Courts of the United States. It appears to be limited by the words, "" with other countries and among the States'""; but according to the American authorities the legislative power is not confined to ships engaged in Inter-State trade and foreign commerce. I think it will be clear that we have power to make laws in regard to navigation and shipping, so far as InterState trade and commerce are affected, and that our jurisdiction extends over ships and seamen, the control of the navigable waters of the Commonwealth, and of all ships which use those waters. In other words, all the waters that may be used for navigable purposes are practically within the power, control, and jurisdiction of the Federal body. All waters which are accessible from a State other than that in which they lie are immediately within the power of the National Parliament. I have here a short note of the case of Gilman v. Philadelphia, reported in 3 Wallace, page 734, in which it was laid down thatThe power to regulate commerce comprehends the control for that purpose, and to the extent necessary, of all the navigable waters of the United States which are accessible from a Stale other than that in which they lie. For this purpose they are the public property of the nation and subject to all the requisite legislation by Congress. As in the United States the laws relating to navigation, shipping, and seamen are based on the plenary powers of Congress, so in the case of the Commonwealth, I venture to say, we may claim full power to legislate on the whole subject, so far as navigation on the high seas or the navigable waters of the Commonwealth is concerned. In further illustration of the extent of the powers that we possess under the Constitution as it stands, I would point out that in the case of The Oyster Police Steamers of Maryland, 31 Federal Report, page 763, it was laid down thatThe existing regulation of Congress with regard to steam vessels proceeds upon the assumption that it possesses f u l l power to regulate all vessels navigating public waters of the United States whether they are engaged in commerce or not. . . And it is also apparent that Congress proceeds upon the theory that proper regulation requires that all vessels in those waters shall be subject to one uniform system. Other cases have established the principle that navigation laws may be applied even I was certo vessels engaged in the domestic commerce of the States. In the case of Lord v. Steam-ship Company, 102 US. Reports, page 541, is was specifically held'' thatWhile navigating the high seas between ports of the same State, a vessel of the United States is, together with the business in which she is engaged, subject to the regulating power of Congress. That is under the commerce power of the United States, with which our commerce power corresponds. We may, therefore, fairly claim, under our powers as already existing, to regulate all ships which use Inter-State highways, whether engaged in Inter-State trade or not, as we consider that that is a matter affecting Inter-State commerce. We have power to regulate and make laws as to lights, signals, rules of the road, collisions, safety, competence and efficiency of officers and seamen, safety appliances, salvage, overloading, seaworthiness, inspection of hull, machinery and boilers. In fact, speaking generally and subject, of course, to the assent of the Crown, we have practically the power to deal with almost everything that is contained in the Merchant Shipping Act. It has been held, moreover, in America, that the Federal law as to even the limited liability of ship-owners is applicable to ships engaged in the domestic trade of a State. In the case of Patterson v. Endora, the Federal law prohibiting advances to seamen, without limitations, was held to be constitutional. The vessel in that case was engaged in foreign commerce, and the Court left open the question as to the applicability of the section in the case of a sailor serving wholly within a State. But in view of the decisions of the Court on analogous questions, there can be little doubt that the section would, if the case arose, be held to apply. I have cited these cases in order that honourable members may realize the vast and extensive powers that we already 'possess under the Constitution. I do not wish to state the position unfairly. I might be met at once with the statement that I found it necessary to insert in the Navigation Bill, as introduced by me, a provision to protect it against a declaration of unconstitutionality as to certain of if* parts. In that Biil we inserted tlie provisionThis Act shall not apply to any ships exthe anti-trust laws of that country. Those clusively used in inland waters of a State, which are not navigable by ships engaged in trade or commerce with other countries or among the States. That reservation has but a limited applicalegislation is for the most part, if not tion, and practically would apply only to inability on the part of the Federal body to deal with and control shipping on lakes that were immediately within a State, and which were not to be reached by ships coming from other States. It will be observed that our powers under the existing terms of the Constitution practically extend to all navigable waters. I would therefore urge that, having regard to the vast powers we already possess in this regard, we should proceed with great care and caution with any proposal to extend them to regions of domestic legislation relating to the States. We should satisfy ourselves that these are amendments which experience and the working of the Constitution itself have justified. To my mind, they should certainly be of a more limited character. I come now to the proposal to amend the Constitution so as to extend our power to deal with corporations. I am with those who agree that certain limited alterations are essential, particularly in regard to the creation and dissolution of corporations. The honourable member for Flinders and others have already pointed out that this Bill, in proposing the introduction of such stated. The point I wish to emphasize is that words as "" regulation and control of corporations,"" goes far beyond what was really intended by the Government itself. The Constitution Alteration (Monopolies) Bill proposes to extend our power to make laws with respect to monopolies. I can scarcely be accused of sympathy with monopolies, since it was my duty to take some part in the introduction of the parent measure, and to introduce two other Bills amending what are known as our antitrust laws. The two subsequent measures had for their object the controlling of monopolies detrimental to the public. The evolution of the system of monopolies is of recent date. In the first place, we had the ordinary trading corporations, and then came the schemes for aggregating corporations. creation of what may be called holding companies, which, possessing themselves of the majority of the shares in several other companies, were enabled to manage and control them. In that way competition was stifled. This process of commercial greed resulted in Sir Robert Best. abuses of the most serious character in the United States, and led to the passing of anti-trust laws are of a very drastic character; but in some respects they do not seem to be sufficiently stringent. Our anti-trust wholly, founded upon that of America. Mr W. H . IRVINE -But those antitrust laws have been found quite ineffectual by reason of the constitutional limitations. found ineffectual in some cases, but very effective in others, and there have been several successful prosecutions. There is a bureau of corporations which, though somewhat limited as to its sphere of action, bas done work of a useful character, having successfully prosecuted in the Ice Company's case, in one or two cases in which the Standard Oil Company was concerned, and in the Sugar Company case. rities Company's case.

If power is not given to the Parliament to control trusts detrimental to the public, and they are not efficiently controlled, there will, at least, be some justification for taking them over, as urged by honourable members opposite. But the time for that is yet a long way off. I do not hold that all trusts are injurious to the public interest and necessarily bad, but those whose operation is tyrannous and detrimental to the public welfare should be dealt with by the Parliament, which should have jurisdiction, not merely in respect to combinations whose business extends from State to State or beyond the limits of Australia, but also in relation to their internal operations within the These were followed by the States.

The distinguishing feature of those Courts is that no lawyers are allowed there. All suits whatsoever, without regard to the amounts involved, must, in the first place, .be brought before these Courts. The Judge takes down the oral complaint of the plaintiff and the oral defence of the defendant, and renders judgment accordingly. If , however, either of the parties is dissatisfied with the judgment, the Judge refers the case to the regular Courts, in which Courts, however, no other evidence is allowed to be introduced but that which was laid before the Judge sitting in the Court of Conciliation. A vast amount of litigation is settled yearly by these Courts, because it is the duty of the Judge to explain the laws governing the particular case The history of law to the parties, and also, undoubtedly, because lawyers are excluded. To show how justice is administered in that little country, 1 wish to quote a letter By infrom the present Attorney-General of Denmark, wbich, I think, is absolutely unique in the record of the legal treatment of clients, and worthy of being preserved in our Hansard.

With kind regards, Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) FRITZ BUEI.OV>. In all my fifty years of reading I have never come across conduct equal to that on the part, of a lawyer. The honourable member for Bendigo supported in the main what fell from the lips of his' eloquent leader, but he laid great stress on the fact questions when he had no objection to their that the electors were to be asked four questions. Let us see, however, what the honourable member advocated at the Conference which ultimately led to the Federal Convention. He there moved a motion to the effect that the Legislature of each Colony should pass an Act providing for the election of representatives to attend a statutory Convention or Congress to adopt a Bill for a Federal Constitution for Australia, and, on the adoption of such Bill, to submit it by some process of referendum to the verdict of each Colony. The honourable member did not then complain that the 128 separate sections of the Federal Constitution would be too many to submit to the people, although he now contends that the same people cannot be trusted to understand four simple questions. Lawyer as he is, and good Democrat as he was, he must realize that 128 sections of a huge Constitution are much more difficult to grasp than the questions it is now proposed shall be placed before the people. But, in any case, how dare he or any other honourable member say that the people are not fit to declare what shall be the law ? Before the last election we heard a great deal about "" trusting the people,"" but it must be remembered that every man on this side of the House represents a majority, though the Leader of the Opposition knows that the same cannot be said with truth of some honourable members who sit behind him. That we on this side are not afraid to trust the people is proved by the fact that one plank in our platform, supported by every Labour member and every Labour elector, is the initiative and the referendum. When the Leader of the Opposition-whos e speeches are like the rippling waters of a stream, and often leave no more on the memorywas speaking yesterday, he, in answer to an interjection, said, according to the re^ port in the Age of to-day ber must not quote from an article in a newspaper comments upon business before Parliament. say that when the honourable member for Herbert asked, by way of interjection, whom we could trust, there came from the eloquent lips of the honourable member for Ballarat, "" The people."" What objection, then, can the honourable member for Ballarat have to the referendum? Why should he object to the electors now being asked four being asked 128 separate questions in the case of the Constitution? Switzerland shows us that the rights of the States can be preserved by that most democratic of institutions to which I am referring. The twenty-two cantons and half-cantons have no fewer than twenty-five different Parliaments, and there the initiative and the referendum do not result in the destruction of the power of the canton. As a matter of fact, we have only to change the word "" State"" into "" Canton"" to produce similar conditions in Australia. In Switzerland, the laws are made through the referendum, because the people are dominant over the Parliament, the Cabinet, and the President. It is an axiom that the creators should be greater than the created, and we are the created of the people under the Constitution. The representatives of the Federal Convention were elected in all the States except in that benighted community, Western Australia, where they were nominated. That State had the audacity to send ten nominated members to that Convention, and their presence only made the Constitution more unworthy of Australia than it should be. But those ten to-day are in the limbo of oblivion, except one. there! now in the place where he is never happy. If the representatives at the Convention from Western Australia had been elected, the Constitution would have been a much better one than it is. In any case, the creators of this Parliament should have the right to alter or amend the Constitution. Article 118 of the Swiss Constitution provides that the Constitution ""may at any time be amended wholly or partially."" Every one will agree that any institution which has been tried by experience in any part of the civilized world, and found good, ought to be transplanted for our use and benefit; and I shall never be content, so long as I am permitted to represent the people, until there is a similar provision in our Constitution, together with the initiative and the referendum, so that the electors, in spite of all the lawyers and barristers, may have their own way.

The honourable member for Angas said that apparently some people wished to amend the Constitution before they understood it, but surely he, with his logical mind, must agree that it is easier for the people to understand four questions than it is for. them to understand 128. In connection with a referendum, the platform is always open to both sides, and I know of no fight that was more educational than that which took place when the Constitution was submitted to a referendum of the people. That is one instance of the educational power of the system, and I wish to see it repeated again and again. If a law is bad, let us amend it until we make it perfect; but we shall never do that if we listen to the advice of the legal members of this House. . An honourable member has spoken of the peril of the East. I trust that I shall not weary honourable members by my references to Switzerland, but I wish to quote an opinion ' expressed by one of the best military men of his day, who left England to undertake 'a position of great responsibility. I refer to Sir Francis Ottewell Adams, late Her Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Berne. In conjunction with Mr C. D. Cunningham, he wrote The Swiss Confederation. Switzerland, comprising people speaking four different languages, is buried in the breast of the Alps, and dominated by the latent, intelligence and brilliant genius of Germany and France. It has wrested territory from three of the strongest nations of its time-fro m Italy on the one side, from Burgundy, and even a small piece of territory from Germany. It is simply the justice of its laws and the justice of the dealings of the people with each other that keeps it together. English authority shows that the annual cost per annum for defence is as follows :-Great Britain, £ 6 4 ios. 4d. per man; Spain, ^56 2s. 4d.; Austria-Hung r y . £ 5 sJ France, £ 4 6 13s. 6d.; 2 I2 Germany, £ 4 6 ; Denmark, ^45 Italy, ,£43 18s.; Belgium, £ 4 0 ios.; Holland, , £ 3 1 ; Russia, ^22 16s.; and, last of all, Switzerland, £ 7 . He writesIt is a subject for reflection to us, a great and powerful nation, that a little country, not possessing a tenth part of our wealth, can put into and maintain effectively in the field between 150,000 and 200,000 men, a feat which we, in spite of our enormous budget, are incapable of achieving. This trusted officer of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria would not have made such a statement had he not known that it was true and could be proved. It would not hold to-day, however, because a great change has since come over Great Britain. Referring to the question of trusts, let me quote the following passage from page 263 of Gronlund's book-The Co-operative CommonwealthThe fact is, the State of Pennsylvania has had a narrow escape from an internal civil war. Had certain men given the word, there would have been an outbreak that contemplated the seizure of the railroads and running them, the capture and control of the United Pipe Lines property, and, in all probability, the burning of all the property of the Standard Oil Company in the region. The men who would have done this, and may do it yet, are not labourers or tramps. What .was the experience of Australia in regard to the Tobacco Combine? A Select Committee, over which Senator Pearce presided, was appointed to inquire into the tobacco industry, and a mass of interesting evidence was taken. The Tobacco Combine of the United States of America stepped across the Atlantic to fight the Tobacco Combine of England, which tried to meet it, but with what result? We are told that the British and American Tobacco Company of Great Britain controls itself. That is not so; it is owned Little and controlled by the American Combine, and there is only one way in which the millions of that mighty combine can be fought. Here is a quotation from The Uprising of thc ManyWhen the American Tobacco Company had beaten the American retail tobacco dealer into a proper pulp of humility and subservience it crossed to England, reorganized itself under a convenient alias, absorbed all the leading British manufacturers, and spread its genial influence through the British Isles, ruining tradesmen and crushing competition. Thence it extended its This high domain to outlying British possessions, and at last descended with its familiar tactics upon Australia. Two great Australian firms, one in Sydney, the other in Melbourne, united to resist the invader, and for purposes of stronger defence they formed a stock company.

After that the Australian tobacco market was at the Trust's mercy. To show the profits that are made in Australia in the tobacco industry, let me give some figures garnered by Mr G. A, Carter, cigar manufacturer, of Melbourne. They are these£ Profit on tobacco Profit on cigarettes Profit on cigars ... 2^03,687 The present revenue from tobacco of all kinds Net The American tobacco combine controls every tobacconist's shop in the United States of America, and in Great Britain, and determines what every smoker shall pay for his cigarettes, cigar, or pipe. tobacco. How can it be beaten? Only by legislative measures. VVe have not the dominant power of that monarch who is half-god and half-man-the Mikado. Japan has beaten this combine, and, notwithstanding its millions, sent it hurtling back to America. The Japanese statesmen saw that there was a profit in the tobacco industry, and offered to purchase at a fair price the business of the combine. The offer was laughed to scorn. Japan then imposed duties on tobacco, commencing with duties of 50 per cent. She also commenced to manufacture tobacco, and made another offer to the combine, which was again laughed at. 1905, she made her duties 100 per cent., and then 150 per cent. An article of the Japanese Constitution provides that all things required for a Government monopoly must be admitted duty free. American combine still continued to fight. In 1906, the duties were raised to 250 per cent. That meant that cigars worth j£io a thousand cost the combine .£35, plus landing charges and freight, to get into Japan; and, notwithstanding its wealth, it could not stand that. It went on its knees to beg the Japanese Government to buy its buildings and machinery, but the reply was, "" VVe do not want 7 them; you would not accept our fair offer."" Japan occupies only a small part of the earth's surface, and the combine thought that it still had the rest of the world to exploit. But now from the northeast of Asia right round to Bombay, it is being undersold by the Japanese. Similarly, when Australia gets the initiative and referendum, it will be able by its legislation to beat any combine. The time has gone by for small duties. Twenty years ago, I was in favour of raising duties up to the point of prohibition, believing that the community should make everything that can be made in Australia.

In Switzerland, 50,000 electors can insist on a law being passed, or on an alteration of tlie Constitution. They can insist that a measure shall be put before the community, and if the community votes ""Yes,"" Cabinet Ministers and Parliament must obey. I ask for that power for my fellow Australians.

241,Mr Palmer (Echuca) [9.1],"Som ein actual working, continual efforts have been made to overstep the constitutional powers that we possess, and I think it can be safely asserted that all those efforts have been avowedly in the interests of the Labour party, and avowedly for the purpose of bettering the condition of the working classes, who believe that under the Federal Constitution they will be able to get more advantages from this Parliament than they can hope to secure from the State Parliaments. That may be so, but whatever is done in the way of amending this Constitution means to a certain extent the undoing of the State Constitutions. This involves the important question, "" To what extent are we justified in legislating for the amendment of our Constitution in a way that will weaken and force upon the States amendments of their Constitutions detrimental to their individual working?"" It is unwise to amend the Constitution until all the powers which we possess have been exhausted. It is quite true that the High Court has ruled a good deal of the legislation which has passed through these Chamber to be ultra vires of the Constitution. That applies to the Arbitration Act and other measures, but it is more than possible that had we resorted in the first instance to the institution of the InterState Commission, and had practically the same legislation been brought into operation in all the States as a result of the recommendations, ancl through the instrumentality of that body, instead of adverse decisions being given by the High Court, probably the fact that those measures were in accordance with the determinations of the Inter-State Commission would have gone a long way towards establishing their validity. Had the proposals of the late Government been carried into effect, especially the proposal to invest the Inter-State Commission with all the powers with which we could invest it under the Constitution, I believe that body when in active operation could have done quite enough to satisfythe most ardent spirits on the other side of the chamber. another body with powers which had been denied to ourselves.? That was the suggestion of the late Government, and it was a fallacy. of the late Government, and if it had been carried into effect, the Inter-State Commisdoing during the Newcastle strike. sion, in pursuance of its constitutional powers, would have arrived at certain determinations which would have largely guided this Parliament in its subsequent legislation. more than we could. orable member.

They undoubtedly have the power now to secure a great' deal more than it was ever intended by the people, or by the founders of the Constitution, that they should enjoy. If these four propositions are carried, we shall have asserted the superiority of the Federation over the States to a marked degree.' Already we have determined upon a line of action regarding taxation which gives us a dominance in that direction, and when we have assumed practical control of the various industries of the States and of trade and commerce generally, there will be very little of a solid nature left for the Slates to legislate upon. Are we competent, sitting, as we shortly shall be, at the Federal Capital in Yass-Canberra, to legislate in regard to all the diverse industrial conditions and situations arising in this vast territory? I was in Adelaide last week, and saw something which I had never seen before. There, is in power in South Australia a Labour Government.

It will be far more difficult to enforce the righteous demands of people who stand up for freedom and individual rights. The honourable member for Flinders says that we should settle this question entirely regardless of existing political conditions, independently of who may sit on the Ministerial benches or who may sit on this side. not say that when he was on the Government side. say it now. is a matter of the utmost importance to consider what are the existing conditions. Every practical person considers, not only the virtue of an abstract proposition, but also the particular conditions which are operating at the time. legislation would never have been introduced had it not been that there is a Labour Government in power. We on this side are prepared to go a certain length in the amending of the Constitution; we admit that there are certain judicious methods that could be adopted, but we take up the position that it is not just to the States who gave us the right to sit here to practically undermine the Constitutions under which they are governed. are they not? legislation will so weaken the State Legislatures, and lower their status, that they will be ineffective to discharge the important functions which are very properly intrusted to them. We all acknowledge that the great Coolgardie water scheme does much credit to the honourable member for Swan; but had Australia been governed from a common centre, how long would it have taken the Western Austrnlian representatives to convince this Parliament that that work was practicable, and could be successfully carried out? When there is a unified Government, which is to be brought into existence by the adoption of the proposals before us, I venture to say that it will take quite as long to convince members representing other parts of Australia as to the advantages to be gained from certain large developmental enterprises in Victoria. Under such a system of government there will be the clashing of interests of one part against the interests of another, and, in my opinion, the proper development of this great continent will not be secured by such means. I am in agreement with the honourable member for Capricornia, who has given notice of motion for the division of Queensland into more than one State. I do not know whether the honourable member speaks only for himself, or for Queensland as a whole. Queensland! motion is only a prelude to other similar movements; and I venture to express the opinion that, when our population has increased tenfold, we shall have, not six I dissent from it, for it States, but probably as many as there are in America. As a matter of fact, there must be home rule so far as local affairs are concerned. councils. serve a useful purpose in Victoria whatever they may do in Queensland, and, while they ought not to be sneered at, the limits in which they operate are too ridiculously small for the exercise of the powers referred to. There are proposals which, under some circumstances, may be perfectly harmless, but, under other circumstances, extremely dangerous; and just now, when there is a wave of public opinion temporarily favouring those on the Government side, it is extremely dangerous to enlarge the powers of the Federal Government. Where is the urgency for this legislation?

257,Mr Palmer,"I do not think that,any demand for this legislation, which is essentially a step in the dark. We cannot foresee the far-reaching effect of the apparently small questions to be submitted to ""the people; but, in my opinion, they will result in upsetting the existing Constitutions, and whittling away to nothing the powers of the States. I may be out of order, but I cannot help suggesting that these proposals are made for purely political purposes, in order to satisfy the demands of a section of the community. The vast majority of the people in the ranks of labour are, I think, fairly well satisfied with the operations of the Wages Boards; and when such Boards have been instituted in all the States, as undoubtedly they soon will be, those immediately concerned will have very little to complain of. the Newcastle trouble. there are strikes all the world over, and, in spite of our industrial legislation, strikes occur here. creased wages, and, so long as the prices of commodities continue to rise, there seems to be some legitimate reason for the demand ; but, as a matter of fact, tlie prices of commodities are rising because the price of labour is rising; labour is die chief expense in production, and the cost of living must rise, thus reacting on the masses. So far as I can see, there is a desire to spend all we have* as a justification for taxing property out of its value. There is a disposition to tax the man who has been careful, thrifty, and industrious; and all for the benefit of others. gressing. The section of the Constitution under which an Inter-State Commission may be instituted reads as follows:There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such powers of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution it. relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereunder. By the exercise of this constitutional power we may secure for the various States uniformity of action and of conditions, and the necessary elasticity to enable them to carry on their functions in a very much better way than that proposed by the Bill. Eveni f the Bill becomes law, we shall still be faced with the difficulty that under the Federal Constitution we have to legislate for every State alike; although legis[i77] lation which may be perfectly justified in the case of Victoria may be wrong in the case of Western Australia, and vice versd. There is nothing that could equalize conditions better than a properly-constituted Inter-State Commission, vested with the necessary authority and power to make inquiries and analyze the conditions of labour in the various States, and, having done that, to advise Parliament in the framing of laws in the best interests of the development of each of the States, and thus promoting the happiness and prosperity of the people of the Commonwealth as a whole. one listening to the speeches of the honourable member for Ballarat and the honourable member for Bendigo would conclude that Parliament, in proposing to amend thp Constitution, .was about to cx>mrrdt some kind of sacrilege. They speak of the Constitution as if it were some sacred document; but what is the Constitution? There is a demand for inSimply an agreement prepared by representatives of the people, and afterwards adopted by ""the people, in order that a central authority may be enabled to govern the whole of Australia. It was never contended by the most enthusiastic Federalist that the Constitution was a perfect document; in fact, the representatives of the people at the Convention said so themselves, and we know that there was much opposition to many of the provisions. Every one who took the platform in favour of the Constitution recommended it to the people as a whole, but they all-includin g the honourable member for Ballarat, the honourable member for Bendigo, a number of others, and myself-emphasize d the fact that there was power in the Constitution to amend it from time to time. siderations that led the people to accept of the Melbourne sittings of the Convention, the Leader of the Convention, Mr no w Sir Edmund-Barton, said that there was ample power for the people to amend the Constitution whenever they thought fit to do so; whilst the honourable member for Ballarat used these wordsIn this Constitution, although much is written, much remains unwritten, and has to be supplied out of our experience of our own people and our working methods in political affairs.

We by a wise discretion, that we have insufficiently and inadequately dealt with the difficulties with which we are at present perplexed. It is enough that we have provided the means of enabling those to deal with them who will be far better qualified for that task than we are. Practically the same statement was made by Sir Edmund Barton. In view of the statements that have been made during this debate by certain honourable members of the Opposition, honourable members will probably be surprised to learn that during the sittings of the Convention they were not satisfied with the provision made in the Constitution for its amendment. The last amendment moved at the Melbourne sittings of the Convention"" was one by Mr no w stead of a Bill to amend the Constitution having to be passed in both Houses by an absolute majority, and then to be adopted by the people, it should be sent to the people, even if it had been rejected by one House, and that, if the people approved of it, then it should be passed into law. Amongst those who voted for that amendment were the honourable member for Ballarat, the honourable member for Bendigo. Sir George Reid, the late Sir Frederick Holder, and ten others. building did not fall on the honourable member for Bendigo when he was speaking today. now existing in the Constitution to enable it to be amended was not considered sufficiently democratic by some of the present members of the Opposition, who now tell us that we should keep our hands off this instrument of government, and say that it was never intended that it should be amended, except to meet some serious national emergency. stitution has already been altered on two occasions. At the third Federal parliamentary elections, the people were asked to agree to the first amendment proposed. And by whom? By a majority of the honourable members now sitting in opposition. The proposed amendment was a trivial one altering the date of the general election from the month of December to a period earlier in the year. That trifling arrangement was designed to convenience country residents in the southern part of Australia, and no consideration wan given to the conwere not told then that it was outrageous to suggest an amendment of the Constitution. At the last general election, again, the people were asked to amend it in two important particulars. Fortunately for the national life of Australia, only one of the amendments sought by the members of the present Opposition was made. then proposed meant giving to, not taking something from, the States. something of which the honourable member for Echuca has complained, l n the one case, the people were asked to agree to the Commonwealth having power to take over the debts of the States incurred, not only at the inception of, but since, Federation, and some of the States were not willing to fall in with that proposal. Another surprising feature of the position taken up by the honourable member for Ballarat is that not long ago he proposed an amendment of the Constitution to carry out one of the very propositions made in the Bill now before us. Indeed, he was the first to make such a proposition. We all know what happened. Quotations have been made during this debate from the memoranda that the honourable member for Ballarat, when in ofiice, issued in regard to the question of the new Protection. Honourable members will recollect that when the Tariff was under consideration he declared that, side by side with it, provision would be made for the new Protection. A great many votes were cast in favour of higher duties, some of them by Free Trade members of the Labour party, on the distinct understanding that a Bill to provide for the new Protection was to accompany the Tariff. In the records of the last Parliament will be found numerous questions put The Conto the honourable member for Ballarat, as Prime Minister, by honourable members in different parts of the House, inquiring what he intended to do in regard to that matter. I find that Sir George Reid asked whether, in considering the Tariff and the duties fixed from day to day, the House was to regard the system of new Protection as part of the understanding upon which the",69,Second Reading

To that, the honIn some industries the existing protection may orable member for Ballarat repliedThe Ministry put forward the matters referred to by the honourable member as a united proposal-the duties on the one side and the new Protection upon the other. As a Protectionist who helped to carry the last Tariff-as one of the party led by the honourable member for Ballarat at that time, and bound by the promise that he madeI feel absolutely ashamed that no attempt has been made to carry it out. The Labour party carried out their part of the bargain, but the then Administration did not carry out its part of the compact. The first memorandum relating to the new Protection was issued on 13th December, 1907, and it contained this statementThese proposals, to some extent, cover the ground .that is already occupied by legislation in some of the States. ercise of power by the Commonwealth, in matters in which Commonwealth and States have concurrent authority, must be subject to this condition.

An attempt had been made by the Parliament to introduce the new Protection by means of an Act providing for the imposition of certain Excise duties, and a case in which the validity of that Act was challenged was pending when this memorandum was issued. Subsequently, when the High Court declared the newProtection provisions of that measure to be ultra vires of the Constitution, another memorandum was issued by the last Liberal Government, headed by the honourable member for Ballarat. the Labour party. honourable member in office for the longest much period during which he has held office in facturers this Parliament. In this memorandum, Protection as outlined in the memorandum which issued on 28th October, 1908, the honorhas been laid upon the table of the House is able member for Ballarat pointed out that carried out? the result of the decision of the Court was that it would be necessary for the ConstituThe placing of that definite proposal betion to be amended The electors will be invited to empower the breath. At the close of 1908, after the Commonwealth to determine the employment Liberal Government had been defeated, and remuneration of labour in protected indusand the Labour party had come into office, tries in view of the protection granted to the manufacturer under the Commonwealth Tariff. the honourable member for Darling Downs enable the payment of fair and reasonable rates nf wages. In other industries not sufficiently protected to enable the f u l l standard of remuneration to be paid the payment of at least a minimum wage can be required, pending the enactment of effective protection. Unprotected industries will not be affected. Parliament will also be enabled to provide the necessary machinery for adjudication and administration, and in classes of cases in which Parliament thinks that the decision of the Commission ought to be subject to review, may establish an appellate tribunal, such as the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. In order to carry out these objects, it is proposed to insert new paragraphs in section 51 of the Constitution, so as to enable the Parliament to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to"" (xxxv.a) The employment and remuneration of labour in any industry which, in the opinion Every exof the Inter-State Commission, is protected by duties of Customs."" "" (xxxv.*) The grant to the Inter-State Commission and its members of such powers of regulation, adjudication, and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for giving effect lo any laws made in pursuance of the last preany, as the Parliament prescribes."" I invite the honourable member for Echuca to notice that this was a proposal to vest the Inter-State Commission with power. spoke to-night as if the creation of an Inter-State Commission would enable all the existing difficulties to be removed; but, as an honourable member on this side of the House interjected, this Parliament cannot clothe the Inter-State Commission with more power than it possesses itself. That being so, we must have an amendment of the Constitution before we can deal with these important questions. The harmless proposal made in the memorandum of 1907, and which I have already quoted, caused the honourable member for Echuca to ask the honourable member for Ballarat, who was then Prime MinisterHow far are we from Socialism, and how of private ownership will be left to manuand producers if the scheme of new fore the House seemed to take away his",70,Second Reading

For that we believe there is not a present demand. We feel that if we deal with the protected industries and justify its application to them it will intimately to the ascertainment of all the facts be time enough to consider the extension. The Opposition, on the other hand, in the matter of the new Protection appear to offer us nothing but to promise inquiry and persuasion to be exercised by the Commonwealth upon the States. Judging by the results of persuasion in the past in that direction the prospects were not extremely hopeful. The negotiations between the honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Ballarat failed at first, because the latter would not yield on this subject. I do not know what happened after the honourable members for Swan and Kooyong had dragged him in, but the result was that he agreed to the policy which he had condemned, namely, to wait until the States had been persuaded. The last Government proposed that the States should be asked to pass laws enabling certain matpromptly thrown out by the Legislative Commission Bill, but, though it had a majority in both Houses, and did not mind applying the "" gag,"" it did not pass it. feated in the Senate.

Ivmust now pass on to the great issue relating tb new Protection, and which relates very surrounding our industries. New Protection, as you know, means securing fair conditions to all those employed in industries which receive the care of the State, and I use the word "" care"" in a wider sense than "" Protection"" in the ordinary sense, because we propose that what is called the new Protection shall not be limited to protected industries. They have, perhaps, the first claim, but we propose to establish protection in all industries in Australia, whether subject to fiscal protection or not. The securing of fair hours, fair wages, and fair conditions of employment is now seen to be, as it has long been felt to be, a matter of grave national concern My hope is to see every industry in Australia with its Wages Board, and I want to see an arrangement to prevent industrial competition",71,Second Reading

If it is not, we shall laws for Australia as to wages and hours and then ask the people to give us that autliority direct. That meant that the States would be at liberty to play with the subject for three years, and that, in the ordinary course of things, there would not be a referendum until the next general election. I was sorry to hear the honourable member for Echuca talk as he did, in view of what was said .by the honourable member for Flinders. The honourable member for Indi was not fair in declaring that lawyers were interested in making our constitutional powers uncertain, and that their opinions are tainted with self-interest; because the strongest speecli in support of the Bill was made last night by the honourable member for Flinders, than whom no man has made more money out of constitutional cases. His speech derived its value and power from the fact that he spoke with experience of the wretched position in which the Constitution places our industries. He told me some months ago that he was tired of witnessing the expenditure of thousands of pounds, not merely by employers, but from funds contributed to with the Hardearned wages of employees. Two or three points have been won, but how many big cases have ended in nothing? What has resulted from the expenditure on the Timber case, or the Boot case, but friction and unrest, the parties being now where they were when they started? In the Boot case, the common rule, which it is to the interest of employers, as well as employees, to maintain, has been abolished. We cannot allow the law to remain as it is, and must either go back and wipe it off the statute book, or go forward. The right honourable member for Swan asked, when he was a broad Nationalist, "" I s it to be imagined that we shall say to the people' Take back the power that you gave us.' "" must ask the people to give us more power. The need for those powers was lishment of Federation, as was shown by the quotation by the honourable member for Wimmera of the motion moved by Mr Justice Higgins, and the speeches in support of it. It was the first motion placed on the business-paper in the name of a private member, and was discussed when the Constitution was only six months old. That, in the opinion of this House, it is expedient for the Parliament of the Commonwealth to acquire (if the State Parliaments see fit to grant it, under section 51, sub-section 37, of the Constitution Act) f u l l power to make conditions of labour. The motion was supported on both sides of ton, while Sir William McMillan, Dr. Salmon, Mr Sawers, and all other members who spoke, were strongly in favour of it. l t was carried unanimously, so that at the very earliest staije it was considered necessary and desirable that we should have these powers. This proposal is. theretore, nothing new. Some of those who supported tiie motion were pronounced Conservatives, and they, too. saw that our powers were not sufficient. We are told, ""You are going to kill the Federal system of government, and bring in Unification."" I agree with the honourable member for Flinders that there is no magic in the words "" Federation"" or "" Unification."" All we are concerned with is the question whether we are to have a complete and proper Constitution to govern the people. It is immaterial what it is called. We speak of South Africa as having a Federal Government, and we speak of the Canadian Federation, yet what'a difference there is between their Constitutions and ours ! If we had had sense we should have followed the Canadian Constitution. South Africa had the opportunity of following Australia and America, or Canada, and profited, as some of their speakers said on the platforms, by the experience of Australia. They avoided her blunders, and went in for a more pronounced National Parliament than even Canada has. Yet we. hear nothing of disaster going to happen to that great Federation, nor do we hear that any great disaster has happened to the Canadian Dominion by reason of its Constitution. Nor will it happen here. As has been said in this debate already, it is a singular thing that the people who We opposed Federation were, with a few ex ceptions, the Labour party, while the peoplt who supported it were the Conservatives.",72,Second Reading

The Labour party were of the same mind, and were afraid of it. Now that the Constitution has proved the most democratic in the world, as we Liberals who supported it were sure it would, we find the Labour party the strongest supprinciples to-day as I held when 1 sat porters of it, and the Conservatives have become the State Righters. I do hot think anything of the position of men Tike the honourable member for Ballarat and the honourable member for Darling Downs. The position and the speeches of the honourable member for Ballarat give me only a feeling of the deepest regret that a man who has led the national cause in Australia, with all his aspirations, and after all his will not deny it. That is the man that efforts, should now, in the latter days of his political career, be facing, every time he speaks, the spectre of the past. I think it is lamentable. him! orable member talk to me about deserting him. Who deserted him when he was on a sick bed? Who, when his Tariff was about to be introduced, and when his Budget had been prepared and determined upon, deserted him and would not stay a minute, but crossed over and sat in opposition to him? Sir member knows the reason. which has been insinuated, but I know the real reason. The right honourable member missed fire. The honourable member for Ballarat recovered, his Government did not go down, and instead of being the next Prime Minister the right honourable member for Swan had to sit in the cold shades of Opposition. That is what happened, ancl yet the right honourable member dares to talk to me about deserting the honourable member for Ballarat. 1 never deserted him. He deserted his party, yielding to the persuasive powers of men who did not consider him when he was on a sick bedin the persons of the right honourable memprepared by the Attorney-General in the ber for Swan and his quondam colleague, the honourable member for Kooyong. out? ber helped to turn him out. The Labour party could not have turned him out without that unholy exhibition that we saw oue afternoon, when the right honourable'member, and those with him, sat side by side on those benches with the Labour party to vote against him. Do not let the right honourable member talk to me about, disloyalty to my leader. I hold the same with him on these benches, and it is a matter of deep regret to me to think that he sits there in Opposition with men with whom he has nothing in common, who have no sympathy with him at all, but are prepared, if rumour in this building is right, to turn him out of the leadership before another session passes. The right honourable member for Swan knows it, ancl they accuse me of deserting. these painful memories? because one who was a great man has been led to his fall by men who were looking after their own advancement and not his. Now that he has failed them, now that he has ceased to be a name to conjure with, they are going to throw him aside by the time the next session comes. in that sort of thing. JOHN FORREST -The honourable ber knows it. I am not tied to the exact words of these measures, and reserve to myself the right to vote for any improvement of the words that may be submitted. I am prepared, however, to support the proposals of the Government to give us these additional powers. I am with the honourable member for Flinders, who said that he is prepared to give the Federal Parliament the whole of the trade and commerce powers unfettered. Another singular thing comes to my mind with regard to corporations. This was admitted to be a matter that required amendment, even by the Fusion Government, and the lack of power on the part of this Parliament was discovered owing to one of the measures previous Deakin.

There is no doubt, also, that the industrial powers asked for are necessary. I come next to the power to deal with combinations and monopolies. There can be no doubt that, whatever words are used, we must be given full power in that direction also. No person has spoken more strongly in favour of our having those powers than the honourable member for Flinders, although he criticised the words used. I think a great deal of that honourable member's speech must have fallen like a block of ice on the members of the Opposition who were listening to it. He was followed this morning by the honourable member for Wimmera, who also supported the proposed amendment of the Constitution, as the result of practical inquiry in connection with the Harvester Commission through the various States. When brought into contact with the employees in different places he saw how impossible it was to work under the present system. On one side, therefore, we have those two honourable members speaking from practical expeiience, and on the other we have the honourable member for Bendigo simply lauding what might be called his own infant. If we are going to be a progressive nation, the National Government must be endowed with all the powers that are necessary for national growth. I commend to the members of the Opposition who are of the other way of thinking, the words of the honourable member for Flinders, that, "" after all, we can trust the people."" If we abuse the powers which the people give us, the people will very soon turn us out. We are told that we are taking powers from the States, but, after all, the States and the Commonwealth are one people. We cannot get these amendments without the consent of the majority of people, and the consent of the people in a majority of the States, and if they are willing to give them to us, vvho has any right to say that we are taking them from the States? The people have the right to take powers away from one of their agents, and hand them over to the other. strong feeling growing throughout Australia in favour of increasing the powers of the National Parliament. the names of honourable members who have expressed in conversation with me opinions regarding the greater powers that must be paralyze honourable members. The feeling is growing that we have gone so far that we must go further. In this, as in every other matter, we have to rely upon the people. When the honourable member for Ballarat was before the public advocating the adoption of the Federal Constitution, he said that the whole essence of the Constitution was in the words, "" Trust the people."" He says the same to-day, and I say with him that you can trust the people. If the people do not want us to have these powers, they will not give them 3 to us. If they want us to have them, they will trust, not us as individuals, but this Parliament as an institution, with them. They know that it is a democratic Parliament. They know that they have absolute control of both Houses, free from"" all special qualifications, and that if we do not do as they want us to do they can very soon send us about our business. There is nothing to be feared from the passing of these amendments, and I am satisfied, not only that both Houses will pass them, but that the people as a whole will, by a large majority, see that this Parliament has all the necessary powers to give effect to their wishes. The two Bills that we have before us widen the scope of the Constitution in five very important matters. The powers asked for deal with trade and commerce, corporations, industrial matters, combinations, and, in another Bill, the nationalization of industries if the Commonwealth Parliament considers it-an advantage. Any alteration of the Constitution should receive the most careful consideration, and should be given effect to only in order to remedy evils that exist, and are felt by the whole of Australia. I regard the Constitution as a deed of partnership entered into by the various States when we federated, arid only to be altered to meet any difficulties that may present themselves, l t should be held as sacred as the marriage tie. I commend to the careful consideration of the Government the suggestion of the honourable member for Ballarat. No doubt the Government have power to put There is undoubtedly a these Bills through. I am sure, however, that both Ministers and their party are anxious to do in the right way what they I could mention deem to be right, and the suggestion to divide the questions to be submitted to the people is worth the serious consideration of a Democratic party such as",74,Second Reading

We may, I think, trust the people to give an intelligent vote on each of the questions. referendum was taken, the people exercised the privilege most intelligently, and though I do not profess to be satisfied with the decision, I bow to it as one which was given in an unmistakable way. Under cover ofpower in industrial matters, and to assist employees, the Government propose to acquire complete control of the trade ancl commerce of Australia; but I am not quite sure that it is wise to go so far in that direction a» the Bills indicate. ""Trade and commerce"" covers a wide field, and involves many difficulties, and I am afraid we are launching this Parliament into a whirlpool of trouble little anticipated by the authors of this measure. The Attorney-General, in his able speech, did not show us the object of the proposed extension of power; it appears to have been covered up, but the effect is quite plain to any observant mind. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -I desire to call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.] the older and more closely-settled States will dominate the States which are struggling to develop their resources. It means centralization, or, as already pointed out, the unitary form of government. what ? government and power, and also the centralization of population. ment centralized? istration is very much centralized even in the Postal Department. tralized ? bearing the High Court has on the matter Under the heading of "" trade and commerce "" this Government is seeking power to regulate hotels, shops, markets, and so forth. the thickly-populated States will have a majority of representatives in this Parliament. national feeling and national sentiments. I regret to say that 1 have noticed a distinct parochialism animating most honourable members; and that will extend as control is centralized. In regard to corporations, the Government are seeking power When the last to make laws to supersede the Companies Act in its application to companies, limited and unlimited, in the various States. The Federal Act will override the present State laws. ' that now. an extension of power? My contention is that we already have sufficient power under the Constitution to remedy present evils, and I am not one to meet troubles half way. I can see in this measure a danger to the co-operative movement amongst producers. There are indications already that the producers' interests are not so well conserved as they might be by the Labour party. It has been suggested, for instance, that tliere should be export duties on wheat, wool, hides, leather, and so forth, and a hope has been expressed by some of the Labour party that an export duty will be placed on butter. peatedly. clined to disbelieve my eyes, but I have a very fair liearing; and when members of the Labour party advocate an export duty on any article I believe them to be in earnest. the Labour party referred to. suggested by several members.of the Labour party.

However, perhaps the Minister of Trade and Customs will not deny that a deputation waited on him to urge export duties on hides, butter, and wheat. the Employers Federation waited on me to ask for an export duty on hides. bike the assurance of honourable members on the Ministerial side that nothing in that direction has been attempted; and I hope that the producers will receive the same consideration that other workers receive when they combine or unite for their own protection. On many occasions, when producers have tried to get the benefit of their labours,' there has been a howl that they are imposing on the consumers. At present the States have power to deal with industrial matters, and none are more qualigovern trade and commerce, and like fied than the local governing bodies. We have to deal with things as we find them, and in most of the States there are Wages Boards, Arbitration Courts, and other institutions for the settlement of disputes. I know there is a feeling at present against find ourselves in serious difficulty. I do not the State Courts and in favour of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court; but conditions change, and, perthese matters, but we have examples of the haps, in the near future that feeling may be incompetence of States to run businesses in reversed, and the State Courts may be regarded as more effectual in the settlement of industrial disputes. That will be done more speedily by men on the spot familiar with local conditions. As to combinations, 1 may say that I have always been opposed to the operation of injurious combines. The utmost freedom should be given to every Britisher, and there is nothing more galling to me than to be compelled by a combine to do my business through any particular channel. I know that injurious combines do exist in Australia, and need only refer the House to my own experience in tliis connection. In 1902, when the drought in Queensland was being severely felt, we were able to buy oaten hay in Victoria at ^ 4 per ton, whereas the price in Queensland was .£14 per ton. As the manager of a co-operative company in that [-78] State, I tried to obtain fodder for our starving stock, but found that it was utterly impossible to get hay carried from Victoria to Queensland. It was left on the wharfs here, but other people, who probably had some interest in the shipping combination, were able to have their produce taken up north. That is a kind of monopoly that I would do my utmost to crush. Every large corporation, however, is not necessarily injurious, and it is wise to discriminate between injurious and beneficent Combines. I fail to sec that we have not power under the Constitution as it is to cope with injurious combinations. Perhaps we cannot deal with them as some honourable members would like to do, but if we can destroy their pernicious influence, and give relief to those who suffer from their operations, we ought to be satisfied. The fifth extension of power 'asked for is indicated in the second Bill, which we are permitted to discuss at this 'stage. Under this Bill the Commonwealth is empowered to nationalize industries. I do not hesitate to say that I have very little faith in State-owned undertakings. I believe that we should make laws' to matters, and to control them to a certain extent, but when we begin as a Commonwealth to experiment in the management and conduct of large enterprises, we shall tread on very dangerous ground, and soon know whether honourable members opposite are prepared to be guided by experience in a successful manner for the people, and I shall, for the reasons I have stated, have no hesitation in opposing both these measures.

It is reported that the present hotel is not well managed, and that it is desirable to bave better accommodation provided. Reports are being obtained from the police and other authorities as to the manner in which such State hotels as we have had in Australia have been conducted, and are at present progressing.
