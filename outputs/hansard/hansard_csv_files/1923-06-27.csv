WA T T ) .,"Having made that clear, I want to say that this is the first occasion upon which -action has been taken under certain legislation passed by this Parliament in 1920. call the fact that we on this side opposed that legislation. ""We pointed out in our opinion every individual against whom a charge was made should have the right of t r i a l by jury . Parliament also passed an A ct dealing, with passports. this side opposed that measure, too. recollect that the Ministeri n charge of it ( Mr Poynton) assured the House that it was necessary in order to facilitate the travelling of persons who might go abroad from Australia. We objected that the legislation proposed was a relic of the war period, and claimed that as we had got back to normal conditions the people should not be passport legislation submitted. ever, the House passed the measure referred to. tioned in my intimation to Mr Speaker, .who are to be deported from Australia, came here furnished with British passports, not with passports issued by the authorities of another country. passports were endorsed by the Australian authorities, and they were allowed to land. They held meetings in Victoria, but no action affecting them was taken. They then went to 'New South Wales, and held meetings there. A certain section of the community objected to their speeches, and criticised the action of the Commonwealth Government in permitting these gentlemen to land in Australia. They claimed that they should be deported. As a result of that criticism, the New' South Wales Government took action against these gentlemen for sedition under a law under which the Commonwealth Government might have taken action had they so desired before the State Government intervened. The law under which the New South Wales Government acted assure to these gentlemen trial by a jury . the State Government had taken action the Commonwealth instituted proceedings against them under the following provision of the Immigration Act 1920 8A. Where the Minister is satisfied that, answer the adjourned, charge of sedition, within three years after the arrival in Ausand tlie police magistrate, before whom tralia of a person who was not born in Australia, that person(a) .has been convicted in Australia of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer;.

We feared that when some burning question was exciting popular feeling men might be appointed to these Boards who were biased; possibly unconsciously. the bias of the Board appointed in this case as the records of its members show. aware that they are biased. In a community like this such a pernicious procedure should not be permitted. In this particular case a Board was appointed by the Commonwealth Government, and the envoys were summoned to appear before it in order to show cause why they should not be deported. Their counsel appealed to the H i g h Court to declare that the ""provision of the Immigration Act under which the Board had been appointed was unconstitutional. However, the Court held that the Act was valid. Meanwhile 1 the hearing of tbe charge of sedition levelled by. 'the State' Government was stopped. The Immigration In -' A fte r quiry Board resumed its sittings after the decision of the H i g h Court had been given, and recommended that these two gentlemen be deported., The next step in the chain of events was the appearance of the envoys in the State Court to",13,Adjournment Formal Proposed Deportation Or Irish Envoys

I should say that there was justification for that criticism. ber is referring to the action for sedition, that was a State affair. proceedings were delayed by the action taken by the Commonwealth Government. the Minister's denial. Senator Gardiner and Mr Dunn, I waited on Mr Bavin, the State Attorney-General, and he told us that the State Government were not responsible for the'delay, but that the faul t lay with the Commonwealth Government for having taken proceedings under the Immigration Act after initiated' a prosecution for sedition. He said that obviously the State could not proceed with its prosecution when the Commonwealth stepped in . if , under the charge of sedition, the envoys would have the right to t r i a l by a jury , and he replied that there was no question of the accused losing the right to a trial by a j u r y under the charge the State had laid against these gentlemen, and, further, that the proceedings had been initiated under a Commonwealth Act. If .the State Government could proceed under a Commonwealth Act, which gave the accused the right to a trial by a jury , how was it that the Commonwealth did not proceed in the same way? was it that they allowed these gentlemen to address meetings in Victoria and also in New South Wales, and that they took action only after the State Government had done so? I hope that there w ill be no effort to make it appear that honourable members on this side, are holding a brief for the persons concerned. I do not know these gentlemen. I have never met them. I a.m no more concerned with them than I would be with any other person ordered to he deported by a Board appointed under the Immigration Act. When section 8A was discussed in this House we pointed out the clanger that might be incurred by persons expressing their opinion of the existing system of governCommonwealth authorities ment in Australia. W it h in three years after his arrival in this country a' man who may have been a good citizen for over two years may happen to say .something during industrial trouble which If the honourable meni -\ may be held to be' in contravention of this section of the Act, and a Board may be appointed to deport him. No one can tell where this sort of thing w ill end, and for that reason we cannot allow these two gentlemen to be deported without raising our voice in protest. If we do not do so we shall be regarded as giving tacit consent to the action of the Government. right to challenge a similar action in the future. position. Whatever may have happened during the war, when every one was in a state of excitement, we are not justified in perpetuating the procedure of that the State Government had period. If the Government think they are justified in putting into operation a measure of this kind in the circumstances I have outlined, what may not happen to I asked our liberty of speech or to the right to trial by a jury? I am ventilating this' matter solely because I am anxious that nothing, should be done .to abolish liberty of speech or t r i a l by j u r y . H a d the Government taken a course of action which would have allowed the ""envoys to be tried by a jury , no one could have found fault. But that was not done. As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth Government intervened, and so delayed the State proceedings that the police magistrate who was dealing with How the case felt called upon to comment on the Commonwealth's action. To me the action taken by the Commonwealth is beyond understanding. Ministers would have looked very foolish if these men had been acquitted. They had to stop other proceedings in order to save their own faces. something in that view of the matter. It seems to me that the Commonwealth Government must have taken f r i g h t when a certain agitation commenced in New South Wales. Probably they thought that the proceedings instituted by the State Government were, in a way, a reflection upon themselves, and, of course,",14,Adjournment Formal Proposed Deportation Or Irish Envoys

13,Mr Charlton,"The r e may beas 1ihe/State (Government had already (preferred .a charge of sedition against the envoys 'under a Commonwealth Statute, they were obliged to lodk for eomeiother means of taking action, and accordingly commenced proceedings under the Immigration Act. I would like to hear fhe : Attorney-General explain -why the Commonwealth did this when the gentlemen in Question [were already answering a charge of sedition, which would have ""to be decided by a jury, and not by a Board appointed by the 'Government. I-do not know 'the members of the Board, and I make no reflection upon their personal ,probity when I say that it is possible for men to be unconsciously biased by public clamour in connection with a proposed -deportation.. Therefore, .the community having again -settled down to peace conditions, we should rever,t -to our pre-war procedure, which gave 'every man the right to trial by a (jury of his fellow countrymen. That right is the bulwark of British justice. We have upheld it for hundreds of years as a pattern to be followed »by 'Other nations in framing their judd'ciall systems. Yet in this enlightened age, after 'trial 'by jury has been in operation for hundreds of years, and has proved to be -an -effective safeguard of the liberties of the individual, and the safety of the community, the Government are attempting 'to deny it to two persons who have arrived in the Commonwealth. Do not forget that they arrived as British subjects, with British passports. Honourable members opposite talk a lot .about .the Empire, and the necessity for iEinpire solidarity, and for meting out even-handed justice ;to every man who is protected by the British -flag. In this instance, .that .principle has been lost to sight; the usual method .of administering British justice has been set aside. Not only every Britisher^ but every person of .any .nationality who comes -to Australia, ^s <erititled :to trial by -jury. The men who are about to be deported arrived with a passport which w,as equivalent ,to a icertificate by the British iGovernment of the exemplary character of fhe bearers. No other view can be taken of ,a passport issued by British .officials. They have no right to issue passports to undesirables, and it may be assumed that tfhey would not do so. These Irish .enxioys iwere hall-marked as reput[14] able 'oitizens >of 'the Empire; yet the <.Commoirwea'lth proposes :to depout ithem without 'according them <trial by jury, i m mediately after -the New :South Wales. magistrate had expressed 'his disgust 'with the action .of 'the'©ommonwealth Law Department in 'delaying ' ito take action against these .men; immediately after ""he had declined to further .remand 'ithem on the sedition charge brought .by the State Government, and had released them, they were -re-arrested. Probably ,they will be deported in 4he near future, but it is not ^yet too late Jor the Commonwealth Government to retrace their steps, and have these anen .tried .by a .jury, a procedure to which they, like everybody else in this country, -are entitled. Mr .GROOM (Darling Downs-Attor ney-^General,) '[3.24]. --The Leader of the Opposition has based his .case mainly upon the contention that (these Irish envoys are entitled-to trial :by. jury -I;ask the House to consider .first .of .all the law under which the ""Commonwealth ,are' acting, and the purpose of .that ^law. I remind honourable .members that the Immigration Act of 1920 was not -a .war-time imeasure.; it was passed after the excitement of the -w.ar had -died down. It .was a law deliberately made .by .this Parliament for the purpose of regulating -the admission of immigrants .to Australia, and excluding undesirables. That Act increased the. inumber of persons who' were deemed ' to .be prohibited immigrantSj and therefore not eligible to land in Australia, and .'included, amongst othersAny person who advocates the .overthrow 'by force or violence of the established Government of the Commonwealth or of any State or of any other civilized country, or of all forms of law, or who advocates the abolition >of organized government, <or .who .advocates .the assassination of public officials, or who -advocates or teaches the unlawful destruction of property, or who is a member o'for affiliated w.ith any organisation which entertains and .teaches any .of the doctrines and practices specified in this paragraph. The deliberate decision of the House was ( that such persons should be prohibited from entering-the Commonwealth. Immigration laws must, by their very nature, be administered promptly, and, usually, at the time 'when.'the person applies for entrance into the Commonwealth. This prohibition stands at the T!ery portals :of the Commonwealth. The Leader of the Opposition, in-effect, suggests that trial .by j u r y should be conceded to every person who conies under the definition of a prohibited immigrant. Do honourable members conceive that it would be possible to administer an Immigration Actf o r , inter alia, the exclusion of undesirables, if every person who knocked at the door and asked for admission had to be tried by a j u r y before his application could be refused^? basis of the Act is administration by the executive authority, which is entitled, by the law itself, to exclude prohibited i m migrants if they are known to be such at the time of their arrival. This Parliament deliberately adopted that law as the settled and determined policy of the country, and I submit that it was right in so doing.. A person who advocates the overthrow of any established Government in the King's Dominions is by the law of the land a prohibited immigrant. It is obvious that in the' specification of undesirable immigrants,, it is the character of tlie individuals which is aimed at. It is not always possible to discover at tlie moment.of an immigrant's arrival in the Commonwealth whether he is or is not disqualified on the grounds set out in the paragraph I have quoted. realizing the possibility of undesirables evading the law, and thereby getting a footing an. the Commonwealth before their characters are discovered, wisely enacted that if within a period of three years after aai -immigrant's arrival he proves himself or is found to be within the category of prohibited i m migrants he can .be deported. order that he should not be treated unf a i r l y , a clause was inserted providing that the Minister could not deport a man charged w i th being a prohibited i m m i grant u n t i l he had appointed a Board to adjudicate on the case, and the person charged had failed to appear before such Board and show cause, or the Board had recommended that he should be deported. In this case those conditions were f u l filled. Charlton) said that it is an unheard of . proceeding to have a law administered in this way; he said that it is a violation of the right to trial by jury . May I remind the honourable member exactly what that right is? It is conceded to a man who has committed an offence against the laws of the country in which he resides. having committed an offence. member's correction. This is not such a case. not always the right to t r i a l by jury . T h a t is not the point. methods of procedure in regard to even the more serious charges of breaches ' I am showing that the against the law of the land. We did not charge these persons with having committed an offence rendering them liable to be deprived of their property, or to suffer imprisonment for a term, or any extreme penalty. them with the commission of an offence, but you intervened and stopped those proceedings. did not stop the proceedings. I am dealing with the law under which we took action. I say that that law considers only the question whether a person is a desirable or an undesirable immigrant. If he is thought to be an undesirable immigrant, it is a matter for the Executive Authority to determine that fact, and deport him from Parliament, Australia. This law is not unknown to British communities or to countries in heriting British traditions. Canada passed an Immigration law in 1910. That was well before the outbreak of the war, so that it cannot be contended that that law was the result of war conditions. It provides that whenever any person other than a Canadian citizen, But in within three years of landing, has been convicted of a criminal offence in Canada, or enters or remains in Canada contrary to the Act, he shall be reported by the Immigration Officer to the Minister. Section 41 providesWhenever any person other than a Canadian citizen advocates in Canada the overthrow, by force or violence, of the Government of Great Britain or Canada, or other British Dominions, or the overthrow, by force or violence, of constituted law and authority, or the assassination of public officials, or The honourable member ( Mr shall by word or act create a riot or public disorder in Canada, or shall by common repute belong to or be suspected of belonging to any secret society which extorts money from or in any way attempts to control any resident of Canada' by force or threat of bodily harm, or by blackmail; such person shall be classed as an undesirable immigrant, and notice thereof be given to the Minister.",15,Adjournment Formal Proposed Deportation Or Irish Envoys

21,Mr Groom,"The CommonwealthSection 42 provides that the . Minister may order any person alleged to be a prohibited or undesirable immigrant to be detained, and may order a Board of Inquiry to investigate the complaint. If the Board is satisfied that the person is a prohibited or undesirable immigrant he may be deported forthwith, subject to an appeal to the Minister. The Board of Inquiry consists of three or more immigration officers, of whom the Immigration Officer in charge must be one. There is a further provision which reads as follows: Where any person has, within three years of landing, become an inmate of a gaol, the Minister for the Interior may issue a warrant ligation to take whatever action they felt authorizing him to be detained with a view to his deportation. Canada is a British community corresponding to our own which, prior to the war, acted in exactly the same way as we acted in 1920. Nobody can say that the Dominion of Canada is less British than Australia in its institutions and -in its care for the liberty of the subject. Executive provision relating to deportation may be found in the Undesirable Immigrants Exclusion Act of New Zealand. Under that Act, the Attorney General of New Zealand may order any person to leave the Commonwealth if that person is disaffected, disloyal, or liable to be a source of danger to the peace, order and good government of New Zealand. Act also has provisions dealing with exclusion. The United States of America has a law exactly similar to the Australian Act, and in it provision is made, in addition, for the examination of immigrants by a Special Board of In quiry consisting of three immigration officers. Honourable members will see, therefore, that there is nothing novel in our law; it is similar to laws which have been passed by other British communities and by the United States of America. These laws are not deemed by those countries to be a violation of the liberty of the subject. our Act was perfectly justified. Act is brought into force by the Minister on the advice of a Board, in order that action may be taken promptly to exclude from Australia persons found here who are deemed to be undesirable. There is no necessity to discuss the proCourt has its own particular functions, ceedings that took place before the Board. A copy of the Board's finding has been laid upon the table of this House. The Board found that these men had advocated the overthrow by' force and violence of the established Government of a civilized country, to wit, the Irish Free State. Exception is taken to our intervention. The responsibility is thrown upon the Department of Home and Territories to administer this Act. The New South Wales Government, on its own initiative, took action under the Crimes Act, and charged these persons with sedition. The action of the State Government did not remove from the Commonwealth the obwa3 necessary for the removal from Australia of undesirable immigrants. decent to wait for the verdict of the ' State Court. object of our Act is to exclude undesirable persons from Australia. Immediately the Commonwealth Government are in a position to do ithis, it is their duty to take action. >So soon as we were in possession of evidence which showed that these men were undesirable under the provisions of the law, we deeme.d it to be our duty to take action. Action was taken independently of the State. The men were charged before The South African a perfectly impartial Board. Immediately -that Board was constituted, objection was taken to its constitutional authority. The constitutional issues were carried to the High Court of Australia. The attitude of the Commonwealth all through has been not to take any technical advantage, but to have the constitutional issue and the merits of the case decided according to law. The High Court of Australia affirmed the constitutional validity of the Act which we passed in 1920.

A charge of sedition-, if proved, would not necessarily relieve the Government of theobligation to take action under the law which I have quoted against persons known to be undesirable immigrants. The Leader of the Opposition took the stand that because these men had been supplied wdiUhi passports"" by the. British Government, no action should haw© been taken against, themhere. Thepassports gave them authority to move within, the British Empire, but containedthe conditions that they were issued subject to the immigration regulations, of allparts of the Empire. ' Therefore, there was nothing to prevent the Government from pnoceeding in accordance with the Commonwealth immigration-, law. all. passports. for the purpose, of preserving the. rightsof* theDominions.

We do not want in) the Commonwealth men, who do not believe in constituted authority' and who-, are prepared to go to any extreme to overthrow all forms of government. case. it is; but the facts pitove conclusively that these men did come to Australia to advocate the overthrow of a society established by law in the Irish Pree. State. In the circumstances, the duty is upon the Government toadminister the law andto see that its provisions are carried) out: The speech made by the: Attorney General( Mr Groom.) is the essence of futility, and I amsatisfied that if the> ^Extension of time granted.'] numbers dividing the parties in thisHousewere closer the motion submitted 1 by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) would be carried this afternoon. The Attorney-General has not said anything to justify the action of the Government with regard to the gentlemen concerned. It is one of the most mysterious and sinister happenings in the Commonwealth during the past eight years, including' the wajr years, when heaven only knows-, we had enough hys<teria and' jingoism to satisfy everybody. more of it. that we should continue to act in this extraordinary way.. These gentlemen came to Australia to delivera message tev the people of Australia. I ' am not concerned' in any way with their message. It would be presumption, on my part,, to attempt todogmatize on the Irish questionwhen the Irish people themselves are so much divided over it. WhatI amconcerned about is that this Government, should out-jingo the jingoes of Britain in their determination to keep this an. utterly loyal country. The Irish envoys were quite well-known in Great Britain, buttfh'eygpt their passports for Australia without the slightest trouble. Members of the British Government,, whatever their faults may be, are not, as a rul'e,, as* hysterical' as this* Government.. They recognised!,, no doubt, that the position of. affairsin Ireland' could not be altered!, and so passports were? issued fo these men, who' came to Australia. glad to get' rid' of them. speeches' containing gross reflections on the British Parliament, and they were in Australia for a month orsix weeks before' any action was taken. I am not concerned at all with the nature, of their views, but I protest that persons who come here on passports issued by the British Government, should not be liable to be incarcerated, or' deported as undesirables. If this course cam. be upheld, it is quite possible that in due time, when some of my colleagues: from the British Labour, party come to Australia,",18,Adjournment Formal Proposed Deportation Or Irish Envoys

36,Mr Blakeley,"They made,the Commonwealth Government may deport them in the same manner. On the other side of the House there are honourable members who have committed enough sedition to justify their deportation a dozen times over, and I am: certain that, on this side, there is not one member who has not made seditious speeches. I defy any man to fight effectively on behalf of the working classes without being guilty of seditious utterances. The absurd Act ""under which the Irish envoys are to 'be deported was mot, as the Minister has said, passed in time of war, tions Act was being repealed, and it was thought necessary to keep the jingoistic spirit in existence, so as to be ready for those who might come to this country, and by their speeches, attempt to disrupt the great British Empire. Section 8A of the Immigration Act of 1920 reads(1) Where the. Minister is satisfied, that, within three years after the arrival in Australia of a person who was not born in Australia, that person[a) has been convicted in Australia of a criminal offence punishable for imand incited by certain organizations in prisonment for one y§ar or longerThesegentlemen have not been convicted of a criminal offence(6) isliving on the prostitution of othersThey are not in that category(c) has become an inmate of an insane asylum or public charitable institution. They cannot be punished under that paragraph. But so t h a t no one might come to Australia who the Government think might undermine the might of the British Empire, this all-embracing provision was passed(d) If a person who advocates tbe overSouth Wales Government to the Comthrow by force, or violence of the established Government of the Commonwealth oi of any State, . . . he may by notice in writing, summon the person to appear before a Board within the time and in the manner prescribed, to show cause why he should not be deported from the Commonwealth.. That isfoolish and ridiculous enough, Heaven only knows, but the section, goes further. It does not refer only to the Governments of the Commonwealth, New Zealand, Canada, or Great Britain-that iswide enough, but apDao-ently the Government think it too circumscribed-bu t it. covers iiny person who preaches the overthrow of any Government. The Commonwealth Government says, ""We are the protectors of a l i e n a tions, and if any personadvocates the overthrow of a capitalistic Government in, say, Japan, this Government under this law can deport such a person."" into trouble if we did not act. member, no 'doubt, would act if he had the opportunity. If there were an insurrection in China, for instance,, and a delebub because the War Precaugation representing the workers of China came to Australia to lay their case before the people in the Commonwealth, he could under this law be deported. The whole Act is characteristic of those hysterical people who have been governingthe Commonwealth during the past six years. The accused persons, who have made twenty or t h i r t y speeches in Australia, have not caused a greater ripple in public opinion than would be caused by a pebble thrown into the sea at St. K i l d a ; but Governments aided, abetted this community have been led to believe that not only the British Empire and her Dominions, but the wholeof the civilized world is endangered. These organiza' tions-, have, therefore, used their force and influence to compel the Government to take action.

Of these, 92,306 bonds of the value of £0,505,482, were owned by ex-members of the Forces and by relatives and. dependants, whilst 33,281 bonds ""of the value of £7,060,522, stand behind the Bank and guarantee were owned by banks, life assurance companies, employers, traders, and others, who cashed the bonds for the original owners 2. £906,514. 3.

To these questions I have replied that the Government were giving the matter consideration. A f t e r the very fullest investigation of the position, the Government have decided to participate again this year in the financial arrangements connected with the forthcoming wheat harvest. The assistance w ill be by way of guarantee through the Commonwealth Banki n the manner employed last year. The basis of the guarantee will be the same also as that of last year, namely, -3s. per bushel at the siding and 8d. per bushel to cover freight and handling charges. The Government have given a great deal of consideration to this question, because they are certain that it is not in the best interests of the primary producers, or indeed of any class in this country, that they should look to the Government for financial assistance in the marketing and handling of their products But, bearing in mind the adverse climatic conditions to which many parts of Australia, and particularly New South Wales, have been subjected for some considerable time past, we have fel t that we should give those engaged in the wheat industry a further opportunity to make arrangements for the handling and marketing of their harvest without governmental assistance. For that reason, we propose to continue the wheat guarantee for another year, but in doing so we wish to make it very clear to those engaged in this industry that we are giving them an opportunity to make their own arrangements, and we hope that before the next harvest they w ill have put their industry on a basis -which w ill enable that to be done.

99,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper,"TreaI t is pleasing to hear from the new Treasurer that he anticipates bringing down his Budget by the end of July. I hope that his expectation will be fulfilled , as it is absolutely necessary that -we should have that Budget before us as early as possible, in view of the declaration of the Government that this House shall rise early in August. It is obvious that, if we are to give f u l l consideration to the Budget, we must have some time in which to discuss it . There should be an interval of at least one week, after the statement has been made by the Treasurer, before wo are called upon to deal with it . That will bring us to within a week or a fortnight of the closing of this House. I am at a loss to understand how we shall be able, in a couple of weeks, to deal intelligently with the Budget and the Estimates, quite apart from other legislation. we set this afternoon, we shall do it . the honourable member, if he refers to the speed at which Bills were introduced. If the Government xise the closure to put through those measures in an ill-digested form, theirs will be the responsibility; we on this side will not worry, because our consciences will be clear when we have to answer to the people for our actions. I wish to draw the attention of the Treasurer to the loan which was issued recently for the purpose of giving depositors the right to convert £38,700,000. W ill the Treasurer make a statement in forming lis of the amount which has been converted ? D r . EABLEPAGE I hope to be in a position to make a statement this week. the whole amount will not be »converted. The Treasurer must anticipate a similar reception for other such loans. During good investment, why is it not over the war, very many people invested in subscribed ? the loans, because they thought it was their duty to assist their country at such sume, many people who, during the war, a time. Many of them could ill afford to thought it their duty, from patriotic do it . pulsion, too. contribution was compulsory, because wealthy people who, in addition to getpersons were told by their employers that ting a high rate of interest for another they had to take up a certain amount. Assistance was rendered them to enable them to do so. That class of depositor ft requires his or her money, and conversion will not take place in such cases, so that a considerable sum will have to be raised in some other manner. My objection to the loan is that it is not short-dated. I cannot understand why the honourable gentleman and his Government decided upon a period of twenty-five years; I be. lieve, too, without the option of paying it off earlier. They made ifc'a long-dated loan in face of the fact that the interest rate is falling in every part of the world ; and if we are to be guided by expert opinion, it is likely to fall considerably within the next two or three years. I believe that the honourable gentleman himself is credited in some papers with having made the statement that in three years the interest rate will be about 4-J per cent. If we maintain the speed Another statement, which he was credited with having niade, is that in about seven I quite agree with years the rate will be 4 per cent. How, then, can the Government justify the issuing of this loan at 5 per ceut. free of State income tax, and carrying a bonus of £ 1 for every £ 1 0 0 converted ? It does not bear out their contention that they are exercising the strictest economy. It is evident that this country is going to be made pay considerably more than it should. If it were possible to convert the whole of the £38,700,000, by giving a bonus of £ 1 for every £ 1 0 0 we would lose about £387,000. A little while back I read that New Zealand had converted, in England, a loan amounting to some millions, at 4 per cent. Surely, then, the ' Commonwealth can convert at a cheaper rate than 5 per cent. ! Not only has the rcte of interest for the conversion' loan been fixed at 5 per cent., but it is to be free of income tax as well, and this willmean, probably, an additional £ per cent, to the It is evident that, investor. motives, to invest in loans, cannot afford other twenty-fiveyears.

Mi-. CHARLTON -There. is nothing to prevent holders from selling on the open market; but my point is that if the rate of interest is likely to fall in the near interest, and. in that way save a confuture we have no right to offer such anattractive investment for such a . long period. It is claimed by stock exchange authorities that if the rate of interest drops to 4-^ per cent, this conversion loan stock will sell for £107, and that if it drops to 4 per cent, the stock will command £115 in the open market, so it will bo possible for "" jobbers"" to make considerable sums of money out of these transactions. Interest rates have fallen i:i Great Britain and America already, and it is being urged in respect of this conversion loan that investors would be well advised to convert, because, in the near future, interest rates Avill be lower than at present. I submit, that, in view of the probabilities, the terms are not wise, and that we should use every endeavour to get our money as cheaply as possible. vestors have availed themselves of the terms for conversion ? Mr ""WEST -U p to the present only £21,000,000 has been taken up; over £11,000,000 has not been converted. can say what amount has been converted. We shall not know until the Treasurer has made his statement. If money is likely to be cheaper within the next six or seven years, those investors who convert their stock will be on a very good wicket indeed. The terms are not in the best interests of the Commonwealth. During the war no loans were issued for a period extending beyond ten years. Why have the Government, at this late hour, and when interest rates are likely to fall, issued such a long-dated loan? should we be asked to pay away £387,000 of the Commonwealth money to induce people to convert their holding in a war loan ? .. We cannot afford to pay away large sums of money in this way simply because our revenue is buoyant. Every one knows that it is not likely to bo buoyant in the future, because our principal source of income is the Customs duties, and it is the business of this Parliament to see that exorbitant revenue is not derived from that source. There is no justification whatever for this long-dated loan. It should have been short dated, so that we could take advantage of any favorable trend in market rates of siderable amount of money. We are paying interest on about £416,000,000, so we should be as careful as possible to get the capital sums as cheaply as possible. Another matter to which I desire to refer is the action taken by Mr Deputy President Webb in the Arbitration Court recently. I am reluctant to mention it, but I believe it is only right that I should do so especially as I have been appealed to by very many trade unionists on the subject. It will be remembered that in January last an award was given in connection with an action taken by the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners against the Victorian Government, Anthony, and others. The essential principle of arbitration is that the parties to it shall observe the award, otherwise they will be in contempt. That is the position in which the Victorian Government stands in connection with the award I mention, but, notwithstanding this, Mr Deputy President Webb permitted them; to approach the Court. In this way there was unfair discrimination, because recently the Australian Workers Union, which failedto give effect to an award, were not permitted to be heard, and certain officers of the union were fined heavily. It is not fair for the Judge in one case to Order! The honourable member must not reflect upon a Judge of the Arbitration Court. Chairman, that I am not reflecting on the Why Judge personally.

But, if I may be permitted to say so, I think it is very unfair to discriminate between parties to an award. I do not want to say anything ' that can be regarded as a personal reflection upon a Judge. President Webb may be a very able man,' but I protest that, especially in view of the attitude of the Court towards the Australian Workers Union, when State instrumentalities are involved and when the ""State Government as one of the parties to an award are defying the Court, they should not be permitted to approach it in respect of any phase of the award. -could quote exactly what took place, but I do not think it necessary to do so, and I do not wish to occupy the time of the Committee action by any Court cannot be permitted without reference being made to it.

He may be able to explain -what guided him, in coming to his decision in a way which may be quite satisfactory; but on the facts available, it is necessary that the position should be ventilated here. In briefly referring to the question of immigration, I wish to quote statements which have -appeared in the press during Ihe last day or two. I hope that honourable members will not think that I am advocating immigration while there are -so many unemployed in Australia. I am not -doing 'anything of the kind. Buti f the Government intend to adhere to their policy of bringing large numbers of migrants to Australia, no exception should be made in regard to people residing in any part of the British Empire. Ma-. Edgar, M.L.C., of Victoria, has, during a visit to Great Britain, found that the position is very unsatisfactory. A newspaper report statesDuring his stay in Belfast, he had several interviews with members of the Northern Government with reference to the refusal of the Commonwealth to accept Irish migrants. Tlie Ministry supplied him with copies of the -correspondence, from which it appeared that Ulster Jiad represented 'to the Colonial Office that the 3irish .were being rejected. The Colonial Office replied that, under the Overseas Settlement Act, tbe .Irish were equally eligible with the British. Interviews followed with Sir William Windham and Mr J. T. Barnes, Commonwealth Migration Officer, who stated that the Coinmoniwealbh had .definitely instructed him to refuse Irish applicants owing to the disturbed conditions in Ireland. Ulster had' represented that Northern Ireland was .completely quiet and normal, and that, .unlike Mr Deputy Southern Ireland, Ulster remained a part -of the United Kingdom. The deputation next interviewed Mr M. L. Shepherd, official secretary at Australia House, who -undertook to cable to the Commonwealth Government, but there was no reply owing to the uncertainties of the Australian political situation. Finally, Mr Barnes informed the Ulster Government that no conclusive action could be taken until Mr Percy Hunter's arrival. I It is reported later in the same paragraph that the migration authorities have agreed to withdraw the circular hitherto in use, which stated that they were reunduly. Discriminating cruiting persons only from Great Britain. There is a clear statement that persons grants; but the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) denies this .most emphatically in these -wordsThere is absolutely no truth in the statement that we are refusing Irish migrants. I .thought that we -were collecting migrants in the British Isles. There haa been no discrimination, nothing of the sort having ever .been thought of. I shall certainly inquire into the statements contained in the cable message. The Prime Minister's statement was published in the Argus -of yesterday, but in the Melbourne Herald of the same day the report of an .interview with Mr Edgar, M.L/C., iconcludes with this paragraphMr M. L.

As the Labour party has definitely embraced the Red objective, and while there remains the possibility of the workers being misled by the promise of a heaven upon earth, I think minor differences of opinion on this side of the House might easily be set aside in the endeavour to open the eyes of the electors to the true position. The proposal to abolish dual income taxation has been given much prominence in the newspapers of the different States. Personally, I have yet to be convinced that the proposals of the Government w ill result in the reduction of taxation. Representatives of the States appear to be under the impression that with the loss of the per capita payments, and the interest on transferred properties, in creased taxation will be necessary. PosThe Opposition will not sibly the Treasurer may be able to tell the House why no mention has been made of certain loans which were issued free There will be the Budget to of taxation so f a r as the States were concerned. Many investors are very anxious to learn whether the contract made w i th them w ill be kept, or whether the Commonwealth w ill make some arrangement with the States. I hope that on this and other important matters Supporters of more information w ill be made available when the particular proposals are brought before the House. Like many other honourable members, I have received a number of letters from the employees of the Taxation Department. They suggest that some scheme of compensation similar to that arranged for the employees of the Defence Department should be applied to them. It is quite apparent that not more than one-third of the present employees of the Department will be taken over by the States, and, undoubtedly, many cases of hardship will result. This is one of the problems which the Government must take into consideration. Probably the most important problem with which the Government has to deal at the present moment is that of immigration. This question has been debated A useful profrom many platforms, and in every Parliament, for many years past. We are all familiar with the arguments. We are told that Australia abounds in empty spaces, arfd that there are 1,000,000,000 coloured people near us crying out for In my opinion, there is no elbow room. It is a fact that u n t i l recently the immigration policy of Australia consisted in collecting the city workers of London, dumping them down in the capital cities of Australia, and leaving them to shift for themselves. dergone much change. think that some improvement has been made; but I hold that, in the future, the Government must make better arrangements in Australia than they have made hitherto.

126,' Mr Mackay,"I am inclined tosolve the important problem of defence. I would rather spend' money in schemes of water conservation and land settlement than in the purchase of guns and the building of warships, which so soon become obsolete. It ought to be clear to all thinking people that we should aim at getting 20,000,000 people in this country before talking seriously of spending money on guns and ships for the purpose of defending long reaches of coastline, which at the present time have not a single inhabitant. Can we claim that our soldier land settlement has been successful ? painfully true that we have had a large number of very exj>ensive failures. Everybody will admit that the successful farmer can only be reared on the land, not J n the city. men to become successful farmers who, before the war, were working in factories, behind counters, or in offices. Those who are being brought from overseas will bo handicapped to an even greater extent. From the experience gained in connection with soldier land settlement, we should endeavour to establish training farms, and expect every applicant for land to put in a period of training on one of them, so that his suitability can bo determined before we supply him with money or laud. Wo must improve our methods of farming. The general opinion is that the dairying industry has been successful, but the average yield per dairy cow in Australia is less than it is in New Zealand, and about half of that in Denmark. Our frui t industry is very indifferently carried on. Tho London cables recently notified the sale of 45,000 cases of tinned f r u it , and the rejection, of a similar number of cases because of inferior grading and packing. ' These matters require very careful investigation, so thab increased land settlement will not result in huge disappointment and very heavy financial loss. If the policy to promote production is to be successful, the industrial unions of Australia must assist in the scheme to bring migrants here to take part in the development of our secondary industries. Whilo the Labour party refuse to assist this branch of national development, it will be difficult to formulate a successful scheme. I congratulate ter ( Mr Bruce) for his promptitude in Government will continue the existing emofficially visiting each of the States, and bargo on black-grown sugar for a period of I hope he will f u l f i l his promise to visit the coastal districts of Northern Queensland. He can then form an estimate of the possibilities of successful development of those splendid tracts of agricultural land. If it were possible for the people of the southern States to visit the sugar' districts of Queensland, the growers there would not need to ask a second time for effective protection for their industry. The visitors would see for themselves what sugar production has done for both the State of Queensland and the Commonwealth."" Wheni n Queensland, the Prime Minister made the statement It is that the Government would not discriminate between town and country or State and State. If the Prime Minister maintains that attitude, and is bold enough to brave the criticism of the southern States, It is too much to expect he will give to the sugar industry the measure of protection to which it is justly entitled. the honourable member to the proposals of the Government? Government concerning the sugar industry are not worthy of a moment's consideration. The continuance of the existing embargo on black-grown sugar for a f u r ther period of two years is, at most, but an insurance to the Government against the loss of £280,000. Speaking in the Brisbane Exhibition H a l l recently, on the sugar question, the Prime Minister saidIn formulating its plans the Commonwealth Government have been faced with two important circumstances', which unavoidably dominated the situation: First, that there will be in Australia at the end of 30th June, 57,500 tons of Government sugar; second, that sugar alone of our primary industries has no outside market whereby this surplus could be sold by virtue of the fact that all com-, peting sugar is produced by black labour, which is paid wages far below the standard prevailing in Australia. This dilemma can be escaped by the Commonwealth Government selling its surplus abroad, but that course would involve a loss of probably £0 or £7 per ton on 49,000 tons (the excess carry-over), equivalent to from £240,000 to £280,000. A fte r stating that the surplus was a direct result of the greatly-increased acreage and production brought about by the sugar agreement, the Prime Minister addedthe Prime MinisUnder, the circumstances the Commonwealth",37,Introduction Of The Taxation Office The Provision I N Stock From Newzealand Cludes Considerable Arrears Which W I L L Be

Critics in the southern States pretend to encourage the industry when sugar prices outside Australia are high, but the industry needs a duty that will give the growers sufficient protection -when prices -abroad are low, because when prices are high the growers can take care of fthemselyes.

Owing to interferences in the past, the -mill proprietors have felt unableto make extensive alterations or add to their plant, because they have been quite at a loss to know what to expect in the course of twelve or eighteen months. The 'sugar crop takes at least eighteen months to mature, and the suggested embargo of two years is practically of no use to the industry. It is quite possible that the growers, realizing that they have little option in $ie matter, will accept the Government's proposal.

They pointed out that, they were as strongly opposed to the Nationalists as were the Labour candidates, and that, if elected, they would be an independent group, prepared to fight for the interests of the men on the land. Owing to those representations numerous electors throughout Australia were cajoled into casting their votes in favour of the nominees of the so-called Country party.

Mr Forde. A vate banking institutions were well able to carry on the banking business of the country. Personally, I believe that the scope of the Commonwealth Bank should be widened so as to provide for a rural were credit system. The Australian farmers have very good security to offer in their productive lands, and a scheme is required to enable them to procure capital on reasonable terms so that they may not, in a period of depression, be harassed as they are to-day by the many exacting private banking institutions. A rural credit system on the lines of similar systems in America amd Canada would perform a very useful function in this country. We have every right to expect the Government, which includes in its ranks men who call themselves Country party members, to bring such a scheme to f r u i tion. .Rural credits in. America and Canada have altogether changed the very life of those countries; they have created prosperity where previously there was adversity, keeping at bay the usurer and speculator, and enabling the genuine farmers to obtain loans on the best possible We find that certain terms.

I do not know whether that was meant to convey that the Country party stood for some rural organization for the men on the land. In Queensland the Labour Government has established such a scheme, and it is doing great work. that scheme is only in its infancy, it it farmers generally, and help them to help themselves. country members in this composite M in istry they have done nothing whatever towards launching a rural organization scheme for the whole of Australia, or to assist the Statesi n a work of the kind. Yet the effect of the promises made on the eve of the elections was that this would be done. One of our greatest problems is how to secure a large and virile population, and its solution, I believe, is to be found largely in the development of agriculture. wealth springs fro m the land, and if we are to settle people in the remote parts of Australia we must be prepared to assist them, in the initial stages. It was found in Queensland, and, indeed, all over Australia,"" that there were party political organizations exploiting the men on the land. trolled by men who could not secure selection, as candidates under the Liberal or Nationalist banner, and who saw an opportunity to get into Parliament by forming primary producers' organizations, and in working up some of the farmers into a frenzy against the Labour party and the existing Tory party. For a time in Queensland these men did exploit certain sections of the farmers by such Tory organizations, but their weakness was found in the fact that Labour farmers, and also certain Conservative farmers, were against them. Then the Labour Government in Queensland in troduced a rural organization scheme on sections every producer in the country. The scheme is a great u p l if t to the men on the land. It is recognised that it will encourage co-operation, and teach the farmer the great power he can wield by organizing on industrial lines. Primary producers inQueensland to-day realize that arising from the fluctuation of markets, and keep down the charges which accumulate between the cow and the counter, between the field and the factory, and between the orchard and the dinner tabic. This is what the Labour party is aiming at in the northern State to-day. A unified Although organization of farmers is the first important step towards the establishment of a is confidently anticipated that rural credit system, and that is why will improve the status of Labour supports such a scheme. An organization of the kind could be called Although there are the Australian Producers Association. The Queensland organization is called the Queensland Producers Association. In brief, the scheme I propose for the whole of Australia provides for the establishment of a branch of the Australian Producers Association in each State by-(1 ) tlie formation of local producers' associations in local centres and consisting of not fewer than fifteen primary producers; (2) the constitution of district councils by It is recognised that all the' election of representatives from local producers' associations; (3) the constitution of a Council of Agriculture by the election of representatives from district councils. The association is to be open to every person engaged in the occupation of dairy farmer, wheat, maize, or cereal grower, sugar grower, cotton These organizations were congrower, f r u it grower, grazing farmer, and general and mixed farmer. These embrace practically all the men engaged in primary production. The objects of the association should be the development of rural industries, the in vestigation of and dealing with problems relating to rural industries, the advising of agriculturists with regard to matters which require scientific knowledge, research work, the securing of effective action for the controlling of diseases and pests, the question of markets, and improved means of transport and other matters appertaining to the welfare of the man on the land. I recognise that these schemes should, if possible, be taken up non-party lines, embracing all by the various State Governments, but of political thought and the Commonwealth Government could work in co-operation assist .them. I would be prepared placing upon the Estimates of money to enable the Government to assist such a scheme to the extent of one-half the cost during the initial stages.

154,Mr Forde,"Themany instances cane inspectors passed through the districts offering 10s. or 12s. a ton, or very little more, for the cane, and tlie growers had to take these prices or allow their cane to rot in the fields. When the Labour party came into power in Queensland it passed the Cane Prices Act Amendment Bill through the Queensland Parliament, under the provisions of which the growers and millers were represented on a Cane Prices Board, whose duty it was to see that there was paid to the grower a reasonable price which would enable him to pay a decent wage to his employees. However, recognising that even this was not sufficient, the Labour Government of Queensland took steps to bring about what is known as the first sugar sought the endorsement of the Commonwealth Government, led by Mr Andrew Fisher. That first agreement, thus brought into existence by the Federal Government, acting iu conjunction with the Queensland Labour Government, fixed the price of sugar at £18 a ton-an increase of £3 4s. per ton-but, 191S, the growers were successful in having the agreement renewed with the price fixed at £21 a ton. creased cost of production, and everything else during the next two years necessitated a corresponding increase in the price of sugar, and the growers were successful in getting the price set out in the 1920 agreement increased to £30 6s. 8d. a ton, due largely to the action of the Labour party iu Queensland. industry a great fillip. It enabled the growers who, through bad seasons, had got behind, to recoup themselves to some extent. increase in the value of the crop which, last year, was £9,000,000 as compared with £1,500,000 in 1915, before Labour intervened on behalf of the growers. There are 25,000 people employed annually in sugar operations. It is one of the greatest means of giving employment In Australia. From the southern States at least 4,000 workers proceed to Queensland each year to, obtain 'employment during the cutting season. The amount of capital invested is £16,000,000. [Extension of time granted.] Machinery valued at hundreds of thousands of pounds is supplied by the southern States' Mr Forde. to Queensland for operations connected with the sugar industry. Towns such as Bundaberg, Childers, Gin Gin, Mackay, Cairns, and many others depend almost solely on this industry. It is the bulwark of the White Australia policy. It would not be possible to populate the great north of Australia without it ; indeed, it would be necessary for the Commonwealth to maintain a standing army there for the purpose of keeping out the black races. It has enabled the north to be settled. For example, the number of electorsin the Herbert division has increased by about 13,000 within the last eleven years. Without the sugar-growing industry we could not induce many people to leave fhe southern parts of Ausagreement, and successfully tralia and settle in those districts where cane can be grown successfully by Australians. The sugar cane-growers are thus blazing the track for Australian settlement. For many years the pioneering work was done with little return. If given the opportunity, this industry will do a great deal more for Australia thanin it has already done. I hope that supplies of raw sugar will However, the inbe made available for the Millaquin Commachinery, pany at Bundaberg, which employs a large number of men. I regret to say that this refinery, through not getting a reasonable supply of raw sugar, has recently had to dismiss fifty or sixty hands. The Nationalist and Country party members have tricked the sugar farmers. The increase gave the The sugar cane-grbwers were led to believe, that if they voted for Nationalist and Country party candidates at the last election the Commonwealth Government. It caused a steady would see that the sugar agreement was renewed, or, failing this, that there would be an embargo on the importation of black-grpwn sugar. The ex-Prime Minister( Mr W. M . Hughes) toured Queensland, and usedthe sugar industry as a. great electioneering "" stunt."" He was feted and entertained everywhere. Complimentary speeches were made in regard to him, but he was dexterous enough in his utterances to do everything but definitely promise the growers what they desired. He left them .hoping while he was hesitating. He said that the industry was ot great importance to Australia, and he would see that it received a fair deal. When the elections were held all the Nationalist candidates throughout Queensland made definite promises to the sugar growers. I quote the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford) as an illustration. MrW . B . Biggs, of Proserpine, writing to the Brisbane Telegraph, saidIn view, of the assertion that fit was doubtto get them to do their duty by the ful if Queensland favoured a continuation of the sugar agreement, and taking into consideration the result of the Queensland elections, I wish to 'make it quite clear that the Nationalist candidates of Queensland all pledged themselves to a continuance. of the agreement. „ . . The fallowing questions were put to Mr Bamford at his election t meeting at Proserpine hy me: Q. Are you in favour of the continuance of the sugar agreement? five years. Q. In tlie event of your party, as a party, refusing to vote for same, will you cross the floov and vote against them? when I aim returned, I will pledge myself .to make it my business, at the first opportunity, to bring the extension of the agreement before the House, as fit will give me the opportunity to .put the acid on tlie Country' and Labour parties, and prove their sincerity to the sugarWhat has happened ? growers, It will be admitted that, the honourable member for Herbert having made that definite promise, the growers have* a right to expect that it will be honoured. But equally definite promises were made by other honourable members opposite. I turn now to the attitude of my own leader. The Brisbane Daily Mai l of 28th October, 1922, reported Mr Charlton's speech at Maryborough as having included the following statement: Mr Charlton said the Labour party had used every endeavour to have a renewal of the agreement. A protective Tariff was inadequate, and if returned to power the Labour party would immediately take steps to bring about a sugar agreement. The same journal reported the honourable gard to the Tariff. They did not know where member for ""Wide Bay( Mr Corser) as they were to-day in connection with the dishaving said at Namboiir on 28th Novemposal of their surplus .produce. ber, 1922If the Nationalist Government is returned to of motion, which will be dealt with at the power further sugar proposals will be subnext meeting of the branch:"" That this mitted, and I feel confident that the existing branch views with concern tlie Prime' Minissugar agreement will ,be renewed, probably in ter's intention to prorogue Parliament during a Islighitly modified form, Ibut nevertheless his absence abroad. We consider the hoi dingsatisfactory to the industry as a whole. Mr up of publicbusiness in this way to be unHughes os most anxious that something should necessary and unwarranted, especially in view be done to maintain tlie sugar industry, which of the fact that in the formation of the comwas mainly responsible for the carrying on posite Government Mr Bruce mentioned that of the White Australia policy, and sugarthe country was to have an equal say and growers can rest assured that their interestswill .be adequately preserved by the Nationalist Government, I do not know what attitude the honourable member adopts now, but if he is loyal to the sugar interests of Queensland he must be disgusted with the policy of the present Government. He has failed industry. . I am waiting to see if honourable members opposite will force their Government to adopt a policy thab was definitely promised to the sugar-growers. The Bundaberg Daily News of 16th November, 1922, thus reports a question asked of the Leader of the Country party and Treasurer in the present composite Ministry (Dr. Earle Page)If your party are returned in sufficient numbers to constitute a controlling factor in the next Federal Government, will you insist on the retention of the control of the industry by the Federal Government as at present enacted, until such time as a system is evolved that will assure to the cane-grower a fair and reasonable return for the labour and capital he has invested. Dr. Earle Page immediately returned an emphatic Yes. Having' ' managed "" himself into a composite Ministry, the honourable member has forgotten all about the sugar-growers, and it is no wonder that the farmers are losing confidence in him as is evidenced by the disgust expressed recently at Bendigo by men who have the interests of the farmers at heart. The Age o i 22nd June, 1923, contains the following paragraphs in its report of the meeting of the Bendigo Branch of the Farmers UnionMr P. S. Penrose said he felt that the indecision in the composite Government would lead to the eventual destruction of the party. He. did not favour the secrecy that accompanied the formation of the composite party. He did not think the farmers could hope for any relief from.the composite Ministry in reMr Penrose submitted the following notice",44,Introduction Of The Taxation Office The Provision I N Stock From Newzealand Cludes Considerable Arrears Which W I L L Be

Was there any business in that 1 No, decidedly not. Apparently, those statements were made merely for electioneering purposes, and the candidates who made them had no intention of carrying them into effect. Apparently, the National Federation, which is financed by great corporations like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, had brought honourable members opposite to heel, because, just after Mr Hughes made a tour of Queensland he was confronted with this resolution from the National FederationThat at the end of the present term, in June next, the sugar agreement be discontinued. The influential members of that Federation represent Flinders-lane and the big business interests of Australia. They have not at heart the interests of the struggling farmers. There .is nothing in common between them. They subscribe money to the funds of the National Federation, which financed the Nationalist candidates during the last election. the next election Nationalists Country party candidates w ill most likely go before the electors as one party, and all will draw their financial sustenance from the National Federation. Naturally, if the Federation pays the piper it will also call the tune. The Prime Minister is a Victorian; his -name is Stanley Melbourne Bruce; he is Melbourne in sympathies as well as in name. I believe the former Prime Minister( MrW . M . Hughes) was more sympathetic to the sugar industry than is the gentleman who has succeeded him. A conference of growers discussed the position January, lowing proposals to the Government. sugar agreement be renewed, and, as an Mr Forde. alternative, the following:A Commonfor five years. The second resolution was only a machinery one, by which the sugar would be acquired, and also, made proCertainly the sugar-growers vision to include New South Wales sugar Both Nationalist and Country in the Pool. Resolutions 3 and 4 directly affected the Commonwealth, and read as follows:While the Pool is in operation, the Commonwealth Government to prohibit the importation of black-grown sugar except so much as is required from time to time as determined by the Pool to make good any Australian shortage; this embargo to be applied subject to conditions stated in clause 4 relating to price to be charged to the consumers. Resolution No. 4'readDuring the currency of the Pool IA refined sugar to be sold at such a price as will insure that the retail price of refined sugar to the consumer shall not exceed 4jd. per lb. in capital cities. The growers asked for a continuance of the embargo on black-grown sugar for a period of five years, and guaranteed to supply consumers with sugar at 4 | d . per lb., a reduction of l j d . on the price which had ruled since 1920. A deputation was sent all the way from Queensland to wait on the Prime Ministeri n Melbourne. A t first he said that no good purpose could be served by receiving them, but eventually he did so. The first request .was for a renewal of the agreement, which they had a right to expect, but it was turned down. The honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) said to-night that he personally was in favour of a renewal At of the sugar agreement, but the honorand able member and other Nationalist members had an opportunity in the last Parliament, when the Nationalist Government had a majority of only one over the combined numbers of the opposing parties, to force the Government to renew the sugar agreement. In failing to take action then the honourable member for Lilley, and every other Nationalist member from Queensland, betrayed the trust that had been reposed in them by their constituents. The fact must be borne in mind that there are in the present Cabinet two Queenslanders, in the persons of the Attorney-General( Mr Groom) and of the sugar industry in Senator Crawford, and it is, therefore, 1922, and submitted the folno wonder that the honourable member for Commonwealth Lilley says that it would be interesting Firstly, that the existing to know whether those Ministers endorsed the action of the Cabinet in rejecting the requests of the sugar-growers. they had been true to the trust reposed in them by the people of Queensland, the sugar agreement would have been renewed, or, failing that, the alternative proposals adopted. In reply to the second proposal submitted by the deputation, the Prime Minister promised to give consideration to the matter. Three months have elapsed, and that delay has caused stagnation in the industry. There was a feeling of uncertainty; the growers did not know what to expect for their sugar, and one result has been that the establishment of the Tully Eiver mill has been hindered. Settlement has been retarded. The foundry at Bundaberg has put off thirty men, because there was uncertainty as to what woTk would he offering; the mills were not renewing their machinery, and the outlook for the foundry was dull. Prime Minister went to Queensland and mad* certain proposals, but by that time sugar in Java and Cuba had risen to £28 10s. and £30 per ton respectively. There was a shortage in the world's production of, approximately, 300,000 tons, due partly to the failure of the beet crop in Europe and partly fo speculation in the worid's markets. ' The world's supplies had decreased, and the world's parity had correspondingly increased. posals put before the sugar industry by the Prime Minister in Brisbane, no doubt after the city organ had pealed forth for an hour,' were for the continuation of the agreement for two years only(a) The industry to form a Pool free from the control of the Commonwealth Government, and to buy raw sugar for the 1923-24 season at not more than £27 per ton of 94 net titre f.o.b. mill. If Australia had to depend on the world's -market it would have to pay from £37 to £40 per ton for sugar, for if you add to the prices of £28 10s. and £30 per ton in Java and Cuba respectively the import duty of £9 6s. 8d. per ton, you have the landed cost in Australia, exclusive of freight and handling, charges. Therefore, the proposal submitted by the Prime Minister was not fair, and was put forward in the interests, not of the sugar growers, but of those people who dictated the policy of the Government. It was an offer of £27 for one year, when sugar brought from abroad would cost Australia If from £37 to £40 per ton. The Prime Minister further proposed,(b) The Pool to provide sugar for the purpose of manufactured goods for export' at a price equal .to the current' world's parity. The sugar-growers have always been pre1 pared to do that. (c) The price for raw sugar for the 1924-25 season to be determined after investigation by a tribunal, and to be based upon the cost of efficient production in reasonably good districts and under normal conditions; such price not to exceed £27 per ton. (d) The tribunal to have regard in ascertaining the cost of production to excessive wages (if any) paid in the sugar industry as compared with other primary industries. Let us examine the Prime Minister's offer to the sugar-growers. Raw sugar was £30 per ton in Cuba, equal to £39 6s. 8d. in Australia, exclusive of freight and Early in June the handling charges. And the Prime Minister offered the Queensland growers £27 per ton for their product! Generosity; forsooth! Colonial Sugar Refining Company. absolutely unfair. His offer to give the growers £27 for one year, and to then apThe propoint a tribunal to fix the price for subsequent years, with a maximum of £27 per ton, was a ""heads I win, tails you -lose"" proposition. The attitude of the sugar-growers has been most fair and reasonable, and naturally they are very dissatisfied with the treatment they have received. As an alternative to the Prime Minister's scheme, they asked for £27 net at the mills for raw sugar, an agreement for two years instead of one, as offered by the Prime Minister, the embargo upon the importation of black-grown sugar to continue for three years instead of two years, and the appointment of a tribunal to determine the price for the third year. The representatives of the sugar-growers -consider that their request is reasonable in view of the fact that world's parity is greatly in excess of £30 6s. Sd. per ton, which price will obtain until the end of the present month. The opinion that the Commonwealth Government have not treated the sugar industry fairly is not the opinion of only those engaged in the industry.

The Government's proposals are for two years., but that is not enough. If, at the end of that period, the industry is again to ibe the sport of chance, or worse, of politics, .which may be defined from the sugar-grower""s viewpoint as-chance, with the dice loaded against the industry, then it .is certain that the prospects of the sugar districts will immediately be affected, and that expansion will definitely be checked. The inadequacy of the Government's proposals will best be appreciated by ooniipa-ring them with the reasonable demand of the industry. The Brisbane 'Telegraph, another Nationalist paper, said in a leading articleI t may bo said at once that the Federal Government's sugar policy, which was enunciated in Brisbane last aright* by the Prime Minister, is deeply .disappointing. It does not give in any considerable measure that security whicli the sugar industry demands, and which it must receive, if it is to survive and play its part, not only in supplying the present needs of the Australian sugar market, but also in developing the waste spaces of Australia. The Brisbane Courier, whicli is one of the greatest supporters of Nationalism in Queensland, said on 6th June, 1923I t would too futile to suggest that tlie sugar typical of scores of communications that policy as outlined last night by Mr Bruce will I . have received fro m sugar-growers and give that measure of protection to the growers people who are interested in the sugar, in that the great national industry warrants. . . , The scheme cannot be regarded as satdustry during the last five weeks:isfactory by the people of Queensland. . . .

In England to-day the people are paying 8Jdl per l b . for their sugar. I have received the following telegram from MrJ . Clayton, president of the ChildersM ill Cane-growers' Association : My association urgently requests you urge Parliament to agree embargo on foreign sugar for four years at least. That request is a fair one, and I support it . In January, the period asked for was five years: the growers are prepared to modify that claim now to some extent, but they desire that they should have accorded to them a measure of support, which the Federal Government have not given them. It is no wonder that the Primary Producers' organization at Mackay on 13th June passed the following resolution: That we cannot reconcile the Federal Government's adhesion to the policy of a White Australia with the proposal to acquire our sugar, grown under Australian conditions as to labour and tools, at a price lower than tbe landed cost of black-grown sugar. We, the white settlers of Queensland, must look on it as an attempt to force on us black conditions of life. You, Mr Chairman, know the conditions existing in the sugar industry; you know that the industry has not been treated properly.

Retail Selling Price Therefore, it will be seen that I have not said something that I could not prove. Sugar should never have been sold at a higher price than 4Jd. per lb. if the Commonwealth Government had not bungled to the extent of importing 116,000 tons of sugar at prices ranging up to £ 8 0 per ton, and averaging £ 4 4 6s. 2d -whic h was world's parity. that sugar to the consumers at the price at which they imported it, they reduced the price with a view to catching votes at a general election, and sold at less than half the price at which they had bought. They thus incurred a loss of £4,000,000, which afterwards had to he made good by charging for local sugar the price of 6d; per lb. that led to all the opposition in the southern States. The price of sugar in Australia was 3d. per lb. up to 1915; it was 3|d. per lb. from January, 1916, to 26th January, 1920, and 6d. per lb. from that time until recently, when it was reduced to 5d. per lb., the price at which it stands today. into the figures and have found that it could be done in this way: per ton. per lb. £ s. d. 18 0 0 9 0 0 27 0 0 0 12 0 27 12 0 s. d. 5 3 / .. 3 0 0 11 1 I 19 4 0 9 6 0 17 0 18 0 0 7 0 10 0 4 10 0 19 3 34 12 1 0 15 0 0 8 0 13 0 .. .. 35 15 1 . 6 4 11 42 0 0. 4id. per ton. per lb. reducing it to 4£d. per l b . , a price at which it could have been sold since 1920, even though the Government had done the f a i r thing and had acceded to the demands of the sugar-growers.

The sugar industry in Australia during the period of Government control saved the people of Australia £17,000,000. Foreign raws, purchased from 1915 to ,1922 inclusive, totalled 475,947 tons, and the average rate per ton gross was £37 19s. During the same period the Australian raws purchased totalled 1,412,000 tons, at an average price per ton gross of £25 17s. lid. Had the whole of Australia's requirements in sugar been purchased on the world's market at world's parity Australia's sugar bil l would have amounted to £71,000,000 instead of £54,000,000, inclusive of £5,000,000 worth of foreign raws. The present proposals of the CommonThe Government now propose wealth Government do not afford' the \ measure of protection which, is warranted; hut the Queensland Premier and the officials of the Sugar Growers' Association have decided that it will be betterto have some measure of protection rather than have none at all. Even though the Commonwealth Government do not offer the protection which was really promised to the growers by,the Government candidates at the election, the growers take the view, "" Under duress we must accept what we are offered rather than throw ourselves on the mercy of the Colonial Sugar Refining monopoly."" which I gave to a representative of one of the Queensland newspapers, I said I thought it was better for the growers to accept the proposals with a view to liberalizing them later. ford) -The honourable member's time has expired. I desire to bring before the notice of the Postmaster-General some matters which I think are worthy of his serious consideration. by local municipal bodies to endeavour to obtain increased postal facilities for Hurlstone Park, portion of which has been added to my constituency. Apparently the Department is not prepared to consider favourably their suggestion that a post-office, which is very badly needed, should be erected in that populous suburb. A few years ago, when I passed through this neighbourhood, it consisted almost entirely of paddocks with habitations scattered here ancl there in what was then bush land. During the recent election campaign, when I had occasion frequently to travel through the district, I found that these paddocks were now covered with houses and handsome business premises; the trams had been extended, and several lines' of motor 'buses were running out. Notwithstanding the recognition by these activities of the necessity for meeting the convenience of residents of this wonderfully rapidly settled new suburban district, the Department has not increased its postal facilities. At the request of the municipal council, I addressed a communication on the subject to the Postmaster-General some days ago, but so far have not Had an acknowledgment. stand that my friend, the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr), who represents the adjoining constituency, which also impinges upon this particular locality, has been in communication with the Department, but his representations have met with an unfavorable reception. The opportunity exists for the Postmaster General to pursue a more progressive policy in regard to the extension of postal facilities, not only in suburban, but also in country districts. There is, I think, too much of a tendency to regard the Post Office as a commercial concern, that In an interview should be run on business lines in order to show a handsome profit. I do not regard the postal service in that light; it is a public utility which should assist the development of the country. So long as the Post Office can pay its way, I do not think it is necessary that' it should be managed in such a way as will enable it to show a profit. I hope that this matter will receive more favorable consideration from the Postmaster-General than apparently it has received from some of the officials in the Department. I have been requested Another portion of my electorateMarrickville-is badly in need of increased postal „facilities. We have had there, for many years, a post-office, which proved adequate to the needs of the popution when it was built. At that time the population was only about one-third its present size. Notwithstanding the large increase which has taken place, and the fact that the districtnow; contains a population of something like 42,000, compared with 15,000 when the post office, was built, very little has been done towards increasing postal facilities. .There is need for a post-office in Addison-road, in the vicinity of Newell-street, a very thickly populated area of this important municipality. A matter which has been brought under my notice is a practice of the Department which requires business firms that receive large parcels of registered letters to sign a receipt for each individual letter. It appears to me to be a very cumbersome method. ceived attention. glad to know that. Another matter I underwhich has been brought under my notice is, the.necessity for reducing the rate of",48,Introduction Of The Taxation Office The Provision I N Stock From Newzealand Cludes Considerable Arrears Which W I L L Be

I do not know whether the Postmaster-General is aware of the fact that many business firms in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and other cities in Australia, which conduct a large quantity of local correspondence, have found it very much more profitable to engage a man to deliver their letters w it h in the city areas. That practice has resulted in a big loss to tihe postal revenue, and I do not think it should be encouraged. I would like the Postmaster-General matter, and see whether some other arrangement can be made. -I take this opportunity, before resuming my seat, of complimenting the Government on their decision to increase the invalid and old-age pensions, and I trust that, when dealing with this matter, they will also consider the advisability of amending the Act in several much-needed directions to remove a number of disabilities that at present hamper the administration of the Department to the detriment of the pensioners themselves. the other day that he was opposed to any increase i u pensions. Sir' ELLIOT JOHNSON -Well, that is a matter for the honourable member himself. The general feeling of the community, I am sure, is in favour of in creasing invalid and old-age pensions at s the earliest possible moment. I am sympathetically disposed towards any such proposal, and I hope that as little time as possible will be lost in bringing down a measure which w ill have the desired result. MrM c NEILL (Wannon) [ 8 . 4 7 ] desire, in the debate on this SupplyB ill , which includes an item of expenditure in connection with the New Hebrides, to suggest that the Government take action to improve the administration in those islands. Recently there appeared in one of the Victorian provincial newspapers a letter, written by the Rev. F . J. Patonthe missionary maintained, by Andrew's K i r k , in the New Hebridesdealing with the condition of the natives under the administration of the Condominium. It is a matter of which the about the Government should take cognisance, and for tlie information' of ""honourable members. I shall read portion of the letterA local Frenchman signed on a school woman against the wish of her husband for a year. This is allowedtoythe French under the Condominium. A decent Frenchman working for this man complained to me that he was not able to sleep because his master's labourers were hunting the woman all night. He said:. "" It is not good tor a school woman,"" and added: "" It may not be the woman's fault. Her master gave her to one of his employees, though her Teal husband is a school attender."" The latter asked me what he could do, and I could only say, ""Nothing."" You see, this Condominium allows it, and you in Australia allow the Condominium. The girl was then to look into the sent to another place along the coast, and this time a native fought a second Frenchman for her. This Frenchman, a drunken specimen, bolted, but last Sunday took her off as .she was ; coming to service. They crossed a river naked. Even the lowest cannibal would not have done that. And she is a school girl. Can you not denounce those in the Commonwealth Parliament iwho allow this Condominium? Another girl working for this Frenchman was recruited near midnight on Ambrim, as she and others were shell-fishing with torches on the reef. Site was recruited by a half-caste. -She alleges that she was rushed by the boat crew and kidnapped. In any case, she has .a husband on Ambrim, but the native that recruited her was rewarded witii her. She was beaten by her mistress and ran away. Natives with loaded muskets hunted her and brought her back. Later she ran away, this time to the French magistrate at Port Sandwich, and pending an inquiry into her ill-treatment, she is held there under the care of the ' French, sisters, I think. One of our church members, recruited on a cutter whose captain is a pureblooded native, a well-known scoundrel. How she got on board, no one knows. Her husband was not asked for eonsent. This is illegal. I reported the matter, and tbe woman is now dead. No notice was taken of the report. Another school attender ran away to work for a Frenchman. He put her on board a cutter. Her husband refused consent. Later the French Resident interviewed the husband, and there is not a, shadow of doubt about the illegality. The woman is not returned. A third woman was recruited by a half-caste. Her husband, I not being able to get her back, went with her. But the recruiter has taken her for his wife pro tern, and she is round with him in the recruiting ship while the husband has to work on the plantation. These are about all the women who ha^e been .recruited here since the war, but multiply every other place where recruiting has been done, and you get a horrible result. And this is the Condominium you in Australia allow. In London they say it is purely a St. matter for Australia, as these islands, with their magnificent ports, are vital to her alone.

We have' a definite responsibility with regard to the treatment of these natives, and it should certainly be the duty of this Government to take the necessary steps to prevent drunken Frenchmen, or any other persons, from molesting women in the manner described by the writer of the letter which I have quoted. I hope that the Government will take prompt action. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce)., in his reply to the statements made by the honourable Scullin) concerning the sale of the Commonwealth WoollenM ill at Geelong, charged honourable members on this side with insincerity and hypocrisy. We are just as sincere as the Prime Minister himself, or any other member of the Ministerial following. sire is to do the right thing by the people of Australia. was established, I , for one, cherished the hope that one day we would have distributed throughout the Commonwealth similar mills engaged in the manufacture of our own raw material. We are in a better position to do this than are the people of any other country. The Prime Minister also suggested that the honourable member for Yarra was using poison gas. ment which he made can be verified from the official files. From 1916 to 1922 the Nationalist party have been using, not only poison gas, but politically they have poisoned wells and used dum dum bullets. If a man dares to say anything against them he is sent out of the country without the privilege of trial by jury . charge, of using questionable methods is at their door, and not at the door of the Labour party. The Prime Minister has Mr JfWeill. declared that he does not believe in in terference with private enterprise. WouldA Britisher lately 'recruited a the right honourable gentleman, if he were Premier of Victoria, sell to private enterprise the great electricity works at Morwell, or the railway system, or the cool stores ? By no means. And would he, if he were Premier of Western Australia, sell to private enterprise the great Mundardng waterworks, carried The Japs out under Government direction at gives to the people of Kalgoorlie and Menzies a plentifu l supply of splendid drinking water? If the Prime Minister does not believe in Government control of public utilities he should be straightforward enough to advocate the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and of every ship owned by the people of the Commonwealth. If he will not do that, he should refrain from charging honourable members on this side with in sincerity. During the last session of Parliament, a number of wealthy cattle owners in the Northern Territory and Queensland approached the Government for a subsidy on beef exported from the member for Yarra( Mr Commonwealth, which was willingl y granted. I have no objection to the payment of subsidies, because I believe every industry in the Commonwealth, and every individual, if necessary, should receive Government assistance, because poor men and women are as much entitled to Our earnest derelief as are the Avealthy beef barons in the Northern Territory or Queensland. When the WoollenM ill Harbors are of national importance, but are, of course, under State control. Warrnambool, Portland, and Port Fairy are among the finest harbors in Victoria, and when a State Government, owing to lack of funds, w ill not improve such harbors and protect them by breakwaters, it should be the duty of the Commonwealth Government to assist by contributing at As a matter of fact, every stateleast one-half of the necessary expenditure. The members of the Labour party are wrongly charged w i th doing everything possible to retard immigration. The honourable member for ' Lilley( Mr. Mackay) said that he hoped, the day was not f a r distant when the trade union The organizations in Australia would support the policy of the various Governments in the matter of immigration. The Labour party of Australia does not oppose i m m i gratio.u in certain circumstances. There are thousands of starving people in Eng-' land, Scotland, Ireland, and elsewhere, and if this great young country can do anything to relieve their suffering and misery, it is our duty to assist them to come here. The Government, however, are not acting fairly to these,people. Our opposition to the present policy is based, on the ,fact that the Government are encouraging thousands of young men and women to come to Australia, and, twenty four hours after they land, are throwing them on their own resources to find work wherever they can when thousands of our own men and women are unable to find remunerative employment. ported in the press of Saturday last that a number of returned soldiers were sleeping in the Sidney 'Domain, and were receiving some help from a hostel controlled by the Anglican Church. When the Government unlock large areas of country, afc present not available for settlement, and find employment for men and women seeking it , tlie members of . the Labour party w ill welcome settlers fro m overseas. settlers in Australia are anxious to bring their relatives. and friends to the Commonwealth, but a National Government, in 1920, two years after the signing of the Armistice, passed an Act prohibiting Germans coming to Australia unti l 1925. Germany, and we are doing the same, notwithstanding that the ex-PrimeM i nister ( Mr Hughes) said that we would never again do so-. Prior to the war the Germans were good customers of ours, and as we are willing to dp business with them, is there any reason why they should not be admitted to the Commonwealth? Many of those who pioneered South Australia and the Wimmera Districti n Victoria were members of that cultured race,. and they have undoubtedly proved themselves to be good Australian citizens. Hundreds of young Germans who desire to migrate are going to Canada and America, and the Government should . seriously consider the desirableness * of allowing them to enter Australia. Germany was our principal enemy during the recent great conflict, but just as she has been on our side before, so she may assist us in the future. Scotland and England have opposed each other, but are friends » to-day. I trust that we have seen the last of great international conflicts, and that England and Germany will now be friends. I hope the policy of the Government to appoint a composite tribunal for the settlement of industrial disputes will not be pursued, because we are justly proud of having blazed the trail in the settlement of industrial disputes by compulsory arbitration. Prior to 1907 the great pastoral industry in Australia was always in a state of turmoil, but in consequence of compulsory arbitration, for which the Labour party was largely responsible, that great and important industry has since worked under peaceful conditions. I do not think It was reany country can produce the industrial results that we can. This happy position has been brought about inconsequence of our strict adherence to the principle of compulsory arbitration. No country has fewer strikes than Australia, and although America boasts of her freedom', the American people work longer hours than those of any other nation. The conditions here compare favourably, with those of any other country. statistics are all wrong? MrM c NEILL V e r y often they are; much of the information I have seen compiled by the statistical authorities is quite inaccurate. Notwithstanding the information which the honourable member GreatB r it a in is trading w i th for Swan( Mr Gregory) may have in his possession, no other country, not even America, can show the good results that we can under compulsory arbitration.. The people of the Commonwealth have accepted and appreciate arbitration, and the Government's proposal to appoint some hybrid tribunal w ill result in creating, instead of preventing, industrial unrest. If there is congestion in the Court additional Judges can be appointed. I move That the proposed vote be reduced by £1. I do this as an intimation to the Government that it is the desire of this House that provision should be made in this vote for the payment of increased old-age and invalid pensions, and that such increased pensions be paid as from the 1st July, 1923. Instead of proceeding with the numerous Bills concerning which notice has been given, the Government should immediately introduce a measure to give effect to their promise to increase these pensions, because they must realize that a large number of people in Australia are",52,Introduction Of The Taxation Office The Provision I N Stock From Newzealand Cludes Considerable Arrears Which W I L L Be
167,A Large Number Of German Mr Geegoey,"I suppose our industrialj suffering in consequence of the meagre allowance Hundreds of people do not know how to get their next meal. When poor people get an increase in wages, the rent-lords seize it as rents, and as soon as the poor old-ago pensioners receive an increase in (heir pensions, the rent-lords wil l thieve it , as they have done in the past. Something should be done to control those people who rent to old-age pensioners, at is., 5s., or 6s. a week, dirty hovels in which no one should be allowed to live. These poor pioneered this country, ought not to have their money extracted from them in this way. receiving, and. the action of the rentlords is an outrage and a disgrace. The principle is wrong, and I hope the Government will do something to clip the wings of these rapacious individuals who are robbing the poor. is absurd for the. Opposition to propose an amendment providing for increased invalid and old-age pensions when the Government has already made a definite statement that it is the wish and intention of 'this party that an increase should be made in the old-age pensions. I intend to deal with three or four other matters which I consider important, and I hope the Ministry w ill take note of my remarks. The first relates to the sugar industry, which is very important to Queensland and the Commonwealth. When the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) was in my electorate I went into the him, and tried very hard to obtain something better than he has now notified the sugar-growers will be granted. understand that after the conversation I had with h im some improvement was made in the schemer, but I regret that it did not go fa r enough. I -should have dealt with this question earlier but for the fact that a conference of growers, manufacturers, and representatives of the Queensland Government was sitting in Brisbane, and to-day we were to be -informed whether the Prime, Minister's offer would be accepted. grams from people in my electorate asking me to oppose the offer, and endeavour to secure an amendment of it in the direction already suggested by me to the Prime Minister when he was in Queensland. My request was that he should make the they are now receiving. embargo for four, instead of two, crops. An agreement for two crops would apply to the crop now about to be harvested, and next year's crop. The price of sugar overseas will be greater than the price the growers w ill have to accept for these two crops. The world's parity to-day is higher than the price the Prime Minister is offering, and there is every prospect of that condition continuing for at least another twelve months. It is reasonable and equitable that the growers should be old people, who have granted an extension of the «agreement for four years at the same rate as is proposed for two years. This important in They are entitled to all they are dustry would, I think, have been sufficiently stabilized if Parliament had accepted the suggestion made by the Nationalist party for a protective duty of £14 per ton. The proposal was rejected, and a duty of £9 6s. 8d. imposed. A duty of £ 1 4 per ton would"" have stabilized the industry; in some circumstances a duty of £9 6s. 8d. cannot do it . The people of the Commonwealth are under an obligation to the sugar industry for settling a white population . along the immense coast-line of Queenslanda coast which could not be settled in any other way. It is absolutely essential, in view of our White Australia policy, that we should have sufficient white men on that coast to assist, at any rate, in protecting us from the importation of a coloured race. We should not lose sight of the fact that the League of Nations would not allow the Commonwealth of Australia to continue to hold the enormous territory it now occupies w it h a matter very thoroughly w i th mere handful of 6,000,000 people. The' Commonwealth' is larger than the United States, where there are 112,000,000 people. I We know that strong appeals have been made to the League of Nations, urging that it is not fair that the Commonwealth of Australia should hold such, a vast territory, andyet not allow the enormous surplus populations of other countries to enter. gentleman get hold of that? I have many telemember for Adelaide( Mr Yates) could have got hold of it if he had done his business properly. I read it in newspapers published in the country not far from the Australian coast.

We do not want to M i l an industry which is employing a large number of men and paying enormous amounts in wages. It should be encouraged, instead of being hampered. During the crushing season, no fewer than 4,000 or 5,000 men go from the southern States to work in the industry in Queensland. The Courtsi n that State recently decided that these men should be paid a higher wage than other workers, because they have to travel from and return to the southern , States, and have to wait a littl e time before the crushing commences. That extra cost is paid by the cane-growers. think a four years' agreement would in flict any injustice upon the consumers. A f t er the Government has sold the surplus sugar which has been accumulated because, of the amount of black-grown sugar imported at a very high price, it will be able for four years to supply the consumer in Australia at from 4^d. to 4£d. per lb. Further, the industry would be so stabilized that the people who would purchase sugar for the purposes of manufacture, whether for local comsumption or export, would know exactly where they stood. Sugar used for export is sold at world's parity; thus everything possible is done to protect the secondary industries using sugar, and the primary industries connected w it h them. I sincerely hope that the Government will not take advantage of the fact that probably a majority of the sugar organizations of Queensland will consent, under pressure, to accept the proposed agreement, because there is insufficient time before the taking off of the crop to make arrangements for financing the crude sugar factories. These factories, unfortunately, are not now in a position to produce a m ill white sugar, which, I believe, could be sold in large quantities. There is not time for them to arrange to produce that class of sugar in the present season, and they are thus under a great disability. doubt that if the growers and crude sugar manufacturers of Queensland accept the agreement it will be because of difficulties connected with finance, and because they w ill be unable without the agreement during the next twelve months. Thrt sugar industry is different from every other industry in Australia in that it is dependent upon protection against the sugar grown by black labour in other parts of the world.

Honourable members often attempt to compare various industries w it h the sugar industry of Queensland, but they forget that when the States decided on Federation, black labourers from the Islands who were engaged in the industry received only £ 6 a year, were well clothed and well fed, and at the end of three years were returned to their native homes.

When I represented that district I succeeded in getting sugar from the north sent to this refinery for milling, but the manager would not take the balance of the sugar whicli arrived after the factory had been closed down, because, as ha said, it would not pay the m ill to carry on at such a small price. I pointed out that he was getting 6s. a ton more than the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, but he still contended that it would not pay him . I asked hi m why it paid the Colonial Sugar Refining Company,, and he stated that its overhead charges were spread over an enormous output, and, in consequence, it could produce the sugar at a much cheaper rate than any other refinery. The members of the Sugar Commission obtained similar information, and further stated that the grower received from the Colonial Sugar Refining Companyi n most instances a higher price than was paid by any other mills, including the Central. Mills. They instanced the districts in which higher prices were given by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.

There are other requirements, but these are sufficient to indicate that carriage by sea from Queensland is not permitted, in as much as the coastal districts are all tick infested and the Victorian State authorities do not recognise .the possibility of giving -the declaration as above in respect of any cattle whicli have travelled through the coastal districts of Queensland. On the other hand, with respect to the importation of carcasses or of meat, the following is the regulation prescribed by the State Government of Vjictoria under .the 'Health Act:In the case of any carcass or meat imported from outside Victoria which has been certified as wholesome by an inspector appointed .for that .purpose by the Government of the State or country from -which it has been exported, the person importing such carcass or meat shall produce the certificate of wholesomeness to ' .the .municipal authorities into whose district such carcass or meat has been brought ,for sale or disposal, and a meat inspector shall examine it and if satisfied .that such carcass or meat is wholesome shall brand it in accordance with the provisions of Schedule (-2) to these Regulations with regard to imported meat. Inquiries are actively in hand as to the practicability of .making available vessels of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers for the transport of either carcasses or fat cattle,and I shall keep you advised of the progress of this question. Honourable members who represent Victorian electorates should join in making arrangements w it h the Victorian Government whereby the consumer in Melbourne and elsewhere in this State would be -able to obtain meat from Queensland at a reasonable price instead of paying Is. 2d. or more per lb. The danger from tick could be obviated by dipping the stock prior to embarkation. If cattle were landed at some isolated point on the harbour, and slaughtered, there would be no more danger to the public than in admitting the hides of cattle that have been affected by tick. If the cattle icould not be brought in alive on account of regulations, at least an arrangement could be made to convey chilled meat directly to Melbourne by a special steamer from one of the northern ports of Queensland. The people could then be supplied ""with meat of the best quality at the lowest possible figure, and at a price f a r below that charged for New Zealand, meat. I hope that honourable members who are particularly interested in Victoria w ill move in this direction, and endeavour to help the poor to whom they so often refer, and also help their fellow beings in another part of the Commonwealth, who are raising cattle under adverse circumstances as to price, and Commonwealth steamers, now idle, could be used for transport.

He has advocated the granting of the increase on many occasions, and I would be exceedingly disappointed if the proposal were dropped owing to the curtailment of the session.

In the case of the ex-Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), honourable members on this side were accustomed to look beyond his actual words. Are we to understand that the reason why the Government have not brought down their old age pensions proposals before j now is that they desire to ascertain the exact financial position, in order that they may be able to give the last penny to these needy people? I wish that were the only reason. T'he concluding observation of the Prime Minister, like the postscript to a lady's letter, contained the.sting. He said lie hoped honourable members would allow the measures on the notice-paper to be disposed of so that, the B ill relating to old-age penFurthermore, we have the sions could be brought forward. It seems to me that by keeping back this Bill the Prime Minister wishes to hold a whip over the heads of the Opposition, and to have the Victorian press charging us with blocking legislation, and thereby preventing the granting of increased pensions to the aged and infirm. Theamendment of the honourable member for Wannon seeks to eliminate such a possibility. It fixes a definite date for the payment of the increase, and brings honourable members opposite up to the collar. Speaking for myself-and , I think, also for the Labour partyI would be quite satisfied to act cept to-day such an increase as the financial position as now known would justify. I understand the Labour party sufficiently well to be able to state with confidence that the lips of honourable members on this side cannot be closed on the other measures to be brought forward by simply holding a whip over us in the shape of a suggestion that by discussing them we shall delay the passage of the measure dealing with pensions.

When asked by -way of an interjection from this side of the House to state the reason for his attitude, he gave only one reason, and the essence of it was that it would mean increased taxation.

This money, of course, may not come directly from these old-age pensioners, but, as Mr Speaker has said, in the end all taxation filters right down through the different strata of society until it reaches the manual labourer.

I neither drink nor smoke, because I like to do as I choose, allowing every other man the same right. He does not If a man chooses to smoke and drink, let him do so; it is his business. Now, let us suppose that my brother both drinks and smokes, and he spends his money in that way, while I save. Let us further suppose that we both live to the age of 65 or 70; it is probable that, through being careful,' I do not need an old-age pension, wheTeas my brother may require such assistance.

I at once rise in the defence of the old-age pensioners when I find a man with inherited wealth unwilling to afford the old people an additional Is. or 2s. 6d. per week. Boothby told us that, in this connection, he waslooking to the future, and he could see the time, perhaps one hundred years hence, when the population of this country would be 50,000,000, and we should be faced with an annual expenditure' on old-age pensions of £50,000,000. But what is the difference between 5,500,000 people paying £5,500,000 i u pensions, ancl a population of 50,000,000 paying £50,000,000 a year? no difference whatever, so that the honourable member .really cuts the ground from underneath his feet.

I think it should be put on record that the present Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Austin Chapman) had more to do than any other The man in the Commonwealth with the introduction of old-age pensions. He was associated with the question in New South Wales, and was Chairman of the Royal Commission whose report made the payment of these pensions a live issue in this Parliament.

We hear a great deal of talk from honourable members opposite on this subject, but the party to which they belong was in office for many years before they made any move in the direction of increasing the old-age pension. I give every member of this House credit for being anxious to see justice done to the aged people in this country. should not say that; it is bad policy. bad policy to say so or not, I believe it is true that every member of the House is anxious to do the best he can for the aged poor of the country. Honourable members on both sides, quite irrespective of party considerations, have been persistent in requests for the removal of anomalies under the Act, and for an increase in the pension. I regret that any attempt should be made to make this a party matter. . The intention of the Government to increase the old-age pension is, mentioned in the Governor General's Opening Speech, and the measure to give effect to that intention will be proceeded with immediately the Budget is presented to this House. The amendment before the Committee will not help us at all. It s effect, if carried, can only be to delay the introduction of the measure by the Government: honourable gentleman who has just resumed his seat is a godsend to the Opposition.

I intend to say but a few words most complimentary to the Treasurer (Dr. able gentleman would only take a few lessons from his chief in diplomacy, culture, and good manners, he would get on better. All that he appears to be able to do is to shake a red rag at a bull. He cannot hope to expedite the business of the Government in that way. I am prepared to agree that the Treasurer in his lifetime has given a great deal away to the poor, but what he has given away is nothing to the millions I have given away. I cannot allow the honourable gentleman to take advantage of this occasion to refer to his generosity and good qualities without directing attention to the very fact that my poverty to-day is wholly the result of . what I have given away to the world at large. The Treasurer has tried to teach the members of the Opposition their duty. Permit me to tell him that we do not want any lessons from him as to our duty. Honourable members opposite would not take instructions from the Opposition as to their duty. They will carry out their duties, as the Prime Minister has said, in the manner they think best, and we on this side will conduct the business of the Opposition as we think best. Wo never impute motives to the Government, except occasionally, nor do we admit them ourselves. The Treasurer has told us what the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Austin Chapman) has done. He will permit me to advertise the fact that the reason why a certain Government brought the old-age pensions legislation into existence was because they were compelled to do so. The action taken was not of their own volition, but because they were dependent for their continued existence as a Government upon the votes of members of the party on this side of the House. In like manner the present Government do things because they are dependent on the votes of a certain number of honourable gentlemen sitting in the Corner.

Are honourable members opposite prepared to fritter away the privileges of the House merely in order that the Prime Minister may leave for England by a certain date? The programme of legislation promised by the Government, if it were properly digested, would occupy Parliament to the end of Ibe year. It is equal to legislative programmes which in other years have occupied Parliament for five . or six months and have only been disposed of by sitting four and five days a week towards the end of the session. Prime Minister expect this Parliament to put through a programme of such magnitude in seven more weeks of sitting? mised towards the end of next month. Discussion on the Budget ought to occupy a couple of weeks. Then we have to deal with the Estimates of every Department. I remember the criticism which was levelled House by newspapers which, to-day, are urging the Government to adopt this course for passing the Budget and the Estimates in three, or four weeks. The Government propose now to put through the whole of their programme in that time. They will be whipped with scorpions in the near future by those who now approve of their action; they will be told that they did not give « these matters proper consideration.

Knowing that, we yet are endeavouring to put -measures through in a manner which renders probable the making of mistakes. I did not think. I would sit in a deliberative Parliament which would permit such a thing. A paper from the Old Country which I read recently disclosed the fact that the taxation proposals which the Commonwealth placed before the recent Conference of State Premiers were known in London last February. Everything appears to have been cut and dried. It is apparent that some influence is at work outside this Chamber to bring about certain results. That demonsUates the advisability of this House Apparently, we are to be remaining in session to see that no advantage is taken of the public. We are the watchdogs of the public, and: are supposed to look after their interests. The Prime Minister would be well advised if he agreed to allow this matter to stand over until to-morrow. This side of the House has never, to my knowledge, endeavoured to hold up Supply and prevent the public servants being paid at the proper time. We are quite justified in complaining of this attempt to rush the matter through.

241,Mr Charlton,"This is a matter of Found the one gift of which fortune bereft us,374 Tho Treasurer saw things with different eyes then, when he was leading the Country party. Now that he is in power he is taking exactly the opposite course. He said furtherIt seems to me that the first step towards economy is for us to consider how much is to be spent, and then to insist that it shall be spent wisely. The Country party has adopted the attitude that it should exercise some control over the spending power of this Parliament, even though there is very little of the current year now left. In the present case we are at the commencement of our parliamentary work, and yet at the instigation of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer we are expected to pass without debate a SupplyB ill totalling over £4,000,000. May I ask the Treasurer how he reconciles his present attitude with his views of 4th March, 1920 ? In his speech oh that occasion he quoted with approval certain remarks made by the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Poster), when speaking in Adelaide four weeks prior to that debate, thusHe made an appeal for the restoration of parliamentary authority to end what he termed the Bolshevik regime. He said that war conditions had made Parliament a cypher, and uncontrolled Cabinets had become intoxicated with their own unlimited authority, and in the absence of effective criticism and proper parlianientajry safeguards often drifted into demoralization. That is our present position. We are d r if t in g into demoralization. There is no war, and no occasion for hysteria. We are supposed, as common-sense men, to have got back to normal. Nevertheless, we are expected to continue to be a cypher when dealing with the affairs of the country in that we are to be denied the opportunity to devote our time and our talents to seeing what can be done to reduce the financial burdens placed on the shoulders of the people as the result of the war. We are to remain a cypher because the closure is to be applied whenever the Prime Minister feels so inclined. The Treasurer quoted further from the speech of the honourable member for Wakefield, thusThe people were staggering under out=rageous prices . . . . There was one remedy left, and that was a vigorous determination by the people that Government be supreme and parliamentary authority restored. This is the way the Government to restore parliamentary Mr Charlton. Supply BiU [ REPRESENTATIVES . ] (No. 1) 1923-24. only shows how cherished ideals are discarded when honourable members opposite get on the Treasury bench. Their desire now is to keep Parliament closed as long as possible, and to that end they feel justified in taking any steps available to them. The application of the closure is ridiculous. We might just as well admit that Parliament has no responsibility, and is a mere cypher in the hands of the Government. I appeal to honourable members opposite as intelligent men and representatives of the people to withstand this pressure by Ministers, and to honour their pledges. D i d they tell the people that, if returned, they would acquiesce in this policy of stifling discussion, and preventing the searchlight of public opinion from being directed upon the transactions of the Government? I venture to say that, on the contrary, they declared that, if elected, they would give diligent attention to all those matters about which complaints have been made, and particularly the treatment of our returned soldiers, and the position w it h regard to the War Service Homes scandals. The only way in which this may be done is for Parliament to be allowed f u l l opportunity to debate all subjects that may be intro-. duced. This, hitherto, has been the privilege of all new Parliaments, but, unfortunately,there now appears to be a disposition among members opposite not to do so., The Treasurer also saidThe Estimates are rushed and closured through frequently in a couple of days.

That the question be now put. mitted from the Chair is that the schedule stand part of the Bill. I should like to know just what that means. Does it mean the schedule, as a whole, covering the f u l l amount provided for by the Supply Bill. The TEMPORARY (Hon. D. Watkins) -There is only one schedule to the Bill, and it includes the votes for the whole of the Departments. to take your ruling on the submission of the schedule in that form. It has always been the custom in this Parliament for the Minister in charge of a Supply Bill, if that is thought desirable, to ask that the whole of the items for the different Departments be taken together. should any one object that cannot be done, and the schedule must be submitted in separate Departments. I trust that you will see that the practice of this Parlia-' mcnt in that regard is observed on this Hurry, G. occasion. I claim that the Committee Jackson,. D. S. should take, first of all, the vote for the Mackay, G. H. Parliament and then the votes for each Mann, B. A. of the succeeding Departments. Marks, W. M. containing a number of clauses and an Seabrook, A. C. attached schedule is under consideration Watson, W. the practice has been, when the clauses Whitsitt, J. T.

But we are here considering the schedule to a Supply Bill, and it has been the uniMoloney, Parker form practice for the Chairman of ComMcNeill, J. mittees to put the vote for each DepartRiley, C. ment separately. I hope that the ComWatkins, D. mittee is not going to be muzzled by any Yiates, G. E. Chairman;, by the Clerks, or by anybody O'Keefe, D. J. need to consult the Standing Orders to decide the point of order that has been McDonald, C. raised. The Leader of the Opposition Lambert, W. H . ( Mr Charlton) has stated the ordinary Green, A. practice adopted in this Parliament. Mathews, J. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN Brennan, F. Standing order No. 169 deals with the consideration of B i l k in Committee, new Cunningham, L. L. clauses, schedules as printed, and new schedules; but I take it that a Supply Bil l differs somewhat from an ordinary Bill. The schedule includes, votes for a number of Government Departments, and I think the Prime Minister would be well advised if he agreed to the submission of question subthe schedule to the Committee in different Departments. the schedule taken as a whole, if that is unusual and if your ruling is that it would be better that it should be taken in Departments. to a Supply Bill is taken in divisions.
