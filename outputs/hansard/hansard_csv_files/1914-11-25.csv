59,Mr Bamford,"What has a l l this topoint to which I am coming. The question assumes two aspects, with both of which I am vitally concerned. is the constitutional aspect, and the next is the effect of the action taken on one of the great industries of Australia. I shall not dwell long on the constitutional aspect, because there are others in the House better qualified to speak in that regard than I am myself. -duty, however, to point out that this Parliament derives its authority in connection with trade and commerce from sect i o n 51 of the Constitution, and that section 92 seems to show the position very -clearly, so far as a layman is concerned. Section 92 readsOn the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, trade, commerce, and intercourse among -the States, whether by means of internal carrimier of New South Wales to secure age or ocean navigation, shall be absolutely -free. ""We have from the Premier of New South ""Wales an absolute declaration that the -estimated wheat supply in that State will be more than adequate for tTfe require-ments of the people there. We are.aware that there are certain policing powers, as we may call them, which may be put into operation for the preservation of life, and for the protection and the well-being and health, and so forth , of the citizens, under which a State may operate. W it h total disregard of the Constitution, Western Australia acted in the restriction of the importation of produce from one 'State to another. by an over-exercise of these policing powers, attempted to restrain trade in this way. Now we have the first attempt made in the Commonwealth to assert, at any rate the first declaration by any State, thafc the foodstuffs in that State shall be the property of the State and disposed of by the Government as they may think proper. It matters little to me that the New thab, if there be surplus wheat after New South Wales requirements are met, that surplus will be at the disposal of the other States. ment has the right to act as the guardian -of freedom of trade between the States, in order to insure free and unfettered commercial intercourse, it little matters, I say, that a Government, while temporarily holding up that trade, may promise to ultimately make available the surplus for distribution amongst the other States. The action of New South Wales seems to be the converse of the action of Western Australia, when that State, The first by an overcautious system of inspection, prevented Victorian potatoes from finding their natural market under a condition of Inter-State Free Trade. Here we have an avowed declaration by the Premier of New South Wales thafc ifc is his intention to prevent the wheat crop of that I feel it my State, and the surplus of the previous years-and that must be borne in mind, because a surplus did exist-findin g its natural market in the other States. Western Australia by its inspection system attempted to prevent foodstuffs getting into the State, and now we have the converse action of an attempt to prevent foodstuffs leaving a State. I can well understand the attempt of the Preuniform action on the part of the various States. There is a very old and impressive story told of the fox that had its tail cut off, and that story seems apposite to the present circumstances. I believe that from a constitutional standpoint, and also having regard to the effecfc which his action will have on the agricultural interests of New South Wales, the Premier of thafc State has blundered badly. Whatever the constitutional aspect of this matter may be, fche question arises as to who is to decide regarding the legality of the action which has been taken. Is New South Wales itself to determine the justice or injustice Western Australia, of an action which we believe to be wrong? Or is the Federal Parliament to be the arbiter? If so, I hope that fchis House will to-day show itself a jealous custodian of the rights of the whole of the States. it is beyond the power of a State t'o do what the New South Wales Government propose to do? when the Government make an open declaration that they have more foodstuffs in New South Wales than the people of If the Federal Parliathat State require. support the referendum on the next occasion. the honourable member's pet nostrum for everything.

64,Mr Rodgers,"The referendum ispreventing freedom of trade between the States is correct, how does Australia stand i u respect of its many great natural industries ? Suppose the Queensland Government were to similarly acquire and control the sugar crop, what would become of the true Federal spirit under whicli tlie States federated? A p parently we are to have tlie doctrine laid down that in times of plenty the Federal spirit is to be observed, but in lean years the opponents of the true Federal spirit are going to take the recoil action of asserting State rights in order, as they think, to produce a cheaper loaf for the people within their own particular State. If this action be right in respect of wheat, would it not be permissible in respect of New South Wales coal, Queensland sugar, and Western Australian timber? of the Riverina territory. Geographically and otherwise, Melbourne is the market for Riverina, bufc by tbe action of the New South Wales Government Riverina will be deprived of its natural market, and its produce will be forced to take a more costly and circuitous route. Wales Governmenb building a railway to carry thafc produce into its own State? will be in ashes before that railway is available for the carriage of wheat. Having dealt with the constitutional aspect, let me now refer to the effect of the New South Wales Government's action on the wheat industry. The total wheat harvest in '1913-14 throughout the Commonwealth, including the Federal territories, was 103,517,000 bushels. for this year is that fche wheat harvest for the entire Commonwealth will be only 30,000,000 bushels. That estimate is nob made by fche Federal Statistician, but ifc is based on fche best information I was able to get in the time at my disposal. I have also the estimate of the New .South Wales Statistician for his own State, and I shall put that on record. The 1913-14 harvest in thafc State yielded 38,028,000 bushels, and the estimated yield for this year is 15,000,000 bushels. the figure I have given will be the limit. This further fact has to be borne in mind : fchat the officials who have collected this information, though they have taken into consideration all the area under wheat, and the possible yield, have not f u l ly appreciated the fact that this year there will be an enormous additional area cut for hay. The farmers will be influenced to fchis step by fche fact fchat a greater area will be required this year to produce tlie amount of fodder that must be consumed, and also by the action of the Government of New South Walesi n declaring that they propose to acquire the whole of the harvest, which action I can characterize as nothing but a piratical invasion of the rural industry of New South Wales by the State Government. count of the action of the State Government, the farmers will cut their wheat L e t us glance at the position crops for hay? phatically.

According to the press report of a deputation of Victorian farmers which waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs, it is estimated that this season there will be a shortage in Victoria of 1,500,000 bushels. have underestimated the shortage. In the matter of yields, there is an inclination to overestimate rather than to underestimate. My point is that Australia w ill undoubtedly be short by several million bushels.

78,Mr Rodgers,"I dare say that theyand that .it would be necessary to go to other countries in order to make it up. The average wheat yield in Australia is from 11 to 12 bushels per acre; last year the average in New South Wales was 11.86; we may call it 12 bushels. That return, at the price of 3s. 4d. per bushel prevailing when the harvest was declared, would have yielded a gross return of £2 per acre. must always bear a certain relationship to the fixation of prices' doctrines; and I have estimates of the cost of production in various States which show that the cost of producing a wheat crop runs from 30s. to £2 per acre. In some parts of Victoriai t is fully £ 2 . In the more settled districts, expenditure of £3,750,000? where the land is heavier, and where the methods are better than in other districts, the cost is liigher than it is in the Mallee. by a Royal Commission? where there is light, free soil, and where the methods employed are not so good as in the other districts. According to the estimate of the New South Wales Statistician, the average yield of the State this season will be 4 or 4$ bushels per acre, which, at the fixed price of 5s. per bushel, will mean a return of £ 1 2s. 6d. per acre, or 7s. 6d. per acre less than the cost of production on the lowest basis I allow for the cost of growing an acre of wheat. Thus, assuming that the wheat yield of New South Wales is 15,000,000 bushels, the State Government propose to levy upon the drought-stricken farmers of the State, on Mr Holman's figures, a direct tax of £1,125,000; and if he is successful in bringing about uniformity of action, and a fixed price of 5s. per bushel throughout the various States, affecting a total Commonwealth yield of 30,000,000 bushels, there will be a levy of £2,250,000 on the drought-stricken farmers of the Commonwealth in order to provide a cheap loaf for the people of Mr Holman, and for every legislator whose affairs are not affected by the action of fixing the price of wheat. price ? admission of the Premier of New South Wales, 6s.. 6d. per bushel would be about the price. The gentlemen who waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs to-day said that 7s. per bushel would be about the import price. The drought-stricken farmer who is unable to provide for the necessities of himself and family, and unable to prevent his stock from starving, is to be the person of all others at this period who is to be called on for a direct levy of £1,125,000 by the Government of New South Wales, very nearly double the Eederal land tax paid in that State. The Federal Now, cost of production land tax paid by New South Wales landowners is £771,000. Surely the action of the Federal Government is not to connive at such a levy! Do our Government propose to assist the Government of New South Wales by financing the purchase of the wheat crop of the State, which, even at Mr Holman's figures, will mean an the New South Wales BilL However, as I have only a few more minutes, I shall not answer any further questions from honourable members. Apparently, the position is, that the Federal Government are financing another Labour Government which has for its avowed object the purchase of the wheat crop of its State at a cost of £3,750,000. The State Government has, by its appeal to the Federal Government, proved its utter inability to conduct its own financial arrangements, and place at the disposal of the people the ordinary facilities of government, enabling public works to bo proceeded with. Yet here is a monstrous proposal on the part of the Federal Government to lend money to a State Government in order that it may exact an enforced levy of £1,125,000 from its drought-stricken farmers. I am very much mistaken if the country will stand suoh an action. Public conscience must be stirred up. Industry would not be safe under sueh conditions. We have the Premier of the State appealing to the farmers to spread out their areas and fallow more land, and telling them that if they do so they will get 4s. per bushel for their wheat. Isi t the proper thing for the trustees of the money of the people of New South Wales to buy in advance the whole of next year's wheat crop for 4s. a bushel?

The Government must have regard to the interests of both classes, and in the discussion of this subject there should be no intrusion of ironical interjections, or of party feeling. On both sides there are honourable members who represent farming constituencies. New South Wales is the only State which this year will have a surplus of wheat; the other States will harvest enough grain to provide seed only for next season, certainly not enough to provide their people with bread. Therefore, it is the duty of this -Government to see that no action is taken by the Government of New South Wales which will in jure the rest of the Commonwealth. If it were an individual, or a company, or a syndicate, that proposed to corner the New South Wales wheat crop, the howls of indignation would prevent us from hearing one another speak. those who interjected during the speech of the honourable member for Wannon would be the loudest in their complaint. Government propose to make anything out of the transaction ? has been arbitrarily fixed, and, though a B ill has not yet been passed through the State Parliament, no dealer in wheat dare offer any other price, and no farmer dare expect more than 5s. a bushel at the nearest railway station. complaint is that the farmers cannot get more for their wheat. honourable member has not practical experience of wheat growing. If he had, he would be less hypercritical. Eveni n New South Wales there are many places where, during the last three or four years, farmers have been growing wheat The at a loss. Remembering these losses, it it not too much for them to expect to be recouped by higher prices this season. Even 5s. a bushel is not a paying price. As a practical wheat grower, I say that, if every item is taken into consideration, from 5s. 6d. to 6s. a bushel would be only a paying price, even in the most favoured districts. Por what other than speculative purposes has the New South Wales Government arbitrarily fixed the price of The matter which it wheat? What is it going to do with the surplus ? Isi t going to act as a philanthropist, and say to the people of the other States, ' ' You can have wheat at the price that we gave for it "" ? That is the last thing that should be expected of that Government. Y e t it speaks of encouraging wheat-growing by the fixing of a minimum price for next year! The action of the New South Wales Government, if this Government does not intervene, will be to retard production. Inasmuch as the other States have not sufficient wheat to meet their requirements, this Government should declare that the action of the Government of New South Wales in cornering the wheat crop of that State is prejudicial to the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole.

[ 3 8 ] -* Both are entitled to consideration in these times, and one is jusfc as much entitled to consideration as is the other. WhilstI hold fchat the honourable member who has submitted this motion and those who support his action are wholly mistaken, and that their energy and talent are being misdirected, I feel that the fact that fchey express concern for fche poor farmer who is being robbed to-day give3 us some little reason to hope that eventually they may turn their attention to the point at which the great robbery is being perpetrated, and which lies at fche do? beginning of the work of production itself. I understand I have followed wheat-growing for twenty-five years. I started in a very small way, and, like every one else, I follow my personal interests very keenly. In NewB u t what are we to do South Wales, the bulk of the wheat produced in the big wheat-growing districts I suggest that is raised by very poor men under fche share-farming system. We have, it is true, a large number of very small holders cultivating their own land, but, except for fche middle-class holder, in very few instances are men of considerable means operating under a wages system. Ifc has become a common practice, especially among share-farmers and very small holders-tk e poor and the needy-to make advance sales of their wheat; but I have not heard on the part of the Opposition The fixation of prices is any expression of solicitation for the welfare of these men.

I have been twenty-five years a wheat-grower, and I never yet received 5s. a bushel; and are we to permit the statement to go forth to the world that, when the Empire is in danger, and there is dearth of employment in every direction, those in the wheat industry are determined to take advantage of their more needy fellow-creatures? A r e the wheat growers going to allow it to be known that they insist on their ' ' pound of flesh ""-that they insist on a price they have never been able to exact before? The bulk of us who are engaged in the wheat industry have, in the past, sold our produce for a trifle, and, though we were staggering under debt, no one came forward specially to assist us. As one who is more solicitous for the development of the wheat industry than of any other, it seems to me that the opportunity is being taken to nip in the bud what might t u r n out to be a very dangerous thing to tbose large numbers of people who are able to live as expensive idlers under our present system of production. It will no doubt, in the opinion of some, furnish a most dangerous precedent if we allow any Government to calmly fix the distribution price in the hour of t r i a l, becost of bagging and handling hay is so cause this fixing is, in its results, satisfactory to the community as a whole; then, when the socialistic agitators come forward with a proposal to regulate the monstrous robbery in the form of rents and shares that are being exacted from the blood and toil of those actively engaged in the industry, there may be a danger of the conclusion that, as the system has worked so well in the case of distribution, it may work quite as well in the case of production. I have some wheat, though not a great deal, to sell this year, and I am pleased to say that I could, as a member of this House, face every farming centre in my constituency without, I think, losing a single vote, except, perhaps, in the case of a few interested commission agents and others, who may be afraid of finding their occupation gone. member approve of the action of the New South Wales Government? the New South Wales Government w ill follow up their present step with others they have already adumbrated in connection with a supertax and the fixing of rentals, there will be given to the wheat growing industry an impetus that could not be attained by any other means.

Practical men must recognise that, in view of bhe drought, the hay this year is, at best, of inferior quality. We know that, as a rule, a drought such aa we experienced in 1902 and are experiencing now is very apt to break up in November or December, and that, witb what may be found in the stubble paddocks, the quantity of hay used on the farms this year may be reduced to, perhaps, one-half; at any rate, the chances are that growth will take place, and a small quant it y of hay will 3ee us through. The class of hay which we harvest in such a bad year is of inferior quality, and, of course, ifc brings inferior prices.

Farmers have lived through past years without getting the price now offered; and, in 1902, they saw a worse drought than the present, as the figures show.

I agree with the Minister, average of 12 bushels, whereas the average is only 3 bushels to-day. inember contend that the purchaser should now pay four times the price that was paid for wheat when the yield was fou r times as great as the present; because that is where the honourable member's argument w ill lead him.

I desire to raise two issues; the question of the application of legislation to actions pending at the time in the Courts, and the inclusion in industrial organizations of employees of persons not employees. Clauses3 and 13 deal with registration. Section 19 of the principal Act gives the Court cognisance, for the prevention and In addisettlement of disputes, of certain specific industrial disputes. They are these : A dispute certified to by the Registrar; all industrial disputes submitted to the Court by an organization by plaint; all industrial disputes which any Statei n dustrial authority refers to the Court; and all industrial disputes in regard to which the President has held a compulsory conference.

209,Mr Groom,"Unde r the civil law alla way. I do not suggest that anything personally improper is intended, but what is a right principle may be infringed. I suggest the insertion of a provision to this effectNothing in this Act contained shall affect any proceedings pending whereby the matter of the registration of any organization is questioned. We ought not, and may not, discuss the pros and cons in any case that is pending, but we are entitled to know whether the B ill , if passed as it stands, would or would not affect existing rights.

Had the B ill been intended to apply to pending litigation, I presume that the Attorney-General would have told us so. My knowledge of him leads me to think that he would not w i l f u l l y have kept us in ignorance of the fact. TheB ill as it stands may be open to the interpretation thafc it excludes from the consideration of the Court iu the determination of a case now pending the question of the cancellation of the registration of an organization, because it declares that an association which is registered shall be deemed to have been duly registered. As regards the second issue I desire to raise, clause 10 strikes at the foundation of industrial organization. The object of our arbitration law is to provide for the settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. An industrial dispute is a dispute between employers and employees in an industry or industries with respect to remuneration and conditions of employment. Clause 10 permits the enrolment in an organization of persons who are neither employers nor employees in the industry with which that organization is connected. an organization who have been connected with an industry? bond fide worker in an industry is properly a member of an organization connected with that industry, but a railway W h y was not this proposal engineer cannot properly be a member of the Wharf Labourers Union. member know of a case of that kind? It could have been moved which a lawyer who practises his profession, and who is not a wharf labourer, is a member of a wharf labourers union, and I say that it is not a sound principle to permit the enrolment in an organization of persons who are not employers or employees in the industry with which it is connected. To permit such enrolment ia contrary to the principle of our law. It We are entitled would enable disputes to be created in an industry by persons in no way connected with that industry.

One of these facts is that, whilst a certain case is pending in the Courts, we have introduced into tliis House a B ill , the effect of certain clauses of which is to deal directly with the merits and the decision of that dispute. As the honourable member for Darling Downs has pufc it , this is the adoption of a principle which not only this Parliament, but, I believe, every British Parliament, has entirely refrained from following-the principle of interference, by amending legislation, with actions brought by citizens to test their rights before the Court? of the country. to precedent?

This association-the Australian Workers Union going to speak in a moment, has registered itself under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I need hardly do more than remind honourable members of the the registration of associations. Those principles were fought out before the H i g h Court many years ago in what is known as the Jumbunna case. I hope the reference does not awaken any painful recollections in the mind of the honourable member for Henty. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE The whole question was then threshed oufc. It waa disputed by those opposed to the Jumbunna branch of fche association thafc there was any constitutional power in this Parliament to enable the organizations to be created and registered under fche Act . That argument was not accepted. The Court unanimously came to the conclusion that associations consisting exclusively of employees on the one side, or of employers on the other, could be registered.

As is well known, the Australian Workers Union has, for a long time, purported to be a very wide one. No one will question that, if it chooses to embrace a very large number of correlated industries, it has a right to do so, provided that it brings in the employees only for the legitimate purpose of arbitration. But whafc has it done ? Either by persuasion or force-by that kind of persuasion which is exercised, as we all know, by these powerful associations-it has compelled hundreds of persons, who uot only axe not employees in the particular industries with which it is connected, but who are not employees in any industry, to join its ranks. timate association for the purpose of obtaining industrial peace, or to enter into industrial agreements, it has become a huge political, octopus-like organization. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE is that such an association should claim registration under the Act. That is the particular claim, which in the Courts of this country, and under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, is being challenged by people who have a right to challenge it . I am going to point out what sort of an association this is which claims to be registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as representative of employees. 19th September, 1904, there appeared, on the inside of the red page, an advertisement containing a list of local agents. They are all members-unde r the rules of the association, they must be members -of the Australian Workers Union. about that. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE The r e can be no doubt that the rules require it . I will show honourable members the sort of people whom it includes within its ranks as independent employees in the industry.

Sir WILLIAMIBVINE On fche point of order. I am perfectly aware that it is contrary to the practice of Parliament to debate the merits of any matters pending before a Court.

We are not allowed to discuss the effect of this provision on that particular case; but, in any event, the Government are validating all kinds of defective rules, and adopting a new principle which, in the future, if followed, will be mischievous in the highest degree to the proceedings of this Parliament. those rules are validated."" that the Attorney-General would have said something upon the point raised.

I confess that, on first looking at the provisions, I thought that this might be the effect, but the balance of my judgment now leans the other way. If the Attorney-General means something that may not be accomplished by the B ill , it ' is incumbent on the Government to send this clause back to Committee. If the impression of the Attorney-General as to the effect of this legislation is correct, that is, fchat it gives the Court the discretion, which is now obligatory upon it , to order that a registration may be cancelled for the causes mentioned in section 60 of the Act, if the Attorney-General thinks that the purport of the B ill is that the Court will still have the power, notwithstanding clause 13, to cancel the registration of a union that is already registered -seein g that this view has been assailed from this side of the House, we ought to have the clause sent back -to Committee, so that we may see whether the Government have attained their object. is very grave doubt as to what the B ill does. Section 60, sub-section b, says that, on an application for a cancellation of a registration, the Court shall cancel the registration if it finds fchat fche organization has been registered erroneously, or by mistake. TheB ill , by clause 12, renders this power discretionary for the future. But in respect of paragraph b of section 60-erroneou s 33 may take the power away. If we are passing clause 13 in order to say that all organizations registered so far are to be deemed to be duly registered, the Court will want to know whafc is meant by this provision, and may say fchat it is intended fco validate erroneous registration under section 60, sub-section b. When we put a new provision into an Act, the Court must find some definite meaning for it which was not expressed by the original provisions of the measure. ney-General says that by this clause we are nofc doing more than is done by section 57. fchafc when a certificate is given by the point, and, as discussion is limited at preRegistrar effected, it shall be deemed evidence of thresh the whole matter out. If the A t registration of the organization, and of fche fact that the association has complied with fche prescribed conditions entitling it fco be registered-in other words, that it has filed rules in accordance with schedule B which have to be registered. It seems to me we cannot go beyond that. The proper rules have been submitted, and the Registrar has accepted them as in accordance w i th those required to be submitted under schedule B ; all conditions have been complied with, but, nevertheless, that is not the final step. An application may still be made under section 60 on the ground that there has been erroneous registration. Now clause 13 says, in effect, that, on an application for the cancellation of registration on the ground that there has been an erroneous registration, the Court is compelled to hold that the registration has been duly done. 13 mean? I confess that I have considerable doubt upon the point. in regard to subsection b that an There organization has been registered erroneously or by mistake. Clause 13 is a sufficient answer in regard to sub-section b, but not in regard to sub-sections a, c, d, c, and / . means that if for any reasons the regisregistration-claus e tration of an. organization ought to be cancelled, the Court may order the cancellation. If the Attorney-General tells me that clause 13 is an answer to that subsection, he must admit that there is no power to get the registration cancelled under section'60. He is in a dilemma. allow you to put the case for me. still contends that, notwithstanding clause 13, an application may still be made to The Attorthe Court to cancel the registration of an existing organization. being shown.

316,Mr Glynn,"The honourable membertorney-General is mistaken, he is doing something that is open to the greatest condemnation on the grounds of policy, seeing that he is giving complete validity to a registration which affects a case pending in the Court. Does he wish to go to that length ? the protection under section 60 might be pleaded ? That is not desired, nor does the B ill give that. for Plinders says that the B ill does give it , and I think that the honourable member for Darling Downs has said the same thing. There is very grave doubt, at least as regards paragraph 6 of section 60, which deals with cancellation for erroneous or mistaken registration. resolve it? By numbers? putting it on the statute-book. Assume that the Attorney-General does not wish to go as far as the honourable member for Flinders said he is going by the wording of the B ill , we arrive at the position that we shall be doing a thing that should not be done. 13 is a complete defence for the case now proceeding, I say that such is not desired, and oughfc not to be done. A t first, the clause did not sfcrike me as having the complete retrospective aspect that some lawyers outside the House fchink it has. wrong. He may be going much further in restrospective legislation than he in tends, according to his own contention. Can we risk the Court holding that the view put forward by the honourable member for Flinders is right, and that we have passed legislation which, from the point of view of policy, both sides of the House would condemn? get into Committee to consider what we. are doing. It is a. serious matter. When Courts are giving a meaning to a new provision of an Act the intent of which mav seem to be covered by a previous and still existent section of the measure, such as section 57 in this case, they must hold that it is intended to do something more than the previous section has done. Therefore, they w ill hold that the new provision practically validates any erroneous registration there may have been under section 60. approval of the Registrar. Clause 13 does something quite different. Do you mean that ments put up by some members on this side of the House clause 13 does much more than is intended, and validates for all parties registrations affected. I could point out other considerations that raise serious doubts as to whether this provision w ill nofc be final against any application for fche cancellation of the registration of existing organizations on one of fche grounds mentioned in section 60 of the Act .

360,Mr Hughes,"I shall t r y to explainI t recognises tliose combinations of employees usually called unions. that a union may come within the purview of this Act, it is necessary that it should comply with its requirements. of these is that it must register. The requirements of the Act relating to registration are set out principally in Schedule B, with which I shall deal more particularly when I come to the consideration of clause 13 of the B ill . The position, shortly put, is that no organization can have any benefit, nor can the Act operate in respect of any organization of persons, except they are registered as an organization, or are proclaimed as such. Under section 19, the Court's jurisdiction is limited, so far as industrial disputes are concerned, to the classes that are set out in that section, and all that the amendment does is to say that disputes under paragraph b, which are submitted by plaint, shall not be outside the jurisdiction of the Court merely because some flaw or invalidity is subsequently found in the registration. This amendment is to give the Court cognisance of a dispute, notwithstanding that the registration of the organization concerned may subsequently be found to be invalid, cr/., has been made by mistake, as under paragraph 6 of section 60. no more than that. any way, so far as I can see, affect any pending case. The necessity for the amendment has arisen from the fact that plaints have been filed by organizations whose registrations have been subsequently cancelled, with the result that their plaints have had to be withdrawn from the file, although the deregistration has not been the outcome of any faul t on their part. In such a case an organization loses its place on the list. It has to file a new plaint, and takes its place at the bottom of the list of cases to be heard. This amendment is to enable the organization in such cases fo retain its place-to give the Court cognisance of the dispute in so far as the invalidity or the informality of the act of registration would withdraw it from the cognisance of the Court. General say that there is any intention of give. trying to apply this provision to the case tions with which an organization applynow going on before the Court? apply to that case. It can apply only to an organization that has a plaint. In the tion registered under this Act a certificate of case in question there is no plaint. TheI n order organization has an award. Clearly, whatever may be said of the other two clauses, this is not applicable to that The first case. I come now to clauses 10 and 13. I shall deal, first of all, with clause 13, because the honourable and learned member for Elinders has, in particular, attacked it . I shall endeavour to explain what I conceive to be its meaning and its effect, both on pending cases and generally. Clause 13 cannot be looked at by itself. We must have regard to the whole Act , and in particular to sections 55, 57, and 60. ScheduleB must also be looked at. Clause 13 of the B ill provides thatlivery association which at the commencement of this Act is registered as an association shall be deemed to have been duly registered. There is no ambiguity about the words, but I am asked to apply my mind to their meaning. It is asserted that this amendment of the principal Act is im properly introduced at this stage if it applies to a pending case. That is one criticism. The other is an objection to its application to any case. I shall deal with both. It is said, first of all, that It does this provision ought not to be introI t does not in duced now, because it applies to a pending case. It is urged that, if in any case before the Court, an organization has not been duly registered, and application is made to the Courti n respect of fchat defect, the parties seeking redress will be treated unjustly by this amendment. I have been invited to insert in this B ill a proviso fchat this clause shall not apply to pending cases. Obviously, then, the gravamen of the criticism is directed against what is thought to be the retroactive effect of clause 13 on pending cases. It is alleged that such retrospective effect would be improper, unjust, and most unusual. Let us see, first of all, what effect clause 13 will have. As I have already said, the Court will not hear individuals; ifc will hear only associations or organizations. It will hear an association when it applies to be registered ; it will hear an organization where it files a plaint or Section 57 lays down the condiing for registration must comply. It says thatThe Registrar shall issue to each organiza-",34,William Irvine I Am Not Diswhen They Are Registered Under The A C T

The certificate of the Registrar is conclusive evidence upon two points-(1 ) that the registration itself has been effected, and (2) that the prescribed conditions have been complied with. "" prescribed conditions "" are ""those set out in ScheduleB to tlie Act. I invite honourable members to look at thab schedule. A perusal of it will dispel a number of illusions or delusionsI shall use whichever is the less offensive term-whic h have arisen in connection with this matter. ScheduleB is that every organization, before it is registered, make rules satisfactory to the Registrar, and setting out, amongsb other things, the powers and duties of the Committee and officers, removal of members and officers, control of Committee by members either of the whole or in district meetings, the mode in which industrial agreements shall be made, and so forth. Those conditions must be complied w it h before the Registrar will issue his certificate.

Some of these disclose no real offence on the part of the organization; some, indeed, suggest, as is borne out by an examination of the cases, that the reaThe son for cancellation may arise from the neglect, error, or act of the Registrar, or of the Court itself.

366,Of The In,"Mr HUGHES -Let me first elaboconditions in sub-section b bave been complied with, under clause 13 other things necessary to effectively register the organization also will be deemed to have been done. TJnder section 57 the certificate of the Registrar is conclusive evidence of two things-of the fact of registration and of compliance with sub-section 6. Clause 13 is not conclusive evidence, but is prima facie evidence, which may be rebutted in a proper case. In any event, the clause only goes to the point of saying that the act itself of registration has been effectual, and the clause aims at that and nothing else. NowI come to the effect of clause 13 on section 60 of the Act, and, in particular, on sub-section b. It is contended Oy the honourable member for Angas, and admitted by me, that if the clause affects any part of clause 60, it affects sub-section 6, clearly the weakest of the clause. Upon a fair review of section 60, and in fair interpretation of its meaning, the contention thafc fche effect of clause 13 is to limi t the power of the Courti n this respect is not upheld. says that the act of registration is effectual. been registered, it may have been registered erroneously; and ib is the mere acb and fact of registration that clause 13 validates, and nofc the consequences of erroneous registration. registration be questioned on the ground that persons who are not employees are included in the registration? that question be precluded under the clause ? of registration under section 57 does not cover the whole field. Both section 57 and clause 13 have relation only to the fact of registration, any sense of the word, serve as a defence on any of the counts under section 60; because if clause 13 will apply, then section 57 will apply, and section 57 is a sufficient answer to an application sub-section h. find out to what extent the honourable gentleman is right, and I tentatively put the point before the House. tion, however, is as to the conclusion in regard to sub-section b. Attorney-General put the word "" d u l y "" in clause 13 ? Does not that carry us further than does section 57 ? Until I saw that word, I was inclined to take the same view as the Attorney-General. under clause 13 is exhausted by the mere validation of the act of registration, and it does not in any way act as a defence in an application for cancellation under section 60. I now come to clause 10, which deals with the amendment of section 55 of the principal Act. This clause enables persons not employed in the industry to become members of an association. It has been said that this clause violates the basic principle of arbitration; and in support of this the Jumbunna case was quoted. It is true that in the Jumbunna case it was laid down as the opinion of the Court that a dispute within the meaning of the Act and Constitution could only arise between employer and employee, the dispute being one in respect to contractual relations between employer and employed. That, I admit, was the decision of the Court, but it is wrong to infer that there is any constiClause 13 merely tutional sanction for such a limitation of the powers of this Parliament. When Although an organization has we desire to know the meaning of the words "" arbitration and conciliation "" we have to consider what that meaning was in 1900, when the Constitution received the sanction of the British Parliament, What was the practice of trade unionsin England at that time? I am absolutely amazed at the contention raised here, apparently in good f a it h , that thisWould provision is a violation of the basic principle of arbitration, and that persons not actively engaged in an industry should The certificate not be admitted as members of an organization. Do honourable members not know that the fight of trade unions in Great Britain, from the and would not, in time that those unions toddled from their cradles up to the present, has been to escape the consequences of the in fluence and power exerted by the employers to crush the efforts of working under men to combine ? Every one knows that the steps of infant organizations areI have been trying to followed persistently and relentlessly by many employers, and every man who takes ofiice in such an organization ia My objeceither dismissed or suffers in pocket or status. No fact is better established than Why does the that trade unions have for very many years had for officials men who were not actively engaged in the industry.

372,Mr Hughes,"Neithe r did I . I as officers such persons as they please,bhe honourable member not to discuss any question now before the Court. auy particular case, I am talking about pending cases in general. Let me quote from Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 5th edition, page 348Upon the presumption that the Legislature does not intend what is unjust rests the leaning against giving certain statutes a retrospective operation. The keynote of that is that, where there is an injustice done to anybody, it is presumed that it was not intended by the Legislature that the law should have a retrospective effect. Thafc is sound nractice, and it is one which the English Courts have almost iuvariably followed. Bufc the whole thing turns on the application of thafc principle, and particularly its application to what is known as procedure as opposed to substantive law. On page 366, Maxwell points out the distinction to be drawn between procedure aud substantive law in this regardThe presumption against a retrospective construction has no application to enactments' which affect only the procedure and practice of the Courts, even where the alteration which the statute makes has been disadvantageous to one of the parties. Although to make a law for punishing that which, at the time when it was done, was not punishable, is contrary to sound principle: a law which merely alters the procedure may, with perfect propriety, be made applicable to past as well as future transactions; and no secondary meaning is to be sought for an enactment of_such a kind. No person has a vested right in any course of procedure. He has only the right of prosecution or defence in the manner prescribed for the time being, by or for the Court in which he sues; and if an Aot of Parliament alters that mode of procedure, he has no other right than to proceed according to the altered mode. The remedy does not alter the contract or the tort; it takes away no vested right, for the defaulter can have no vested right in a state of the law which left tbe injured party without, or with only a defective, remedy. If the time for pleading wore shortened, or new powers of amending were given, it would uot be open to the parties to gainsay sueh a change; the only right thus interfered with being that of delaying or defeating justice; a right little worthy of respect. In the case of Kemp v. Wright, Chancery Division, 1895, vol. 1, page 1271, an alteration of the bankruptcy law applied to a society in regard to which an order for dissolution had been given, and it was held that a subsequent amendment after the decision of the lower Court had been given enabled fche Court above to upset that decision. A . L . Smith, Lord Justice, saidMr Justice Kekewick arrived at his conI am not dealing with clusion in this case by holding that a deed of dissolution was equivalent to a winding-up order of this Court. There is no authority to suggest that view; but be this as it may, the matter is not worth discussing, for the point under section 10 of the Building Societies Aot of 1894 is conclusive. I read that section as enacting that after the 25th of August, 1894, no matter what any Court may have said about dissolution or winding-up-fro m .and after that day, when any society is being dissolved or wound up, no advanced member shall be called upon to pay his debt otherwise than according to his contract. Here an amending Statute took away a right existing before the Act. In tbe case of TheK in g v. Cliandra Dhrama, page 335, King's Bench Division, 1905, vol. 2The prisoner was convicted under s. 5, sub-s. (1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1S85, of an oifence committed on July 15, 1904. The prosecution was not commenced until December 27, more than three months, but less than six months, after the commission of the offence. On October 1, the Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act 1904 came into operation, by s. 27 of whioh the time for commencing a prosecution for an offence under s. 5, sub-s. (1) of the earlier Act was extended from three months to six months. It was held that the legislation applied, and the prisoner was tried under the amended law, and was convicted. Then, in Commonwealth Law Reports, V o l . 14, 1912, in the K in g and the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth against the Associated Northern Collieries, it was held that evidence then before the Court, but not available under the law as it stood when the proceedings were instituted, would apply to fchat case, and it was so applied. That, briefly, is my answer to the criticism directed against the measure. The alterations of the law proposed are alterations in procedure: fchey do not take away any rights, they do not prevent the Court from doing justice: they do not l i m it the penalties of any party in any case now proceeding. I see no reason why the Bill should be recommitted. An attempt has been made to show that these amendments have been introduced for the purpose of interfering with fche course of justice, and that they have application to pending cases. All I have to say is that no attempt has been made to show, or if an attempt has been made it has failed, that these amendments are",38,William Irvine I Am Not Diswhen They Are Registered Under The A C T

Clause 13 is, on the face of it , retrospective, and I strongly urge that ously defective, it would be guilty of a the Attorney-General does not answer our contentions when he suggests that it will only bring about a trifling advantage to existing organizations which are irregularly registered. The words "" shall be deemed to have been duly registered "" have a clear and conclusive meaning. The Court must take for granted that everything required by the law in connection with the registratended for by the Government were recogtion has been actually done, therefore making the registration valid. TheA t torney-General unwittingly misled the House when he said that all that the clause means is that a union has been -primd facie registered. If the Attorney General would insert words saying that an organization shall be held by the Court to have been ""-primd facie registered"" he would get r i d of a large amount of the criticism that has been launched against clause 13, because it does not say that the Court shall simply regard an organization as having been "" prima facie registered "" ; on the contrary, it means that the association has absolutely and completely been validly registered. When retrospective legislation is attempted, it is usual and proper to expressly exempt litigation which has been honestly started under the existing law. When a man starts proceedings upon advice given under the existing law, he may go to large expense in preparing his case and presenting it to the Court. All that exfound on page 360pense is involved under the existing law by a man who is engaged in endeavouring to enforce his rights as they exist under the law. His lawyers advise him, not as to prospective legislation, but as to the existing law. He goes to large expense in order to enforce his rights under the existsuch rights."" It is admitted that its ing law, and if it should be held to be proper and usual for Parliament to introof an organization which is now invalid. duce legislation altering those rights under the existing law, a very grave injustice would be done to him. me deal with the matter from a strictly If it is possible for a Government to take advantage of its majority to pass retrospective legislation of this kind, the most serious abuses may occur. I do not suggest that anything of that nature is occurring now; but if , for example, a Liberal Administration were to attempt I approach the matter from that to validate the registration of an employers' organization which was obvigross misuse of power, and I can fancy what my honourable friends opposite would have to say about the matter. An y Government so short-sighted as to take a course of that kind would make a grave mistake. A seat in Parliament might be more or less shaky because of some irregularity, but if the principle now connised, it would be possible for the A d ministration of the day to introduce a B ill to validate the position of a supporter, thus doing an injustice to the opposing candidate and his party. These considerations are not to be ignored. The Attorney-General quoted from Maxwell On the Interpretation of Statutes, a recognised authority, but he could not find in that work any passage justifyin g interference with existing litigation. Parliament has the right to alter procedure at any time; but it must not inflict grave injustice by interfering with the vested interests of thoso who have honestly entered into litigation for the protection of their rights under the existing law. Maxwell does not suggest that there can be any justification for interference with pending law suits, or with vested rights created by them. On the contrary, he says that a law must be made specifically applicable to such rights if it is intended to affect them. This passage is to be In general, when the law is altered pending an action, the rights of the parties are decided according to the law as it existed when the action was begun, unless the new Statute shows a clear intention to vary such rights. TheB ill shows a clear intention "" to vary effect w ill be to validate the registration The Attorney-General, in referring to section 57 of the principal Act, omitted to Let emphasize its vital feature. The section provides that the Begistrar shall issue to each organization registered under the Act a certificate of registration in the prescribed form, which certificate shall, until proof of cancellation, be conclusive evidence of the registration of the organization and of its compliance with the prescribed conditions entitling it to be registered. that the certificate is to be evidence of registration only u n t il proof of cancellation. Section 60, which provides for cancellation, is being deliberately amended. TJnder that section, as it stands, if it appears to the Court, on the application of any organization, or person interested, or of the Registrar, that, for any reasons, the registration of an organization ought to be cancelled, or that an organization has been registered erroneously,or by mistake, the registration may be cancelled. Clause 13 would be a complete answer to proceedings for cancellation under section 60(6) contemplated under section 57. TheB ill , therefore, amends that provision. I believe there are cases in which organizations have been erroneously registered. An organization may be composed of persons who have no right to belong to it , and may be registered erroneously. Although at present such registration could be cancelled, yet from the moment of passing this B ill , cancellation is to be impossible. existing registrations. the amendment is only supplemental to section 57 is to put a wrong construction upon it , because the registration under the principal Act is valid only unti l proof of cancellation, and the B ill prevents canlaw. Under section 55 any of the followcellation by providing that an organization which has been registered, although improperly registered, shall be deemed to be properly registered. An organization which attempts to assert rights given to it by the existing law should not be interfered with in its litigation; its rights should not be affected by legislation of a retrospective character introduced in the midst of legal proceedings. fects in the law? should be careful not to affect existing or pending legislation. If we are careful in that regard no such injustice as I have referred to can accrue from the alteration of the law, because all who are not litigants will be on the same footing. posal to simplif y or to facilitate registration, but against retrospective legislation affecting persons engaged in litigation for the protection of their rights under the existing law. It is specifically provided asked for the amendments? Sir ROBERTBEST I do not know; that may be so. Nevertheless, we should not affect existing litigation. If we do not recognise the rights of litigants, we shall do a grave injustice, and our action may have serious effects in the future. The Attorney-General tells us that what is meant by the B ill is that the registration is to be regarded only as primd facie evidence of due registration. I say, without hesitation, that it does not mean that. If honourable members read the B ill , they w ill see that it means that the registration shall be absolutely valid and incapable of being attacked under section 60 (6). TheB ill , being capable of a f a r graver and more serious construction, the Attorney-General should pay heed to the representations that are being made regarding it , and remove any possible ambiguity. With regard to clause 10, section 55 of the principal Act is amended by it to permit the enrolment in organizations of persons This w ill affect who are not employers or employees in To suggest that the industries with which those organizations are connected.

The amendment refers to the doing of certain things in time of war. What wara littl e war or a big war? Wars are always taking place, and they may be large or small. A small war in one place might only affect us in a minor degree, but the opportunity would be presented for interested parties to say that certain protected articles were affected, and that the Minister ought to take a certain course of action. The place to determine alterations of the Tariff is on the floor of the House, where everybody can be heard, and the evidence for and against determined. under every law we pass, and this is not the way to amend them. I suggest to the honourable member that he should withdraw his amendment. In all probability, he will have an early opportunity of dealing with the matter when the Tariff is before the House. [9.45] I should think that the moving appeal of the Prime Minister ought to have some effect upon the honourable member for Brisbane; but if I were in his place, I should certainly resent the condescension of the right honourable gentle[39]2 In normal times, when man, who has practically told the mover of the amendment tliat he does not know In fact, the Prime Minister says that, in regard to fiscal matters, the honourable member is a simpleton.

We debated very seriously what should be the countervailing duty on the raw material in that case, because of the quantity of sugar that has to be paid for. Iron is the raw material for all sorts of iron manufactures. Does the honourable member propose to let iron come in free ? of 12£ per cent, to 15 per cent, on steel rails, which are the raw material for railways. Are they to come in free ? Mr. Hoskins makes all sorts of angle-iron. Iron is the raw material for many industries. Timber is the raw material for the building of houses.

Are we to allow t i m ber to come in free for the purpose of stimulating house building and giving employment in the building trade, where unemployment is very keen at the present time ?

We cannot take off or put on duties in regard to raw material without affecting many items in the Tariff. We can never tell when a product, the application of brains and the ingenuity of man, is the raw material or the finished product. Hoskins' works, it is a finished product, but when Mr Walker buys it to build his engines at Maryborough, it is his' raw material.

Title agreed to. B ill reported with an amendment; report, by leave, adopted. B ill read a thir d time. General) [10.5] I move That this Bill be now read a second time. As honourable members are aware, a considerable number of private telephone lines have been resumed by the Department, but many of them have not yet been paid for. TheA c t which was passed in 1911 to permit of their resumption provided that when an arrangement could nofc be come to between the Department and the owners of a line, the amount of compensation was to be settled by arbitration under the laws of the Statei n which the line was situated. That system has been found so unsatisfactory that we wish to alter it . A case was submitted to arbitration, Mr Shand, K . C , acting as arbitrator, and a barrister appearing for each party. The arbitrator awarded the sum of £ 6 0 , but he gave no reasons for his decision, so that there was no basis on which to build future settlements, and the costs which the Department had to pay amounted to about £ 3 0 0 , or five times the amount of fche award. Arbitratio n has therefore nofc proved a cheap method, and, as there is about £15,000 worth of property to be resumed, the Department feel justified in asking Parliament to sanction a more efficient method. proposal is that when an agreement cannot be arrived at a Justice of the High Court shall decide the matter. method we shall obtain, in the reasons supporting a decision, a basis on which to found other settlements, and thus, perhaps, avoid litigation. A t any rate, we shall have some statement of principle to guide us. resumed are not worth £ 5 . must pay for them. We must, however, have some cheaper method of arriving at a settlement. -The method of settlement provided in the B ill resembles tbe application of a steam hammer to crack a nut. The legislation of 1911, which it is now proposed to amend, was brought in by the party now in power, which provided for the settlement of disputes by arbitration, in accordance with the laws of the Statei n which each particular line happened to be situated. The method has not proved successful, ifc having cost £300, the Minister tells us, to obtain a settlement of a case in which only £ 6 0 was awarded. The Minister complains that no statement of principles was obtained from the arbitrator which would serve for guidance in other cases; but that was to be expected, because the laws of the States differ, and the arbitration provided for was to be in accordance with six different laws. Many persons are disposed to pass by Courts of justice which are presided over by men who are trained for fche work of deciding questions at issue, and to employ arbitrators who are not so trained, and who often t r y to satisfy both parties by splitting the difference between the amount claimed and the amount offered, thus pleasing no one. By using the Courts we save arbitrators' fees and obtain the services of skilled adjudicators -of men trained to seek and apply settled and definite principles. But why should the disputes which may arise in connection with the purchase of private telephone lines be referred to the Justices of the H i g h Court, whose time is already so f u l l y occupied ? The Lands Acquisition Act lays down certain definite principles of valuation. No doubt it would be more difficult to do that in reThe gard to the resumption of personality all over Australia. Many of the private lines that are being purchased may be By this merely bush telephones. Certainly great latitude must be allowed. In many cases the disputes could be settled locally by a police magistrate or a County Court Judge. every case shall be settled by a reference to a Justice of the H i g h Court.",48,Customs Bill Second Reading

There is no intention on the part of the Minister or tlie Government to embarrass or interfere with the rights of those who have telephones to be acquired by the Government; but there is abundant experience of the difficulty of settling what is an equitable compensation, and arbitration has been discovered to be the most expensive of all means. The Government always have to pay, and tliere is no evidence that an appeal to the H i g h Court would be expensive to either party. be no appeal to a Judge unless tliere is a dispute. an appeal to a magistrate in certain cases? settle nothing, whereas possibly one or two cases before a Judge would settle the whole or a greater part of the claims.

The whole promore than the layman, know about telephones at a house? ing down a principle of payment according to value; and no one will allege that, in dealing with people who have property to be taken over, the Government are in any way harsh. It would be wrong to let the impression go abroad that this is a measure intended to coerce or injure people in regard to rights that we all recognise. I am surthe Government ihave all the information that can be gathered regarding this matter. Two or three years ago important questions arose in Englandi n connection with the purcliase of telephones, and there was one arbitration which lasted about two years, and which resulted in an award of about £11,000 on a claim for £23,000, while the costs were very severe. There, I think, an Act of Parliament distinctly laid down grounds which have to guide arbitrators in the exercise of their discretion; but, in the present instance, it is proposed to ask a Judge to frame the law, and lay down a policy of compensation. I grant it is a great advantage to have rules to guide an arbitrator; but still a High Court Judge may express a wish that Parliament had given some idea as to what its intentions were. This was done in the case of the Lands Acquisition Act, which In any case, there need prescribed three categories. These, by the way, are not adequate, and great hardship is done, because people do not W h y not provide for know whether they can claim compensation under the terms of the „ Act, and dare not go to Court in case they are crushed by the costs and loss of time, possibly of interest. I do not accuse the Department of any wrong: but, without guidance as to the basis of claim, a man going to Court may be mulct in heavy costs.
