Johnson) I have received fro m the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) a letter notifying his intention to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, ""The Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, and the recent decision of the High Court in connection therewith."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, . Question proposed. The decision recently given by the High Courti n regard to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration is momentous and far-reaching in its effect upon the industrial peace of Australia, and, if the present position is allowed to continue, nothing b u t ' industrial chaos can result. I take this action to-day 'because of the seriousness of the position. Some twelve months ago I had occasion to draw the attention of honourable members to a campaign which was then strongly in .progress to get r i d of the Arbritration Court and, particularly, Mr Justice Higgins. We are well aware that on the Government side are many honourable members who, if not pledged to the abolition of the Arbitration Court, are, at any rate, strongly antagonistic to the President of that tribunal. They are prepared to do anything whicli will result in ridding the country of tliat Court and its President. Whether that is the attitude of the Government I do not know, but one Minister has stated plainly and bluntly that it is his intention to contract himself outside the scope Of the Court. Acting Minister for the Navy( Mr. Poynton) to say whether that is so or not, understood to have stated that intention. There appears to be a growing inclination on the part of the Government to remove as much as possible of the Commonwealth Public Service fro m the jurisdiction of the Federal Arbitration Court. I desire from the Government a statement of whether it ia their intention to adopt (Formal). fchat policy, and whether they support the Acting Minister for the Navy in his announced intention of contracting himself out of the Court's jurisdiction. Immediately after the gazettal of the award dealing with the station hands indignation meetings were held throughout the Commonwealth by the organizations representative of the pastoralists, farmers, and settlers, and I do not suppose there is on either side a country member who did not receive a request that he should take active steps to get r i d of the Arbitration Court and Mr Justice Higgins. I am loth to interrupt the honourable member, but it is plain that he is travelling far beyond the definite matter . to which he referred in his notification to you, Mr Speaker. I understood that he intended to discuss only the recent decision of the H i g h Courti n regard to the Journalists case. I suggest that in discussing the future of arbitration he is opening up an extended field for debate, and is out of order, and that he should confine his remarks to the definite matter referred fco in his notice, as the best means of focussing attention on the matter which he wishes to discuss. Johnson) I ask honourable members if they find it necessary to converse while another honourable member is addressing the House to do so in such tones as will not disturb either the honourable member who is speaking or those who wish to listen to him. In regard to the point of order, I find, on perusing the terms of the notice which the honourable member for Darling sent to me, that his motion is for the purpose of discussing "" the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and the recent decision of the High Courti n connection therewith."" It seems to me that the terms of the motion do not absolutely l i m it the honourable member solely to the discussion of the recent decision of the H i gh Court; but he will not be in order in discussing arbitration and conciliation generally. by the High Court on Friday last has been universally welcomed by the employers' organizations, especially the pastoral organization.

No doubt, the,honourable member has seen that statement, as attributed to him by the Age, and he has not contradicted it . barrister-at-law, and a leading authority on Commonwealth arbitration matters, in referring to the High Court judgment with awards, has saidThe effect of the judgment is, in my opinion, not to invalidate the awards of bhe Commonwealth Arbitration Courts; only to make it . necessary for the Federal Parliament to vest tlio duty of enforcing those awards in other Federal Courts-that is, either the High Court or State Counts vested with Federal jurisdiction, or inferior Federal Courts. . Mr P. A . Russell, barrister-at-law, and also an authority on arbitration matters, has said1 am disposed to agree that an amending Act could give authority to enforce awards iii special or inferior Commonwoalth Courts, or confer the necessary powers upon existing State Courts. We are perfectly sure that this Parliament has the power to immediately create a Court-o r to give to the H i g h Court the power-to enforce the awards of the Conciliation Either that should be done, or Mr Justice Higgins should at once be appointed for life, and the necessary power Until the honorgiven to him. The position is clearly before the Government, and we wish to know whether they are prepared to avert I have never been a national calamity in Australia by granting what is desired. ing, but I do not desire to see industrial chaos in Australia. During my short life, I have seen quite enough' of strikes to cause me not to desire any recurrence of them. I wish the Government to take action immediately to safeguard the interests of Australia by To return to the creating a Court where employees can have their awards enforced. W ill the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr. Jowett) stand behind me in that demand? I trust that the Government will bake early steps to clear up the industrial situation in this regard. There are pendcases in which employers have refused to pay the wages provided for in the awards of the Arbitratio n Court. That Court has power to make awards, but it has no power to compel employers to observe them. We do not wish to have to go to Courts presided over by stipendiary or police magistrates to secure the enforcement of awards about which they know nothing. Imagine having to go before a Police Courti n Sydney Mr Bavin, where nothing is known of the industries to which these awards relate, or of the merits of the case. Isi t not better that the employees should be able, in each respect to Arbitratio n Court instance, to go to the Judge who has made the award ? Honourable members, if they give this matter a moment's consideration, will recognise the disadvantage under which employees would labour if they were compelled to go to these in ferior Courts for relief. We object to go to them, and for the reason that we believe that, unless relief is granted, strikes will immediately take place, and that Australia will be plunced into industrial chaos, we ask the Government 'to take action in the direction I have in dicated .

93,Mr Tudor (Yarra) [3.50],"I amcarefully the judgments of the H i g h Court bench as reported in that newspaper. country of "" yes-no "" decisions; that of the H i g h Court is certainly one. first question which the f u l l bench was asked to answer wasIs the Constitution of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration beyond the powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and in particular. as to (a) the arbitral provision, (&) the enforcing provisions? To that question the answer was (a) No ; (b) Yes. The second question wasIs the award invalid by reason of the appointment of the President for seven years only? To which question the answer was "" No."" The third question wasIs the award enforceable by the said Court? To that, also, the answer was "" No . "" Therefore, apparently,, the Court can sit and hear evidence and make an award, but has no power to enforce that award. The Chief Justice said that the Arbitration Courtwas invested with ample"" and complete jurisdiction to declare and enforce the mutual obligations of the parties. The exercise of the power to impose penalties was admittedly an exercise of the judicial power. If the Court had not the power to impose penalties, then that power would be non-existent elsewhere. If the Arbitration Court had not the power to enforce its awards, no other Court could do so. Mr Justice Barton's opinion was thatThe power of adjudication was combined with the power of enforcement. Mr Justice Isaacs read the judgment of himself and Mr Justice Kich. occurs this passageOnce an award was made the dispute was settled, and the arbitral function was at an end. Enforcement by a Court was an entirely separate matter. They thereforeheld that the arbitral provisions of the Court were within the Constitution, that the enforcing provisions' were beyond it, that the award was not invalid by reason of the appointment of the President for seven years, but that it was not enforceable by the Court. Mr Justice Higgins, the President of the Arbitration Court, said that he consideredthat the' award was not invalidated by reason of the term of the appointment of the President, and was enforceable by the. Court. He also thought that the awards "" should -be enforced by Courts of summary jurisdiction."" Mr JusticeD u f f y , too, "" held that the question should be answered on We have heard before in this investigation of section 72 of the Constitution."" He gave the same answers to the The questions as Mr Justice Higgins. Mr. Justice Powers said thatTbe awards could be enforced in the State Courts, and Parliament could give power of enforcement to the High Court. If Parliamentgave ""Ehat authority, fhe President, or Deputy President could, as a High Court Justice, enforce the awards. As I read the judgments, the Chief Justice and Justices Barton, Higgins, and Duffy think that the Court has complete power to enforce its awards. If the Acting Attorney-General( Mr Groom) finds that the Court has not that power, and that the power can be given to it by an amending Act , the law should be amended so as to leave our arbitration jurisdiction where it was believed to be. We have been told that during the war no action should be taken by the workers to alter the position. Of course, that advice was not offered to the doctors who were on strike. If it should be found that the workers are in a different position in regard to arbitration from that in which it was thought thafc they were, the Government should put matters right. If the workers ought not to t r y to change matters during the war, the employers should not do so by an appeal to the High Court. I ask the Acting Attorney-General whether many of the awards have been enforced by the Arbitration Court itself, or whether their enforcement has been l e f t to other Courts. I have no faith in some of the local Courtsi n matters of arbitration. InI n it saying ""this, I do not reflect on the honour or_ integrity of our justices of the peace in general, but they would be naturally biased in respect to some arbitration matters. While not interested in a case directly before them, their friends, if they were employers of labour, might be interested, and their t u r n might come next day or next week. The Victorian Government have decided not to allow a Wages Board to sitfcodeal wifch matters which arise from time to time. They have said fchafc no trade or calling that has appealed to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court shall be allowed to appeal to a Wages Board. That decision affects the employees of the leather industry, who have obtained an award from that Court, but new businesses have come, into existence since the award was obtained, to which it does not apply, because those concerned in those businesses were not named as parties, and an award applies only to the parties to the case before the Court. We, on this side, were desirous of giving the Court power to make a common rule which should apply to the whole industry in which a dispute arose. We all wish to see the multiplication and extension of businesses, but it will be wrong if arbitration awards are not made to apply to all whom they properly concern. If the decision of the H i g h Court that the A r b i he cannot enforce penalties himself, tration Court cannot enforce its awards is to stand, what is the alternative? In this chamber, and out of it , I have advocated arbitration as opposed to direct action. are the best. I favoured Wages Boards when there was no opportunity of getting an Arbitration Court, but there are objections to the. Wages Board system. In many cases an employee has jeopardized his position by sitting opposite his employer on a Wages Board. Many employees have been dismissed for their action in regard to Wages tfoards. I gave several instances on one occasion when an Arbitration B i ll was being discussed in this chamber. As a believer in arbitration, I say that the Government should declare, if bhe Arbitration Act has been weakened, that both employers and employees will be put again in exactly the same position as they occupied before the H i gh Court gave its decision. It is the duty of the Government, if it has the constitutional power, to repair the damage to the A r b i tration Court which I conceive to have been done by. the decision of the H i gh Court, and to give the Arbitration Court all the powers that it was believed to have before its validity was questioned. I should not have risen but for the direct attack that has been made on the Pastoralists Union, with which, although I am not connected with it now, I have been intimately connected in the past. It-is not true that the-Pastoralists Union has tried in any way to break down the Arbitration Court. The honourable member for Darwin( Mr Spence), when president of the Australian Workers Union, advocated arbitration; and after we had had a taste of it , we managed to carry on our industry with great success. However much credit we may give to the President of the Court, there is undoubtedly the feeling that he is not altogether unbiased. Johnson) -The honourable member is not in order. any sentiments of opposition to that Justice; I have never yet done so, and I do not intend to do so now. But if the position is that it w ill , instead of creating industrial unrest, bring peace and satisfaction into the pastoral world. On one occasion, when I appeared before Mr JusticeH i ggins, he alluded to the unhappy mess I never did. Strikes that we had made in framing the rules that we had to work under; but his own rules were so bad that we had to go to him for an interpretation of them, and he had to alter them to make them in telligible. The pastoral industry is a very large one, and it is difficult in some instances to' say what new awards mean. We are not allowed to put in a contra account against the men. Pastoralists have been fined heavily for merely technical breaches of the law. Mr Edolls was fined Â£ 1 0 0 ; Mr Kelly, Â£ 5 0 ; MrW h it t y , Â£ 2 0 ; the Eureka Estate, Â£ 5 0 ; and the Gurley Estate, Â£ 5 0 ; for mere technical breaches of the law; and Mr Justice Higgins has said that he could fine up to Â£1,000 for such breaches. fined as much as Â£1,000 for a technical breach of an award, I do not know what the honourable member would do to him if he committed a more serious offence. I believe that the Arbitratio n Act can continue; and that redress for any breaches of awards can be found. I am also of opinion that it would be in the best interests of industrial peace, in the pastoral industry, at any rate, if Mr Justice Higgins were allowed to not only make the awards, but to also mete out the punishment to any offender. The Acting Prime Minister appeared to argue that in the majority of arbitration laws the arbitral functions are distinct and apart from the responsibility for, or bhe power of, enforcing awards. But the honourable gentleman was dealing largely with Wages Boards proceedings. In New",27,Adjournment Commonwealth Court Of Conciliation

101,Mr Considine (Barrier ) [4.6],"South Wales there is a system of Wages Boards similar to that in Victoria, but there is also an Industrial Court to which appeal may be made from the decisions of the Boards. In these matters the In dustrial Court is supreme. Similarly, the Pederal Arbitration Court hitherto has had power to enforce its awards. In my opinion, the antagonism of many honourable members on the Government benches, and a large section of the outside public, is not so much to the Arbitration Court as to the gentleman who at present presides over it . Certain honourable members have been loud in their denunciations of Mr Justice Higgins; and, as the honourable member for Darling mentioned, the President of the Federal Arbitration Court has been attacked by no less a personage than the Prime Minister pf the Commonwealth. We have also heard honourable members inquiring as to the duration of Mr Justice Higgins' appointment, and as to whether any action was being taken by the Government in regard to the renewal thereof. The whole of the criticism of honourable members opposite who against the President of the Court. The Leader of the Opposition has stated that he favours arbitration. I do not agree with my leader upon that point, because my opinion is that there is nothing to arbitrate about. established an Arbitration Court, and the workers are lucky in having as its first President a gentleman of such high character as Mr Justice Higgins, who, according to his idea of justice, has endeavoured to mete out fair play to the workers. member not to discuss the Judge. given by Mr Justice Higginsi n the past have given rise to a 'considerable amount of comment. Now, by a decision of the High Court, his powers in regard to the enforcement of awards have been limited, and it is proposed that some other Judge or magistrate shall deal with breaches of awards. The experience of the workers has been that in the majority of cases they get anything but justice from those gentlemen. In'regard to the present state of affairs, it seems to me that we are approaching the lamentable conditions that exist in the United States. eight-hour law was passed in that country, an appeal was made to the H i g h Court of the United States, and the law was found tb be unconstitutional. Now, in Australia, when the workers succeed in gaining benefits of any value from the Arbitration Court, questions as to the constitutionality of the Court and its actions are raised. It is noticeable that a lot of American methods are being introduced into the industrial affairs of this country. Workers of the World, for instance. often suspect that honourable members opposite know a good deal more about the Industrial Workers of the World than we know. There is a growing tendency on the part of the employing classes to question the judgments delivered by the Arbitration-Court when such judgments confer benefits on the workers. They are following the policy adopted in the United States of appealing to the High Court upon questions of constitutionality. Not believing that an Arbitration Court can be of any lasting benefit to the working classes, I am not much perturbed by such actions; but I know that there are certain sections who are not yet able to have spoken has been directed help themselves, and that it is necessary for them to approach the Arbitration Court. It is an open secret that a committee of employers has been drafting a new Arbitration B ill which will safeguard the interests 'of their class. TheB u t Parliament' has Acting Prime Minister has stated that the Government had briefed some of the leading lawyers in order to safeguard the Arbitration Act. peared in Court as representatives of the Commonwealth to sustain the provisions of the existing law. counsel. gentleman did not state in what manner counsel had distinguished themselves. In my opinion, one of their particular distinctions has been an attempt to extinguish the Arbitration Court. If, whenever the workers succeed, after spending thousands of pounds, in getting a satisfactory award from the Arbitration Court, duly created by the representatives of the people, they are to be dragged before the High Courti n order to have the award declared unconstitutional, honourable members will need to be very careWhen the f u l unless they wish to precipitate f u r ther,, industrial trouble.

[4.17] -Thousands of my constituents are members of unions registered under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and I believe that the majority of them claim to have received benefits from arbitration. I have always differed from them on that point. When the Arbitration Act was placed on the Labour platform, seventeen years ago, I objected to it ; I still object. I believe in the good old-fashioned strike-no t the general stiike, b u t sectional strikes whicb the workers can win. I , personally, shall welcome any juggling on the part of the present Government in order to bring the Arbitration Act into discredit, so that we may get back to the sectional strikes as the only real way of fighting the employers What the worker has received from the Arbitration Court has not been in his true interest, in spite of what the employers say to the contrary. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Falkiner) admits that he is willing to work under the Arbitration Act, but knowing that his willingness to do so could not possibly be in the interests of the workers, his statement merely fortifies me in my attitude towards the Act. However, as the workers have accepted the measure, I am prepared to work under it, but I have always contended that no section of unionists is entitled to be registered under the Act and accept its benefits and at the same time claim the right to. strike. always placed before those men who have sent me to this Chamber is that if the workers are prepared to submit to arbitration they must give up the right to strike. I have always condemned unionists who are registered under the A r b i tration Act who go on strike. playing the game. it is not playing the game for the Government or the employers to say that they want to work under an Act which is useful to one section only. evidently what is now attempted, because there has been no denial to the statement made by the Assistant Minister for the Navy( Mr Poynton), as reported in the press, that so far as shipbuilding is concerned the Government intend to contract themselves out of the Arbitration Court. I asked in the House whether the statement as reported was correct or not, and the Minister refused to answer the question. ' member to give notice of it .

It simply shows that the employers have not been dealing fairly with their employees, and that it was necessary to invoke the assistance of Che Court to compel them to do justice to them. I hope that honourable members opposite, who attack the Court and its President, do not object to the employees securing a fair deal. It would be easy to establish the point that their objections to the Court and the President arise from They have, however, a detheir objections to the awards They think that the President has given the The honourable member for workers too much. Do they think that the workers are getting too much, and that the President is biased in their favour? They are not prepared to say that, although they suggest it by all kinds of innuendoes against the President of the Court. Since the High Court has declared that the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court has no power to enforce his own awards-that the Court The recent decision"" of the has no power to enforce awards made by it-thi s tribunal has been stripped to a large degree of its usefulness. I am one I venture to suggest that if of those who entirely favour the principle of conciliation and arbitration. I believe it should be applied not only to industrial, but to international, disputes. The whole world is fast coming round to that view. What, however, would be the position if an international Court of Arbitration had power to make an award, but no*power to enforce it? The whole world just now is discussing the question of a league of nations to establish that very principle, so as to avoid resort to",33,Adjournment Commonwealth Court Of Conciliation

135,Mr Pinlayson,"The honorablewar as a means of settling international disputes. Buti f that league of nations is to be' placed in the same position that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court has been-if it is to havo power to consider a case, and to arrive at a verdict, but no power to enforce its decisions, the whole scheme must collapse. In such circumstances the purpose and effect of a league of nations would be absolutely futile. I venture to suggest, therefore, that the Government must consider this question, not merely as a passing phase of industrialism, but as an urgent matter demanding immediate and serious attention. I hope that, for the safety of industrial affairs in Australia, for the sake of the peaceful development of the Commonwealth, and in order to avoid the industrial chaos to which the honourable member for Darling( Mr have some of the originators and f ramers Blakeley) has referred, and which seems to be apparent, the Government will take this matter into their early consideration. We all desire peace in Australia. We desire that it ""shall have peace in its development, and peace amongst its people; that they shall all work together for the one end, and be, in fact, one people with one destiny. And can any one suggest a better plan-is there anything better than a. Conciliation and Arbitration Court clothed with the fullest possible power to preserve peace in our industrial operations ? there was one thing, more than another that brought me into the Eederal Parliament at its inception, it was the desire to secure the application of the principle of conciliation and arbitration to the industrial affairs of the whole Commonwealth. I looked forward to the realization of one of the dreams of the leaders of the Labour movement in Queensland in those days-the complete abolition of strikes. Some honourable members have been'through a strike. I have passed through two, and I hope I shall never see again what I witnessed in connection with those two industrial upheavals. starving and women wanting food. The women, however, were better unionists than the men proved to be in the two strikes in which I was involved.' The Commonwealth Constitution provides unmistakably that the Parliament Shall have power to make laws with respect to conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. arguments in support of Federation. strongest arguments used in the western portion of Queensland in support of Federation. There we had passed through a couple, of strikes, and their effect had been such lhat the workers were prepared to go to any lengths to prevent any recurrence of the conditions which prevailed in connection with those strikes. If the section in the Constitution means anything, it means that we have the power to enforce the laws made under it. Yet we of the Constitution, including the Chief Justice( Sir Samuel Griffith), Sir Edmund Barton, and others, as High Oourt Judges, declaring that we have not the power we all thought we had under that Constitution. It is just as though we were presented with a gun of the largest calibre to use against those who were opposed to the arbitral powers of the Constitution, but ordered not to load it ; in short, that while we may arbitrate and conciliate, we have no power to enforce the decisions of the Court. In my peregrinations throughout Australia. I have come across good employers, and also some of the very worse. After the Queensland strike of 1S91 the pastoralists, not. content with beating the men to their knees, desired the ""State Government to deport the leaders from Australia, and, further, they blacklisted, every man who stood up for a living wage for his fellow-workers. As a matter of fact, I reckon that the pastoralists of Queensland owe me a lot of money, seeing that jobs for which they then paid me 12s. 6d. they have now to pay 30s. However, as in the case of the Arbitration Act, although I could send them in a bill, I have no power to enforce the demand. I saw children practically The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), in his manifesto tq the people'of Australia, said, that if his Government were returned to power the unionists and workers of the country might rest assured that none of the arbitration or industrial legislation would be interfered with or altered during",34,Adjournment Commonwealth Court Of Conciliation

If the above be correct, will the Acting Prime Minister request the Cabinet, to consider whether the Government should insure every Australian private and officer for, say, half the above amount at the same rates of premium? orable member's questions are1. Information has now been obtained from the United States .Government regarding its naval and military insurance scheme, and the particulars mentioned by the honourable member are substantially correct. 2. The Aot of Congress authorizing the creation of the insurance scheme was approved on Oth October, 1917. It provides that the time within which persons in the United States Military and Naval Service may apply for Government insurance is 120 days after entry to service. To meet the case of persons who had entered the service prior to the passing of the Act, a. further provision was made by which persons on active service on and after 6th April, 1917, were automatically insured by the Government until 12th February, 1918, unless they had applied for insurance to take effect at an earlier date. 3. The Parliament of the Commonwealth has provided a War Pensions Act and a Repatriation Aet, which are another form of insurance of the soldier and his dependants in case of death or incapacity.

With the appliances which he intends to erect, the cost will be reduced to 28.77s. Do the figures refer to the cost of coal delivered in Melbourne? At Newcastle the coal costs only 15s. per ton f.o.b. The reply is as follows:On the 27th September the honourable member for Hunter asked me a question in.regard to a statement which appeared dn the Argus, wherein the Controller of Shipping was reported to have said that there were 277,460 tons of coal in Victoria, and that the present cost of the coal was 35.46s., and that, with the appliances which he intended to erect, the cost would be reduced to 28.77s. I have since been advised by the Controller of Shipping that he made no such statement. Thc honourable member has apparently confused the figures, which, instead of being shillings, are pence, and evidently refer to the cost of handling, and not to the cost of the coal. Tlie remarks in the press relate to figures supplied by the Melbourne Harbor Trust, and not by the Controller of Shipping. fche honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) askedCan a statement be furnished, without undue labour and expense, showing the total number of temporary clerical employees in the service of the Conunonwealth as on the 30th June, 1918?

This arrangement was arrived at by a conference, convened by the Ministerf or Repatriation, between representatives of the Chambers of Manufactures and the Trades Halls of the various States, to consider the conditions under which injured soldiers could be trained in industries to which their incapacity offers no bar, or a temporary one only. Under this arrangement, returned soldiers may now, subject to the approval of the Department of Repatriation, enter industrial establishments for training in the proportion of one to six of the fully-paid journeymen continuously employed at the trade in the establishment concerned. The Department of Repatriation guarantees that the minimum wage w ill be paid to a l l trainees. The trainee's efficiency is re-assessed at regular intervals by a district committee, consisting of a chairman appointed by the Minister, two representatives of the employers in the trade of the trainee, and two representatives of the union covering the trade or calling concerned, and the employer pays on thiff assessment. In case of thc absence of a trainee from duty, if an employer decides not to pay his own contribution, that of the Department of Repatriation also stops.

Subsequently Mr Giles exonerated the Wheat Board from responsibility for failure to secure the alleged freight, but stated that a definite offer of 1,000,000 tons at 75s. per ton. had been refused.

As the views of the constituencies differ widely on various questions -ther e is, for instance, often a difference onmany questions between city and country constituencies-the views to On Friday last the which utterance is given in Parliament also differ widely. B ut hitherto a member has been at liberty to express any view which he desires to make public. Should the motion be carried, this liberty of speech w ill be taken away, and some members will be prevented from stating their own convictions and the opinions of their constituents. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) strongly by the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best). The constituencies which these gentlemen represent differ widely in character and in their political views j b u t it seemed to me to be in bad taste for the honourable member for Kooyong, remembering what his opinions are upon a certain question, to reply to the honourable member for Batman as he d i d . One objection I have to the motion is that it provides for the censoring of parliamentary speeches by the Law Officers of the Crown. I have nothing against these gentlemen personally, but I hold the opinion that a -legal man is the most incompetent person that could be chosen to act as a parliamentary censor.

166,Mr West (East Sydney) [5.13],"opposed to anything that seems to him new. Again, the motion places Mr in either past or prospective circumSpeaker in an invidious position, because it compels him to order the elimination from a speech of any passage which the Law Officers of the Crown may think should be eliminated. I look upon the motion as an insult to this Parliament. It will go forth to the Empire that in Australia the representatives of the people are not thought fit to be allowed to give free expression to their opinions, and their speeches have to be submitted to the Law Officers of the Crown in order that passages considered out of accord with the sentiments of the electors may be struck out. We boast of our Democracy, and yet it is proposed that the Crown Law officers shall say what in our speeches is"" to be published. There was a long Caucus meeting of Ministerialists just before the resumption of our sittings, and I feel confident that many of them were not in favour of this proposal. But they have to remain dumb dogs; they cannot bark now. How are public questions to be dealt with if the views of members are not to be permitted free expression ? No Opposition has been more loyal to the Presiding Officers, although these were chosen by its opponents, than the present Opposition, which has unquestionably complied with every decision of the Chair as to what was or was not within the rules .of debate. No Opposition has ever been more ready to help the Government in the conduct of public business. If there must be some tribunal to decide what shall, and what shall not, appear in Hansard, it ought to be, not the Crown Law Department, but men who, by reason of their parliamentary knowledge and experience, can judge fairly"" what remarks ought to be censored. Every honourable member who votes for this motion will regret it some day. The representatives of the people above all others should have the fullest opportunity of expressing their thoughts. Without that liberty what is Parliament? Already under existing powers some speeches in Parliament have been censored, and in some cases rightly so. Therefore, there is no necessity for this motion. Whenever any measure or proposal is brought before Parliament, the Minister introducing it states the reasons for so doing, but the Minister who introduced this motion did not say one word or quote one concrete case in justification of it . When Parliament is asked to take [238] action there should be some justification stances. No honourable member who is anxious to preserve the rights and privileges of Parliament can vote for a motion of this character. If the Government could convince me that such power as they are seeking is necessary, I might be induced to concede it, but not to the Crown Law officers. The Speaker even now has power to remove from Hansard anything which, in his opinion, should uot appear. Ori t is competent for the Staff to represent to Mr Speaker that certain matters should not be published, and Mr Speaker can then submit the matter to the House. In this way Parliament would retain control of its own affairs. I guarantee that not one member of the British Parliament would give to an outside t authority power to censor parliamentary debates. Certainly, men.'like the late Charles Cameron Kingston would have availed . themselves of every Opportunity provided by the usage of Parliament to resist a motion of this character. What is the value of an Opposition unless it has power to criticise the aetions of the Government? Do we not know that things are being done to-day by the Government, which, but for the war, the Opposition would not permit to be done? Is the object of this motion to prevent us from criticising the Government's expenditure proposals, or the flagrant injustices they are allowing to be perpetrated on some of our soldiers ? What is the object of the motion if it is not to stifle the voices of honourable members on this side? It cannot be directed against the Ministerial supporters, because they are silent; they have not the courage to criticise the Government, and but for the speeches of Opposition members, Hansard would be a very small production. Honourable . members' opposite follow behind the Government as a lap dog follows a lady. There is some ulterior motive behind this proposal. There aTe very few statesmen amongst the Ministerialists, but there are a few politicians, and politicians always keep their minds on the next election. It appears to me that one of the objects of the motion is to enable the National party at the next election to bring a charge of disloyalty against any lionorable member who, in his desire to preserve the privileges of Parliament, and to see justice done to the people, votes against the Government's proposal. No honourable member w ill submit to the whip, and if injustices are perpetrated, this motion will not prevent us from exposing our view of . such things. Nobody is less acquainted w it h functions and privileges of Parliament than are the officers of the Crown Law Department, and we shall be placing Mr Speaker in a humiliating position if we give to those officers the power to direct him to have removed from Hansard any portion of an honourable member's remarks. publication of a particular utterance or passage is wise or unwise must always be a matter of opinion. One member of the Ministerial party told me that one of the objects of this motion, as explained at enable Ministerialists at the next election to bring a . charge of disloyalty against those who opposed it . Honourable members ought to know what statements are to be erased from Hansard. I have noticed in the press a report of a meeting held at Eaglehawk in connection with the price of meat, at which it was said that it was not possible for the Government to interfere with the pastoral industry, because of the getting was perfectly true; the Government dare not do anything to offend the pastoral interests who are so much behind them; but if I made it in this chamber it would be struck out of my speech because it would be considered to be detrimental to the conduct of the war. The Law Officers might consider it to be detrimental to recruiting. must act in accordance w it h the wishes of the Government of the day. No cord a vote which will deprive of fied that the Government in a party motion, otherwise they would have advanced some valid reason for it. it has been brought forward with a view to testing the feeling of honourable bers of the Opposition in regard to another motion, which has for its purpose the curtailment of the time to be allowed .for debate. been framed with the object of giving every honourable member a fair tunity of being heard; bnt the Government propose to curtail that and by the motion now under consideraMr West. tion they seek to take the control of Hansard from the House and Mr. Speaker, with whom it has rested since the establishment of Federation. This the is the first occasion on which any step has been taken to detract from that privilege, and no valid reason has been advanced for it . Of course, every Government likes to rush its measures through; but there should be a l i m it to the means of giving effect to that desire. An honest Government does not fear criticism. No GovernWhether ment is perfect, and no Government B ill is perfect. There is no measure which is so much in the interests of the people as that which has been subjected to criticism by an Opposition. It is only when a B ill is subjected to fair criticism that the party meeting, was to. anomalies can be discovered in it . It is only by the criticism of Bills that a Government's want of capacity can be determined.

There are times when plain speaking is necessary, and when, for the protection of the people, an honourable member must give free expression to his views. If this motion, which springs from ' narrowmindedness, be carried, however, that will be no longer possible. Wheni t goes for t h to the Empire that such a motion as this has been tabled here, very little will be thought of the National Parliament of Australia. People will come to the conclusion that the minds of those in authority are very small, and that their conception of their responsibility shows them to be unfit to hold office. I am, quite satisfied that when I vote against this motion I shall only be doing my duty to myself arid my constituents. The Government have no right to cast this reflection on the Opposition, simply because criticism is offered of the present Administration. The safety of any country depends largely on the presence of a strict and stern Opposition in the Parliament. soring of the honourable member's speeches. action being taken by the Crown Law authorities in regard to my speeches, and I am satisfied the same may be said of a number of honourable members on this side. I do not objectto the motion because of any fear that I shall make statements likely to endanger the Empire. God forbid that I should, for I would rather be turned out of Parliament at once if I thought there was any fear of such a thing. My honest opinion is that when the Government decided to table this motion they had not given it the consideraMr Deakin, Mr Fisher, tion it required. If I have failed to convince my colleagues, and honourable members generally, of the danger of a motion of the kind, the only effect of which can be to rob Parliament of its privileges, it is because my language is not equal to the occasion.

Further, it will engender feelings in the community Are that ought not to exist, and it ought to meet with the direct opposition of every Cannot member of the National Parliament. of the gravest reasons for opposing the motion is that the Government have made out no case for such a serious interference with the traditional rights of a British Parliament. It seeks to interfere with the privileges of Parliament, which have always been recognised as the greatest bulwark of British nationality. The difference between a British community and most other communities lies in the fact that we . have self-government, and we pride ourselves on the fact that the people, through their elected representatives, can give expression to their desires and aspirations. The British parliamentary institution is founded on the fact that the common people have the right to elect their men to Parliament to decree the laws by which the country shall be governed; and that this may be given effect to in a proper and logical way, it has always been laid down by the mother of Parliaments, the British House of Commons, that an elected member shall have the f u l l right and privilege to say that which he desires on behalf of those whoelect him.

Britain to obtain the present system of government has come down through the ages, and the freedom at present enjoyed, which has been bought with the life-blood of many hundreds of brave reformers and pioneers, has been handed to us as a sacred trust, and we must ever defend the right of the people to govern themselves in the way they decide. It is the duty in any Parliament of a British community to see that that trust is observed at the very base of the British parliamentary system. all British communities to give free expression to public opinion in Parliament. If there were not this freedom of speech, we should not be able to have that free discussion which gives the correct reflex of the minds of members. Under the motion, if a member rises in Parliament, and expresses certain views which may displease, not Parliament-and this is the most dangerous feature-bu t some officer in the Crown Law Department, his speech may be censored; because some Crown Law official, who is a servant of the Government of the day, does not approve of the remarks of some honourable member, the attention of Mr Speaker may be directed to them as imperilling the safety of the Commonwealth, as calculated to prejudice His Majesty's relations w i th foreign Powers, and to interfere w it h that I , in the House, point out that it is the successful prosecution of the war. Such wide interpretation can be placed on these conditions that, especially in a time of war, almost anything that a member may say could be construed into a breach of one or other of them. The Leader of the Government has already publicly stated that the safety of not only the Commonwealth, but of the Empire and the Allies, depends upon the introduction of conscription; the Government have clearly indicated, that in their opinion, if conscription is not made the law of this land, there is danger of the Empire tottering down around us. If it be the 1 intention of the Government to introduce conscription during this session, the motion presents one of the greatest means by which they can carry it without discussion.

We are back in the dark ages when to speak one's mind was a crime, and when the reward of the reformer, or any one who was opposed to the powers of the day, or who stood for progress, was the dungeon or the gallows. This proposal strikes at the very root of our system of parliamentary government, and, in all seriousness, I ask honourable members to pause and consider carefully before they attempt to interfere with the traditional rights of Parliament. The Government say that it is necessary to prevent the publication of seditious utterances. I am prepared to agree that disloyal utterances should not be allowed to go broadcast while the country is at war, but the Government's motion reminds one very forcibly of the story of the Chinaman who burnt down his house in order to roast a pig. The censoring of dangerous utterances in Parliament can be easily and simply dealt with by the House it-' self. If we are not careful of what we are doing, the people will become disgusted with the parliamentary system; they will say that no longer is the system"" of any use Nothing could be more farcical than the to them, and we may find ourselves in the position of many European peoples who have no parliamentary system or constitutional methods of bringing about reform. Such people are forced to adopt other methods to obtain that which they believe to be in the interests of their country. The Government might well Teconsider these proposals, in order to discover if some other way cannot be found to deal with disloyalty, if such a thing exists in this House. If it does exist, surely the House is capable of coping with it without allowing outside interference with the traditional rights of Parliament. Not one speaker has mentioned an instance of disloyal utterances by any honourable member in this House. Before the Government can justify the carrying of this motion, they must show that disloyalty does exist, that honourable members are engaged in promulgating seditious ideals, and are expressing opinions that will undermine the stability of the Empire and imperil the safety of the Commonwealth. The Government have utterly failed to do will calmly reflect upon this proposal, bearing in mind the history of the achievements under the British parliamentary system, they will recognise the wisdom of withdrawing it. What is to become of the expunged matter if the motion is adopted? Are the censored speeches to be destroyed, or will they be kept and incorporated in the permanent records after the conclusion of the war? The official records of Parliament cannot be correct if any portion of them has been deleted. If the Government, in their foolishness, are determined to pass this motion, I seriously ask them to at least see that the true records are preserved, so that after the war is over, and it can no longer be said that their publication can .be injurious, they may be incorporated in the permanent reports. If that is done, students of Australian history, who may desire in later years to leam what happened in the.

The defect of Russia was not even a'n accident. It was in great part brought about by that same kind of incapacity which has always presided over the acts of our successive Governments. The defection of Russia was in part brought about because, upon the first mutterings of the storm in that country, instead of showing that prevision which we have a right to demand, instead of being accurately informed, our representatives saw and heard nothing, knew nothing,except their own rooted prejudices and their own reactionary ideas.

Por instance, the shipping companies of Australia have manned three Australian ships with the coloured labour of a friendly Power. To this the seamen of Australia object.

Surely, as a representative of a Division in this HouseI may be allowed to place before the Parliament and people of Australia the fact that the shipping companies are obtaining cheap coloured crews from a friendly foreign Power? The Acting Prime Minister will not say that I am going beyond my province in mentioning this matter in order that it may be ventilated. friendly Power might feel aggrieved at this statement, it will not be published. Again, British newspapers have widely published the terms of the secret treaties made between the Allies in 1915.

Then, again, under these treaties, Prance was not only to get back the whole of Alsace-Lorraine, but a portion of the west bank of the Rhine, while another portion of the west bank of the river was to be made a buffer state.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. Debate resumed from 26th September (vide page 6448), on motion by Mr Watt -That the paper be printed. This is the first opportunity I have had to lodge my protest against many actions of this Government. While one may conceive that in the fixing of prices the Government have met with some difficulties, their explanations are of very little use to heads of families and mothers of children who have not the wherewithal at the present time to satisfy the right of all Australian children to sufficient meat, bread, and groceries. However, before dealing with that matter, I should like, in a pleasant way I hope, to refer to the trouble about the flying of the red flag. If we look into history we find that that great superman, Julius Csesar, used the ... ... ... 32 red flag once on behalf of right, and ... . ... 14 for the benefit of the plebeians, who were the workers of ancient Rome. I hope 18 sincerely that the efforts on behalf of the Seventh War Loan w ill result in subscriptions amounting tq four times the amount Livingston, J. needed; and further, that some of the Lynch, J. rich patriots of Australia will follow the Mackay, G. H. example of two unions who have lent Maxwell, G. A. Â£100 each free of interest, and hand over Palmer, A. C some of their thousands on the same Pigott, H. R. M. terms. What is this loan flag ? There is Poynton, A. no such flag flown on the seas, but it is Sinclair, H. curious to observe that the Government in advertising the Seventh War Loan, and Webster, W. as an inducement to people to subscribe, Wise, G. H. are issuing an honour flag, and that this flag consists of the Australian flag shown Smith, Laird on a red flag. And , still more curious to Thomson, John. relate, the Government are not content with that, but in the picture of this honour flag show the very halyards as Riley, E. coloured red. It will be seen that honour Tudor, F. G. is paid to the red flag by making it the West, J.

But how are we Catts, J. H . treating the men who come back from Nicholls, S. RT the Pront? How are we treating their dependants, women, and children? I say that their treatment is an infamy and a disgrace. This is not altogether blameable on the Ministry, but there are some men who ought to be dismissed when they make inexcusable mistakes. There can be no need for cases such as I am going to mention. The first is that of a woman with three children, who received sudden notice that no more money would be paid to her, as herhusband, who is at the Pront, had been absent without leave. These are the sort of cases I have to meet every time. I ask for volunteers. In the one under notice, after a cablegram had been sent out and inquiries made, it was found, through the Commanding Officer some nine months afterwards, that this man had not been absent one day from the fighting line. Why is not an example made of those responsible for these mistakes ?",52,Groom
226,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [8.36],"To come to another matter. God grants to any woman the sacred g if t of motherhood, and she brings a child into the world whose father is cowardly enough not to acknowledge him, and that child grows to man's estate, and the mother gives him to fight for his country, she is treated differently from the married mother. This Parliament, to its honour, has struck out from every Commonwealth law the word "" illegitimate,"" using in its stead the word "" ex-nuptial."" Does the Minister for Defence think that the hearts of the mothers of ex-nuptial children' do not hleed like other mothers' hearts when their sons are killed or wounded ? Y et these mothers are not to receive pensions; and in this way a few paltry pence are saved! temptible and un-Australian. The people of this country desire that our soldiers and their dependants shall all be treated alike. I hope that Parliament will say to the Ministry that every mother who has given a son to the war shall be treated in the same way. To-day I asked the Acting PrimeM i nister the following questions: 1. Will lie make inquiries to ascertain if the Government of the United States of America, through its Insurance Bureau, makes the following provisions for its soldiers and officers, viz.:-Insurance s to the maximum of $10,000 (Â£2,000) and the minimum of $1,000 (Â£200) at a cost of premium during the war averaging $8(33s. 4d.) per $1,000 (Â£200), thus, it is stated, bringing the maximum of. Â£2,000 practically within the reach of every private; the premium, it is understood, being only $80 (Â£16 13s. 4d -) per year? 2. Also,, whether wliere no application, is made -within 120 days after enlistment, it is arranged that $5,000 (Â£1,000) insurance shall be deemed to have* been applied for by every man and officer?' 3. If the above be correct, ""will the Acting Prime Minister request the .Cabinet to consider whether the Government should insure every Australian private and officer for, say, half the above amount at the same rates of premium? I was bold that my statement of facts was substantially correct; but the M i nister was misled, I think, by. one of his officers in the answer he gave, which created thp impression that the Americans are doing for their soldiers only what is referred to in my questions. Every one knows that, in addition, they are giving pensions to the injured and to widows and other dependants. only that half what the Americans do for their soldiers and soldiers' dependants When shall be done for our Australian lads and? those dependent on them. While on the subject of insurance, let me read a letter which I have received from a lady whose husband is known to all but, perhaps, some of the newest members of theHouBe. She writesBB.

The cost of insuring an American soldier or officer for Â£1,000 would be about Â£8 6s. 8d. per year; but the rate based on the charges referred to in this letter would be Â£152 7s. 8d. a year. A m I wrong in asking for our men only half what' the Americans give to theirs ? W ill any one say that we should not do as much for our soldiers as the Americans do? It is all very well to say that we provide pensions, but so do the Americans. Facts; like those stated in the letter that I have Tead make it difficult to get recruits, and I wonder that so many volunteer. It is interesting to know that the Victorian electoral division which bas given the smallest number of recruits is Bendigo. The honourable member foT Grampians, by his splendid services on the recruiting platform, got just a few more for his division. Bendigo is the only constituency in which fewer than 20d men have enlisted, its enlistments being 155. Grampians comes next, with 218. Dr. MALONEY -Kooyong gave the devil's number, 333.

Let me TefeT to a debate in the .Senate, of which I have distributed a number of copies, and which is worth reading. I am sorry that Senator Millen could not see his way to provide allowances for more than four children in a family. .Senator McDougall asked why it was proposed to stop at four children; to whioh Senator Millen replied bhat it was deemed advisable to stop at an amount a little in excess of the livin g wage. Senator Guthrie asked what ,fche position would be if a soldier had five ehildren, to which Senator Millen replied that if the Senate wanted the schedule raised, it could say so. Therefore, the .present position is not altogether the faul t of the M in is t r y; it is the faul t of landlord proves that he has spent money the Senatei n not requiring that every Australian ohild should be provided, for with an allowance of 3s. 6d. a week. Senator Guthrie pointed out that many men had larger families than four children and asked why an allowance should not be made for every child. He asked, "" W h a t would be the position of a man who had eight children ?"" to which Senator Millen answered that bhat would be the man's own responsibility. I am sorry that Senator Millen has taken up this attitude. For more than a quarter of a century I have advocated the giving of child pensions. I know, as few laymen know, how many deaths occur even in this Australia of ours for want of proper food and clothing, and I know how great is the death Tate of children in the old land. In New Zealand provision is made for every child. W ill any man or woman I think bhat the Batsay that 3 s. 6d. per week is enough to provide milk and proper food for a child ? The y might well be, Would any member bring his own son or daughter up on that sum? If a.young The Batman figures tree lacks light; -nourishment, and moisture, it will never reach its f u l l growth. We know that the average child in a populous suburb such as Collingwood is 2 inches lower and 9 lbs. lighter than the Yes . average child of the same age reared in a suburb like South Yarra. I asked the Prime Minister repeatedly To the period bebefore he departed for England why the Government did' not take steps to prevent landlords raising rents during war time. The Batman men had The various municipalities have condemned many houses, justly so in some cases, but they have failed to compel the In New Zealand owners to build new houses Tn their stead. Consequently, houses are fewer, and rents are rising. There is one old-agepensioner, a woman, whose rent has been raised twice by a landlord named Anderson. A magistrate advised her t<* tender the lower rent to. the landlord,' and then, if she were taken tb Court, she need only take the bench into her confidence as to how she had searched everywhere for another house, and no magistrate on any bench would give the landlord an order to evict her. The Prime Minister answered my suggestions by saying that the control of rents was a difficult matter. He said he could understand persons who had carried out improvements which added value to their houses, increasing the rents, so as to get 8 per cent, from the property. If a in improving a house, I do not object to him getting additional rent equal to 8 per cent, on the cost of improvements. But why should not the Government declare that there should be no raising of rents while the war continues? I was interviewed by the tenants of a Jewish landlord who owns many terraces. I approached him with the request that he should cease raising rents whilst the war was on. He replied, "" I want my 6 per cent., and I intend to have it . "" I said, "" I do not wish to give you an advertisement, but I shall do so if you take up that attitude."" He replied, "" I thank you for your courtesy in coining to me, but I have made up my m in d .

But why does not Parliament issue a regulation under the War Precautions A ct to make it unlawful for auy man to raise rents during the war, and not put you individually to the necessity of approaching me to do what should be obligatory on every landlord?"" Speaking with all the sincerity in my being, I ask t h e ' Government to consider whether the time has not come when they should declare that there must be no more raising of rents until the war is over. In regard to the price of meat, I should be wrong if I did not recognise that the Government have to contend with difficulties; but I can imagine an astute -Prime Minister with a big love of humanity, tinged with a good deal of common, sense, deciding to fix the price of meat on the hoof. done for a nation of 100,000,000 people like the Americans, it can be done in Australia. Then, in order to prevent the charging of exorbitant retail prices, the Government could open meat shops in all towns having a certain population. They could instal cold storage, and arrange for the Queensland Government to send down beef at the price at whioh they are selling it to our kindred overseas and the Homeland. That meat could be sold by the Government retail at an increase of f d . or I d . per l b . , representing the difference between the cost in Queensland and the cost in other States. The people have a prejudice against frozen meat. When a butcher asks his customers whether they will have fresh meat or frozen, they almost invariably prefer the fresh meat. As a medical man, I tell the people that if meat has been properly frozen it is as healthy as any meat that can be had. Moreover, only the best meat is frozen. I am informed that a Victorian squatter, who was a member of the State Parliament, and a director of a cold storage company, has sent to the freezers as many as 400 sheep from whioh 200 have been culled and the rejected sent back to the station. The same thing happens with lambs-onl y the best are frozen. That squatter, when returning to his station at the weekend, always took with h i m ' a frozen .carcass for his home consumption. ' I 1 remember when in England dining at the Artists' Club w it h Professor Owen, and he asked me if I could tell h i m what special quality there was in a four-year old wether saddle of mutton I replied that I knew nothing about the matter. "" We l l , "" said he, "" w e had a dinner at the F o r ty Club the other night, and the piece de resistance was a four-year old wether saddle of mutton, and every member of the FoTty declared that he had never before tasted a saddle of mutton equal to it . "" Therefore, I urge the Government, if they really have the welfare of the people at heart, to open shops for the sale of frozen meat. I guarantee that the cost w ill not amount to more than I d . per lb. above the selling price in Brisbane. If they .'do that, they w ill enable the Australian people to buy meat at the prices at which it is being exported. I turn now to the wheat question. How is it that through bad management we If that can be prefer to allow countless thousands of bushels of wheat to be destroyed by weevils and mice rather than sell it at a cheap price to the people? I have a photograph of >a pyramid of 3,000,000 mice which were destroyed at a wheat depot; yet a man engaged in raising poultry can only get wheat for his fowls by paying an increased price. I look forward to the time when the people w ill take a hand in the government, as they w ill be able to do if we have the initiative referendum and recall, and w ill say that the farmer must have a f a i r price for his wheat, say, 4s. at the station. Allow the wheat to be supplied to the miller. The cost of gristing is not more than 25s. per ton. Compel the millers to supply flour to any baker. The percentage of profit has been mathematically ascertained. Allow the baker to sell bread over the counter at a f a i r price, and send to prison any miller who w ill not supply a baker because lie does not belong to the. iring. If the Government were to adopt tlhat policy, they would show that they ihave sympathy for the m a j o r it y of the people. They are not the m a j o r i ty who are well-to-do and live in plenty. The men of wealth can always look after themselves; their money helps them to do that. I regret very deeply that the Government of the day did not adopt the suggestion I made in 1912 in regard to the conversion of the State loans, and so save an immense sum of money. At the time. I was afraid to tell the House that I had calculated the profit at more than Â£20,000,000. No Australian State has ever failed to meet its loan obligations. Bonds may fall as low as Â£73, but as the time for redemption approaches they rise towards par. If a person invests in bonds merely for the purpose of getting an income, it does not matter to him whether the price of the bonds rises or falls; but, if bonds are bought for speculation or in order to have liquid assets which can be easily converted into money, how gladly would such holders convert their State stock into time, if a post-office up country had to be Commonwealth bonds, which would have greater stability. The axiom of Euclid that "" The whole is' greater than its part"" is as true to-day as when it was uttered, and the Commonwealth, as ia whole, is a much greater security for a loan than any single State. My proposal was not adopted, although it did bring forth complimentary letters from almost every House of Parliament under the British flag, with the exception of Newfoundland. Surely there is room for economy! Standardization is a word to conjure with in every factory to-day. Any firm which is able to standardize the parts of its maqualification to vote, but if the,donkey chinery is sure of larger profits. I believe that the Government have gone in for the standardization of the Commonwealth motor cars a very wise step. Why do they not standardize their Taxation Departments? There is an Income Tax Department for each State and an Income Tax Department for the Commonwealth in each State. In each there is a large number of public servants. The State Taxation Department does not bother me nearly as much as the Commonwealth Department does. I do not mean to say that the officers in the latter. Degive dinners, they give them to people who partment are not able -to do their work. Perhaps they lack experience. ""Is there any honourable member who can make out his income tax without looking up the ready reckoner which is supplied? There is no need for a readyreckoner in America, or in Great Britain, or in regard to any State income tax. But I had to obtain one, because, if any constituent of mine came to my office, and asked me what his income tax was likely to be, I Dr. Moloney. could not give him the information without reference to one. Those wonderful curves ! _ Why cannot the tax rise by graduations, so that any one can understand it. Let us standardize the Income Tax Departments, and have only one return, and only one set of officers, and let us apportion to the State its proportion of the revenue, the Commonwealth retaining the balance. The same arguments apply in connection with the land tax. It is a great absurdity to go on as we are now doing. It came out in evidence before the Public Accounts Committee that at one repaired, three different officials had to go and examine the work: There ought to be economy in avoiding duplication of work. Let us abolish the State Legislative < Councils. They are useless, and generally represent one class of the community only. In Victoria no one can become a member of the Legislative Council unless he is a land-owner. It is idiotic. When Benjamin Webster returned to America he described to an intelligent American audience the franchise as he found it in England. It was a property qualification. He said that if a man owned a donkey worth Â£50 it was his should happen to die on the day before the election, he asked that intelligent American audience who held the votethe man or the donkey. These silly old fossils in Victoria threw out women's suffrage thirteen times and manhood suffrage fifteen times. They wasted over Â£70,000 of the money of the people of Victoria, and then had to pass the reform in the end. Let us abolish State Governors. What good are they to the community ? If they never feel hungry. They do not go about the highways and the byways, as the Old Book says, gathering in those who may be hungry. Let us abolish the State Agents-General. If we have common sense, let us make them General Agents on a minimum salary, with a commission for the business they send to Australia. It was a Teform which was promised before Federation was brought about. Then. I come to our refreshment-room. We could afford to give 12,000 meals at 2s. 6d. per meal to honourable members outside, and yet not lose as much money as we are now losing upstairs. It would pay us to give 30,000 meals at Is. per head We are building up generals who have to hungry people outside, and not lose more than we are now losing on the dining-room. think 'that honourable members eat at the country's cost. I am merely pointing out that the dining-room is costing the country that needless amount of money. Honourable members cannot get meals upstairs as cheaply as they can get them in the city. I can get a meal at the Cafe Francais for 2s. 6d. that I cannot get upDefence Department. He was educated stairs for 5s. We are not saving money by having our meals in the House, but we are the means of the House losing money. My proposal is to get rid of some of the gilt feathers who are bossing affairs upstairs, and allow a co-operative company of stewards, waiters, and cooks to supply honourable members with meals, or to let an outside restaurant do so, which would have the opportunity of making some use of the food that now goes to waste when the House rises suddenly before a dinner adjournment. Under the advice of the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr condemned by Mr Wilfred Blacket, who Finlayson), or one or two other cheerful individuals, honourable .members, are becoming so teetotal that the consumption of alcohol is not more than 4^d. per member per month. What is the use of keeping a bar open for that amount of revenue ? 'Refreshments cost no more than 4^d. per month per member. However, people cannot say that we are not temperate. If an honourable member asks a friend to come to Parliament House to have a meal, he is charged 6d. extra. The press reporters have to pay 6d. extra. If that is not contemptible cheese-paring, I do not know what is. The dining room pays no rent; there is no charge, for light, linen, cutlery, crockery or glassware, and possibly none for firing. This is a direction in which economy could . be brought about. NextI come to the excessive payments to officers in the military service. We have 150 men in Australia and at the Front who draw more money than is paid to the Commander-in-Chief of the Swiss Army. There are ten -to fifteen men drawing more money than Von Moltke was paid when he led the victorious Prussians through Prance in the Franco-Prussian War. He drew Â£1,500 per annum, whereas one oflicer in the Australian Army is paid Â£40 per week, and also draws a field allowance of Â£5 5s. a day. never smelt gunpowder at the Front. General Cuscaden is a man who has the People outside seem to lowest diploma of any medical officer in the Australian or British Forces. There is not a man in the Imperial Army who' is not his superior in the matter of surgical diplomas. Has he ever gone to the Front, or smelt gunpowder there? No. He has stayed at home polishing the handle of the big front door of the in Ireland, but he had to go to Scotland to get his diploma. He would not be permitted to go into the Melbourne Hospital, or the Alfred Hospital as an inpatient surgeon. The Women's Hospital? Yes. Belonging to the Government House push, I suppose he got shoved along. I now come to the foolish expenditure at Canberra. I thank the hdnorable member for Hume( Mr Falkiner) for asking the Government whether the men in control to-day are those who were sat as aRoyal Commission inquiring into the"" Federal Capital Administration. What were his findings against the men who, with the malignity of a departmental conspiracy, sought to crucify the genius who, against the whole of the world, had won the prize for designing our Capital, and endeavoured tb bring in a hotch-potch design by stealing the brains of one man and taking the ideas of another? Had their object been carried out, they would have stamped that design permanently Upon Australia, but they were prevented by the action of the Government controlled by the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Joseph Cook). I thank him and his Assistant Minister( Mr Kelly) for having been manly enough to send to America to ask that genius who had submitted the prize design to come to Australia. The Commission would not have been issued to Mr Wilfred Blacket had it not been for the splendid action of the present Postmaster-General( Mr Webster). One man who was chosen by . Mr Griffin to devote his time and ability to the plans, of the future Parliament House was accused by the head of his department in the a Patents Office of being absent without leave, despite the fact that the Minister had asked him to do the work, and had provided hi m w i th a room for the purpose. Because he was an Australian who had graduated through a workman's drawing school, and had gone to Scotland 'to learn his business there; because he was an honoured member of the State Service who had been transferred to the Commonwealth, he was not class enough for these gentlemen in the Home Affairs Department who held no diplomas they had won for themselves. When I read fche findings of the Royal Commission, honourable members will see that it needs no words of mine to indicate the vast amount of money that has heen wasted at the Federal Capital through inability and ineptitude. findings wereUpon all the evidence, and particularly upon that which has been stated or referred to in this report, I find that the reasons why Mr Was sent to India to inquire into the Griffin, between 18th October, 1913, and 15th November, 1915, performed no substantial part of his duties under his contract with the Commonwealth are as stated in four of the five charges advanced in his behalf, viz., charges 1, 2, 3, and 5, and are as under:(1) That necessary information and assistance were withheld from him, and his powers were usurped by certain officers; (2) That he and his office were ignored, his rights and duties under his contract denied, and false charges of default made against him; (3) That the Honourable W. O. Archibald and members of the Departmental Board endeavoured to set aside his design and to substitute the Board's own design; ,and (5) That there was in the Department a combination, including the Honourable W. O. Archibald and certain officers, hosfchey have not the very best architects in tile to Mr Griffin, and to his design for the Capital city; and that the Honourable W. O. Archibald and the officers mentioned in my references to the evidence under these charges are severally responsible to the extent already indicated by me for this result. But I think it necessary that I should emphasize the fact that after Mr Archibald's accession to office it must have been perfectly clear tp all the officers that the ber, for the benefit of a hospital, that Ministerial policy was direeted against the carrying out of Mr Griffin's design, and any acts they did in frustration of Mr Griffin's efforts were therefore done in furtherance, as they believed, of the Minister's desires. I cannot say that this excuses them; still the greatest responsibility in respect of the obstruction to Mr Griffin is with the Minister. Holding the views that he did as to .the ""grave mistake"" that he considered had been made in the engagement of Mr Griffin, he should have adopted one of two alternativesDr. Maloney. a either to have cancelled the contract and reverted to the design of the Departmental Board, or else to have allowed Mr Griffin's contract to be performed and his design carried out. As to the fourth charge"" That in order .to .prevent Mr Griffin's design from being carried out, wilfully false estimates of its cost were given,"" I find that it wholly fails, and that no such false estimates were made. Who are these men ?

Question resolved in the affirmative. That the House do now adjourn. By the courtesy of the Minister for the Navy the papers in connection with the discontinuance from the Naval College of Cadet R. J. H . Rubie have been placed on the Library table, and I venture to trespass on the attention of honourable members for a moment or two in order to call attention to'certain facts. This midshipman had a seizure at the College, according to the Navy doctor, and certainly he had some sort of fainting spell. He was recommended for what they call a ""survey"" by a Board of Naval Surgeons in Sydney. He went to Sydney, and the survey was in the lad's favour. It was recommended that he be sent back to the College. The Naval Board then took a hand, .and said he ought not to be sent back to the College. An appeal was made to an arbitrator, and the arbitrator Is it was against the doctor at the College; but it was said by the Naval Board that he should not be sent back because a predisposition to epilepsy was too dangerousto have about the Navy. There was no history of epilepsy healthier boy. After that, owing to the protests of the family, who knew what the decision of the Board in Sydney was, the Naval Board began to consider a way out, and suggested getting an outside expert to give them the benefit of his advice. Admiral Creswell, I think, suggests in the papers that it was excellent to get an outside expert's advice, but held that, in any case, it would not be followed against the decision of the naval non-medical Board in Melbourne! The doctor at the College, who had decided against the boy on one fainting spell, described him as having a narrow and high palate, which was the only indication in an otherwise healthy boy of, perhaps, an abnormal mental condition or predisposition. The doctors in Sydney who had the boy in front of them, said that that was a mistake, for the boy's palate was broad and entirely normal! If the doctor at the College could make so flagrant a mistake on a matter under his notice, one must be very careful about accepting his decision when the whole future of the lad is at stake. This matter was referred to Dr. (now Colonel) Jones, who is in charge of the lunatic administration of Victoria. did not have the boy in front of him, but merely the file of documents, and, while he appeared to think the attack might be eipilepsy, he went so far as to say that the boy should be taken back to the College and observed during a further term.

There are somt interesting features in these papers worth the passing attention of honourable members. lieve in the trut h of answers supplied to them by a Public Department, the control of this House over Public Departments has gone for ever. In these files we find, in the first place, Admiral Creswell pointing o u t I presume, to his Min-. ister, though I am not quite clear as to fchat-that the overwhelming bulk of the evidence is in favour of epilepsy, and that, therefore, the boy should not be ccntinued at the College. As a matter of fact, the overwhelming evidence is in the other direction-in other words, bhat the boy should be kept at the College. There was only one doctor and the non-medical men in Melbourne who fchought that the boy should be sent away. That is one instance of a lack of candour on the part of a prominent person at the Navy Office. Another instance of lack of candour came within my pwn experience, and I protest to the Minister in charge of the Department against that sort of thing. I saw the Secretary to the Navy about the matter. A t that time. I did not know that the evidence of everybody, except the doctor at the College, who made the initial blunder about the configuration of the lad's palate, was in favour of his retention at the College, and I urged that outside evidence should be got, in the absence of any history of epilepsy in the family or anything in the appearance of the boy to suggest such a thing. The Secretary to the Navy, in a very frank and kindly way, said that outside expert evidence would, be got, but after about a fortnight or so the lad was dismissed. I then asked by letter if the outside evidence I had suggested had been obtained, and the reply I re'ceived was as follows: In reply to your letter of 1st August regarding the case of Master Rubie, late Cadet Midshipman at the Royal Australian Naval College, I am directed to inform you tliat-the most careful consideration was given to the medical evidence In this case, and expert opinion was taken. My letter referred to expert opinion that was to be taken after my interview, and no expert opinion was taken after that interview. ing. leading to a member of this House who was seeking information to which he was entitled. It was not only deceiving to If honourable members cannot beme as to the promise given, but it was misleading as to the facts, because the most careful consideration had not been given to the medical evidence in the case, or the boy would still be. at the College. Attention had been given only to the fiat of Admiral Creswell and the Board over whioh he presides. This was that the boy must be "" fired,"" and no further effort made to ascertain whether he was well or ill. favour of having an expert from outside? opinion was not followed. lose."" -Creswell had expert opinion himself outside many years ago, and he is still in bhe ""Department, despite that expert opinion. He was given the benefit of the doubt; and I do hope that the Minister who presides over the destinies of the Navy wil l follow the suggestion made by the Medical Boardi n Sydney, and in dorsed by Colonel Jones, of this State, bhat the boy be given a further chance at the College, and observed in the future. The boy is no weed or weakling; he is admitted on the papers to be the best of the bunch physically with which he entered the College. It may be^ that there is a tendency to epilepsy, though that is extremely improbable. If it is, the Department could have the boy observed, and, if necessary, quietly passed out before any harm resulted to the Navy. Do not "" fire "" this boy on the mere ipse dixit of a man who knows as much about medicine as some people say he knows about bhe Navy. I desire this boy to be given another chance; and I appeal to the Ministeri n charge to give it to h i m.

279,Mr Kelly,"Of course. Admiralsire to direct the attention of the Minister for Works and Railways to the refusal of a pass to the secretary of the Railways Union over the transeontinen. tal railway. We have read in the newspapers of how the whole of the working of the railway is held up on account of this trouble. About a week ago I mentioned the matter privately to the Minister, and asked whether it was correct that the Government had decided that they would not grant the ordinary leave pass which is granted on every other railway in Australia. The Minister informed me then that the ordinary leave pass was granted in exactly the same way as in other railway services. This union secretary had asked for a pass for two months. anxious that this railway should be worked on proper lines; and if there has been any breaking away from ordinary railway usage in the matter of leave passes, I should like to know what action the Government are taking with a view to the settlement of the dispute. easy to stop a dispute of the kind at the start; but, like a fire, once it gets out of control no one can say where it will finish. I merely wish to point out the difficulties bhat might arise in the event of the trouble spreading to the .State services at both ends of the transcontinental railway. ter for WÂ°rks and Railways) [9.59] It is""perfectly correct bhat bhe honourable member spoke to me about this matter, and asked me whether the Government were granting ordinary leave passes from station to station, in accordance with bhe practice in other railway services: gather from the Railway Commissioner that the practice on the transcontinental railway is the same as that followed elsewhere; that is to say, when a man gets his six days' leave, or whatever it may be, he is given a pass from station to station. The case in point, however, is not a ease of that kind. asked for leave of absence for six or eight weeks, and for a station-to-station pass during that period. get paid during that leave. absence, without pay. It is understood that this pass was intended to be used for union organizing purposes; and there is no such practice elsewhere, except in Western Australia and in South Australia, in a very modified form. under which the men work, and what they suffer by reason of the lack of population, make their position worse than that of men on any other line in Australia days on an inspection of the line, and had an opportunity for an examination of their conditions, and I 'think that the honourable member must admit that no other Railway Department makes better provision for supplying tlra needs of its employees than the Commonwealth makes for the men on this line. I consider that the housing accommodation must be improved, but while ballasting operations are proceeding, and the permanent position of stations is uncertain, it is impossible to erect permanent homes at all stations.

I spoke to the Minister over a week ago. cial intimation from the men that they intended to take action, nor has there been any official intimation from the representatives of the union as to the reasons for their action. verbally conveyed to the Commissioner a few days since that if a free station-tostation pas's for a period of from six to . eight weeks was not issued to Driver Wittorff, the local secretary, to travel over the railway on organizing work for the union, the men would cease work to attend a conference. That was the only communication tliat the Commissioner had, and the next thing that happened was that the men stopped work. I do not wish to discuss the merits of the case further at this stage. The Commissioner is now awaiting a reply to communications. resumption of the traffic as soon as possible. In the meantime, we must consider what steps can be taken to keep the traffic going. have a few words to say regarding an answer given by the Acting Prime Minister to-day to a question asked by me respecting the employment of returned soldiers under an arrangement whereby the pension or repatriation allowance of the soldier is Tegarded as part and parcel of his wages. The Acting Prime Minister's reply dealt exclusively with the cases of returned soldiers who were learning a trade. The case I have in my mind is one which I endeavoured to bring under notice when the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) moved the adjournment to discuss another matter. A returned soldier was sent to the Zinc Corporation Works at BrokenH ill to fill send unskilled workers to Broken Hill, or the position of cleaner, purely a labourer's job, for which labourer's wages are paid. The South Australian Branch of the Repatriation Department arranged that 60 per cent, of his wages should be paid by the Department and 40 per cent, by the Zinc Corporation. To his credit, the soldier refused to take the job under those conditions, and reported the matter to his union. I read .an account of the case in the Barrier Daily Truth, and, after I had received a letter regarding it from the Barrier Branch of the Austratralian Labour Party, I wrote to the Repatriation Department concerning it. Although a considerable time has now elapsed since my letter was sent, I am still waiting for a reply to it. The Minister's answer to my question was unsatisfactory, as it did not touch upon the posiA threat was tion of unskilled labour. One of my questions wasIs it a fact that a returned soldier working under this scheme loses a day's work, and is docked by the employer, and is the Repatriation Department credited with the proportionate deduction of the day's wages ? In reply, the Acting Prime Minister said that, in the case of the absence of a trainee from duty, df an employer decides not to pay his own contribution, that of the Department of Repatriation also stops. It would appear, therefore, that the soldier's pension stops, so far as the Repatriation Department is conOur desire is to bring about a cerned, from the date on which he ceases work. Like other honourable members, I know the scheme under which, for the purpose of helping injured returned soldiers by assisting them to learn some trade and calling, certain arrangements are made for their payment, but the position of a soldier who is employed on ordinary work, such as that of a cleaner or mill hand, for which no great knowledge, skill, or length of training are required, is different. I want from the Government an assurance that returned soldiers will not be employed with the advantage fco their employers that the Repatriation Department, or, rather, the Commonwealth taxpayers shall meet the difference between the amount the soldier is actually receiving and the amount which the employer is contributing to his wages. I want to have that system of employing returned soldiers wiped put. The Repatriation Department should cease to fco any otlier place under those conditions. It can by no stretch of the ima, ination be considered a benefit to the returned soldier that his employer shall be able to secure his services at 40 per cent, or 60 per cent, less cost to himself, the difference being made up by the general taxpayer. It is, however, of great benefit to the employer to have such a practice adopted. This is a matter which the Government should sit up. and take notice",63,Adjournment Cadet Midshipman Rubie Railway Leave Passes Wage S Of Retubned Soldiebs Pension Oe Repatriation Allowance

But there is absolutely no reason why a returned soldier employed at an unskilled job and able to perform it as well as any civilian should have 60 per cent, of his wages made up by the Repatriation Department. I fail to see how that practioe can be justified. add that when an honourable member communicates with a public Department to bring a matter under notice, he should be treated with the courtesy to which a member of this Parliament is entitled, a courtesy which, I may say, I have received from other Departments with which I have communicated. patriation Department absolutely ignored the representations and facts I brought under its notice. Government took the matter to which I have referred into consideration, because the practice adopted is giving rise to a great deal of dissatisfaction and, as I have shown in the case to which I have referred, is not satisfactory to the soldiers themselves.
