(2) Can he confirm that the publication states (a) “in 2000-01 around 10.3 million personal taxpayers lodged returns – representing 52% of the total Australian population (19.7 million) as of 30 June 2001” and (b) “on average personal (or individual) taxpayers have accounted for 53% of the total Australian population since 1995-96”. (3) Can he confirm that section 3.10 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 states “besides paying instalments and the rest of your income tax, your main obligations as a taxpayer are… (b) to lodge returns as required by the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936”. (4) Will he explain the obligations a taxpayer has under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and supporting legislation to lodge a taxation return. (5) What is the estimated total number of personal taxpayers that are obliged to lodge a tax return. (6) How many persons (a) receiving personal income are subject to income taxation, (b) are required to obtain a tax file number under Australian taxation law, and (c) are required to lodge a taxation return under Australian taxation law. (7) What is the estimated cost to revenue for the years (a) 1999, (b) 2000, (c) 2001, (d) 2002, and (e) 2003 by persons who have not (i) declared taxable income, (ii) obtained a tax file number, (iii) lodged an income tax return, and (iv) paid the assessed income tax. (8) What steps are being taken following the Ralph Report to reduce the number of persons who have placed themselves outside the Australian taxation system; if no action is being taken, why not. rial responsibilities. The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) (a), (b), (c) and (d) Yes. Note: Data for Taxation Statistics 2000–01 was compiled before all processing for the 2000–01 income year was completed. Statistics in some chapters are sourced from 2001 annual income tax returns and associated schedules (such as the capital gains tax schedule 2001) processed by 31 October 2002. The statistics in these chapters are not necessarily complete and will continue to change as data from 2001 tax returns and schedules processed after 31 October 2002 are included (as mentioned on page IV of Taxation Statistics 2000-01). (2) (a) and (b) Yes. (3) Yes. (4) Section 161 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 provides the legislative requirement under which an annual taxation return is required to be lodged. It specifies that every person must, if required by the Commissioner by notice published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, lodge a return for the year of income within the period specified in the notice.",146,Request For Detailed
211,Mr Brough,"The Treasurer has referred this question to me as it falls within my ministeUnder section 162 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Commissioner can also require a return to be lodged, regardless of whether a taxpayer has an obligation as per the gazette notice. (5) The requirement to lodge an income tax return is dependant on an individual’s own circumstances. Generally, the ATO expects around 11 million personal taxpayers to have an obligation to lodge a return for the year ended 30 June 2003. (6) (a) As per Table 3.25 of Taxation Statistics 2000-01, there were around 8.4 million individual taxpayers that were taxable in the 2000-01 income year (based on 2001 individual tax returns processed by 31 October 2002). A similar number of taxable taxpayers were present in the 2001-02 income year as per Table 3.25 of Taxation Statistics 2001-02. Around 8.6 million taxable taxpayers were present in the 2002-03 income year in the equivalent table of Taxation Statistics 2002-03. (b) There is no requirement for persons to have or quote a TFN under Australian taxation law. The relevant section that covers the issue of a tax file number is section 202B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA 1936), which states that ‘a person may apply to the Commissioner for the issue of a tax file number. The Commissioner has issued Tax File Number Guidelines which are pursuant to section 17 of the Privacy Act and the TFN offence provisions in the Taxation Administration Act 1953. Paragraph 1.2 of these guidelines states ‘The rights of individuals under taxation, assistance agency or superannuation law to choose not to quote a tax file number shall be respected.’ This forms the basis of what is known as the ‘voluntary quotation principle’, which recognises that an individual is not legally obliged to quote a tax file number. Neither taxation nor assistance agency nor superannuation laws make the quotation of a tax file number a requirement, although a financial consequence of not quoting can be severe. Under assistance agency law, the quotation of a tax file number is a condition for the receipt of assistance payments. (c) See answer to question 5 above. (7) (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) – (i), (ii) and (iii) The information requested for years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 is not available. Preliminary figures on tax and penalty raised from compliance activity in the 2002/03 and 2003/04 years were published in the Compliance Program 2003-04 and 2004-05 booklets respectively. The figures are updated in the Commissioner’s annual report. (iv) Where people do not pay tax liabilities by the due date, a debt is created for collection by the ATO. The ATO invests significant resources in these activities on an ongoing basis. In instances where debts are likely not to be recoverable the ATO uses standing accounting practice in relation to these amounts. These figures are presented in the ATO’s Financial Statement published each year in the Commissioner of Taxation’s annual report. (8) The ATO has recently augmented its efforts to identify people who are operating outside the system by implementing an expanded program of data matching. This expanded program utilises a range of third party data providers with a particular focus on sources that may indicate business or income earning activity. The ATO is also looking to better utilise data that is already available to the ATO, including financial investment return data. As part of these activities, the ATO is also seeking assurance that particular groups, particularly high income earning professionals are participating in the system as expected. The ATO will be sourcing membership records held by a range of professional associations and bodies to ensure registered professionals are in the tax system. The ATO is presently targeting members of the legal profession, accountants, architects and medical practitioners. Superannuation (Question No. 17) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 17 November 2004: Further to the answer to part (4) of question 3158 (Hansard, 13 May 2004, page 28553), can he explain why the Government will not change its superannuation policy to enable Australia’s police officers to retire at the age of 55 years with access to superannuation benefits. rial responsibilities. The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The superannuation preservation age is to increase from age 55 to 60, commencing in 2015. A review on whether police should be exempt from the new superannuation preservation rules was recently undertaken by Treasury and independently chaired by Mr Gary Potts. The review found that police are not in a unique position insofar as they are affected by the increase in the preservation age and that issues specific to the police force would be better dealt with by targeted responses by police employers. The review recommended that no special exemption to the preservation age be made for police officers on the basis that the preservation age is a community-wide standard and to lower the age would erode this universal element of the Government’s retirement income policy, central to dealing with the key long-term challenge of the ageing population. Police would also have fewer years in which to accumulate adequate superannuation benefits to fund their retirement. The Government has accepted these findings. Notwithstanding the above, it will remain the case that, subject to a superannuation fund’s governing rules, the superannuation law will continue to allow a person to access their superannuation benefits on termination of gainful employment at any age if it is taken in the form of a non-commutable life pension or annuity. National Airspace System (Question No. 66) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 17 November 2004: What are the itemised costs of developing the National Airspace System incurred by the Department of Transport and Regional Services and other agencies in the portfolio.

(a) The 2003-04 Federal Budget allocated $6m to the National Security Hotline. Of this amount, $1.2m was allocated for ongoing communications around national security, such as any advertising, public relations, printing, distribution, storage and market research. (b) Of the $1.2m allocation, $321,257 was spent specifically on advertising. (c) and (d) $4.8m was allocated for administration from the 2003-04 Budget, of which $3.5m was spent. Built into the operation of the National Security Hotline is the capacity to meet unforseen surge demands and roster additional staff to handle significantly increased call volumes. In 200304, the full additional capacity was not required, resulting in an underspend. The figure for administration includes funding for salaries including shift allowances, contingency supplementary staffing (as mentioned above), database maintenance and development, Information Technology support, telephone costs, photocopying and other general office administration costs. National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (Question No. 569) Mr Albanese asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, in writing, on 14 February 2005:",153,Questions In Writing
214,Mr Mcclelland Asked The Attorney,"General, in writing, on 8 February, 2005:",155,Questions In Writing
215,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) In respect of that part of the ANAO report which states that the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) and bilateral agreements “contributed to important policy changes in natural resource management”, will the Minister explain what the important policy changes for each jurisdiction are that can be exclusively attributed to the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (NAP) (i.e. those policy changes which were not already underway or to which there were commitments by the State or Territory, such as for example in commitments to implement the COAG Water reform Framework). (2) hat has the Commonwealth done to ensure regional body members declare any conflict of interest, real or perceived, which they may have directly or indirectly, in relation to the expenditure of NAP funds and what written commitments are made by regional group members to respond to potential conflicts of interest. (3) Will the Minister provide a copy of the Review of the NAP Governance and Control Framework dated March 2004. (4) What is the longer-term natural resource policy outcome sought by Commonwealth agencies that has contributed to delays in the establishment of the NAP bilateral agreements and what policy or funding reforms were sought through the bilateral agreements to secure that outcome. (5) How do the policy or funding reforms in part (4) differ from those already underway or committed to by the jurisdictions, such as under the COAG Water Reform Framework. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) specifically commits the parties to the following reforms: to cap extractive use of water from all surface and groundwater systems that are over-allocated or approaching full allocation; removal of impediments to the effective operation of trading markets in, and the integrated management of, both surface and ground water systems; controls on land clearing which prohibit clearing where it leads to unacceptable land and water degradation. Through bilateral agreements the States and the two mainland Territories have committed to: policy and institutional reforms in regards to water property rights; appropriate pricing of water; introducing regulatory reforms for water and land use to motivate best practice in land and water resource management; establishing regional bodies to develop integrated and strategic natural resource management (NRM) plans; and a national standards and targets framework and monitoring and evaluation strategy. These agreements also secure national commitments through complementary processes such as the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) 1994 water reform agenda, the national vegetation framework and the Murray-Darling Basin strategies. (2) Regional bodies are established by the States and Territories, in most cases under legislation, and are therefore operating under arrangements defined by these jurisdictions. The Australian Government is working with State and Territory Governments and regional bodies to ensure best practice governance arrangements for regional bodies. (3) A copy of the Review of the NAP Governance and Control Framework dated March 2004 has been provided to the honourable member and is available from the Table Office. (4) The IGA outlines the outcomes that the Australian Government is seeking to achieve including: capping extractive use of water from all surface and groundwater systems that are overallocated or approaching full allocation;",155,Questions In Writing
216,Mr Truss,"The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following anremoval of impediments to the effective operation of trading markets in surface and groundwater systems; controls on land clearing which would lead to unacceptable land or water degradation; development of national criteria that will be the basis for accreditation of integrated regional NRM plans; establishment of community-based regional bodies to develop the regional NRM plans; development of regional NRM plans that improve salinity and water quality. The Bilateral Agreements reinforce the IGA and the COAG 1994 water reform commitments. Negotiations to commit the States and Territories to these and other related outcomes delayed the conclusion of the NAP bilateral agreements. (5) The policy reforms in the IGA and bilateral agreements reinforce the COAG 1994 water reform commitments. They also include additional regional arrangements (such as establishing regional bodies and undertaking integrated regional planning process) and vegetation reforms. Developing and implementing the NRM plans will contribute to delivering the commitments and national policy reforms agreed to by COAG.

221,Mr Vaile,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Organisation Financial year grant paid* Grant Amount Australian Business Limited 2003-04 $23,167 2004-05 $22,638 Australian Industry Group 2003-04 $22,177 2004-05 $5,809 The purpose of EMDG grants is to assist small and medium sized Australian businesses to enter export markets and become sustainable exporters by reimbursing up to 50 per cent of eligible export promotion expenses they incur above $15,000. The maximum grant is $150,000 and a maximum number of seven grants is payable to an individual recipient. Eligible export promotion expenses include marketing visits, overseas representation and marketing consultants, participation in trade fairs, communications, free samples, promotional literature and advertising, and visits to Australia by overseas buyers. Eligibility for an EMDG grant is determined in accordance with specific eligibility criteria as set out in the Export Market Development Grants Act 1997. The scheme makes a provision for peak industry associations to seek ‘special approval status’ to enable them to apply for a grant. Under this provision, eligible business associations can apply for a grant as an Austrade ‘Approved Body’. To qualify for ‘Approved Body’ status, an association must be the ‘peak’ industry body for the industry it represents and must be undertaking generic export promotion on behalf of its members. To be a ‘peak’ industry association, an applicant must be able to demonstrate that it ‘represents the majority of businesses engaged in that total Australian industry’. Austrade determines if a body meets these requirements in accordance with a Ministerial Determination. * Section 94 of the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985 authorises Austrade to provide only certain limited details of grant recipients (name, address, industry, grant amount) to third parties. Therefore, the exact date of payment of EMDG grants cannot be provided.

224,Mr Brough,"The Treasurer has referred this question to me as it falls within my ministe(4) What is the name and postal address of the consultancies engaged. (5) What is the cost of each consultancy. (1) CASA’s strategic direction is underpinned by high-level goals, which in order to be achieved, must be supported by a range of safety related actions. Within this context, CASA has determined that where appropriate, greater emphasis will be placed on using data analysis in the decision making and planning process within CASA. One of CASA’s objectives is to identify and address the most significant safety related trends and risk factors in the system of civil aviation safety in Australia. As outlined in CASA’s 2005-2006 to 2007-2008 Corporate Plan, a series of initiatives have been developed to enhance CASA’s safety research and analysis capability. These initiatives include: resources reporting directly to the Chief Operating Officer; development of research and analysis strategies to support standards development; the development of cooperative research and analysis programs within CASA and with regulatory authorities, aviation organisations, universities/colleges and manufacturers; and conveying results of safety research and analysis to stakeholders. In the past year, CASA has initiated a number of data analysis projects aimed at improving aviation safety. Of particular importance was an extensive analysis of fatal accidents in the general aviation sector. This project was undertaken within CASA and did not involve the use of any external consultants. (2) As the program is being embedded in CASA’s decision making processes, it is difficult to provide detailed costings. However, the initiatives which have been developed to enhance CASA’s safety research and analysis capability include the appointment of resources within the Office of the Chief Executive Officer. This equates to two Senior Officer (2) appointments with a salary banding of $76,674-$92,269.

Joint Australia-United States Geological and Geophysical Research Station (Question No. 1685) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, in writing, on 15 May 2005: Which United States Air Force unit provides the personnel employed at the Joint Australia-United States Geological and Geophysical Research Station at Alice Springs. Mr Ian Macfarlane-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:: Air Force Technical Applications Centre at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida. Hearing Services (Question No. 1697) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Ageing, in writing, on 15 June 2005: (1) Can she confirm that the Government commissioned the Centre for International Economics to conduct a study on the provision of hearing services to children and Indigenous Australians and on the impact on Australian Hearing of competing in an open market. (2) Has the Government received a report on the findings of the study; if not, why not; if so, is it publicly available and, if it is not publicly available, why not. (3) How many audiologist and audiometrist positions are vacant within Australian Hearing. (4) What is the average cost per client of the Australian Government Hearing Services voucher scheme and has this scheme allowed the Government to provide more free hearing aids. (5) Will the Hearing Services Consultative Committee consider amending the voucher scheme’s eligibility criteria to provide greater access to services for low income earners without private health insurance; if not, why not. (6) Do clients who access free hearing aids receive the same choice of services as those clients who can afford ‘top-up’ hearing aids, in particular, is the same range of hearing aids available to them; if not, why not. (7) Is Australian Hearing expected to make a profit on the provision of hearing aids and other services to hearing impaired Australians; if so, what additional cost has this policy imposed on clients purchasing ‘top-up’ aids. Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Government commissioned a consortium comprising the Centre for International Economics and Pacific Road Corporate Finance to undertake a feasibility study on the potential for increased competition in the provision of hearing services under the Australian Government Hearing Services Program (the program). (2) Yes. The report has not been released publicly because it contains potentially sensitive commercial information. (3) Around 40. (4) $780 in the 2003-04 financial year. All clients who meet the eligibility criteria for the voucher system can access hearing services under the program. The program offers free hearing services (including hearing devices) to all eligible clients, and funds the fitting of devices when practitioners deem there is a clinical need and it is appropriate to do so. (5) The Hearing Services Consultative Committee has been established to provide me with advice consistent with its terms of reference on broad strategic issues on the national provision of hearing services and emerging issues of concern. (6) Eligible program clients who are assessed as needing a hearing device may choose from a list of ‘free-to-client’ devices that have been approved for supply under the program. Clients whose hearing needs cannot be met through the fitting of an approved ‘free-to-client’ device may be eligible for a non-standard device. Eligible clients may also choose to purchase a hearing device with additional features (referred to as a ‘top-up’ device). Choosing a ‘top-up’ device requires the client to contribute to the additional cost associated with the device. These arrangements provide clients with access to a wide range of hearing devices, while protecting those least able to purchase devices by providing them with access to a series of devices that are available at no cost to the client. (7) This matter of financing Australian Hearing Services falls within the portfolio responsibility of the Hon Joe Hockey MP, Minister for Human Services.

230,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Data is provided annually to the Department of Health and Ageing by the Health Insurance Commission on the number of people who have received the private health insurance rebate. This data is used to estimate the number of people with private health insurance. The data is not broken down by age. The latest annual published data for 2002-03 shows that approximately 57,400 people in the electoral division of Newcastle held hospital cover, or 45% of the electoral division’s population. (2) Data is only released at the electoral division level. Continence Aids Assistance Scheme (Question No. 1878) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Ageing, in writing, on 9 August 2005: Why is the Continence Aids Assistance Scheme terminated for people when they turn 65, regardless of the severity of their medical condition. Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Australian Government provides support for people with incontinence through a range of national services. Specifically, continence advice, information and support is provided through the National Continence Management Strategy and National Continence Helpline on 1800 330 066 (free call). In addition, some financial assistance for products to help eligible people with permanent incontinence is provided through the Continence Aids Assistance Scheme (CAAS) and the Stoma Appliance Scheme. The CAAS was set up by the previous Government as an employment-related scheme in which assistance was provided to people in the 16-64 years age group. The Scheme was designed to help people with incontinence remain in the workforce by assisting with the financial barrier continence management can cause to participation in education and employment. The CAAS was intended to complement State and Territory Schemes and was never intended to cover the full cost of continence aids. The CAAS continues to provide some limited assistance to people over the age of 65 years, though only where applicants are involved in paid work of at least eight hours per week and where their income and asset levels are such that they are eligible for an income support benefit. The Australian Government provides assistance to States and Territories through the Commonwealth State/Territory Disability Agreement to provide aids and equipment for people with disabilities. The State and Territory Governments administer a range of schemes, set their own eligibility criteria and determine the range of aids supplied. The CAAS was intended to complement these State and Territory schemes. It was not intended to replace existing schemes of assistance. Most States and Territories fund schemes that provide continence aids for people with disabilities, except Western Australia.

Utilities Allowance (Question No. 1921) Ms Hoare asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, in writing, on 9 August 2005: (1) Is the Minister aware that pensioner couples in receipt of Utilities Allowance receive the same amount of Allowance as pensioner singles. (2) Can the Minister confirm the basis for differential payments between pensioner couples and singles that have shown single people need a higher level of income to maintain a standard of living similar to that of couples. (3) Which studies has the department relied on to establish the current position and, in respect of each study, (a) what year was it completed, (c) who was its author, and (d) which areas in Australia or which overseas countries were the focus of the study. (4) Will the Minister commission a taskforce to investigate the current real average living costs of pensioners; if not why not. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) The social security system recognises that single pensioners need more income to have a similar standard of living to, and run a household like, couples. Couples gain economies and advantages from living together. Single people cannot usually share costs, such as electricity, telephone, heating and house maintenance. (3) The differential rate of pension paid to members of a couple and single pensioners was introduced in 1963. No single study can be considered as specifically determining the relativities.

Timber Imports (Question No. 1957) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Trade, in writing, on 9 August 2005: (1) Is the Government aware of reports that significant volumes of timber imported into Australia from Papua New Guinea are produced from illegal operations. (2) Has the Government investigated claims that some of this timber is entering Australia through the Brisbane-based company TLB Timber Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of the Malaysian logging company, Rimbunan Jijau, which owns 70% of PNG’s timber industry.",173,Questions In Writing
234,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Is the Government aware of allegations that illegal logging in PNG is one of the main causes of corruption, human rights abuses, and environmental damage. (4) Is the Government aware of actions taken by other countries such as the United Kingdom which, three years ago, developed a binding policy which identifies timber certified by the Forest Stewardship Council as the preferred timber to purchase. (5) Is the Government taking any steps to stop the importation and procurement of timber from illegal and destructive sources. (1) The Australian Government is aware of Greenpeace reports stating that timber has been imported into Australia produced from illegal operations in Papua New Guinea. (2) No Australia does not currently have mechanisms in place for identifying timber products from illegal logging operations. (3) The Australian Government is aware that Papua New Guinea faces difficult issues with its forestry sector.

The Australian Government has also urged the Government of PNG to ensure that its forestry legislation and procedures, which take into account environmental and landowner concerns, are enforced. (4) Yes. (5) At the last election, the Australian Government committed to working with major Australian timber wholesalers and retailers to examine options, consistent with our international obligations, to encourage wholesalers and retailers to ensure the timbers they sell are sourced from sustainably managed forests. The Australian Government is also monitoring the implementation of timber procurement policies in other countries, including those referred to in question 4 above, and is seeking to assess their effectiveness. Eureka Strategic Research Pty Ltd (Question No. 1988) Mr Bowen asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 10 August 2005: On 21 July 2005 did the Australian Tax Office engage Eureka Strategic Research Pty Ltd to conduct market research at a cost of $22,242; if so, what research is being conducted under the terms of this contract. rial responsibilities.

235,Mr Vaile,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,175,Questions In Writing
236,Mr Brough,"The Treasurer has referred this question to me as it falls within my ministe(a) differences in the educationally-relevant background characteristics of students; and (b) gains in students’ educational attainments arising from their participation in private tutoring programs outside of school. (1) (a) The Australian Government has endorsed the McEETYA National Framework for Professional Standards for Teaching, to help identify the key elements (knowledge, understanding, skills and values) of effective teaching. The Framework acknowledges that the nature and content of professional teaching standards developed at the local level will vary according to their purpose and context. Professional teaching standards therefore provide a possible mechanism for assessing teacher performance. The profession, through the National Institute of Quality Teaching and School Leadership, has commenced the development of advanced standards to identify highly accomplished teachers and school leaders. The Government strongly supports performance-based pay for teachers. Salary advancement for Australian teachers is currently almost exclusively based on an incremental scale, reflecting longevity of service and experience rather than qualifications or teaching performance. The Australian Technical Colleges, funded by the Australian Government, which will be senior secondary schools which provide students with trade training, will provide their teachers with access to performance pay and will offer them the option of an Australian Workplace Agreement. The broader implementation of performance pay however would be a matter for the education authorities that run schools and employ teachers. (b) The Australian Government is committed to ensuring parents receive more meaningful information about school performance in order to assist them in making decisions about their child’s schooling. In order to assist parents, the Australian Government is making State and Territory funding conditional on a range of measures being implemented. A key requirement is that, from 2006, State, Territory and non-government education authorities will have to ensure that each school makes available to parents information about the performance of the school. This information will encompass key student outcomes including the percentage of students achieving literacy and numeracy national benchmarks, professional engagement including teacher qualifications and teacher attendance, and information about parent, student and teacher satisfaction. Schools may publish other material about the school as they see fit. All Education Ministers have agreed that the publication of league tables is not supported (McEETYA resolution, May 2005). (2) (a) The National Goals for Schooling in the 21st Century, endorsed by all education Ministers in 1999, provide that “Schooling should be socially just, so that: students’ outcomes from schooling should be free of negative forms of discrimination based on sex, language, culture and ethnicity, religion or disability; and of differences arising from students’ socio-economic background or geographic location”. They also state that “the learning outcomes of educationally disadvantaged students [should] improve and, over time, match those of other students”. When they endorsed the National Goals for Schooling, Ministers directed that work commence on the development of national performance measures in key areas of schooling, including literacy, numeracy, science, ICT and civics. Recognising that the capacity to obtain a national picture of the educational progress of students is affected by the variety of definitions of student groups used by different States and Territories, school systems and schools, Ministers also directed that common national definitions of student background characteristics be developed and put in place across Australia.",175,Questions In Writing
237,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The development of both national performance measures and definitions has been the job of ment and Reporting Taskforce. Since 1999, reporting in the Annual National Report on Schooling in Australia (the ANR) on student achievement in each State and Territory against national literacy and numeracy benchmarks has gradually expanded to cover Years 3, 5 and 7, disaggregated by sex and for Indigenous students and students of language background other than English. In 2003, reporting by student geolocation (metropolitan, provincial, remote and very remote) was introduced. The national definitions and data collection mechanisms needed for reporting in the ANR according to students’ socio-economic background are being implemented as from 2005, with full reporting expected from 2006. The Schools Assistance Regulations build on the McEETYA definitions by requiring that the performance measures to be included in the ANR each year will include information disaggregated according to the student characteristics noted above, using the definitions approved by literacy and numeracy, but also for the national sample surveys in science, ICT and civics which will occur over the 2005-08 quadrennium. The provision of school performance information (see 1b above) will require schools to give a description of the value they add to students’ learning. Typical of this kind of analysis is the reference to relevant background characteristics of students that schools may wish to include. (b) The Australian Government acknowledges the differing backgrounds and experiences of students, but nevertheless is committed to the expectation that all schools can and should deliver high standards of achievement for their students. The key imperative driving this commitment is a desire to see all children, regardless of their background, experiences and opportunities, including access to private tutoring, achieve minimum standards in literacy and numeracy to enable their successful participation in schooling, further study, training and work. In relation to the impact of private tuition on students’ achievement, a review of the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme (as part of a review of the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Programme) found that individual tuition can make a difference to performance where the needs of the student are clearly matched with the expertise of the tutor. (The Scheme provides funding for extra tuition for Indigenous students who are assessed by their relevant educational institution as needing some tuition over and above that which is normally provided by the institution.) The Australian Government is funding a pilot Tutorial Voucher Initiative. This in an innovative and practical measure designed to be additional to any other assistance children may receive during school hours. The pilot was developed to enable access to valuable one-to-one tuition delivered outside school hours. An independent evaluation is running concurrently with the pilot Tutorial Voucher Initiative. It is investigating the impact of the pilot on student reading development, and the effectiveness of the pilot as a means of assisting children who did not meet the Year3 national reading benchmark in 2003. The evaluation will provide valuable information for the development of future programmes in literacy. The Department expects to receive a final report early in 2006 after the pilot ends. National Water Industry Training Package (Question No. 2033) Ms Macklin asked the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, in writing, on 10 August 2005: (1) What is the current status of the National Water Industry Training Package? (2) When was the current training package developed and implemented? (3) On what date was the training package due to be replaced? (4) Is a replacement for the National Water Industry Training Package being developed; if so, who is being consulted on its development? (5) Which industry skills council is responsible for the National Water Training Package? (6) Will the development of a replacement training package take account of new water management strategies and practices? (7) When will the replacement training package be submitted for approval and when will the new training package be implemented? (1) The scoping (first) phase of the review of the National Water Industry Training Package (NWP01) was undertaken in 2003 and the final report from this phase was noted by the National Training Quality Council in December 2003. Work has already been undertaken in re-validating the 2003 Phase1 scoping report and a Steering Committee has been formed to guide Phase 2. The initial scoping phase of the review was undertaken by the National Training Advisory Ltd (the Local Government ITAB). Since this time, new industry advisory arrangements have been put in place for the new national training system, and the newly established Government Skills Australia ISC has taken up the project, which is seen as a high priority. (2) The current version of the National Water Industry Training Package was endorsed by the National Training Quality Council on 21 September 2001. State Training Authorities are responsible for implementation of Training Packages once they have been endorsed. (3) The current National Water Industry Training Package was recommended for review by September 2004. This is a recommendation, not a requirement, and the current package remains in implementation until the review is complete. (4) PhaseI of the review of the National Water Industry Training Package was completed in December 2003. The development phase of the review has now commenced, with the appointment of a Steering Committee, comprising representatives from a broad range of national and State-based industry organisations and training providers. As part of the review process, comprehensive consultation will be undertaken with relevant industry stakeholders, including the water industry in all States and Territories, training providers, key government agencies, employer and employee associations, and the community. (5) Government Skills Australia is the Industry Skills Council responsible for the National Water Training Package. (6) During the consultation process, the review of the National Water Industry Training Package will consider any new water management strategies and practices. (7) The reviewed National Water Industry Training Package will be submitted for endorsement to the National Quality Council after the completion of the review process, in September 2006. Following National Quality Council endorsement, the Training Package will be ready for implementation by all States and Territories.",176,Questions In Writing

Mr John Cobb-The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (a) and (b) There are no specific offences contained in the Migration Act 1958 under which employers can be prosecuted in relation to people detained for working illegally and people detained for overstaying. A prosecution could be initiated against an employer for offences under s11.2 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995 (extension of criminal responsibility), at the discretion of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. Extension of criminal responsibility, under this provision, includes, for example, aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring a person to commit a substantive offence against the Migration Act. One employer has been prosecuted under these provisions. Concession Cards (Question No. 2043) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, in writing, on 11 August 2005: (1) Is it the case that pensioners holding a pensioner concession card have this entitlement suspended by Centrelink when they travel overseas; if so, why. (2) Is it the case that Centrelink provides a verification service to local governments regarding the eligibility of ratepayers to receive a Pensioner Rate Rebate every quarter; if so, why. (3) Is it the case that pensioners who travel overseas for a period that spans a quarterly Centrelink verification date are not able to receive a Pensioner Rate Rebate for that quarter; if so, why. (4) Is it the case that pensioners who travel overseas for a period that does not span a quarterly Centrelink verification date do not affect their eligibility for a Pensioner Rate Rebate; if so, why. (5) Will the Minister introduce legislation to ensure that the Centrelink verification service to local governments concerning ratepayers’ eligibility for a Pensioner Rate Rebate is not applied arbitrarily; if so, when; if not, why not. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) To qualify for a Pensioner Concession Card (PCC) or any concession card under social security law, a person must be in Australia. When a cardholder leaves Australia, their card is cancelled and it is reissued when the person advises Centrelink of their return to Australia. The Australian Government issues concession cards to provide access to Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) prescription items and certain Medicare services at a cheaper rate. The requirement to cancel cards when the cardholder is overseas protects the integrity of these schemes. (2) Yes. Centrelink’s Customer Confirmation eService (CCeS) provides a validation service to state, territory, local government and private concession providers. This service enables concession providers to check whether their customers have a current entitlement to a concession card.",178,Questions In Writing
