Further, I shall request the Postmaster-General .to ask the commission to make the correction which the chairman says it is always anxious to make when its mistakes are pointed out to it. Judging by some of the talks broadcast during the last twelve months, the commission will have a full-time job in correcting misrepresentations.

ON OVERDRAFTS. Minister request that a conference take place between the Commonwealth Bank and the Associated Banks in South Australia with a view .to having the rate of exchange on cheques between Eyre Peninsula and the mainland of South Australia brought into line with the rate applicable on the mainland? The rate on the mainland is Is. per £100, and between the mainland and Eyre Peninsula, i per cent., or 2s. 6d. per £100. Quick means of transport enables clearances to be made rapidly. According to the chairman of the Associated Banks, in South Australia,' 0. L. Isaachsen, the cost to the . banks of the alteration would be approximately £300 a year. Will the Prime Minister also ask the Commonwealth Bank and the Associated Banks to confer with a view to having all orders payable to Government departments, Commonwealth and State, in respect of income tax, land tax, motor registrations, &c, made free, of exchange? vernor of the Commonwealth Bank to eonsult with the Associated Banks in regard' to the exchange rate on cheques. Honourable members will recall that in the report of the banking commission some reference was made to the general subject of the exchange rate on cheques. I am not quite sure that all the items mentioned in the second portion of the honourable member's question are matters for discussion between the Commonwealth Bank and the Associated Banks,' but I shall have the matter' examined, and ask the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to carry out the consultation suggested by the honourable 'member should such a course appear to be desirable. give consideration to compelling the trading banks to reduce the overdraft interest rate from 4f per cent, to a rate not higher than 2 per cent, above the fixed deposit rate? overdraft has been the subject of discussions between the Commonwealth Bank, the trading banks and myself since I have been Treasurer, and from time to time reductions have been made in the light of the fixed deposit rate at the particular time. The maximum rate that may be charged on overdraft at present is 4f per cent. It must be remembered that when the fixed deposit rate is reduced a considerable time elapses before a bank is able to derive any financial benefit therefrom, because contractual obligations in respect of fixed deposits are not broken. Therefore, when the interest rate on fixed deposits is' reduced, the new rate applies only to new deposits and very little benefit accrues to any bank until the deposits at the pre-existing rates come up for review. For at least twelve months, the benefit thus derived would not warrant a reduction of the interest rate on overdrafts. I assure the honourable member that this subject is watched constantly. ter in a position to say what matters will be dealt with at the forthcoming Peace Conference? I put my inquiry in that way because although certain matters may not arise, others will, and it would be useful if the House had before it some information in regard to the matters to be discussed. Secondly, I ask the Prime Minister what particular principles will be contended for by the Australian representatives at the conference.

I do not suggest a private meeting for preference, but I realize that some problems may not lend themselves to public discussion. In brief, to what degree will the House be given an opportunity to consider the principles to be advanced on behalf of Australia in relation to,matters that will arise at the conference ? known, some matters associated-with the peace will not be discussed at the forthcoming Peace Conference. It is doubtful, for instance, whether questions relating to the final peace with Germany and with Japan will be discussed. I confess to some difficulty regarding the second part of the right honourable gentleman's question, in which he asked me to indicate the broad views of the Commonwealth Government on the matters that will come before the conference, because nearly all the subjects that will be dealt with were discussed at a conference of Prime Ministers in London recently. The broad outlines of Empire policy are known to the' Minister for External Affairs, who will represent Australia at the conference, and also to the Eesident Minister in London, Mr Beasley. Of course, they are known also to Mr Bevin, who will represent, the United Kingdom Government at the conference, and to other Empire representatives. The matters to be brought forward at . the Peace Conference were discussed by Empire Prime Ministers, and agreement was reached on the broad principles underlying the Empire's views of many of the vexatious questions associated with the restoration of peace in Europe*. As to the right honourable gentleman's suggestion that a secret session of the Parliament should be held, I point out that previous so-called ""secret sittings were not particularly successful from the point of view of secrecy. I shall, however, give consideration to the matter. a secret session be held. I said that in regard to some of the matters which will be discussed at the Peace Conference, a secret sitting might be regarded as desirable. WhatI really desire is that, at an appropriate time, there shall be some discussion in this House of the matters that will be determined at the Peace Conference. further consideration to the suggestion, be discussed at the Peace Conference a probably be held towards the end of the present session of this Parliament, and I should not like any discussion here to be embarrassing to representatives of the British Empire at the conference. The right honourable gentleman's suggestions will be given careful consideration. for the Army say whether it is the intention of the Army Department to vacate the military hospital at Marwee? If so,, does he know that that hospital is much better equipped than is the Prince of Wales Hospital at Randwick, and that in the opinion of medical officers the Marwee establishment is most suitable for a repatriation hospital? Will the right honourable gentleman have inquiries made with a view to the retention of this building as a repatriation hospital? invitation of the. honourable member for Lang, I accompanied him and other persons to the Herne Bay Military Hospital. I was greatly impressed by the high standard of efficiency and the type of buildings in use there. So far as I know, there has been no decision by the military authorities to vacate that hospital. I shall inquire whether the building can be used as a repatriation hospital when it is no longer required for military uses. 1 agree with the honourable member that the hospital at Randwick needs improving. Anything that I can do in consultation with the Minister for Repatriation to give effect to the honourable member's suggestion will be gladly done.

If so, what useful purpose is served by the Commonwealth taking over coal mines under the National Security Regulations, and what steps does the Government propose to take in order to secure resumption of work in its own mines ? whether the Coalcliff colliery is among the coal mines the employees of which are on strike at the present time, and since I do not know that, I am not in a position to answer the latter part of the honwho is conferring with all Commonwealth orable gentleman's question. WIRE NETTING. of the continued absence of supplies of galvanized materials in Queensland for house building and water supply requirements, and the shortage of galvanized wire and wire netting throughout that State, will the Minister for Works and Housing institute inquiries to ascertain whether Queensland's full quota has been received; if it be found that supplies have been delayed owing to shipping and other hold-ups, will he give an assurance that action will be taken to relieve the present very acute shortage and have Queensland's requirements of these important materials immediately despatched ? say offhand whether Queensland has the questions, will the Minister state what received its quota of galvanized materials possible use there can be for the replies or whether some supplies have beenheld received ? up because of lack of shipping or through other causes.

Minister, and Treasurer) [3.56] -by leave I move That the hill he now read a second time. The purpose of the bill is to provide for the application of certain moneys which had» accumulated in the hands of the Central Wool Committee during the war in respect of activities outside the provisions of the wool pura g r e e d I take it the right honourable chase agreement with the United Kinggentleman refers to the original agreedom Government. This subject was dealt ment made in 1939 or 1940? with at some length in a statement in this House by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) on the 11th April last. The Minister, after explaining how the moneys had accumulated, announced that the Government had decided that they would not be taken into Consolidated Revenue and would not be distributed to individual growers, fellmongers,. top-makers and manufacturers concerned, but would be used for the benefit of tbe wool industry, particularly for research and promotion of the use of wool. Proposals had, at the time, been drawn up to use the fund in those directions, and it was announced that these would be discussed with representatives of wool-growers. I shall mention briefly some of the main points of that statement. Under the wool purchase arrangement, the United Kingdom Government agreed to purchase the Australian wool clip for the period of the war and one clip thereafter. The arrangement covered the , whole of the clip, with the exception of wool used by Australian manufacturers. For three years, the contract price was a flat rate of 13.4375d., Australian, per lb. Later, in 1942, as a result of representations by the Commonwealth Government, the United Kingdom Government agreed to an increase of 15 per cent., which raised the price to the satisfactory figure of 15.453125d. per lb. Growers have been paid the contract price in respect of wool bought by the United Kingdom Government, and a similar price in respect of wool' sold to Australian manufacturers. Each grower received initially the appraised price according to a "" Table of Limits"", which recognized a price differential as between various qualities, and at the end of each season he also received a supplementary payment to bring the average appraised price up to the flat rate contract price. As between the United Kingdom Government and the Commonwealth, it was agreed that any final profit made hy the United Kingdom Government on sales of raw wool for use outside the United Kingdom should be divided equally between the two governments.",20,Australian Victory Contingent

The Central Wool Committee, in addition to handling the wool purchase arrangement for the United Kingdom Government, has carried out other activities which have resulted in certain moneys being collected on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. moneys have mainly arisen from the following sources:Skin-wools Wool tops, noils and waste ex. ported from Australia pursuant to tlie National .Security (Wool-tops) Regulations Deferred price on wool content of manufactured goods exported from Australia, pursuant to the National Security (Price of wool for manufacture for export) Regulations These are provisional figures, and other transactions-will probably bring the net accumulation to over £7,000,000. When the ""wool purchase arrangement was commenced in 1939 it was announced by the then Prime Minister( Mr ments and the growers. The representaMenzies) that wool derived from sheepskins would not participate in any adjustment over and above the appraised price, which was to be the final and only price paid for such wool. This was necessary in order to enable the fellmonger, when purchasing woolled sheepskins to fix a firm price for the wool content of such sheepskins. This was 'confirmed each season to all concerned by the Central Wool Committee. £2,400,000 represents the difference between the appraised price paid to fellmongers, and the purchase price received from the United Kingdom Government, and covers transactions of six seasons. . The control of the export of wool tops, noils and waste was vested, in the. Central Wool Committee under National Security Regulations. The overseas market in wool tops to be supplied from Australia increased mainly because of the inability of the United Kingdom to supply India during the war. Topsmnkprs were paid the cost of raw wool, plus other charges and profit, and the excess price obtained from overseas buyers was collected by the Central Wool Committee. Although this involved exports, the United Kingdom Government intimated that any moneys derived from these operations, were for the account of the Commonwealth Government. As I have already mentioned, raw wool used by Australian manufacturers was excluded from the wool purchase agreeThese ment, and the manufacturers obtained their wool at a price lower than the export issue price "". The growers were, £ however, paid the United King... .. 2,400,000 dom contract price. When woollen goods were exported, the' exporter was not allowed to retain the benefit of the price concession, and was .. 2,700,000 required to pay to the Central Wool Committee a deferred payment representing the difference between the amount, actually paid for wool and the "" export issue price"". Although this transaction related to exports, the United Kingdom .. .. 1,550,000 Government stated that it was agreeable to the whole of this deferred payment being retained by the Commonwealth Government. I now come to the discussions which recently took place between the governtives of both grower organizations put forward the request that the moneys should be distributed to the growers who had supplied wool under the war-time purchase plan from 1939 to 1946. For the . reasons already outlined, the Government indicated that it was not prepared to accede to that request Other representations were made that the moneys should be used as capital in the finance of the The amount of new Wool Disposal Plan, subject to the recognition of ownership by the wool suppliers of 1939-46. The Government did not accept this suggestion. I wish to make it clear to all concerned that under the wool purchase arrangement with the United Kingdom Government the growers received the"" full contract price each season; the moneys now in question arose from activities on behalf of the Commonwealth Government quite outside that arrangement.

71,Mr Chieley,"I shall arrange forcannot, after full consideration of all the facts, see any justification for distribution to the growers, or for recognition of the claim for ownership by growers. As a matter of interest, I think a good case could have been made for the payment of the moneys in question to Consolidated Revenue, as they accrued, for use in war finance. In that event there would have been no accumulation in the hands of the Central Wool Committee, and the present claim by growers would probably not have arisen. However,the Government is prepared to adhereto its earlier decision not to retain the moneys in Consolidated Revenue, but to ask Parliament to appropriate them to a trust fund for the benefit of the 'industry, and the bill contains proposals to that end. The bill sets out the purposes to which the fund may be applied. This follows generally the lines recommended by a departmental committee on which there was a representative of the Wool Consultative Council' and representatives of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. The fund may be invested in Commonwealth or State securities, and the capital and income of the fund may be applied for purposes associated with the-wool industry, including in particular(i) Research in the production and use vides, first, that a candidate's -allowable of wool.

I think it will also be agreed that money spent in election campaigns on goods and services in the early Commonwealth parliamentary contests went considerably farther than money . goes now, and, on this ground alone, a very substantial increase of allowable expenditure is justified in order to ensure that every candidate shall have a reasonable opportunity ""to reach the whole of his electorate and to press his candidature. The bill also alters the wording of section 146 of the Electoral Act. This is due largely to the development and use. of broadcasting in political contests. Broadcasting has been found to be almost indispensable in the conduct of a campaign and is, as all honourable members will recognize, an expensive but effective method of campaigning. Furthermore, it is recognized that the use of telephones has become indispensable in the modern technique of electoral campaigning. In recognition of these two factors, it is proposed to insert in section 146 of the act authority for the expense incurred in radio broadcasting, and the temporary installation and maintenance of telephones at a candidate's committee rooms, to ""be regarded as a permissible expense. It is proposed further to alter section i.46 by substituting the word "" places "" for Mr Johnson. "" halls "" in the item authorizing expenditure on public meetings.

The purport of these provisions is, first, to prohibit the exhibition of ""posters intended or calculated to affect the. result of any election or referendum, of any size exceeding 60 square inches, and, secondly, to make it an offence for any person to write anything of an electioneering nature directly on any roadway, building, &c. ' The Government believes that the continued application of these provisions concerning the size of posters used in Commonwealth elections and referendums is completely justified at the present time because of the' shortage of materials . used in such posters and signs. It might be interesting to mention at this point that, in. the last elections for the House of Representatives held in 1943, there were 345 candidates, all of whom would indulge to a gerater or less degree in the use of signs and posters in pursuance of their candidature. One type of advertising commonly used, namely, 6-ft. by 3-ft. calico signs, at a modest estimate of 50 signs for each candidate, would involve the use of over 40,000 yards of calico that is to-day in short supply. It will be agreed, I think, by all reasonable people, that the use of such an enormous amount of material that is in short supply for a brief election campaign, after which it would be of no further use, could never be justified. Furthermore, it would involve the use of a considerable amount of timber, and even paper and newsprint are not so plentiful as to justify an 'alteration of the conditions laid down for the last federal election. The time has not yet arrived when we can revert to pre-war practices in electoral advertising. These restrictions do not give advantage to any party or candidate, and it is believed that their retention will be in the best interests of all concerned. adjourned. 1946.

Tou have rebuked the honorThat the bill be now read a second time. first time in my experience honourable members are called upon to debate a measure which has not been explained by tlie Minister who introduced it. One would not expect a Minister to treat even a minor measure in such a cavalier fashion; but this is not a minor measure. It is one of tremendous consequence to the people engaged in the wheat industry. We are obliged therefore to read the bill, and to understand it to the best of our ability. The views that I hold in regard to the measure have been formulated after reaching my own conclusions about the wheat industry, bearing in mind the Government's record of administration of that industry, and'after hearing the expressed views of wheat-growers themselves following various conferences. On numerous occasions, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) has said that the Government's plans for the wheat industry are in complete harmony with the views of the Wheat Growers Federation, which organization the Minister accepts as being representa' tive of the growers. The Minister will have to offer something more than this bald assertion to prove to me and the House, .let alone the wheat-growers, that the Government's policy has the approval of growers' organizations. tralian Wheat Growers Federation composed? no relation to the matter now under discussion. opinion held' in regard to a levy on ' wheat „ when the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill was before this chamber. does not intend to allow this discussion to become another second-reading debate on the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill already passed by the House.

The Minister presented this bill, and I ros*. at once to make my second-reading speech on the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill. the Minister did introduce this measure without explaining it to the House. The task of explaining certain aspects of it, therefore, falls upon me. First, the bill provides for a levy on wheat in certain contingencies, for five years commencing with the 1945-46 crop, which already has been compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth under the National Security Regulations, and by virtue of the Commonwealth's constitutional authority. In respect of that crop, this legislation infringes the Constitution by providing ' that the terms of settlement shall involve, not the payment to growers of the full realization price of their-wheat, but the contribution of a substantial portion of that realization price to a so-called stabiliseason's crop be not included in the plan as zation fund, from which payments may or may not be made to the growers concerned, or to other growers, at some undetermined date. It may easily happen that the levy imposed upon wheat-growers in respect of the 1945-46 crop will never he disbursed amongst wheat-growers at all, because this legislation provides for its own termination at the end of five years. As a layman, I shall not offer an opinion as to the legality of this proposal; but from the point of view of common equity, and what the Australian citizen understands to be his rights under the Constitution, I say that the position adopted by the Commonwealth Government is untenable. This action is. without precedent, and it will, itself, establish a precedent which will create tremendous doubts in the minds of Australian citizens. There is no justification for the Government asking the Parliament to authorize the appropriation of a portion of the realization on wheat grown last year for the establishment of a stabilization fund for the future advantage of, at best, some wheat-growers. The Minister has said many times in this House that everything that is implicit in its wheat industry legislation has the endorsement of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. but it was the Challenging the honourable gentleman on that point, I shall quote from the official organ of the Australian Wheat Growers, Association The Victorian Wheatgrower, dated the 17th April of this year. The publication is headed "" Official Organ of the Victorian Wheat Growers Association"", which, of course, is the Victorian element of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. On the front page there is an article headed "" Federation's Wheat Stabilization Plan"". The article gives a description of that plan, and' states that a conference called to determine the federation's policy on this matter arrived at certain conclusions. It proceedsThis conference approves the necessity for the introduction of a satisfactory plan for the stabilization of the wheat industry on the following lines:The second of the lines stated isThis federation requests that the 1945-46 it has been acquired under the National Security Regulations. I challenge the Minister to reconcile that statement with his repeated announcements in this House that the Government's plan, in all respects, has the approval of growers' organizations. which the honourable member has referred is not the official organ of the federation. not try to trap me on a technicality, because' he is on very weak ground. This is the official organ of the Victorian Wheat Growers Association, which, as I have said, is associated with the federal body representing the wheat-growers of Australia. The Minister stands revealed as not having been candid when he said that the federation was in agreement with the Government on every point of this plan. federation agreed to every point of the plan; but that, in the main, the plan had the approval of organizations representing wheat-growers. v",25,Scully

116,Mr Spender (Warringah) [4.51],"not heard one word from the Government in .justification of that. The clause continues(2.) Subject to a lower rate being prescribed by tbe regulations, the rate of the charge per bushel of wheat exported by any person, other than the Board, shall be fifty per centum of the amount by which the price per bushel for export of fair average quality bagged wheat free on rail at the port of export, as declared from time to time by the Board, or such lower price as is prescribed, exceeds Five shillings and two pence. (3.) Subject to a lower rate being prescribed by the regulations, the rate of the charge per bushel on wheat of any season exported by the Board shall be fifty per centum of the amount by which the average price per bushel free on rail at the ports of export for. fair average quality bagged wheat of all the wheat of that season exported by the Board, or such lower price as is prescribed, exceeds Five shillings and two pence Shorn of its legal verbiage, that means a levy of 2s. 2d. a bushel on wheat harvested after the 1st October, 1945, and exported on and after the 1st December, 1945. That feature of the legislation must be considered in relation to what was the position of the wheat-growers when their 1945-46 crop was acquired from them. Harvesting, I understand, commences near the end of the year-thi s bill names the 1st October-and continues to January and sometimes February of the ensuing year. The substance of my attack against this bill is that clause 4 relates to five crops of which one is a crop already garnered. It is injportant to direct attention to the law of the land. When one knows that, one sees how fundamental is the objection to this legislation. The Constitution provides that the Commonwealth shall not acquire any one's property except on ""just terms"",'and, of course, it cannot acquire for any purpose except a Commonwealth purpose. I leave aside for the moment any question of whether this bill can be said to be for a Commonwealth purpose. Elsewhere, no doubt, at some time that will be debated. On the assumption that the legislation is in that respect valid, I confine my remarks to the proposition that the last harvest was taken from the wheat growers, who, under the Constitution, and under the National Security (Wheat Acquisition) Regulations, were entitled to compensation on just terms. Having reached the stage at which they are entitled to that compensation, they are to Mr Spender. be deprived by this bill of 2s. 2d. a bushel of that compensation. There can be no escape from that. It has been said in the courts on more than one occasion that no ministry can escape its responsibilities under the law to pay just compensation. In the case, Apple and Pear Board v. Tonhing, which was, I think, the first major case on this matter decided after the commencement of hostilities, the court made quite clear that even where the Government provides, as it does in the wheat acquisition regulations, that, on the acquisition of wheat or any other commodity by the Commonwealth, compensation on a specified basis shall be paid, that compensation, whatever may be provided in the regulations, shall be just compensation, in accordance with the law of the land. This provision of our Constitution was modelled largely on the Fifth Amendment of the American Constitution, which says, in substance, that no person's private property shall be expropriated except on the basis of proper compensation judicially determined. It is important tolook at the provisions of the National Security (Wheat Acquisition) Regulations -under which this last crop was acquired; and I propose to show that despite those regulations, giving to the wheat-growers a specific basis of compensation, the Crown, in a most reprehensible manner I contend,"" now proposes to say to the growers, "" True, you are entitled to certain compensation on a basis, laid down.in the regulations, but do not intend to pay it to you, because simultaneously we propose to impose a levy of 2s. 2d. a bushel"". In respect of tbe last cropI am directing my attention to the last crop-regulatio n 19 providesThe .basis of the compensation to be recommended by the board shall be the rate or rates per bushel arrived at by reference to the surplus proceeds from the disposal of the wheat, but from the compensation determined by the Minister, the board may make deductions on account of any or all of the following . .' _ I now summarize-first , the price-or value of cornsacks; secondly, transport charges; and, thirdly, dockages. It is quite plain, therefore, that what the regulations entitled the wheat-grower to when the last crop was acquired was the f u l l realized value of the crop less those spprifir deduction?. Th.it W*J= a contract made by the Crown in respect of that erop. The Crown now proposes by the -objectionable manoeuvre contained in this bill to escape from that responsibility. Most of this crop has been realized. We know that the export price at present is approximately 10s. a bushel. Therefore, it is relevant to quote what the learned Chief Justice, said in respect of the Australian Apple and Pear Marketing Board when the case which I have mentioned came before the High Court. He was dealing with the argument that had it not been for the fact that some board had the responsibility of marketing apples and pears, the grower, perhaps, would not have been able to market his crop at all, and, consequently, that fact had to be considered when determining fair and just compensation. That argument was rejected by the High Court which said, in effect, that it had not to deal with a hypothetical position, that it knew what this particular quantity of frui t brought in the market, and that was the amonnt of money which the Commonwealth, by law, was compelled to pay. The Chief Justice saidI t has been argued that the value of the fruit should be determined by taking opinions as to what, in the circumstances of (1) glut in the market (2) the fact that the board might not -""ell the plaintiff's fruit at all, a purchaser -of the fruit would have been prepared to pay for it. In my opinion the court is not remitted to any such speculation in. this case. The defendants cannot say that the fruit is worth less than the amount for which the defendant board actually succeeded in selling it. When there is evidence of the price which goods have actually brought when marketed in an ordinary course it would be contrary to common sense, when determining their value, to ignore this direct evidence and to seek evidence consisting of opinions as to what the goods would, «pon certain hypotheses, be likely to bring when so marketed. What is the result in respect of the 1945-4.6 crop? The result is that under the Wheat Acquisition Regulations, which cannot in any event override the expre-s law of the Constitution, there was an obligation upon the Wheat Board, having acquired this 'wheat, to pay its realized value. In a way which I can only say is morally wrong, if not legally indefensible, the Government proposes now to do indirectly what it 'could not do directly. No honourable member could contend that the Commonwealth is not obliged under the terms of the law as it now stands to pay to the wheat-grower the full realized value of his wheat, less the expenses of marketing. By this bill the Government proposes to escape from that responsibility, and to do indirectly what it could not do directly. It proposes to pay 2s. 2d. a bushel less than the realization value of the wheat after the deduction of marketing expenses has been made. Upon what ground can that be defended ? This is, of course, part and parcel of the' stabilization scheme. But does that fact justify this action? If a levy were made divorced from the stabilization scheme, and it was made retrospective, I venture to say that every honorable member conscious of his responsibility would want to know why it was being made retrospective. And' that question has still to be answered, notwithstanding the fact that it is a part of the total scheme. From this bill one can only draw the inference that a similar contention will be raised as was raised in respect ""of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill, namely, that the justification for this extraordinary, and I say, advisedly, reprehensible, action of the Government in expropriating from the wheat-farmer what was his real compensation, is that this proposal was a subject of contract, or .arrangement, between some body who purported to represent all the wheat-growers and the Government. A brief analysis will show how utterly ridiculous is such a suggestion. In the first' place, no one can contract my rights away. Whatever rights I have under the law, no one can contract them away. Even if I am the only one who remains out of a scheme I am entitled to the.?e rights. And in this particular case, unless I am wrongly advised, the body which claimed to represent the wheat-growers member's contention we cannot have a stabilization scheme. Minister did not listen to my comment upon the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill. If he did, he' certainly did not answer it.

Appparently,-the next.argument is, "" It does not matter, whether you -decide to start from the end of last year -or the year before, or you are breaking the spirit of the law, or whether you are, in reality, extracting money from the wheat-grower's pocket"". I notice that the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Langtry) is in the chamber. I have for the honorable, gentleman almost an affection when he sings those pleasant ballads with which he sometimes regales my ear. But I require from him something more than ballad-singing. I invite honourable members opposite, who represent wheat-growers, to attempt to .justify ibis expropriation. I do not want them to avoid the issue by using general .phrases about stabilization. I do not want them to tell me that some organization contracted on behalf of the-wheat grower when obviously it had no legal right to do so.

That is my proposition. If the honourable member for Perth( Mr it apply to a crop which had been' sown Burke) believes in the justice of this particular scheme, he can justify the antedating of this bill so as to cover the last three or four harvests. On what ground ? Because, he will say, some organization which pretends to represent all the wheat-growers spoke on their behalf. Let us have no more of the suggestion that any body can speak on behalf of any individual unless that person gives to it the right to do so! I am satisfied that the majority of wheat-growers did not speak through that organization. Even assuming that they did, what right has anyone to deny to the minority, ho matter how small, its legal rights under the Constitution? I rest my. argument, not upon legal grounds only, but also upon high ethical grounds. The ethical grounds are that when a man's property has been taken from him by the Crown, he shall be paid the full measure of its value. The Crown should not, by any manoeuvre^ strategem, seek to avoid that liability. If that proposition is incorrect, then, in the words of the honorthere are no limits to which this vicious procedure can be extended. It could be said that, for the purpose of stabilizing the funds of the Commonwealth to meet claims for compensation made by persons whose property is resumed, there shall be imposed upon all property which is resumed a levy of so much in the £1. There is no difference between one propoHonorable sition and the other. Therefore, I record my objection to this bill upon the following grounds:-First, it is retrospective; secondly, by its retrospectivity, it extracts from the wheat-grower what was his money, if not at law, then certainly in the intendment of the Constitution; and, thirdly, it cannot'be justified, ;in respect of this crop, as being necessary for the stabilization of the wheat industry. This bill provides the machinery by. which the wheat industry stabilization scheme will be implemented. Therefore it is necessary to test the measure in three, specific ways in order to determine whether or not it will meet the requirements of the industry. The first question that should be asked is: "" Will this legislation be retrospective in its action; will prior to the initiation of the scheme ?"" It is imperative, in fairness to the",32,Scully

131,Sir Earle Page (Cowper) [5.20],"growers, that the bill should apply only to crops planted after the introduction of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill in this Parliament. The second question to be determined is: "" W ill that portion of the price which will be allowed to remain in the hands of the farmers, be sufficient to cover the actual costs of production?"" -That is not in order. I hope that, the right honourable member will not attempt to debate the amount of the price remaining in the hands of the farmers. That is not related to the bill. The only amount dealt with in the bill is the excess price. putting the question in an inverse way. Sub-clause 3 of clause 4 expressly states that the amount to remain in the hands of the grower will be 5s. 2d. a ""bushel. It statesSubject to a lower rate being prescribed by mers must be able to show a definite profit the regulations, the rate of the charge per bushel on wheat for any season exported by the Board shall be fifty per centum of the amount by which the average price per bushel free on rail at the ports of export for fair average quality bagged wheat of all the wheat of that season exported by the Board, or such lower price as is prescribed, exceeds Five shillings and two pence. reference to the amount that will remain in the hands of the farmers is only for the purpose of determining what the balance shall be. point I wish to make is that the balance left in the hands of the farmer should be equitable, having regard to the full price. right honourable gentleman misunderstands me. I said that the amount of 5s. 2d. a bushel referred to is merely the amount above which a levy will be struck. The right honourable member may refer only to the levy. Speaker. My third question is: ""For what length of time will this charge operate?"" These three questions apply the test that will determine the fairness and, ultimately, the practicability of the scheme. The answers will show whether or not the scheme, will have the desired effects of increasing production and of stabilizing the position of the farmers. Dealing .first with the retrospective effect, I point out that similar legislation introduced by me in this House in 1940 expressly provided that the crop being harvested at that time should not be subject to any stabilization charge. The first crop to be included in that scheme was to be the 1941-42 crop. Sowing for that crop started in March or April, .1941, some months after the bill -had been passed by Parliament. By this means, the farmers were given a fair deal. Those who wished to participate in the scheme were able to do so, and those who did not wish to participate were able to refrain from planting wheat. They were given the opportunity to decide the matter for themselves. But this bill is retrospective, and we should consider first the effect that it will have on the farmers themselves. If we are to have successful stabilization of the industry, the farin the first year of the operations of the scheme. Otherwise they will not continue to participate in it. Let me com-' pare the position of the wheat industry to-day with its position during World War II . , and even during World WarI . In 1914-15, the total value of the wheat crop was over £7,000,000. In 1918-19, the value of the crop was £20,000,000, nearly three times as great as in the first year of that war. In the first year of World War II . , the total amount received by the wheat-farmers was over £31.000,000. In 1944-45, the total was £7,583,000, representing about one-fourth of the value of the crop in the first year of the war. In fact, the returns from wheat in the last three years of World War II . totalled £11,000,000 less than returns in the first three years. Furthermore, costs were rising during the war. honourable member is not entitled to deal with the receipts of farmers or costs of whether the 1945-46 crop, which is referred to in sub-clause 1 of clause 4, should be included in the scheme. honourable gentleman is making a speech which he should have made last week",33,Scully

The first point I shall discuss relates to clause 6, which provides that the act shall continue in operation until a date, not being earlier than the 30th September, 1950, to be fixed by proclamation as the date upon which the act shall cease to be in operation. The honourable memthis as a provision for a five-year plan, and, no doubt, in substance that is true, but it may be-a plan for more than five years. The bill is designed to enable the act to terminate by proclamation, which, after all, may be issued at any time after the expiration of five years. That seems to me to increase the confusion, because it means that the plan is certainly for five years, and that its duration thereafter will be outside the control of the Parliament, and will depend upon the executive decision of the Government as to whether a proclamation should be issued. SoI make that simple qualification upon what the honourable member for Indi said; but in substance he is no doubt right in saying that, insofar as this is a plan for a certain period, it is a plan for five years. What does that involve? As far as we can judge, there is a strong probability that at the end of five years the stabilizaI am surprised that he is not willing to tion fund, which is to be established out of the charge to be made under this bill, will be in credit.

What is to happen at the end of that time? Let us assume for this purpose, as the honourable member for Indi wisely did, that at the end of that time there will be a large credit balance in the stabilization fund. What is to be done with it is not being settled. large credit balance? should' be; I said there well might be. The Minister will agree with me thatj if the world parity price of wheat remained high for the next few years more reason why there should not be a large credit balance. very good reason why there should be. If the world price remained high, the levy made upon the growers would have built up the stabilization fund to the amount, maybe, of a good many millions of pounds. the price remains high ? correction, but I thought that the whole essence of the idea was that when the world price was good there was to be a levy, so that the fund might be put in credit, and when the world price-was low those credits might be used to stabilize the.price at its guaranteed level. what is ? does not intend that, I give the matter up. I ask the Minister to assume-and assume it-that over the period of five years the credits will exceed the disbursements from this fund. What is to be done with the credits at the end of five years? That is a point upon which the House would have appreciated some information, but there is nothing in the bill to enlighten us upon it. There will simply be a fund which can be dealt with at the end of five years by the Parliament, according to the then constitution of the Parliament, and according to the views of the then majority of the Parliament as to how such funds should be treated. That seems to me, as it seemed to the honourable member for Indi, a most powerful argument for extending the term of this scheme to ten years. Over that period we are much more likely to",36,Scully

I have no doubt that if I could see into the minds of his legal advisers I should find them arguing that whatever may be the position regarding the acquisition of property, taken by itself, there is a power to establish some kind of pooling system for .the future, and that if this power is exercised to provide for the stabilization of prices, then you may escape from the terms of section 31 of the Constitution.

The meeting was conHad a fairly close acquaintance. ThusI question the Government's growers' scheme on two grounds: first, the durapresent the Perth decisions on wheat stabilization of the scheme; and, secondly, the tion to the Minister in person. That was-the proposal to go back on the past and taku intention, and there was no other intention. away rights which the supreme organic It was realized that, although the Minislaw has given. Both proposals are inter was an energetic man and had defensible, and certainly have not been defended at any stage of the debate. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. I support the amendment, because I believe that the Government has not taken into account fully the wishes of the wheat growers. Statements that have been made in support of what the Government alleges to be the desires of the growers are unsound. A postponement of this measure for six months would give to the Government, and particularly to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully), time to re-examine the matter thoroughly, and would facilitate the automatic exclusion of the 1945-46 wheat crop from .the provisions of this legislation. That action would be hailed with pleasure by the wheat-growers generally. At a meeting held in Perth in April of this year, the Australian Wheat Growers Federation carried a resolution including the following:That the federation request that the 1945-46 harvest be not included in the plan as it had been acquired under National Security (Wartime) Regulations. culture has said that at a later date he a postponement of this measure in order those engaged in the industry.

It is of paramount importance, not only to wheat-growers, but' also to .the whole of Australia that the 1945-46 wheat crop be excluded from the scheme.

After years of drought able member' may only advance reasons for the postponement of the bill. postponement is desirable in order that the Government may have time to reconsider its decision to include the 1945-46 crop in this scheme.

I have ruled that it is not admissible. ' upon another matter ? This measure seeks to impose a charge upon all wheat exported from Australia harvested on or after the 1st October, 1945. Is it not pertinent to argue that there are reasons why that particular harvest should not be included in the plan? question upon which I ruled. I regret that the honourable member has not taken a closer interest in the proceedings. The question of the inclusion of 1945-46 crop could be debated upon the motion for the. second reading of the bill. The honourable member for Wimmera is now speaking for the second time. He has already spoken to the motion and, therefore, he may now speak only to tbe amendment, which is that the bill be postponed for six months. He may give reasons in support of the amendment, but may not discuss the original motion. your ruling, Mr Speaker. I am most anxious to give my reasons why the bill should be postponed for six months. One reason is that many wheat-growers have incurred liabilities with country storekeepers and others and have given undertakings that they would meet their obligations out of the proceeds of the 194546 crop. They entered into commitments believing that they would -receive payment in full for that crop. If the amendment be agreed to, the Minister will have time to reflect, in which event he may decide to exclude the 1945-46 crop from the scheme. He will ' agree, I am sure, that persons who' enter into financial obligations, honestly believing that funds will be available to enable them to meet their commitments, should not he denied access to those funds by retrospective legislation. Wheat growers are men of vision, and, even before they fallowed the land to be sown for the 1945-46 harvest, they realized that they must finance their activities.

He may not .make another second-reading speech, but he may advance arguments to show why the bill should be postponed for six. months. the opinion that the bill should be postponed for that period to enable the Government to review the situation. The Minister, may have seen in the Sydney Morning Herald a report of threatened legal action by wheat-growers. I do not think that the Government desires litigation and therefore a further opportunity to consider the implications of this legislation is most desirable. In the Sydney Morning Herald of the 20th July last, under the heading "" Wheat Men take Legal Action; Forbes move against Stabilization Plan"", the following appeared:The Forbes Wheat Defence Committee has decided to take legal action to restrain the Federal Government from including the 19454G wheat crop in its stabilization plan. The committee announced its decision at a ledge of primary production knows that meeting at Forbes yesterday. Its action followed the announcement on Thursday by the general president of the Farmers and Settlers Association, Mr Hugh S. Robertson, that the association had decided to seek legal opinion on the validity of the Government's plan for the 1945-46 crop. v."", C104] In order to prevent a legal battle between wheat-growers and the Government, a postponement of this bill is desirable, particularly as the Government claims that its purpose in introducing the measure is to confer a benefit on wheat growers. On this occasion I would vary the old adage, "" Hope deferred maketh the heart sick "", and say that "" The bill deferred will -make the wheat-grower's heart glad "". I support the amendment that consideration of this measure be postponed for a sufficient period to enable the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) „to give further consideration to his proposal. During the debate on this bill arguments which we have heard on many occasions recently have been emphasized, but, unfortunately, they seem to have made little impression on the Minister. He seems determined to get his hands on the proceeds of the 1945-46 wheat crop. In other words, the Minister seems determined to take from the wheat growers who harvested wheat in the 194546 season at least. £7,000,000, which should go into their banking accounts. The bill before us purports to be one for the stabilization of the wheat industry, but it is rather a measure providing for acquisition under a scheme which requires wheat-growers to contribute, from their own pockets, money to protect themselves. That could be done without any aid from the Government. Nothing has been said by the Minister, or any supporter of the bill, to justify the proposal that 50 per cent, of the amount received for wheat in excess of 5s. 2d. a bushel shall be paid into a stabilization fund. The only justification for the Government's proposal which the Minister has advanced is that as the price of wheat is now high this is a good time to establish such a fund. The Minister seems to have forgotten the difficult times which wheat growers have experienced during recent years. Every person who has any knowlife on the land, whether as a wheat grower, a dairy-farmer, or a grower of sugar-cane or bananas, means that losses and profits over a number of years must be averaged in order to arrive at the true . position.

Not one defence has been raised by the Minister against the charge levelled by honourable members on this side of the House that the Government parallel between what is proposed in this proposes by this measure to perpetrate a bill and what has been done in respect of ""steal"" of £7,000,000 from the pockets other industries. of the wheat-growersin respect of the 1945-46 harvest.

The Minister could still do £100 to £300 would represent a substanjustice to those who will contribute to tial loss. The sec'cnd main objection to the bill as a revolving basis, whereby those who is that it makes no provision for the pay into it but who, subsequently, for wheat-grower -who leaves the industry some reason or other, leave the industry, before the termination of the scheme. been given no thought in this measure.. submitted by the Minister is based on the credited to the fund on their behalf to mistaken belief that a wheat-grower will be recorded so that when they leave the always remain in the industry.

In some electorates these changes represent 30 per cent, of the number of people on the roll. It may be said that within a period of three years the changes in the number and occupations of persons on the electoral rolls would average 20 per cent. That represents the normal turnover of people changing from one town to another, fro'm one electorate to another, or from one occupation to another. I agree that in the wheat industry the movement may be lower than the average in other industries because a wheat-grower, having his own home on his property, is more stabilized in his occupation than are most members of the community. Nevertheless, there is a constant turnover in the wheat industry itself, and it is in respect of those wheat-growers who will not remain in the industry that the Opposition is most concerned. I support my colleagues in their efforts to safeguard the interests of such people. may include me among, his colleagues on this matter. orable member, as-1 also do the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie1 Cameron) and, of course, the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr proceeds for certain purposes are baseHughes) who also has given us his counsel and advice in this important matter. ter, not a single Labour supporter has spoken in favour of the bill. the honourable member for Hume( Mr it. This legislation is more ethical Fuller) who is usually most vociferous in his advocacy of the Government's proposals has remained strangely silent. The honourable gentleman is apparently afraid to commit himself. Thus we have the spectacle of the Government' benches being packed with silent supporters of the Government, not one of whom has been courageous enough to attempt to justify this "" filch "" of £7.000,000 of the wheat-growers' money this year. However, honourable members on this side of the House, though they lack numerical strength, refuse to remain silent in face of the injustice which the Government proposes to perpetrate on the wheat growers. thati f the members of the Australian Country party were given enough rope they would hang themselves. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) expressed concern as towhat would happen to money in the Wheat Industry Stabilization Fund in the event of the winding up of the stabilization scheme. I remind him and his colleagues that section 6 of the Wheat Industry Assistance Act 1938 providedThere shall he kept in the fund an account to be known as the Wheat Tax Account to which shall be credited out of the receipts of the fund all moneys collected under the Flour Tax (Wheat Industry Assistance! Assessment Act 1938, on wheat exported from Australia or upon wheat produced and sold in Australia. That tax is similar to the tax provided for in this legislation. able member had better deal with this tax. the honourable member for Richmond about a "" steal"" by this Government in imposing a charge on wheat exported from Australia and then allocating the less, becaure the proposal in this legislation is on all-fours with the-legislation of 1938, which was passed when the honourable gentleman was a Minister. This bill provides that excess money in the fund shall finally be refunded to the wheat-growers who provide than was the 1938 legislation,because tbe money raised under it was distributed to distressed wheat-farmers, who may not have paid one penny into the fund.

I may not have spoken at all but for the tedious repetition and misrepresentation of honourable gentlemen opposite. Only the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and the honourable member for Barker( Mr farmers. Both this measure and the Archie Cameron) debated the bill fairly. As a layman, I am not prepared to enter a legal argument with such a renowned, lawyer as is the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), the great wheat-grower who is so. interested in this bill, but when I asked a question of tbe Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), who is as competent as is the honourable member for Warringah ,to give legal advice, he failed to verify the contentions "" of the honourable member for Warringah. Honourable members opposite would have the people believe that this legislation applies only to the 1945-46 pool and not to any subsequent pool. That is not so. National security regulations identical with this legislation were made by the Menzies Government, of which honourable members opposite were all members or supporters. member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull), whom I congratulate on not having been associated with the Australian Country party in this Parliament at that time. Later those regulations werereplaced by legislation. A 50 per cent, levy was imposed. There was no question then of just compensation to the persons from whom the wheat was acquired. The argument about just'terms has been raised now merely to delay the passage of the bill. The tedious repetition that has characterized the stone-walling of honourable gentlemen opposite shows that the aim of the Opposition is, at. all costs, to prevent this bill from becoming law. Opposition supporters have harped on the fact that. I did not deliver a second reading speech on this bill, but they know, as the general community knows, that my second-reading speech on the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill covered this bill, too. Moreover,, the Leader of the Opposition acquiesced in leave being given to introduce this bill before the debate on the second reading of the other bill was resumed after I had made my second reading speech. Over and over again,, honourable members opposite have referred to the equity in the"" wheat industry stabilization fund that might be created by the individual contributions of Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill were discussed at the last meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council. At that' meeting the measure was debated clause by clause and accepted as drafted. Unless the States pass the complementary legislation we shall not be able to implement this stabilization scheme. Minister has referred to the necessity of the States passing complementary legislation. In view of the ruling you gave earlier, Mr Speaker, that honourable members could not discuss the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill, I ask whether the Minister is in order in debating that bill. the Minister to refer to what took place and to show the necessity for the States to pass complementary, legislation. He is in order, in replying to speeches made during this debate, in showing that, despite the fact that some honourable members have mentioned the names of people opposed to the scheme, the Australian Agricultural Council agreed to this legislation. The Minister would be doing leas than justice to this legislation if he failed to do that. opposite contend that the scheme should operate for a period of ten years.

However, I gave a definite undertaking to the council that the States would be called together three years hence in order to discuss the continuance of the plan. That aspect is fully covered in the agreement with the States. Honourable members opposite have contended that the equity of individual growers in the pool is not safeguarded. Any grower who is subjected to a levy will have some equity for a time at least, but his equity will be determined by the price at which wheat is sold subsequently. For instance, the price of wheat might decline in the second year,' rendering it necessary to absorb the surplus at the end of the first year in order to build up. the price to the guaranteed price of 5s. 2d. a busheL"" Then, in subsequent years tbe Commonwealth would guarantee that price. That is a specific provision in the agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the growers. I stated definitely at the last meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council that all individual growers who had paid the levy would have an equity in any surplus that might exist at the end of the first five-year period; and I declared without hesitation that at the end of that period any surplus should be distributed amongst growers who had an equity in the pool. tribution be effected if a record of the names of growers is not kept ? ber knows that it has been the practice to keep a record of the names of growers in respect of pools. But I remind him that governments which he supported did not make such provision under legislation which they enacted dealing with the wheat industry. The attitude of honourable members opposite shows clearly to the wheat-growers that the Opposition is, doing its best to destroy this scheme. Honourable members opposite are making every effort to persuade the wheat growers to bring pressure upon the States to refuse to pass the complementary legislation without which no Commonwealth-wide wheat stabilization plan can be implemented. The arrant humbug of the members of the Australian Country party in this matter has been clearly demonstrated in this debate; but I believe that wheat-growers from one end of the Commonwealth to the other realize that fact and will deal with the members of that party in no uncertain manner at their first opportunity. Amendment negatived. .Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clause1 agreed to. Clause 2This Act shall come into operation on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent; Dir. ARCHIE CAMERON (Barker) [8.48] I m o v e That the following new sub-clause be added:"" (2.) This Act shall not he submitted for the Royal Assen until it has been approved by a majority of registered wheat-growers at a postal ballot."" I move the amendment for various reasons. We have been told that this legislation is the outcome of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States. The Australian Agricultural Council cannot bind either the Commonwealth or State parliaments. All that the members of the council can do is to bind their respective governments. Each of those governments must submit complementary legislation to their respective parliaments, and in due course those parliaments will pass, or amend, the legislation drafted by the council. It would be much easier for us to debate the measure if we were favoured by the Government with a sight of the proposed State legislation because we could then see the scheme in its entirety. Thus, we now have: First, the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill which we passed under great difficulty; secondly, this measure which is experiencing a stormy passage; and, thirdly, legislation which is still in the realm of darkness. The second point I make is that the Minister has stressed time and again that this legislation is the result of an agreement between himself as Minister for Commerce and ' Agriculture and the Australia Wheat Growers Federation. With very great respect to that .body, I do not think that it can",44,Scully

229,Mr Scully,"The honourable memcommit of Australia to this scheme. excellent reasons for believing that it does not speak, and never has spoken, for a majority of tbe wheat-growers. As proof of my contention, I desire to read extracts from a publication entitled Wheat Farms of Victoria. This is a sociological survey made in 1946 at the Melbourne University by Alan J. Holt, partly at the expense of the Commonwealth Government.' A fte r Having made a survey of the Wimmera and Bendigo districts and the north-west of Victoria, Mr Holt wrote. Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers Association -Forty-si x per cent, of wheat farmers were financial members of this organization. For4 per cent, members it was their only social organization. Several of the interviewees held' executive positions; one was president of the local branch and three others secretaries of local branches. In addition there were four at least who had been members but were unfinancial at the time of visit. Members were ""all confined to groups of medium and low production rating, and comprised a higher proportion of Mallee than Wimmera farmers. farmers were members as well as owners, but managers were not. It is said that the association owes its origin to tbe Country party organization when in 1028-29 during an internal disruption, a group attempted to form a wheat-growers' wing as distinct from rural township members. A committee was formed, but after a brief existence recommended that the wheat growers' section be formed outside the political movement as an "" industrial "" or "" economic "" organization. brought in during the last few years: in any case, many wheat-farmers are small wool growers as well. While it is still a separate organization, it has a similar membership. All interviewees who were Country party members are also members of the Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers Association. Many interviewees of other political opinions than Country party exp'ressed the opinion that they would be niembers of the association had it not been for the apparent close' connection between the Country party and the association. The association is stronger in the Mallee, where many rural branches have been formed. Wimmera branches are almost all confined to country towns. This may be in name only, however, and may be due also to the fact that the towns are closer together in the Wimmera than in the Mallee. Dealing with the political set-up, because that must be taken into consideration, Mr Holt United Country Party -This political party plays a very important part in the life of the Mr Archie Cameron. all of the wheat-growers wheat areas. At least 23 per cent, of the I have farmers interviewed are active members of the party. Only4 per cent, are recorded as members of the Labour party and 0 per cent, of the United Australia party (commonly regarded as the conservative party, and since reconstituted as the Liberal party). 1 he balance did not belong to any political organization. I submitted my amendment because I desire very clearly to 'convey to the Minister my firm belief that no organization in Australia speaks for the whole of the wheat-growers. The Australian Wheat Growers Federation speaks for some farmers, but in South Australia, there ""is .in addition to that organization the Grain Growers Association and the two organizations have certain differences of opinion. I firmly believe that the only way in which to obtain the views of the farmers regarding this stabilization scheme is to conduct a postal ballot ,and allow the wheat-growers who are interested enough to return their papers, to decide whether they desire this legislation. That is the democratic approach. The situation now is entirely Tenants and sharedifferent from what it was at the outbreak of the war. A t that time, I would never have advocated the course that I am recommending now, because, quite clearly, the Government then was seizing or commandeering all the wheat and other primary products for war purposes. What the growers thought of that act did not enter into consideration, just as the views of workmen were not considered when the Small wool-growers were Labour Government decided to conscript them for war service.. Conditions now are entirely different from what they were in 1939. Now, we are endeavouring to legislate for peace-time conditions, and, therefore, we are under an obligation to ensure that the people who have most to lose and most to gain from this scheme shall be properly protected. It is without precedent that a government should levy a charge on wheat under the conditions which the Minister' proposes, although the principle is the same as that which the righ t honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) incorporated in legislation in 1941. Wheat prices then were so low compared with prices ruling to-day that the two situations cannot otherwise statedbe compared. The contribution which wheat-growers will be required to make under this bill w ill be more than one-half of the total value of.the wheat at the time the right honourable member for Cowper introduced the bill in 1941. In my judgment, the only satisfactory approach is to allow the wheat-growers to express their opinion regarding the proposal. If a majority of them favour the scheme, I shall have nothing further to say about it. But until the growers have expressed their views, I cannot accept the decision of a meeting of two or three men from each State who claimed, for example, that the whole of the wheat-growers of South Australia are in favour of this scheme. I do not believe, at this stage, that such aclaim was correct. honourable member for Barker( Mr able and the extent to which the finances Archie Cameron) made a point which is overlooked by the contending factions in this game of "" political wheat football"". Whilst the wheat-growers of' Australia, and the farming community generally, aim at organization on the lines o:f the trade union .movement they have not yet advanced to the position that the trade union movement reached at the -beginning of this century. The group of farmers' organizations, such as the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales, the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, the Wheat Growers Union and the Settlers Association of Queensland make extravagant claims that they speak on behalf of all the growers of a particular product. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr many people. Scully) is then placed in a very invidious position in trying to obtain agreement among all the growers' organizations. As the honourable member for Barker pointed out, some of those organizations have political affiliations, either written or unwritten. On a contentious subject like the stabilization of wheat, particularly on the eve of an election, politics are introduced and the welfare of the producer 1 tends to be overlooked. In my electorate, a clear division is approaching between farmers, not on the value of the stabilization scheme, but on whether the Australian Labour party is serving the best interests of the growers. That conditionof affairs is unfortunate because the growers are not sufficiently organized industrially to be able to risk a failure of their scheme of industrial organization by throwing it into the ring in'a political brawl. The farmers will come off worse. Throughout history, the food producers have been at the mercy of speculators who, recognizing that people must have food, used great pressure to corner food, and then demand a price which they fix instead of allowing the law of supply and demand or the needs of the situation to determine it. In my opinion, the Minister acted wisely in requesting the Australian Agricultural Council to discuss wheat stabilization. The State Ministers for Agriculture and their staffs have a profound knowledge of our agricultural economy. They appre-. ciate just how far the scheme is practicof the Commonwealth and the States are able to support a scheme that depends for its revenue upon export values. When the Labour party was in opposition, we criticized the government of the day for not paying what we considered to be adequate prices for wheat or wool. Now, honourable members opposite are in the role of critics of the Government. According to reliable estimates, 20,000,000 people ih the world will die of starvation. In other countries, there is sufficient food to feed them. The problem is lack of means of distribution. Those facts should make honourable members think deeply about the subject of food, instead of introducing politics into a subject that means life or death to so The honourable member for Calare( Mr Breen) has driven home the point which honourable members on this side of the chamber have been impressing upon the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully). The honourable member stated that we should disregard politics and discuss the means to stimulate wheat growing. What is more likely to stimulate the production of wheat-the payment to growers of the export price of 9s. 7£d. a bushel, or the payment of the stabilized price of 5s. 2d. a bushel? .The question answers itself. Therefore, I cannot understand the inability of honourable members who speak in that fashion to compel the Minister to use common sense. The additional income which the growers of the 1945-46 crop would receive",45,Scully
230,Mr Breen (Calare) [8.55],The,47,Scully
231,Sir Earle Page (Cowper) [8.59],"if that crop were excluded from the sta1 bilization scheme .would enable them to recover much of what they had lost during -the last three years of drought. Under ^the taxation law, any losses incurred can be offset against subsequent profitsi; conaffect many of the growers in bis sequently, they would not have to pay tax on a good deal of this additional income, because, undeniably, they have had severe"" losses. They could utilize the money in the improvement of their properties and the repair of their machinery. Therefore, the proposition of the honourable member for Barker that they shall be given an opportunity to express their opinion is a sound one. If the Minister will not submit the whole matter to them, he should at least ask them whether or not they are willing that the 1945-46. harvest shall be included in the stabilization scheme. I am wholly in favour of stabilization. The present scheme, in general outline, follows the scheme that I submitted to the Parliament in 1940; but my proposal differed from this in that it deliberately excluded the wheat harvest which, at the time, was being delivered by the growers, and provided that only future harvests should be embraced in it. Any grower who did not wish to be bound by the scheme could refuse to grow wheat. I beg the Government to treat this matter on a non-party basis. Surely, if the farmers themselves were asked to decide whether or not the 1945-46 crop should be included in tbe scheme political considerations would be excluded! Who is introducing such considerations? Surely the Government is, by resisting all attempts to enable the growers, who own. the wheat and are entitled to the proceeds from the sale of it, to decide what procedure shall be followed. with the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) in congratulating the honourable member for Calare( Mr Breen). That he is the only Labour representative of a wheat-growing electorate who has chosen to speak, makes his contribution to the debate the more notable. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Barnard) -'Order!

I should have thought that on such an issue the representative of Hume( Mr Fuller) would hold an opinion, because it will electorate. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The Chair has ruled that the honourable member. must discuss the amendment. concerned with the question whether all wheat-growers are to be deprived of what they reasonably anticipated would be their complete returns from the last harvest. There are wheat-growers in the electorates of Riverina and Wannon who might have expected their representatives to have an opinion on the matter. The honourable member for Calare has pointed out that the farming community as a whole is not so well organized industrially as are trade unionists. It appeared to me that he is moving towards the conclusion that their organizations are not yet competent to be consulted by the Government That, of course, is beyond doubt. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) has mentioned a book recently produced by the University of Melbourne, with the assistance of the Department of Post-war Reconstruction, in which it is stated that in Victoria, one of the highly organized wheat-growing States, fewer than 50 per cent, of the wheat-growers are members of a wheat-growing organization. What the percentage is in the electorates of the honourable members for Forrest( Mr Lemmon) and Swan( Mr Mountjoy), who have not spoken on this measure) I do not know, but probably it is less than in the electorates that I have mentioned in New South Wales and Victoria. If the Minister is to be guided by the speech of the honourable member for Calare, who argued that the. wheat-growers' organizations are not so fully representative of the industry as to justify their views being regarded as decisive, the only sensible and fair thing is for him to consult all the wheat-growers. As the result of war-time pools, all of them are registered. It would, be the simplest thing to abstract from the records of the Australian Wheat Board the names of all the registered.",47,Scully

The Ministry regards a referendum of the people of Australia as a good thing when it wishes to obtain a decision to its own political advantage. This matter is not touched by politics. Ifi t were put to the growers they could decide, free from all party affiliations, whether they want their assets to be "" grabbed"", virtually stolen; to be possessed retrospectively.

Of course, that is necessary if this legislation is to operate as desired, but there would » be a far better chance of its acceptance by the State parliaments if this clause were eliminated. The wheat-growers generally are opposed to the plan, and that is due pre now in a far worse economic position difficulties. Nobody knows that better than the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture.

Therefore, in arguing that the clause be postponed, surely an honourable member may refer to the effects of drought on the position of the farmers. We must have regard to the pej-sons whom this clause will affect, and to understand how it will affect them we must understand also how Charge BiU 1946. 2897 they have been affected by drought. Therefore, I submit .with"".respect, that your ruling is wrong. for altering my ruling. man, incorrectly anticipated my argument. I was about to say that, owing to the drought, many farmers would not contribute to the fund from the proceeds of the 1945-46 crop. It is .highly desirable that the contributions of wheat growers to the fund should be as even as possible. Therefore, there seems to be a sound reason for omitting the 1945-46 crop. Another, consideration is that north-western Victoria, and parts of South Australia and New South Wales are now faced with the danger of a serious grasshopper plague. money for the 1945-46 crop would enable them to take measures to cope with the grasshoppers. Honourable members may laugh, but if they understood how necessary it was for farmers to get a good crop next year they would not laugh. It is a very serious matter. The growers are certainly opposed to the inclusion of the 1945-46 crop, and I now voice my opposition to it also. honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) has advanced reasons which, he claims, should induce the Minister-for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) to exclude the 1945-46 crop from the provisions of this measure. One reason was that when wheat-farmers fallowed for the 1945-46 crop, they undertook' commitments to business people, storekeepers, &c, and that as a consequence, they are in dire need of the f u l l price realized for that wheat twelve months after it was harvested. But the export parity price ruling when fallowing for the 1944-4'S wheat crop was carried out was 6s. 5d. a bushel-it had risen sharply from January, 1944, when it was less than 5s so 63. 5d. should be acceptable. However, that is not the reason why honourable members opposite are protesting against the inclusion of the 1945-46 wheat crop in this scheme. Their object is to prevent the inauguration of any stabilization",50,Scully

262,Mr Breen (Calare) [9.30],"Thescheme that will give to the grower, over the years, all that his labour produces -as follows:They want to make the product of the wheat-farmer something on which they can gamble. I have listened to honourable members opposite criticizing certain individuals who have been accepted by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture -as advisers, for which service they have been paid out-of-pocket expenses. Questions such as "" Is he on the pay-roll ?"", have been asked. I am sure that not many honourable members opposite can live on their parliamentary allowances of £1,000 a year. ""Most of them have other interests, and I do not say that disparagingly. The point I wish to make is that the real reason for the opposition to this scheme and the criticism of this particular phase of it, is a desire to torpedoe the stabilizaiion plan altogether. However, the wheat""farmers are awake to that danger. The -following letter was sent to me by a wheat-farmer in my electorate, and has been publishedAs a returned soldier from two world wars I have some knowledge of what we owe to Britain and the British. When I find that we are selling wheat to .'Britain at 10s. 4d. per bushel, and when we ""know that the British are literally starving ""* themselves to feed the rest of the world, I i-wonder if we"" realize just how much we owe to -the people of that country? We are selling wheat for milling at 5s. 2d. per bushel, and we are selling wheat for stock feed at 4s 6d. per bushel, but we demand the full export price when we sell wheat to the people in the United KingdomI am a wheat-grower and I can find plenty to do with all the money I get, but I -would be glad to take less for my crop' if the' British people were to get cheaper food. A lower price to Britain could be partly balanced by a home-consumption price of 10s. 6d. per bushel. I can visualize honourable members opposite saying to the people of this country, "" ""We intend to charge 10s. 6d. a bushel for wheat consumed in Australia so that we can sell wheat to Great Britain at 5s. 2d., a bushel"". It is not hard to imagine what the reply would be. The letter continuesAs things are going now, it looks as if we should remove the kangaroo and the emu from our coat-of-arms and replace them with Ned Kelly and Shy lock, the notorious Jew. That letter, written by Mr K. T. Allen of Rob Roy, New South Wales, is commented upon by ""Peter Snodgrass"" in J/r. Breen. the New South Wales Journal tbe Land People generally are not conscious of any responsibility in this matter. It is none of our business if the people in other parts of the world are starving, it is their business. That is the attitude of honourable members opposite. They are concerned with only two things: First, they seek to make political capital out of the starvation of unfortunate people -overseas; and secondly, they want to torpedo a scheme which_ in the long run will mean the salvation of the wheat-grower. It is most significant that in the course of this debate we have not heard from the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) any attempt to justify"" this clause. The honourable member forCalare( Mr Breen) has made a valiant endeavour to stop the. drift, but with little success. He has sought to establishtwo things: First, both in his speech and by interjection, he has alleged that the Opposition's amendment is opposed to letting the British people have wheat at a low price. We on this side of the chamber all favour Great Britain having wheat at a low price, if that 3s necessary; but-and this is the vital difference-w e do not believe that the burden of such a concession should be carried entirely by the Australian wheat-growers, of whom there are only approximately 60,000. If Great Britain needs wheat at a price less than the world parity price we should meet that need; but let the burden be carried by the whole community. The honourable member's second contention was that the Opposition's amendment was intended to torpedo the stabilization -scheme'. The honourable member has not proved that statement merely by making it. He was driven to that extremity in order to find some explanation for this unjust clause which makes provision of the inclusion of the 1945-46 wheat harvest: So that there will not be any misapprehension about this matter, I .foreshadow an amendment following upon that of the honourable member for Wimmera. Clause4 (1) (it) provides that a charge shall be levied on all wheat harvested on or after the first day of October, 1945, and exported from the Commonwealth, whether by the board or by any other",51,Scully

With the object of excluding the 1945-46 harvest I propose to move that the words "" on or after the first day of October, one thousand nine hundred and forty-five "" and "" on or after the first day of December, one thousand nine hundred and forty-five "" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" on and after the commencement of this act"" in each case. It is, I hope, competent for me to move the amendment which I have foreshadowed. Sub-clause (1.)

It would place the issue clearly before the committee, and would enable us to decide whether or not the 1945-46 harvest is to be included. submit that it is not competent for the committee to agree to an amendment such as has been foreshadowed by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr grower was entitled, as a matter of right Spender). I think that he knows that that is so. This bill is the result of a resolution carried in Committee of Ways and Means. That committee instructed the Minister to bring in a bill to give effect to that resolution. The amendment would alter that resolution. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Barnard) -Order! The honourable member for Warringah has only foreshadowed his amendment. time of the committee would be saved if I made that point clear. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The Chair will determine that point when it arises. honourable member for Dalley( Mr That is to say, the charge will operate in Rosevear) participates in a debate in committee, he seems to get lost. The Minister in charge of the bill said that there was no distinction between making a levy in respect of a past crop and imposing a levy in respect of a future crop. I do not know what the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) thinks about-that; he is of age and can speak for himself. I am sure, however, that he would not controvert that there is a vital distinction between a levy made retrospectively and one made prospectively. This is a levy made retrospectively, and I repeat what I have said before, namely, that a levy made retrospectively is a vicious thing unless the most overriding reasons of public policy justify it. I have heard nothing so far to justify this retrospective levy excepting a reason which the .Government is not prepared to admit, namely that it is another way of stealing something from wheat-growers. When the 1945-46 crop was acquired by the Wheat Acquisition Regulations there was vested in the wheat-grower a right to compensation. That compensation must be full and adequate. Where the wheat has been realized-wher e there has been a market to show its realizationfigure--it has been made clear that the realizable value is tbe amount of tbe fair and adequate compensation. The second point is that when the wheat was acquired the wheatunder the then existing law introduced by the present GovernmentI refer to the Wheat Acquisition Regulations-to full and adequate compensation determined in accordance with the realizable value of his wheat. Australian wheat is being sold in New Zealand at a fraction over 9s. 7d. a bushel; in other overseas countries it is being sold at 10s. a bushel. The effect of this legislation is that the wheat grower is to be deprived retrospectively of his right to that money by the imposition, of a charge of 2s. 2d. a bushel on wheat already taken from him and vested in the board. Sub-clause 4 of clause 4 readsWhere wheat products are exported, the charge shall be imposed on the wheat equithe valent of those products. respect of all wheat in the possession of a wheat-grower. During this debate I have not heard one word to justify that provision. I do not raise my argument on",52,Scully

So that the matter may be debated, I desire to make further reference to those regulations. They provide that upon a proclamation being published in the Gazette the crops became vested in the board. Thereupon, all property in the wheat crop passed to the board. The wheat-grower's right was then converted into a claim for full and adequate compensation, because regulations provided that compensation should be equal to the realized value of the wheat, less certain specific charges incidental to realization. No honourable member can say that on the faith of those regulations a wheat farmer would not have been entitled to. the equivalent of export parity for his wheat, less certain charges incidental to realization. The Government's proposal is to take from the wheat-grower, under the guise of a retrospective levy, the compensation to which he clearly was entitled. able member does not understand the position. x ber for Dalley is not now presiding-over our deliberations, and it is competent for honourable members to dispute with him. The honourable member thinks that he is the only -member who knows anything. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! remarks to the subject before the Chair. I hope that the honourable member for Da'ley will do the same. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The Chair will take care of that matter, should it arise. ber can say that, both legally"" and morally, the wheat-grower is not entitled to the full realization of his 1945-46 cron, less the charges incidental to realization. That is his right under the regulations, and -also in commercial morality manoeuvre the Government seeks to take from the wheat-growers of Australia large sums of money which will have the effect of relieving the Government from the necessity to meet the costs of its stabilization scheme. If the Minister cannot see any distinction between taking away a vested right and taxing -the wheat-grower in the future I am afraid that I cannot help him to see the inequity of his proposal. The Government can defend its action only on the ground that it was agreed to by somebody who did not represent all the wheat-growers. In respect of the future the wheat-grower knows where he stands; he can plan his budget and knows the incidental effects of the bill on his operations. In respect of the past he had every right to assume that the price of realization was his but that is now to be taken away from him. ^ The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member's time has expired. Sub-clause 1 of clause 4 reads as follows:A charge is imposed and shall be levied and paid(«)' on all wheat harvested on or after ' the first day of October, One thousand nine hundred and forty-five . . . . I emphasizethe year 1945. This is the 23rd.day of July, 1946, and we are now considering imposing a levy on wheat harvested on and after the 1st October, 1945, almost ten months ago. That wheat was probably sown in May and June, 1945, thirteen or. fourteen months ago. When the facts are stated in this manner it becomes obvious that this levy constitutes a retrospective tax on the wheat grower. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) expressed the optimistic view that the Minister might accept his amendment and exclude, the 1945-46 harvest from the provisions of the bill. The honourable member is indeed an optimist because, if his amendment were accepted it would mean that the Minister would have to drop about £7,000,000 of "" loot "" which he proposes to take from the wheat-growers in order to initiate this so-called stabilization and decency.

It is evident indeed that the Opposition is fighting a forlorn battle; the numbers are against it and the Government will have its way. Whilst honourable members opposite who are supposed to represent wheat-growing electorates should be willing to range themselves alongside the Opposition in its attempts to exclude the 1945-46 harvest from the provisions of the bill they are strangely silent. The honourable member for Calare( Mr Breen) read a letter from a constituent who would be very generous with the wheat-grower's money. The writer was prepared to sell to the under-nourished people of Great Britain wheat at lower than world-market prices.' He said that if we did otherwise we would be guilty of exploiting the straits in which the people of Great Britain were placed. Whilst 10s. 4d. a bushel might be considered a high price by comparison with the price that prevailed over the last few years, I agree with the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) that if generosity is to be shown to the people of any country the cost of that generosity should be borne by the whole of the community and not by one section whose product is required by them. The support of the honourable gentleman for such a proposal is to say the least of it extraordinary. tion to make from my remarks. duction-1 am able to make. We realize that all our efforts on behalf of the wheat-growers will be fruitless because we have not the numbers to prevent the Government having its way; nevertheless., we shall not be prevented from objecting to this proposal with all the vigour we can command. prevent the honourable member from stone-walling the bill. to fight against a principle which we believe to be wrong, whether applied to the wheat industry or any other industry. What would the Minister say if honourable members in Opposition suggested that the wages of workers should be subjected to a tax having a retrospective effect over the last twelve months? However, because the wheat growers represent only -a small body of approximately 60,000 individuals the Government believes that they will stand for anything. It has been suggested that the issue should be determined by a i><il!ot. We know that the holding, of a ballot is the last thing the Minister desires to do. ' The TEMPORARY CHAIR-MAX The holding of a ballot is not involved in the clause. moved by the honourable member for Wimmera was that the clau.=e be postponed as an instruction to the Government to exclude the 1945-46 crop.

If the honourable member for Warringah and the honourable member for Richmond assume that that is the idea of the wheat-farmers, they are deluding themselves. scheme provides for a levy on wheat when prices are high to create a fund from which equalization payments shall be made when prices are low. That is the scheme in this bill, which provides for a guaranteed minimum price of 5s. 2d. a bushel. The Opposition is protesting against the inclusion in the scheme of a crop harvested when uncontrolled inflation was rampant in some countries overseas and Unrra was demanding food for the starving people of Europe regardless of the cost. That is why the price for that harvest was so high. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member must confine his remarks to the clause ber for Warringah and the honourable discreetly and said that we would diyide member for Richmond think the returns the committee to discover those in favour from that harvest should not be used of taking money from the wheat-growers to supplement the pool against the day in a manner which I am sure the wheatwhen prices may be low, I think they are growers believe to be both illegal and the only people in Australia who hold improper.

The honourable member will not be permitted to make a second-reading speech at this stage of the bill. point, I was about to mention that the product of this industry has both high and low overseas prices. Those who are engaged in it can maintain themselves in it only by averaging their income. When the bulk of the wheat-growers planted the 1945-46 crop they had been through a series of adverse seasons and prices, but a year ago they had moved into a period when they knew from answers to questions given by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture that the export value of their wheat had reached 9s. a bushel. They were sustained by the knowledge that they could recoup some of. their losses from the high overseas prices. Upon that assumption, which was founded upon the whole of their experience and their conviction of their rights under the Australian Constitution, they budgeted for the next year, as every one engaged in rural industries is bound to budget in advance. They now are to be obliged, as the result of this legislation, to re-assess their incomes from a crop that they have harvested. Here is what they find in simple figures. If the amendment be rejected and tbe bill be passed in its present form, every farmer who delivered 1,000 bushels of wheat will receive £54 less than he expected. But, of course, 1,000 bushels'is not a normal delivery. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Lemmon) said that in twelve days he had sown 500 acres of wheat. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member will not be permitted to indulge in a wide discussion of the industry on this clause. man who sowed 500 acres of wheat would expect, on an average yield, to harvest from 7,000 to 8,000 bushels. A man who harvested 7,000 bushels will have his income reduced by £379 if this bill be -passed in its present form. If he delivers 8,000 bushels his income, under this pernicious measure, will be decreased by £433. There has not been an occasion previously in the history of this country when men have produced a product and have had it compulsorily acquired by the Government under terms which were explicit at the time of the acquisition, but which has been subjectlater to a decision by caucus to introduce legislation the effect of which will be to take from £300 to £500 from individual growers. The industry cannot bear such an impost upon the incomes of those engaged in it. This is not an abstract argument; every wheat-grower, with pencil and paper, will work out how much he is having stolen, or improperly taken, from him. With the permission of the committee I incorporate the following table in Hansard:Amount proposed to be withheld for stabilization fund 2s. 2d. per bushel, being 50 per cent, of difference between 5s. 2d. and 9s. 6d.

Minister has some difficulty in interpreting the language of the Leader of the Opposition. I listened carefully to the right honourable gentleman, and' I have no doubt on that point. The Minister knows that the legality of this measure has been challenged, not only in this chamber, but also in Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia, wKere wheat-farmers are banding together and voluntarily subscribing funds with which to fight the Government in the courts.",56,Scully

The point I make is that if an appeal to the High Court be successful, and this provision is proved to be ultra vires the Constitution the measure as a whole will be invalidated. The Government is jeopardizing the whole scheme by obstinately proceeding with this pernicious proposal. Every grower has -raised his voice in protest againstI nearly said "" steal ""-thi s expropriation. I appeal to the Government on the ground of equity and fair play. If it has any regard for our customary system of fair play it may still see the light and exclude the 1945-46 crop from the scheme. Secondly, I put the very powerful view to the Government that if its persistence with its proposal results in an adverse decision by the High Court, the and everything the Minister is trying to achieve will be lost. I cannot understand why the Government refuses to accept the suggestion that it postpone the commencement of the scheme until next year. Many attempts have been made to stabilize the wheat industry along these lines. We had an extraordinary opportunity during the war to obtain details with regard to all wheat farmers in Australia, including their names, acreages and production. I am loath to believe that the Government would"" wantonly throw away the opportunity now presented to it to capitalize what has been done in respect of the industry during the war. The Government, by persisting with its proposal to include the 1945-46 crop in the scheme, will seriously jeopardize the whole plan, because our experience has been that when the various States as well as the Commonwealth must enact legislation in order to make a pooling system possible, a small number of men are able to cause trouble, as was caused in respect of dried fruits and wheat. Therefore, we should try to establish the greatest possible goodwill towards the scheme generally. I estimate that the levy to be imposed on Uie wheat-growers will average 2.s. 6d. a bushel in respect of the total Australian crop. That levy will antagonize the wheat-farmers, particularly as it will follow the worse financial result in Australia for many years in the marketing of wheat. be 2s. 6d. a bushel on the total Australian crop. a bushel on all wheat exported, whole crop. one-third to one-half of the crop is disposed of in Australia, but frequently from one-half to two-thirds is exported, whilst in some years as much as three-quarters of the total crop has been exported. The question arises as to why the Government persists with this proposal. -cheme as.a whole will be invalidated, It is obvious that it cannot help the farmers financially in the ensuing year if they are to pay a levy of 2s. 6d. a bushel. The effect must be to cause the farmer a certain amount of harm. The Government cannot need this money as a special loan because it is well known that arrears of income tax amounting to many millions of pounds have not been collected. Is the object of the proposal to bring in money to the Government's coffers by way of a loan which does not carry interest? Judging by our experience after thewar of 1914-18,substantial amounts will be paid into the pool during the next few years. Why does the Government persist with this proposal? Does it wish to antagonize the farmers, or does it hope that the bill will be invalidated? Despite the interjection by the Minister when the honourable member for Indi Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) supported the point made by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) that the wheat acquired up to the present must be acquired on just terms. Apart from the 1945-46 crop, an agreement must be made with respect to the acquisition of future crops. If that be done, growers will know the",57,Scully

301,"( Mr Mcewen) Was Speaking, The","conditions under which they are to plant and deliver wheat in the future. They can then determine whether the conditions are just. They grow the wheat, they own the wheat, they need the money. The growers take the responsibility of accepting the conditions laid down by the Commonwealth; but obviously, the proposal to include the 1945-46 crop is expropriation. In those circumstances, the Government is not acquiring the wheat on fair and just terms. The only effect of this proposal will be to antagonize a large majority of wheat-growers, and arouse opposition to the stabilization of the wheat industry. That is the last thing that the Government should do. In the final analysis, this opposition will lead to an appeal to the High Court or the Privy Council, and the destruction of the stabilization scheme. That fate befell other marketing schemes, because a few growers were antagonistic to the proposals of the government of the day. were excluded, members of the Opposition would still raise objections to the scheme. introduced a wheat stabilization scheme. Before doing so, I discussed the proposal with the representatives of the wheat growers of Australia, and with the Australian Agricultural Council. Between 100 and 130 representatives of the Commonwealth, States and wheat-growers' organizations assembled in the Senate chamber, and after a full discussion, agreed to exclude the 1940-41 wheat crop which had been planted. The scheme commenced with the new season's crop, namely, the 1941-42 crop, although the bill had been passed in December, 1940. We realized that by excluding the 1940-41 crop, we would remove one of the causes of possible antagonism to the scheme. Recognizing that a stabilization scheme is necessary now, I urge the Government not to antagonize wheat-growers unnecessarily because any opposition to this plan may lead to the legislation being declared unconstitutional. During this discussion, I have heard hon-. orable members opposite threaten to submit amendments, although they knew that those amendments would not be in order. The amendment which is in order is that which proposes to postpone the operation of this clause. We should examine the clause for the purpose of determining whether there will be an expropriation or robbery which honourable gentlemen opposite have mentioned. The essence of the clause is that there shall be deducted from the proceeds of the sale overseas of all wheat including the 1945-46 crop, the amount in excess of 5s. 2d. a bushel. Onehalf of that excess will be paid immediately into the pool for distribution, and the other half will be retained for the purpose of stabilizing the wheat-growing industry for the next five years. If , at any time, the price of wheat should fall calamitously as it has in the past, the money which is retained for stabilization purposes will be paid to the farmers to guarantee that the fixed price will be maintained. Therefore, it is obvious that all this talk about robbery is so much pOlitica] "" eye-wash "". The only money that the farmers of Australia will lose will be the cost of administration by the board. That will be a charge against the accumulated funds of the wheat pool. As the farmer will have returned to him everything that was taken from him, how canthere be any robbery or expropriation. It is all very well for the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) to ""throw his weight about"" as a legal man, but he knows as well as I do that my analysis of the position is correct. bers opposite assert that the Government's proposal is wrong, and that before this scheme is introduced, the farmers should be invited, by ballot, to express their opinion regarding it. I ask: What will become of the minority of wheat growers who would be opposed to the scheme ? that. ment's legislative proposal will result in robbei-y and expropriation, will it not be robbery, through a referendum it competent fo'r the honourable member for Dalley to discuss a proposition which we debated on clause 2?

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Barnard) -The Chair has allowed members of the Opposition to make passing reference to the subject, and, in the circumstances, will permit members on the Government side to do so. I made a passing reference to this matter, the Chair ruled that my remarks were out of order, and refused me permission to proceed. Therefore, I submit that the Chair should not allow the honourable member for Dalley to proceed on similar lines* ' The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The Chair is not prepared to have its ruling canvassed. interruptions, I shall discuss the questions of robbery and sanctity of private property, about which the honourable member for Warringah spoke at length. If his argument about the sanctity of private property and. the property rights of growers in their crops is valid, the position will not be altered by the fact that a majority of wheat-growers are in favour of ' the stabilization scheme. If the stabilization of an industry by legislation is wrong, its stabilization by a majority vote of the producers is equally wrong; The minority, in such circumstances, will still retain their rights to their property. It is true that, at present, high prices are ruling overseas for wheat. The people of Great Britain, we are told, are underfed. They need wheat and,"" like Shylock, we are extracting the last drop of blood from them by charging them 10s. 2d. a bushel. merce and Agriculture fixed that price. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order!

The fact that honourable members opposite are so anxious to exclude the 1945-46 crop from this scheme is the clearest indication that they have no faith in the future of wheat prices throughout the world. the position to see whether my statement is nonsense. If the honourable member for Indi has faith in the continuance of the high prices' ruling overseas, it does not matter whether the Government commences the stabilization scheme this year or next year. If the scheme were postponed until next year, the Opposition would still raise the same bogy about robbing the wheat-farmers. member for Indi, like a greedy kid, wants all the toys and a big doll, too. He wants the people of Australia, through the Commonwealth Government, to guarantee for five yearsI heard him advocate even a period of ten years-the price of 5s. 2d. a bushel, and allow farmers, on the 1945-46 crop, the full benefit of the high prices ruling. overseas. Such things ought to work both ways. I believe that the success of a scheme can best be assured by starting it in a year when prices are high. A scheme could not prove successful if it were begun, after there had been a calamitous collapse of world prices. There must be that "" nestegg"" of a successful crop at the beginning. As we proceed, if existing prices overseas be maintained, and 'year after year the excess be applied, one-half to the pool and one-half to the stabilization of the price, at the end of the scheme all of those whose wheat had been included in it will share in the distribution of the excess amount. admit that. said so throughout. _ once. the scheme proved successful, it could",59,Scully

The quantities of each of the following produced in the year 1938-39 were:-Gal the country wholesalers obtain the goods free vanized barbed wire, 12,122 tons; galvanized of tax by. quotation of certificate, and are plain wire, 15,179 tons; galvanized wire netting, 12,240 tons. the Minister -for 2. The quantities of each of the following produced-'in the year 19413-40 were:-Gal"" vanized barbed wire, 23 tons; galvanized plain wire, 3,781 tons; galvanized wire netting, 5,397 tons. 3. Thequantity which will be' produced during 1040-47 depends upon the rate at which man-power becomes available to the wire drawing plants Despite every effort it has not been possible to provide sufficient man-power to enable full production capacity to be used, but the position has so far improved that the present rate of production would give a yearly total of-Galvanize d barbed' wire, 6,500 tons; galvanized plain wire, 7,000 tons; galvanized wire netting, 8,700 tons, and it can reasonably be expected that a gradual increase will take place as the men returned ' from the services resume their former employment. It should be noted that galvanized plain wire is being manufactured in 10 and 12}-gauges only, as full analysis against the pre-war size of 8-gauge which predominated. Asa result the present length of galvanized plain wire is greater in proportion to the tonnage than the pre-war production. . 4 Wire arid wire products are allocated to the various States .by the.Commonwealth control, which receives* full co-operation from the -wire drawers, to ensure an equitable share to each State. Control of distribution within a State iB the responsibility of the State government which will, no doubt, see that the various sections of industry receive .their fair proportion. upon notice1..

362,,"Mr CHIELKY -The^ . answers to. the 1 required to pay tax on their sales of the goods by wholesale, the tax being calculated upon the amount for which the goods are sold 2. No."" 3. Representations have .been received' on this subject at various times during the period of operation of tbVsales tax, not only by the present Government but also"" by preceding governments.. 4. City wholesale merchants do not pay tax at all on their sales to country wholesale merchants of goods for resale by them by wholesale. When .city wholesale merchants sell goods to country retailers at a delivered rice the tax is payable on the delivered price, ut when the sale is on f.o.r. terms, the tax is payable on a price which does not include freight. 5. The matter has already received consideration by each successive government since the inception of the tax. It is an essential feature of the whole scheme of the sales tax that the tax shall fall on the last wholesale sale oi the goods, and shall be charged upon, the amount for which the goods are sold. If this basic feature of the law were changed, it would involve the conversion of the' tax from a tax on wholesale transactions into a tax on manufacturers' sales only. It is considered impracticable to amend, the law to provide for the payment of tax by country wholesalers' upon any basis other than the price for which tbe goods are sold by them. ROAD-MAKING MAOHKTEBT . -1946; the honourable member 'for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) .asked me a question about the disposal of lend-lease road-making, equipment. There has been -no delay by my department in making lend-lease road-making machinery available to State government departments and local government authorities, which require it for road 'making and other public WOTKS. I h Queensland, the matter is handled on behalf of the State Government by the Premier's Plant .Allocation Committee under the chairmanship of the Deputy Co-ordinator of Public Works, Queensland. The committee has had submitted to it a very large quantity of plant,, including many lead-lease items and, although large quantities have been allocated; there are still numerous applications awaiting finality, mainly because the plant which has been offered to the authorities has not yet been accepted by them. Additional, plant is coming forward from service departments almost every week, and as this is received by my department it is readily made available to the various Answers to Questions. States. I can assure the House that there is ho. delay on the part of the Commonwealth Government in the alloca.tion of lend-lease and other' equipment to the States, for ultimate disposal. As a matter of fact, my department would like to see the surplus equipment taken up more readily by State instrumentalities, but this is .entirely in the hands of the State authorities. I suggest that the honourable member refer the Associated Chamber of Manufactures, Queensland, -which complained of delay in the allocation of lend-lease plant, to the chairman of the State Allocation Committee with a view to expediting any cases which may have been brought to notice.",67,Sales Tax
