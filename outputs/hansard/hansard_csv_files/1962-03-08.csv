When does the Government propose to give effect to the recommendation of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory on the provision of a safe, all-weather road between Canberra and Tumut? The recommendation was reported to both Houses in November, 1959. I ask the Prime Minister whether he will implement the recommendation, which contains these wordsThe Commonwealth Government would be justified in voting the amount necessary for the completion of the Brindabella route, to connect with the extension of the main Forestry Commission road. The estimated cost of a twolane gravel r o a d member is now proceeding to give information. The honourable member should not take advantage of an opportunity to give information under the guise of quoting from a recommendation. I point out also to the honourable member that we are all endeavouring to keep questions and answers short. that the estimated cost of this road is £212,000, exclusive of the already planned development of the route within the Australian Capital Territory. that the honourable member knows more about this road than I do, I will discuss it with my colleague. the Minister for External Affairs whether he can give the House any information concerning the .offer of Mr Khrushchev to President Soekarno of substantial financial aid to bolster Indonesia's weakened economy if the President will appoint a to the Postmaster-General. I recall to the Minister tor Finance and a Minister for Minister's attention the representations I Labour who are approved by Moscow. have made over the past few years for the Who was appointed to these portfolios in the recent cabinet reshuffle? Were not Czechoslovakia and other East European satellites of the Russian empire conquered by the Communists by similar tactics? know the honourable member's interest in avoiding the extension of Communist influence in our near north. It is well known that the Russians have offered considerable economic assistance to Indonesia. Of course, the Indonesians will well know of the risks countries run if they take aid from the Soviet bloc. I would have thought that the Indonesian leaders are astute enough themselves to have seen the possible trap and not to have fallen into it. As for ministerial changes, the Indonesian Ministry has been changed by proper constitutional process, as laid down in the constitution, and I can tell the honourable member that the new Minister for Finance is a gentleman who has held that portfolio before. I personally know of no reason to think that he is a nominee of anybody but the Indonesian Government. the Attorney-General. It concerns Mary Kathleen Uranium Limited and the contract which it has with the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. It had been strongly rumoured in Mount Isa that the contract between the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and Mary Kathleen Uranium Limited has been extended as to time and quantity for the production of uranium oxide to be supplied to the authority. Is this so? If it is, will he see that on this occasion effective arrangements are made to ensure that tribute ore suppliers participate in the increased tonnage of uranium oxide? this long question to my colleague in another place, and permit myself the observation that it would have been very suitable to go on the notice-paper.

Is he able to inform me -whether the consideration he promised me on those occasions has yet borne fruit? as the honourable member states in his question, that he has on several occasions .in the last few years discussed with me, and made representations about, the provision of better post office facilities at tion, may I remind him that I informed Essendon. It is also correct that I have told him on several occasions that the matter able in the ultra-high frequency band for would be investigated and that we would attempt to do something to relieve the situbroadcasts if a fairly general desire to have ation that he had described. The present situation, as I understand it, is that an examination has been proceeding and will be completed quite shortly into whether a new post office building should be erected on the present site or whether the present building should be renovated and extended. I am expecting a decision to be made in that respect very shortly. I point out that whatever decision is arrived at-whethe r it be for a new building of for renovations and extensions-it will then become necessary to follow the usual procedure of preparing a design, plans and specifications. Moresby. The Minister is reported to have That, naturally, will take some time, so I do not want to mislead the honourable member. I expect that all this should be completed within the next couple of years. to the Postmaster-General. The honourable gentleman will recall that when he announced last June that the Australian Broadcastthat was not accurate. ing Commission would close its frequency modulation broadcasting stations, he said that frequency space would still be available for such stations in the ultra-high frequency band throughout the Commonwealth. I now ask him: Have any steps been taken to restore frequency modulation broadcasting for listeners who prefer its static-free fidelity? I also ask him whether he can explain why Australia can no longer have frequency modulation stations when there are some 1,000 such stations in the United States of America, and also many stations in Britain. Germany, Japan and other countries. able members will recall that the proposed cessation of experimental frequency modulation broadcasts was discussed in this House on several occasions last year. I made a lengthy statement to the press, and copies of the statement were supplied to members of both Houses. I could give the honourable member a copy of that statement, which covers the whole ground. In immediate reply to the honourable member's questhe House that space would be made availa continuation of frequency modulation such a service reinstated were indicated by listeners generally. I said that we would be prepared to consider representations, but as yet I have not been informed of any such general desire. a question to the Minister for Territories by referring to a statement issued under the authority of the Minister on 17th February at a press conference in Port said that leaders able member is referring to a press statement he must be able to vouch for its accuracy, and must not quote it. its accuracy because I have never known the Minister to issue an official statement you do not quote from the text. Minister whether it is correct, as has been stated, that leaders in New Guinea have asked that New Guinea be constituted as the eighth State of the Commonwealth. Did the Minister suggest to them that the natural sequence would be to establish New England as the seventh State and then New Guinea as the eighth?

18,Mr Drummond,"I desire to ask thegrateful for the testimonial given to me by the honourable member for New England. IfI can claim accuracy, it may be because I do not try to. interpret the motives or secret thoughts of other people. I have no idea what was in the mind of the indigenous people of Papua and New Guinea when they expressed to me their wish that, eventually, they should become the eighth State of the Commonwealth. Whether they had New England, or the Northern Territory, in mind as the seventh State, I do not know. In talking of becoming the eighth State, what the people really said-and they said it in . many places in the Territory with great ' clarity-wa s to this effect: At present they certainly want Australia to remain in the Territory to look after them and their welfare. They realize that they are advancing towards self-government, and their present view, which I should say is the view expressed by a very big majority of articulate people in the Territory, is that when they 'reach the stage at which they can undertake self-government they would like to remain in continuous association with Australia. The best way that they can see of doing it is by entering into an arrangement to become an eighth State. Treasurer whether consideration is being given to the relief of parents with school children who have to pay 12± per cent, sales tax on books and other school accessories. If consideration is not being given . to this subject will the Minister see whether it is possible to relieve the parents, not only of university and high school children, but also for school children in lower classes, of the whole or part of the sales tax paid on school books and requisites? ment has shown, in many practical ways, its recognition of the problems of parents and its sympathy with the needs of their situation. As is well known, we have assisted them by way of tax deductions for school expenses, and in other ways we have been of direct assistance. Even as recently as the time of the presentation of the latest Budget, action was taken to assist the family the honourable member refers did not seek man with regard to sales tax on certain hems any approval of mine, nor did I have any of furniture and other consumer durables. What the honourable gentleman proposes concerns a matter of policy which would normally be examined at the time when the Budget arrangements are in contemplation, and I shall see that it is not overlooked when that review is being made. Primary Industry given any further consideration to the setting up of an inspection and control system to deal with the export of kangaroo meat? been considered seriously by the Government on many occasions. Considerable technical difficulties on the administrative side are involved, mainly because of the conditions under which kangaroos are slaughtered. They are mostly shot in remote areas, and the department can exercise no control during the important period between 1 shooting and processing. The department would require, as a prerequisite to export under its control, the provision of storage and handling facilities in accordance with its instructions as to standards. The quantity of kangaroo meat being exported at the moment would not justify the Commonwealth's meeting the heavy expense involved in an inspection service, because it would be essential for all meats to be inspected before export, there being known diseases among kangaroos. Immigration whether his approval was sought or given for a recently retired departmental head, who is still a deputy chairman of the Commonwealth Immigration Planning Council, to accept a directorship of the Sitmar Line, which operates three migrant ships running between Italy and Australia. How can he justify this gentleman's being at the same time in a position to advise the Department of Immigration and in a position to profit from contracts with the department?",13,Papua And New Guinea

Bradfield Park Housing Settlement-Taxa tion-Immigration-Loca l Government Finance-Posta l Department-Televisio n -Decentralization-Australia n Representation in Ireland-Wate r Supply. Question proposedThat Mr Speaker do now leave the chair. This is Grievance Day, and I have a grievance about Bradfield Park. This is a slum where decent people ought not to be required to live, and the position is more reprehensible because it is sponsored and maintained by the Commonwealth Government and the State Government of New South Wales. The site was acquired by the Commonwealth in 1940 for the purpose of establishing a Royal Australian Air Force camp, which was to be used as both a recruit training depot and an embarkation depot. Immediately after the war, when there was an acute shortage of housing, the Commonwealth leased a large part of the area to the Housing Commission of New South Wales for temporary housing accommodation purposes, and the Commonwealth Government has taken over another part as a migrant hostel. The tenants in the Housing Commission part of Bradfield Park are people who had been living in inadequate accommodation and who have been placed temporarily at the camp at Bradfield Park pending their transfer to permanent homes erected by the Housing Commission. For example, when, say, a man and his wife had been living on a verandah, having the use of the facilities of the house, and where perhaps the wife had become pregnant, and the couple could not continue to live under such conditions, that man and his wife would be given accommodation at Bradfield Park. Again, a family might have been evicted, for some reason or another, from its previous accommodation, and those people would be placed in Bradfield Park housing settlement until a permanent home could be found for them. They might be there for six months, twelve months, eighteen months, or perhaps a couple of years. The part on which the migrant hostel is situated is entirely distinct from the Housing Commission part, and the migrants accommodated there include perhaps a handful of professional people such as school teachers, skilled craftsmen and others, and they live under hostel conditions. It is quite obvious that a service type of camp that is now 22 years old, with the normal kind of huts that one finds in these places arranged in very neat and regular rows, and made of wood and galvanized iron, with thin walls and thin partitions, and with, in effect, public latrines, no matter how well painted the buildings might be, no matter how the housewives might try to keep the huts clean, is simply not satisfactory as residential accommodation. Again, there are, of course, no individual yards in which young children can play. Indeed, the children in this area cannot be kept under control by their parents, and they run wild in the camp. There is a school at the camp for all the children there, and the accommodation at that school is of the same quality as the accommodation in the rest of the",19,Bauxite

It does not need any great exposition on my part to show that this is very bad residential accommodation. I want to put forward a proposal to ameliorate the situation. First of all, 1 should say that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is anxious to get on with the construction of a standards laboratory on this site, which tions that could be kept in mind in planning is ideal for that purpose. The present standards laboratory is bursting at the seams. It has accommodation at the Sydney University, and temporary accommodation in the adjoining suburb of Newtown. It happens that Bradfield Park is ideal for the purposes of a standards laboratory because, with the open spaces available, there is no interference of the kind that cannot be tolerated when using the delicate instruments that the scientists in a standards laboratory use. I do not want to go into all the reasons why this is an ideal site for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, but the Department of the Interior has agreed in principle to that organization taking over Bradfield Park as and when .it can get possession of it. I want to be constructive. I want to children could go to the schools at which put forward an alternative. I notice that they would ultimately stay.

Indeed, it cannot go on for much longer. It should wish to deal this morning with what I connot go on for any longer at all. So the sider is a most unfair condition that is matter has to be faced. I say it should be faced now. How should it be faced? I believe that the Commonwealth has got to consider the building of decent accommodation, decentralized, perhaps, in two or three centres in the metropolitan area of Sydney. I suggest that it should be the kind of accommodation which, if the present need for it should cease at some stage, could be used with modificait, for old people's homes, or, if the Government wanted to dispose of it, for motels, or some other purpose. It should be decent and permanent accommodation and it could be decentralized in two or three areas in the metropolitan part of Sydney-in the districts where migrants, for example, are likely ultimately to live permanently and close, tb where their work is likely to be. It so happens that Bradfield Park is in the midst of a high-class residential area where relatively few migrants or tenants of the housing commission are likely to be settled permanently and so would never be integrated into the community and would remain in isolation. But if decent decentralized accommodation of the kind I have mentioned was provided these people could be integrated into the community and their There are many reasons, of course, why",20,Supply Grievance Day

In fact, he could go to the area in the middle of January and remain there until the middle of December and still not qualify. He would have been qualify for the allowance. Another man, It is well known that in the north and return to the north and carry on in the particular job. If they go back after the wet second income year but not in the first year decided to have a twelve-month break out the income year. They would lose the allowance in the first income year they spent in the north and in the last year as well. So infiveyears they would lose their qualification for the allowance for two years out of the five. We have still the other position of the man who goes to the north with the full intention of stopping there for several years, and who, through no fault of his owu, is forced, after ten or eleven months, to go south. He is forced to do that perhaps because of sickness or because his family cannot stamd up to the conditions in the north, or because the employer terminates his services, and he still does not qualify for the zone allowance. That man also has been in that area where the disadvantages which the act quotes apply, and yet he cannot get the allowance which the act provides. I am sure all honourable members will agree that in fairness to people in the circumstances I have mentioned section 79A of the act should be amended to give such people at least a proportionate amount of the zone allowance. I put it to the Government that this is the time, while we are considering an amendment to the act, when this most unfair position should also be dealt with and rectified. As I said in my first speech in this House, it is my belief that, in order to bring about the full development of the north, the men who go to that area should have the burden of income tax lifted from them completely. But if the zone allowance is the best we can do for them, at least we should be fair and consistent. Let us treat fairly those men who, through no fault of their own, are unable to qualify for the allowance under the act as it now stands but who reside in the area for at least six months of the year. Take, for instance, people who go to work at the Wyndham meat-works in the extreme north of Western Australia. They go there for the meat season, which commences in April andfinishesin December. They may not be fortunate enough to be picked up for the following season because the employer may not need the same number of employees again. So although these chaps have been in the area for eleven months they do not qualify for the zone allowance. I ask the Government to give this matter some attention. with the remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Collard). Last year, I brought up the matter of certain public servants who go to the north for twelve months and whose appointment usually dates from January to December. Consequently, they miss the zone allowance twice. I agree that this matter should be examined. The main subject on which I wish to speak concerns East African people who, as most honourable members know, have reached a position of crisis in their lives. The winds of change, as the United Kingdom Prime Minister, Mr Macmillan, said, are blowing rather strongly over Africa and I think that Australia, through its Department of Immigration, should assist some of these very worthy people. There have been criticisms of certain immigrants to Australia-British, southern European and others. But I am certain that no mistake would be made in permitting immigrants from countries such as Kenya, Uganda, Zanzibar and Tanganyika to settle in Australia. Tanganyika became independent on 9th December last year and the others are fast approaching independence. In those countries a change is taking place from white ownership of land to indigenous ownership. The white people are realizing that the best thing that they can do, not for themselves particularly, but for their families of young children, is to move to a country where they will be welcomed and where they will be able to invest their capital. Many of these people have to sell their properties at about a quarter of their real value. They cannot dispose of motor cars and other assets and they leave with much less than they should after a lifetime of hard work. Many of them are third or fourth generation British people who were born and brought up in the country and would normally have no desire to leave. I believe that this is a type of person worth attracting into Australia, but we do nothing to assist them to come here. In Africa we have embassies in Cairo and in South Africa, a high commissioner in Accra in Ghana and one in Lagos and Nigeria. We have a trade commissioner at Nairobi in Kenya but he is not capable of giving",21,Supply Grievance Day
72,Mr Chaney (Perth) [11.36],"I agreethe type of information that these people want. I think the time has arrived for us to establish information offices in places such as Kenya and Uganda so that prospective settlers in Australia can receive the type of information that they require. 1 think that we should consider granting some sort of assisted passage. I understand that if these people go to England they can get an assisted passage to Australia, but by then they have probably used up the capital that they need to start life afresh. If they get here on their own initiative by a ship from an African port at great cost to themselves, they are often forced to stay at hotels while they look around for a property on which to settle. Most of them are farming people. One family which I know personally had to pay £60 a week in hotel bills while looking over properties and deciding where to go. This family sold its farm for £9,000 when the real value was £30,000. It would have been a simple matter for the Department of Immigration to have allowed these people to stay at an immigrant hostel. I know that, the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) has criticized immigrant hostels in his electorate. But in Western Australia we have a couple of hostels in which people are quite willing to stay until they find a place to settle down. The Department of Immigration makes the facilities of these hostels available only to assisted immigrants. I think that we should extend these facilities to people from east Africa while they are looking for another place to live. I am convinced that we should do this because these people are among the best types of people who come to this country. In the first place, they are pioneers or of pioneering stock. Many of them participated in the war service land settlement schemes introduced by the British Government to encourage the development of colonies after the first and second world wars. We could well do with them. They have some capital to start themselves off. If we offered them some inducement to come, Australia could well be the gainer. I suggest that we appoint information officers in these countries and that the Department of Immigration provide accommodation for these people when they arrive here. We do very much for other people who come here. The Department of Immigration could well take a hand for the great benefit of these settlers and of Australia itself. the last general election campaign, the Leader of the Australian Labour Party, aware of the importance of local government in the life of the people, gave an undertaking in the Brisbane Town Hall that if a Labour government were elected the Commonwealth would recognize local government to a greater extent than at present. That feature of the Australian Labour Party's policy was well received by the citizens of Brisbane. There is ample evidence of that in the manner in which the people of Brisbane expelled Liberal members who had represented them for a long time and returned in their places members who were pledged to support the Australian Labour Party on what might be briefly described as a new deal for local government. Local government plays a particularly important part in the lives of the people-mor e so in some States than in others. In Brisbane, local government coordinates such matters as sewerage, local trading and electricity generation as well as other normal responsibilities. Because of that, the local authority of the city seems to be everlastingly infinancialdifficulties. The difficult situation in which local government finds itself is causing much hardship and lack of development in many of the States and in country towns in Queensland. Local government is one of the three forms of government-federal , State and local. The Federal Government itself recognized the importance of local government as a means of meeting the unemployment situation when, a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) announced that there would be an increase in the authorized borrowings by local authorities. I understand that the City of Brisbane was authorized to increase its loan expenditure by about £400,000, solely for the purpose of relieving unemployment. This was a most worth-while proposition. I suppose I should say that it was most generous of the Prime Minister to approve of the increased borrowings, but he went only halfway towards doing the job. All that the City of Brisbane received was the authority to borrow; it then had to go and borrow it.",23,Supply Grievance Day
73,Mr Coutts (Griffith) [11.42],"DuringThat presents very great difficulties, because the city authorities, as all other local authorigovernment authorities should be recognized ties in Queensland, are in competition on the loan market with many other bodies in the southern States. It seems to me that the Lord Mayor of Brisbane has an almost perpetual job flying to Sydney and Melbourne in an endeavour to obtain loan money for the development of Brisbane. The increased allocation of which the Prime Minister approved only recently will be spent on worthwhile projects-sewerage , drainage and the construction of roads, in itself, the construction of sewerage will have a snowballing effect on the unemployment problem, because householders affected will then be compelled to spend money on the installation of this amenity of modern life. I am aware of tbe constitutional difficulties involved in the provision of local governis made available to the State governments ment finance. I know that the Constitution makes no provision for the recognition of local government bodies. That is because the Constitution was drawn up in the 19th century. It may truly be described, as far as local government is concerned, as a horse and buggy constitution. The Constitution was all right in the days when it was drawn up by that famous man whose name was given to the seat I represent, because at that time the only thing that local governments were concerned with was the provision of roads for the horses and the buggies. The advent of the internal combustion engine has changed the whole nature of local government, and has made on local authorities terrific demands which were not envisaged at the turn of the century. Consequently, there is need for a recognition of the role that local government plays in the development of this nation. The Constitutional Review Committee which, I am afraid, has not met for some considerable time, should bring to the notice of the Government the need for change in this matter. It is all very well for Ministers and the Prime Minister to say-as the right honourable gentleman has said so frequently in this place-that local government authorities come within the ambit of the State Parliaments, and that the Commonwealth plays no constitutional role in relation to them. I would be the first to subscribe to the correctness of that view; but I believe that a change should be made, and that local by the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister is not prepared to give this recognition. He is an arch-conservative who refuses to see the need for change. This is most unfortunate, and I hope that in the near future, when the present Prime Minister has departed from this place and a new man is occupying his seat, the importance of local government will be truly recognized. WhatI should like to see-and this would be a most revolutionary change-is for the Commonwealth to allow the financial arrangements of local authorities to be handled in the same way as the financial arrangements of the States. The State governments submit their requests for loan money to the Loan Council, and approval granted by that body means that the money by the Commonwealth. What happens in relation to local authorities is that the Loan Council approves of certain works programmes and loan allocations for local authorities, and there the matter ends, the mayors of the cities and towns concerned being compelled to go cap in hand to financiers all over the Commonwealth seeking money. I hope the day is not far distant when the role of local government in the general Australian scheme of government will be fully recognized and effect given to the proposal that local authorities, after having their programmes approved by the Loan Council, will be assured that the money they require will be made available through that body. want to make some comment on the speech of the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Coutts) in regard to local government. I have suggested previously that representatives of local government should at least attend meetings of the Loan Council as observers, even if in no other capacity. If they did so they would be able to put to the Premiers and the Commonwealth representatives their particular points of view. Even if they did not have a vote in the council at least they could have some part in the discussions. Nobody denies the importance of local government, and the vital part that it pays in our lives.",24,Supply Grievance Day
74,Mr Lucock (Lyne) [11.50],"Briefly, II think we should give some consideration to the present method of distributing funds to local government authorities, which is at present a State responsibility. We in New South Wales bave seen the State government allocate money most unfairly, to my mind-puttin g it mildly. In certain areas of local government in my own electorate I have seen it happen that, when the Commonwealth Government has made more money available for distribution to local government authorities, that money has not been distributed in the proportions in which it should have been distributed to areas that are represented by non-Labour members of Parliament. The two principal reasons for which I raised by the honourable member. rose to speak to-day concern the Treasury. The first relates to tax deductions for mediand honourable members have the right to cal expenses and the second relates to the direct the attention of the Government to Postmaster-General's Department, but is matters within their electorates. We also, I think, a Treasury matter. I ask endeavour to give everybody a reasonable the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) to have a chance to speak within the framework of look at the position regarding tax deducthe Standing Orders. I had already told tions for medical expenses when he is prethe Country Party Whip that I would not paring the forthcoming Budget.

However, I think that for Reid did not help me in that connection. the limit on tax deductions for medical expenses should be raised, because in the medical benefits. As I have said, when a case of a taxpayer who has a long illness in person is faced with expense for medical his or her family the greater degree of attention, he needs all the help he can get medical expense involved the greater the through tax concessions. strain upon his financial resources. We know that there are many cases of people have mentioned previously. I believe that being involved in very heavy medical the Postmaster-General's Department should expenses.

79,Mr Lucock,"This is Grievance Daywas the case some years ago. When new telephone services are provided, many related requirements such as new trunk lines and switchboards, the extension of post office buildings and other things, may be involved. All this means that there is a tremendous responsibility on the Postal Department. I am not criticizing the work that is done by the officers of the department. I think they are doing a fantastic job in the extension of telephonic communications, but I feel that the Treasury is not fully appreciative of the real value of the work of the Postal Department. Extra money for this department provided from Consolidated Revenue could return more revenue if a section of the department were put on a commercial basis. In my electorate, many people are waiting for telephones. It is almost beyond the physical capabilities of the staff in that area to cope with the applications. I believe there is a need for increased recruitment within the Postal Department and for further development and that the basis for this must come in the first place from the Treasury by the provision of extra finance. If my other suggestion for a commission could be adopted, I believe the Postmaster-General's Department would bave available to it more funds, which would enable it to expand its work to an even greater degree. I wish to direct my remarks to local government, and in this respect I support the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Coutts). In the electorate of Wide Bay, there are twelve local government authorities, and they have protested against the treatment meted out to them in relation to recent grants to the States, including Queensland. The Commonwealth Government has placed' some onus on the local government authorities to help in the relief of unemployand other lending authorities. It is indicament, and many of these authorities thought they would be entitled to some of the money provided for the States by way of grants. However, they are not to receive any portion of the grants and can look for assistance only through subsidized work. It is worthy of note that the Queensland in Queensland of most assistance to them Government last year reduced the subin raising their loan quota. The fact that sidies to local government authorities for they now are allowed to borrow more works. The City of Gympie was conmoney is not something which fills their sidering a sewerage system but the reduction in the subsidy of 10 per cent, amounted to about £200,000. In some cases the local government authorities are required to raise £4 for every £1 of assistance given by the State governments from Commonwealth grants. At the least, they have to raise 60 per cent, of the money for works. Most of the local government authorities in the Wide Bay area are progressive and they have already borrowed to the limit of their economic ability. They believe that it would be unwise for them to place an additional burden on the ratepayers. To raise £4 for every £1 of assistance, they will have to levy the ratepayers next year. Last year, some of the local authorities were concerned about seasonal unemployment. I refer particularly to Bundaberg where at present there are 1,155 unemployed. The local authorities provided additional work last year to assist the seasonal workers, but whereas last year they had a surplus they have recently had a deficit and as a result the rates were increased. They believe that if tbey are to have the responsibility of providing employment, they should be given additional financial help. The ratepayers cannot continue to carry the burden of responsibilities which they feel rightly are those of the Commonwealth and State governments. The local government authorities believe that there is a need for co-ordinated loan raising, such as the central lending authority suggested by the honourable member for Griffith. When a loan allocation was approved, the representative of each local government authority could raise the amount required without going through the various channels of insurance companies tive of current difficulties that this year local government authorities have had more trouble than previously in filling their loan allocations.

85,Mr Mcguren (Cowper) [12.18],"MrWhere are my markets?"" Naturally the answer to these, questions, in most instances, is, "" In Sydney, or Melbourne, or Adelaide, or one of the other big centralized areas of the country"". That is the first problem connected with decentralization that we, as a government, have to face. It is not an easy one, and I appreciate it, I think, as much as any one in this House. But I suggest that we must do some really worthwhile thinking about the problem, whether it be from the point of view of military requirements or from the stand-point of using to the best advantage the areas that should be developed and are seeking development. Whichever way the matter is approached, I believe we must do something about it, and do it quickly. I know that committees have been set up to consider the problem. I know that the New South Wales Government is now establishing a Ministry of Decentralization. But I feel that this should be a joint affair. It is not of much use for one State to do something along these lines. The question should be brought up to the top level. We should have a committee composed of the most knowledgeable people with the best brains in the country, because we are now going through a period in Australia when we must learn to stand on our own feet. For far too long we have been content to ride on the sheep's back. . I am not decrying what the wool and wheat industries have done for us. I know that they have been all-important to Australia, but I think it is time we started exploiting fully all our other resources, and I suggest that the main move could be made by this Government, by the proper use of' money provided through the Development Bank at a low rate of interest. As I have said, the man who could do something about decentralization is the man who asks, "" Where is my market, my manpower and my raw materials? "" He must be offered a bait. Therefore I suggest that money should be supplied through the Development Bank at possibly half the normal rate of interest. That should .be the first bait to be offered. ThenI suggest that local government authorities should come to the party. They should offer land, and perhaps electricity and water, at rates that would induce people to establish industries. I believe we should go even further. The Commonwealth Government -should do something about providing assistance in solving the transport problems that are experienced in all parts of the country. The Government should help the various councils and shires in their task of maintaining roads other than highways. The transport issue is a most difficult one. Unfortunately, a great mistake was made in New South Wales in the early days, when adequate means of communication should have been provided between the coastal centres and inland areas, rather than concentrating on communications between the various points along the coastal strip. At the present time we have two railway lines running north and south, and two main roads going in the same direction. This has definitely served to retard decentralization. I have suggested other ways in which assistance should be given, but the main requirement at the moment, I believe, is for us to become aware of the importance of the problem, to recognize it as one deserving first priority, and to realize that we must stand on our own feet from now on, particulajly as we will have many more difficulties to surmount when the United Kingdom enters the European Common Market. We must exploit the areas that can produce the goods required, but which are not now, except in rare instances, being used. In many cases the few areas that are being exploited are those in which our natural birth right, in the form of bauxite and other minerals, has been sold to interests outside Australia. These resources should, I believe, be developed and used by Australians. Finally, I repeat my suggestion that the Government set up a committee to deal with this all-important problem. I put it to the House that if the Government giv-a some real thought to this matter it will he making a valuable contribution to the solution of one of Australia's most serious problems.

No doubt, a considerable proportion of the share received by New South Wales will be allocated by the New South Wales Minister for Local Government to the Cowper electorate. The Commonwealth's allocation of £50,000,000 this financial year under the scheme compares with an allocation of £9,000,000 in the last year of thc Chifley Government's term. This Government is allocating about six times as much to the States for road works as was allocated by the Labour Government. The honourable member for Cowper, with his background in local government affairs, comes here and says that the Commonwealth should make a contribution. It is contributing £50,000,000 a year, compared with a contribution of only £9,000,000 in the last year of office of the Government which he supported. At least, I suppose that he supported it. It is of no use for the honourable member to try to divert us from the real argument. I have stated the facts. Opposition members ought to try to get into their heads the fact that this Government is allocating to the States £50,000,000 a year for road works compared with an allocation of only £9,000,000 by the Labour Government in its last year of office. About £13,000,000 of the current financial year's allocation of £50,000,000 will go to New South Wales, and a good deal of that share will go to the Cowper electorate. There is not the slightest doubt that there seas. is a great demand for development in Australia. Those of us who have taken the trouble to look at the situation in this country great areas of mineral wealth in northern realize that the problem is so vast that a Australia. The honourable member for nation of about 10,000,000 people could Capricornia ( Mr Gray) knows that a group not find the resources to do the job even in of members of this Parliament has seen the ten years, much less in one year or two possibilities of the Fitzroy River basin in years. A vast programme of national his area. We know that in the Northern development has to be undertaken.

If we tried to obtain it by exciting new possibilities for the mineral those means, we would be bogged down and wealth of the area. We have no chance would not get the job done. However, there of financing the development of mineral are methods that can be adopted, and I deposits there on our own. But we could would like to give the Parliament two illusdo what the National Capital Development trations of what can be done. They are to Commission has done with respect to the be found close at hand-on e in Canberra Hobart office building and what the New and one in Sydney. One is the responsibility South Wales Government proposes to do of this Government and the other is the with respect to the development of the responsibility of the New South Walej Labour Government. The Hobart office building being constructed at Civic Centre, Canberra, is on a block not so large as is the block in the heart of Sydney bounded by Martin-place and King, Castlereagh and Pitt streets. When the Hobart office building was projected, the National Capital Development Commission stated the height of the building and ihe number of stories and invited tenders from interests with sufficient money and resources which were prepared to undertake the construction. The unimproved capital value of the block of land on which the building is situated is £77,000. However, that is not of importance. The company which obtained the lease of the land paid £410,000 for it. The company has the right to lease office space in the building. This means that the Commonwealth Government, and, therefore, the taxpayers, are not called upon to find the money for this development. This brings to mind ideas for development elsewhere. I understand that Mr Renshaw, the Deputy Premier and Treasurer in the New South Wales Government, has in hand proposals forfinancingthe development of the Rocks area of Sydney at the southern end of the Sydney harbour bridge at a cost of £100,000,000. Tenders are being invited overseas by the New South Wales Labour Government. It proposes to use financial resources, labour, new systems of design and new methods of architecture available overThis method could be adopted to develop Rocks area in Sydney. I suppose that similar developments are proposed elsewhere, too. The Hobart office building will be a desirable investment, and so will be the development of the Rocks area of Sydney. There is a demand for the minerals of northern Australia, and the development of those riches, also, is desirable. This ParThey are shipping it over the long haul to liament, and the Northern Territory Administration and the Queensland and Western Australian Governments, as the case may be, have a responsibility to give all the assistance possible in the development of our mineral wealth.

The honourable member's time has expired. Mr Speaker, I wish to mention again a matter that I have continually brought to the notice of the Government for many years-a n exchange of ambassadors with the Republic of Ireland. It is interesting, to note that during the last session of the last tions. Lord Casey did this for years. When Parliament, the Prime Minister( Mr the Prime Minister held the portfolio, he Menzies), in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs, announced an exchange of ambassadors with the Republic of Korea, which we know as South Korea. That, I believe, was a step in the right direction. I we should be given the reasons. am aware of the great friendship cemented between that country and Australia during the Korean war when Australian armed forces played a magnificent role in assisting Nations. The only question I.could not the United Nations against the Communist aggressors. However, I should like to emphasize that the Australian people have absolutely no kinship ties with South Korea. On the other hand, at least 30 per cent, of Australians have kinship ties with Ireland and I might add that many of these people served Australia, and served well, in World WarI . , World War II . and the Korean War. During the regime of the Chifley Labour Government, Australia was represented in Ireland by an ambassador, Judge Dignam, and we had here from Ireland a very notable man, Dr. Kiernan. Yet this Government refuses to appoint an ambassador to Ireland. The Governments of the United Kingdom and Canada-tw o of our fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations-ar e fully represented in Ireland, and 35 other nations are represented there by ambassadors. This prompts the question,"" Why not Australia? "" It is offensive to the people of Ireland, and to Australians of Irish origin, that the Australian Government refuses to appoint an ambassador to Ireland. Perhaps the newly appointed Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) will see the logic in my argument and accede to my request, which has fallen on the deaf ears of his two predecessors in this portfolio. The present Minister held the. portfolio of External Affairs temporarily some time ago, before the Prime Minister took over the position. I remember, then, asking the Minister a question about our representation in Ireland. His excuse for not answering my question was that he could not understand my brogue. IfI am to judge by the way he fared at the last election, I would say that he cannot understand some of the brogues in the Parramatta electorate. His majority dropped from about 9,000 to 2,000.

Mr Speaker, the purpose of this bill is clear enough and simple enough. The bill proposes to increase by a further £5,000,000 the capital of what is known as the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia. As recently as October last year this House contemplated a similar measure and we on this side of the chamber were able to say then: "" We told you so. We told you at the time when this Development Bank was created that it was inadequately capitalized to perform the work that it had been deAustralia. I notice that attention was signed to perform.""

I believe that at came to Australia to take part in banking this stage it is pertinent to ask the Governin our growing economy in those days. ment where the emphasis is being placed. The reviewer saysIs it being placed on development as the Government wants it to be placed when and the Union any credit is to be drawn therefrom? Is As every one knows, the Australia and New money being made available for developZealand Bank Limited is an amalgamation ment, or is the bank being restricted by of the Bank of Australasia and the Union narrow ideological views of the role of Bank of Australiabanking in the community? This organization is called a development bank, but in essence it is little more than a rolling fund. The contrast is drawn very clearly in one document, namely, the reports and balance-sheets for 1961 of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. Two parts of that corporation are the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australiathe accounts of which are at pages 34 and 35-and the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia-the accounts of which are at pages 18 and 19 of the same document. The significant difference between the Development Bank and the Trading Bank can be seen by comparing the composition of the item ""Liabilities"" in the balance sheet in each instance. The capital of the Development Bank at 30th June, 1961it has been increased by £5,000,000 since then, and this bill proposes to increase it by a further £5,000,000-wa s £15,857,000 in total liabilities of £45,199,007. By contrast, the Commonwealth Trading Bank has a smaller capital than that of the Development Bank. Its capital at that date was only £7,429,000 in total liabilities of £360,000,000. Thosefigurespin-point very significantly the difference between the operations of the Commonwealth Trading Bank and those of the Commonwealth Development Bank. One banking fact was learnt early in 1962, contains a review article of the splendid history of the Australia and New ZeaButlin. The reviewer refers to the influence The"" Anglos"", among whom the Australasian were the most substantial, transformed the banking in three principal ways. They introduced branch banking and . . they recognized and exploited the importance of deposits for banking resources. The significant point is that if an organization is really to be a bank it has to be allowed to receive deposits, because it is out of the interflow between the deposits which are a liability of the bank and the advances which become assets of the bank that a bank grows. That is the significant difference between the Commonwealth Development Bank and any other bank as it",34,Supply Grievance Day
96,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [2.15],,35,Commonwealth Banks Bill
97,Mr Whittorn,I do not remember that. land Bank Limited written by Professor,35,Commonwealth Banks Bill
98,Mr Crean,"You can read that in in the early days of Australian development,operates in Australia, with the exception of savings banks, and they are in a different category of banking altogether. That fact is pointed out, to some extent, in the speech of the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt). Hes a i d Honourable members will recall that one increase of £3,000,000 has already been provided for in the Commonwealth Banks Act 1961. . . . As a result of these two increases the capital of the bank will now be £25,857,000, in addition to which the bank has substantial reserves of its own and also employs considerable sums borrowed from the Commonwealth Savings Bank. The difference between getting resources by borrowing from another bank and getting them by deposits is that a bank has to pay interest on what it borrows and has to charge the people to whom it lends money as least as much as it costs the bank to borrow the money. That is one factor that is crippling the growth of the Development Bank. It must make a profit, and in order to make that profit it has to divide its business not so much in the broad field of development, but between development which is supposed to be the charter of this bank, and earning enough income from hire-purchase transactions with its own limited number of customers. That is also clearly pointed out in the annual report at page 30. Trading Bank pays interest on deposits. deposits; but on a large proportion of them, namely two-thirds, it does not pay interest. I suggest that the honourable member look at the proportion of fixed deposits to floating deposits in most of the banks. They pay no interest on floating deposits. They do pay interest on fixed deposits, but they represent only about a quarter, in total, of the total deposits of the banking system. The annual report statesIt was found possible to approve a large proportion of the many and varied applications received during the year 1960-61, andfinanceapproved by the Bank totalled £24.9 million. Of this amount, £10.8 million was by way of loans. That is less than half of the amount of £24,900,000. The report continuesThe provision of the remaining £14.1 million for the financing of equipment on hire-purchase terms represented the re-employment of funds which came to hand from repayments on earlier transactions of the same type. That indicates the kind of limiting factor which is stopping this bank from doing what it was supposed to do. I think it indicates perhaps a conflict between the Country Party in one particular corner of government and the Liberal Party in the other. These are the apostles of free enterprise, of competition, but they do not want the Development Bank to compete as a bank, and because it cannot compete in the full sense as a bank it is restricted in fulfilling its charter of assisting in development. That conflict was quite clear in this House when the original bill came before k . Technically, under the wording of the act, the Development Bank can do all that any other bank in Australia can do. For instance, it can receive deposits, but it does not do so because the Liberal Government, in the name of some ideology, does not want it to do that. One is rather amazed these days on watching television to see joint advertisements presented on behalf of the free enterprise banks. There is certainly not very much competition between them so far as the presentation of advertisements is concerned. This gets us back to a very significant point. Although it was not novel at the time, attention was drawn to it in 1945 in the splendid report of the Rural Reconstruction Commission established by the Hon. J. J. Dedman. Under the heading "" Rural Credit"" in the fifth report, dated 28th February, 1945, paragraph 833 statesThe resources which the banks command and the wide representation they enjoy through their branches enable them to serve a great variety of needs in the sphere of rural credit both for production and marketing. That is still true. The report continuesIn this report, however, the Commission is mainly concerned with the extent to which they do not provide adequately for all the needs of agriculture. In this regard, the Commission is of the opinion that the trading banks do not give suflicient consideration to(a) Projects which are in the development stage; (b) Farmers with small capital resources; (c) The tenant-farmer and the share-farmer. In making this comment the Commission realizes that the banks are business concerns with obligations to depositors and shareholders and accordingly are entitled to operate within such limits as they themselves consider prudent. That is not the charter of the Development Bank, the functions of which are quite clearly set out in section 72 of the act. If",35,Commonwealth Banks Bill
99,Mr Mackinnon,The Commonwealth,36,Commonwealth Banks Bill
100,Mr Crean,"It pays interest on somethose functions are to be performed, they can be performed only In two ways. First, they can be performed if the Development Bank is allowed really to operate as a bank But if, in the name of an ideology, the Government wants to restrict its activities as a bank, then, if development is to take place, funds must be provided in the cheapest possible way. funds. I suggest, to begin with, that the fact that it has had to have two infusions of capital within the space of four to five months is clearly indicative bf that. I submit, too, that He was talking about the same sort of gap, if the. honourable member reads objectively the comments in the bank's report, be will see that the bank has been able to do as well as it has done with its limited resources only because it has to divide its functions between hire-purchase transactions and development. Sometimes, the two activities can be coterminous, but in many instances they are not, and when they are not the genuine rural development of Australia must suffer. I advise that the honourable member look again at the aggregate of the advances made by the ordinary banking system of Australia over a period of years. For instance, take the period from June, 1959, to June, 1961. In that period, the total advances by all the private tradingbanks and the Commonwealth Trading Bank increased from £933,000,000 to £106,000,000; but, in advances for agriculture there was a total decline from £229,000,000 to £225,000,000. It may be argued that the reason for that was that farmers were more successful in June, 1961, than they were in June, 1959. honourable member take that up with his colleagues in the Country Party section of the Government. It does not seem to be substantiated by the statistics relating to farm incomes in the statements of national income for the two periods. In other words, of the total banking activity outside the Development Bank there is a lesser proportion going to agriculture now than was the case even two years ago. That, of course, may again typify certain changes that are inevitably taking place in the Australian economy anyway. I think also pertinent to this discussion is an address delivered by Dr. H. C. Coombs, Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, to the third Conference of the Australian Agricultural Economics Society, held in Melbourne from 24th to 26th February, 1959. In a paper entitled ''Rural Credit Developments in Australia"" Dr. Coombs makes this observationIt may be that the new Development Bank proposed by the Government will be able to contribute to the filling of this gap. in effect, as had been pointed out in 1945. That gap was still existent in 1959fourteen years later. He went on to sayI hope, however, that too much will not be expected of it. That too much will not be expected of the Development Bank! He did not say precisely why too much should not be expected of it, but I think he had a fairly good idea, bearing in mind its limitations as a. bank, even though it was called a bank. I noted last night that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) was disposed to treat with great respect the opinions of Sir John Crawford. In the subsequent discussion of the paper read by Dr. Coombs, Sir John Crawford saidIt did seem to me that the paper went very close to admitting that the most profitable lending £1,039,000,000, an increase of for the banking system,' at least under existing economic conditions, is not in the rural field, except tb the extent that hire purchase is associated with banking. That is the same circumstance into which the Development Bank has had to get itself because it cannot cover its costs in any other way. Sir John Crawford also saidDr. Coombs commented on the development of pastoral companies, and one wonders what their real influence has been; And one will continue to wonder since two of them have been amalgamated within the last day or twoTheir own financial resources depend to some extent at least on what further back-stopping they will get from the banking system. Recent events suggest that the banking system in the future is less and less likely to provide rural credit-That is .borne out by thefiguresI have cited for the period from 1959 to 1961.",36,Commonwealth Banks Bill

104,Mr Crean,"Again I suggest that tbefor anything but "" carry-on"" and for the purchase of property by existing or well-backed customers. Is that the criterion of development that this Parliament wants-that only the wellheeled shall be allowed to obtain fresh soles in the future? Sir John Crawford went on to say of Dr. Coombs's paperThe problem he dealt with so interestingly, which is the unsolved problem, is what he called the supply of credit for the "" residual"" borrower I suggest that was the role that those who established the Development Bank hoped it would fillthe problem of providing credit for advancing development and productivity. Where, more than on the other side ot this House, do we hear used the words -"" development "" and "" productivity "", and where is there a more determined effort to strangle the child than there is on that side of the chamber? The supporters of the Government do not want the Development Bank to be a development fund at all. They want to cut its growth according to the behests of the private banking system, even though increasingly that system is getting out of the significant and important field of the development of Australia. I suggest that the members of the Australian Country Party in particular ought to ponder very seriously the present situation. Do they want the emphasis, so far as the Development Bank is concerned, to be on development, or do they want it to subscribe to some ancient shibboleths of the private banks? Do they want development primarily, or do they want an out-moded banking theory to be triumphant? Sir John Crawford went on to sayIt brought to my mind a little more clearly that one of the justifications for banks' reluctance to provide extensive credit facilities in this field is the very cost and the very difficulty of incorporating the necessary routines in a normal banking operation. Again, that is a very good reason why we need a separate institution. The time that it was necessary to devote to making an examination of whether or not a borrower was really creditworthy, according to the criteria of private banking, was not worth the candle so far as banks of that kind were concerned. Sir John continuedAs Dr. Coombs suggests, there is probably a need for a fresh institutional approach. He included in the term what I would suggest is separable in the concept-the addition of new principles. It was hoped that new principles had been written into the legislation by virtue of sections 72 and 73 of the actIt is worthy of note that the new Development Bank Bill does incorporate the test of income, as distinct from security valueI suggest that that is one of the reasons why there has not been a great deal of enthusiasm for this institution on the part of the apostles of free enterprise in this Parliament. It was not a case of applying the old test and giving more security to one who already had assets. What the Development Bank aimed to do was to give a chance to the man who wanted to establish a farm or an industry, mainly on the security of his capacity and faith in his integrity. That is not the test applied by the other banks. Sir John saidIt is worthy of note that the new Development Bank Bill does incorporate the test of income, as distinct fVo-Ti: security value, and this in itself is a courageous departure. But again, the courageous departure has been halted by the inactivity of the Country Party corner of the HouseI have no doubt that even though it is a new test, the Development Bank will still need a very keen assessment of the personal factor. Of course it would; that is only prudent. But if the personal factor proved satisfactory there ought not to be a withholding of funds. Sir John Crawford went on to sayNevertheless, this is a recognition that the -approach through security plus personal factor is not enough. The Development Bank will certainly need to handle this principle with great care, but it has to be attempted. And, I suggest, it has also to be encouraged. Finally, when it came to Dr. Coombs's summing up at the end of the lecture, and when he was speaking of the Commonwealth Bank, the State banks and the various other banks, he saidHowever, these banks are limited in resources and like the pastoral companies tend to draw their funds from the field in which their loans are made. That cannot be a circumstance so far as the Development Bank is concerned. I suggest that the emphasis ought to be on development, not on banking. If it is to be on development, there has to be the provision of funds at low rates of interest. If funds cannot be obtained from other sources, why cannot they be provided from the revenues of this nation, without any interest toll at all? Apparently, we are going to have the blessing, in the next few days, of a depreciation allowance measure that will put some £10,000,000 or £12,000,000 into the pockets of companies in the Australian community that are already some of the strongest. If the Government can afford to do that for manufacturing industry, why can it not afford to be a little Government has been in office, been the more generous as far as the essential rural development of the nation is concerned? I leave the matter there, Mr Speaker. We welcome this increase in the capital of the bank. We still say that the capital will be inadequate to serve the needs that exist in 1962, just as it was inadequate, perhaps even more so in the aggregate, to meet those that existed in 1945. The establishment of the Development Bank was recognized as at least a courageous attempt to do something for rural development. I suggest that it was a Country Party Treasurer who was largely instrumental, despite the shibboleths to which the other members of the Cabinet subscribed, in seeing the bank established. There is an inherent duty on the part of other members of the Country Party to see that the bank places emphasis, not on banking, but on development. like to say something about the extraordinary statement that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) made just before he finished his speech. He referred to the Government's proposal to introduce a 20 per cent, investment allowance, which, as he put it, ought to put £10,000,000 or £12,000,000 into the pockets of large secondary industries in Australia. He compared the way in which the Government was treating the secondary industries in this respect with the way in which it was treating the primary industries. Is not the honourable member aware that, about eleven years ago, in either 1951 or 1952, this Government introduced a system of taxation concessions, or depreciation allowances, for the primary industries which were very much more valuable to those industries than the proposed 20 per cent, concession for secondary industries? That leads me to another point which the honourable member obviously has not appreciated. If we want to encourage development in Australian rural industries, the thing to encourage is not lending to the farmers for developmental purposes, but high incomes; because it has been proved beyond a shadow of doubt that the great bulk of farm investment comes out of income, and one of the reasons for the extraordinary growth in farm investment, which after all is development, has, since this income tax concessions which, by giving the farmer a larger disposable income, has enabled him to re-invest it in his farm and so increase production. I believe you will never change that situation in Australia where the bulk of farm investment comes out of income, and for one very good reason. It is that the psychology of the farmer is such that he is disposed to undertake development investment when the prospects are good and he can see the way ahead. That is also the situation in which he borrows money. But you will never get him to accept a situation where you substitute the lending of money for a decline in investment because in his judgment the prospects are not good. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports made some other extraordinary statements. The first of them was that the Opposition, when we increased the capital of the Development Bank by £5,000,000 at the time of last year's Budget, said that the capital of the Development Bank was inadequate. Now that the Government has decided to increase that capital by another £5,000,000, honourable members opposite say they told us so. I can recall following the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in the debate on that occasion and pointing out that there was no sense whatever in using money from the public revenue to increase the capital of the Development Bank ahead of the need to do so. I pointed to the pledge given by the Government when the Development Bank was brought into being, that it would ensure that the bank always had sufficient resources for the purposes which lay within its charter. I suggest that the determination of the Government to again increase the capital of the bank is proof positive that that promise has been kept. What would have been the point in increasing the capital of the bank by £10,000.000 or £15,000,000 last August or September when there is still part of the",37,Commonwealth Banks Bill
105,Mr Forbes (Barker) [2.43],"I shouldoriginal £5,000,000 in the bank's resources available for lending? The money would have been lying idle, when it could perhaps have been used in that four or five months for purposes which honourable gentlemen opposite hold so dear to their hearts. I know the honourable member for Melbourne Ports-to be fair to him-woul d suggest that I am not stating this correctly because, in fact, the Development Bank, even within its charter, has restricted its activities because of shortage of funds. But he did not give one single point of proof to demonstrate the correctness of that assertion. He did not give a single example to prove what he said; he merely quoted a statement from the report of the Chairman of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation which said more or less what the Government has since accepted-that before very long, if the bank is going to fulfil its charter, it will need additional funds. I know the way in which the bank bas operated only in South Australia, because that is the only place in which I have seen it operating at close quarters. But because I know that a Commonwealth-wide institution like the Commonwealth Banking Corporation takes a good deal of trouble to see that its administrative practices and policy apply right across the Commonwealth, I am pretty sure that what has happened in South Australia has happened elsewhere. I have been pretty closely in on a large proportion of the transactions made by the South Australian branch of the Development Bank with rural industry in that State, because the electorate of Barker is the area in South Australia in which the greatest amount of rural development is taking place-in a State in which the high rainfall zone is fairly restricted. I can therefore say, without fear of challenge, that the bank in South Australia has never since its inception refused a loan to an applicant on the ground that it did not have sufficient funds available. I make that quite categorical statement and challenge the Opposition to produce examples which prove the contrary to be the case. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports also spoke of the Government's tenber said, because the Australian credit instidency on ideological grounds to restrict the tutions did not provide adequate developactivity of the Development Bank. In fact mental finance in the rural areas, particuhe said the bank was not permitted to accept larly in circumstances where the people deposits but then reversed that statement because the bank is permitted to accept deposits. But the Development Bank does not accept deposits, and for a number of very good reasons. It is a specialist financial institution with a narrowly defined charter. IfI may remind the House of what that charter is, it is to provide finance for developmental purposes in circumstances where the applicant is not able to obtain finance for development purposes on reasonable terms elsewhere. That is the main part of the charter, which then goes on to say that the prospects of the success of the enterprise rather than the form of security available will be the main criterion upon which the loan shall be based. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports referred to the report of the Rural Reconstruction Commission, which was a very good commission indeed and produced very valuable reports. I pay credit to the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), who was responsible under a Labour government for setting up that commission, although I do not give him much credit for the fact that, at least in this respect, he did not adopt its recommendations. It was left to this Government to adopt the commission's recommendations on this point. I point out to honourable members opposite that the Labour Government set up the Industrial Finance Branch of the Commonwealth Bank, which granted its loans by the criteria which are now included in the charter of the Development Bank-the prospects of the success of the enterprise rather than the form of security. But the rural equivalent of that agency, the Mortgage Bank, had no such liberal clause in its charter at all. The Mortgage Bank, which I think was instituted in the time of the Labour Government, granted its loans on the same basis as do the normal trading banks, that is, the capacity of the applicant to provide ample security. I revert to the report of the Rural Reconstruction Commission. As the honourable member pointed out, it said that there was a major gap in the system of rural finance in Australia. This gap existed, as the honourable memwho wanted to undertake the development ment. We on this side of the House regard had, to use the honourable member's phrase, that as being both undesirable and inadequate Development Bank was designed precisely to fill that gap. If honourable members bother about accepting deposits as the look at the bank's charter, they will see that the bank meets that requirement. As I understand its report, the commission said has suggested? What does he envisage as that, normally speaking, the credit requirelikely to happen should this institution start ments of a great majority of primary proto accept deposits and compete not only ducers were met by the existing financial with the private trading banks but also the institutions-that is, the trading banks and Commonwealth Trading Bank?

FromI should like to make at least one more been mainly because the Development whom they are allotted do not measure up to that criterion. I do not suggest that this I suggest to the Minister assisting the at the table, that he consider suggesting to the State governments that in future when they are contemplating land settlement schemes, and where they do not intend to finance the applicants when they go on to their blocks, they bring the Development Bank and the other credit institutions into the discussions at an early stage. From my own observations, I am sure that if that approach had been adopted in the past a certain amount of heartburning and disappointment would have , been avoided. I mention, for example, the Fairview Estate near Lucindale in the south-east of South Australia, which is situated in my electorate. In most cases the blocks were allotted on the right basis, but I am quite sure that in a number of cases if there had been consultation between the State land settlement authorities and the Development Bunk the. people concerned would never have got into the situation in which they found themselves. Finally, as I said earlier, we should never forget that the overwhelming bulk of farm development is undertaken with farm income. If farm incomes are healthy, then farm investment will be healthy. Indeed, the psychology of the' farmer is such that he is more prepared to borrow funds when incomes are high and the prospects therefore are good, than when the prospects are net good. High farm incomes are the key to high farm investment, irrespective of whether that investment comes from income or. borrowing. A policy which attempts to arrest a decline in farm investment by providing easier credit will never succeed, and it is not desirable that it should. That is not the .motive of the Government in providing extra funds for the Development Bank, and I am sure it has never cast the bank in that role. However, I believe it is timely to remind the Government now that if it wants farm investment to remain at its present level and even to increase, farm incomes must be high. I support the bill. honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) has missed the point entirely in dealing with the statement made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), who puts the Opposition's attitude on financial [8 MARCH, 1?S2.] Commonwealth Banks Bill 637 and banking practices. His speech was not an attack on the Commonwealth Development Bank. He reminded us, with evidence from "" Hansard and references to banking ,? history, what has happened. No matter what Dr. Coombs says at a summer school nor what Sir John Crawford says somewhere else and regardless of what situation is visualized by the honourable member for Barker, the fact remains that this bank is miscalled a Development Bank. We are all, perforce, interested in banking and banking practice. Until members of the Oppositions become the government in the fullness of time-and the time is almost ripe-w e want to convey our feelings upon these things which, willy nilly, had to be accepted when we were a small minority in this House. What the honourable member for Melbourne Ports said was utterly consistent with our views. In his earlier speech which I read in "" Hansard"" before I came in here, he blessed with faint praise, I suppose, this institution which was founded in order to create some sort of bridge over a credit gap. The fact is that the farmer was flopping about trying to get money but the cities, conventionally, traditionally and almost eternally, were mopping up the money that he wanted. Consequently, he was short of the finance necessary to carry him along in many circumstances. The members of the Liberal Party pat themselves on the chest when they speak about the Development Bank but it was an unwanted child. The Australian Country Party Treasurer brought it and laid it on the doorstep one morning and they had to adopt it. But they put it into a crimped cradle where it is cribbed, cabined, and confined, and it cannot grow. If you consider the pevelopment Bank in relation to the development of this country, the position is absurd. The Opposition is not criticizing what little you have. We say that the bank ought to be expanded. The honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) and other rural members strut about and talk the stuff which we used to think so valid in 1902. "" This is a country with a vast hinterland and great reserves "", they say. Those are generalities. You cannot make grass grow or cattle fatten or grow lucerne on river banks unless you have",39,Commonwealth Banks Bill
106,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [3.5],"Th emoney and machinery. This little bank -with its little capital and little outlook is unworthy of being in the great corporation now known as the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. Under the Chifley Government and in previous Labour policy the development of radical banking was seen as an opportunity for the benefit of all people and, not something that should be of benefit to people with big financial resources, big incomes and big opportunities for making a slugging good profit out of the people. What is our complaint about the whole measure? As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has said, the capital was meagre but it was good enough at the time to do the job that it was supposed to do. The bank was like a little tweeny maid in one of Sir James Barrie's plays-on e of those little servants who flutter between the kitchen the Development Bank has become comand the servery and never get into the dining room. On one side you have the great Commonwealth Banking Corporation; on the other side you have the trading banks; and the little tweeny maid, the Commonwealth Development Bank, has to do the service in between them. It has to do the little menial tasks that they are too noble, great and aristocratic to do. That is why we object to its being called the Development Bank. Let us look at what happened in regard to it. The agents of this so-called Development Bank in the city and the country are the trading banks. That is farming the cat out! No lush bit of rural lending will be passed over to the Development Bank by the Bank of New South Wales, the Australia and New Zealand Bank Limited or any other trading bank. They have made a Cinderella of fhe Development Bank. What it is doing is fantastic. Let us take a hypothetical case at Mildura member for Mallee to hang on and the grapes of wrath may yet be revealed to him. Let us assume that a progresssive vine fruit-grower has a good property and is well in debt to the Bank of New South Wales. He decides that he wants a packing shed, wire fencing, a drying shed or machinery, and various soil conservation measures to be taken. On the solid old bankers' practice of getting about four times the value of a loan in collateral, he is not a good enough risk for his own bank to advance more money. So his bank manager says to the Development Bank, ""You should give Bill Flinders down the road £10,000 or £20,000 because he wants to develop "". As custodian of the people's money, the Developmental Bank should reply: "" If he is worth lending money to, why do you not lend it to him? You have a fat hand on the collateral."" But the Development Bank does not say that. It says, "" We will give poor old Bill Flinders a second mortgage."" Then, if he goes broke the Bank of New South Wales will make off with the loot and the Development Bank will write off its loss. That is what has happened. That is why pletely a creature of trading bank thinking. That is why we resent the position in which the bank has been placed although we accepted the bank as the best of a bad job when it was established. In view of the small amount of capital, the bank has made a fairly good profit-£600,000 . The whole concept of development surely is not encompassed in this small bank with its small development. If you want to look at another side of the question, you can always tell where the banks or the insurance companies are going by the way they lash out with their investments in buildings. At the top of Martin Place, Sydney, the Reserve Bank is to build a £4,000,000 bank. The Commonwealth Bank is busy expanding everywhere. But wedged in between them is the tiny, emaciated Development Bank, which, under this Government, is not meant to grow to any great extent. It is to be used as a gimmick to suggest that there is a liberal lending reservoir of money for the ruralists in this bank. There was a nobler and freer concept in the Chifley banking legislation, which has been truncated by this measure. This Government got into power in the long and weary past because it told the country that there was something wrong with Labour's attitude to banking. Having won an election upon that issue it left most of the salient points of the Chifley laws where they were. But in order to kid to the",42,Commonwealth Banks Bill
107,Mr Turnbull,Will you,43,Commonwealth Banks Bill
108,Mr Haylen,"I ask the honorableelectors and its supporters, particularly the wealthy trading banks, the Government had to do something about the Commonwealth Bank. If honourable members think that this is a fictitious version I suggest that they points that were driven home by the honorget a trading banker to tell them what he thinks of the Government in relation to the Commonwealth Bank. Look at the articles in the newspapers daily about the influence of the Commonwealth Bank! There is the old irk, the old hatred, the old desire of the private interests to get theirfingerson the people's bank. So, the Development Bank is not powerful, for the reasons much more explicitly put forward by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports than by myself. The argument that has been advanced on the other side of the House has had nothing to do with the case. We do not say that it is nol a good thing that these fellows should get rural credits. We think it is a splendid thing. The Government's Development Bank is some sort of rugged adaptation of the rural credit scheme first conceived by the honourable member for Lalor( Mr to get money from the Development Bank. Pollard) when he was a Minister and later developed into the Industrial Finance Department of the Commonwealth Bank. That department could, by now, have been an enormous bank on its own. The radical banking policy of the Labour Party is not opposed to having a lot of banks as long as they are all controlled by the people and sectionalized in this day of specialization. The honourable member for Barker, after having ranted about the trading banks and is a beautiful link between the Commontheir great rights and freedom, then said wealth Bank and the trading banks, and that that there could not be too many banks. He if one of those banks will not touch a proposaid that his idea was that everybody should sition, the money can be obtained from the be able to have a special bank to go to if Development Bank. Because of the narrowhe wanted to do so. He knows, in his ness of the bank's charter and the limitation own heart, that planning must enter into of its funds, it cannot do very much. When the banking sphere just as it must enter we contrast the statements made about our into all other activities. I have risen to-day because I wanted to able member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate), direct attention to the fact that the Developwith the very limited amount of money that ment Bank has a function to fulfil. To-day can be got out of the Development Bank, it reminds one of a plant that could grow we can see that the argument that this bank extensively but is placed in too small a is really worthwhile is completely cockflower pot. Dr. Coombs has indicated, in eyed. the statement read by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, that that is his view. vigorous and growing partner of the group Sir John Crawford goes a little further and of banks known as the Commonwealth Banksays that he believes we must not expect ing Corporation. As the position stands, it too much from this bank, because it does not have the facilities for growth, although it has the facilities for lending to people who want to use its services. Those are the able member for Melbourne Ports. Having read the reports, I b&& that the concept of the bank was not a generous one. It was established as a result of pressure applied to the Government by the Country Party. When the Government went to the polls, the members of the Country Party wanted to be able to say, "" We shall lend more and more money to the farmers "". The honourable member for Barker made the nonsensical statement that anybody who approaches the bank for money will get it. Rubbish! You have to go through the grinder and undergo a psychological examination by an inspector, a deputy chairman, and so on, before getting any money. You have to go through the mincer that all borrowers have to go through. I know from some of my constituents who have properties in the country that it is hard They have accounts in the Commonwealth Bank or in the trading banks. If the proposition is a little doubtful, they are told, ""Why do you not try the Development Bank?"" The Development Bank has become tired of being asked to finance propositions that are no good at all. It naturally curls up, and people do not get interviews with the directorate as easily as they would like. Let us not run away with the idea that this illimitable future by, for instance, the honorThe Development Bank should be a lusty, is a little tweenie, alternating between the scullery and the attic and living on the crumbs that fall from the other sides of the banking structure. It has made a profit of only £600,000, so obviously its operations have been limited by its capitalization. The Commonwealth Bank this year is letting out £300,000,000 in loans and advances. This bank is lending about £11,000,000. That is the figure given by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. It is a useful thing, but it is small. It is silly to talk as if the pig meats, but he has run into a solid brick bank were something that had been planned on an enormous scale. It cannot really act as a development bank because its capital is limited. . Speaking merely as an observer and as a dilettante in relation to banking and economics, I thought a vital point was made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in relation to deposits. How simple it is to lend money when it is coming in practically free. This Development Bank does not issue cheques; it does not say, "" Come in and bank with us"". Cheques are exchanged between those who have mortgages and overdrafts, but it is not a general trading bank. Would it not be better, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has said quite reasonably, to let the bank have its own funds, rather than to depend on grants from the Government' from time to time in amounts of £5,000,000, such as this legislation provides for? Would it not be better for the bank to have money of its own so that it could grow? If that is not tb be the case, I am suspicious enough to believe that the bank, was never intended to survive. I have looked through the list of banking "" dos and don'ts"" in relation to this institution. We have heard a glorious story to the effect that everybody who cannot get money from the trading banks can go to the Development Bank and that Bob will be literally their uncle and give them money. That is not borne out either in fact or in fiction, as far as I can see. A farmer can get money from the bank only if his production has something to do with exports. It is all bound up with that accursed term "" balance of payments "". We have to pay our debts overseas. We are frightened of the landlady, or of the people in Lombardstreet. Before the bank will lend some of the. people's money to a farmer, to grow lucerne or something else, it has to make sure that he is producing for export. I do not think that that is fair or reasonable. When the Labour Party takes control, the bank's charter will be greatly extended in regard to its finance and its ability to lend, so that it can make a proper job of development. A constituent of mine is keenly interested in the development of an overseas market for wheat products and for bacon and other wall in his attempts to get finance. In the first place, the milling combine will not let him get into production, because it holds mortgages against him in other banks. The Development Bank will not help him. He has approached it. When he talks about the scheme to expand his piggeries and increase his production of pig meats, the bank does not treat him in the manner which the charter provides. He is finding it extremely difficult to get set. I believe that restrictive practices are preventing this bank from treating genuine cases on their merits. The Development Bank was established to help people who had good propositions. A man should not be required to have collateral for a loan, if he has the spirit and the will to succeed; he should be looked upon as a good risk. I shall develop this theme on another occasion. Perhaps this is not the appropriate time to do so. The man to whom I have referred has a sound project for an export industry. He was undoubtedly good for the money he wanted to borrow but he has not been allowed to get it. ShallI tell the House why? It is because there is a gentlemen's agreement between the trading banks and the Commonwealth Bank. People are told that they must stay with the banks with which they have been dealing. Although the bank of your choice in 1931 may not be the bank of your choice in 1951, you are stuck with it. That is a stultification of banking. We read the gobbledygook in these reports about how free the Development Bank is to be and about how every application for finance is to be treated entirely on its merits, but that is not happening. The philosophy of the trading banks, ""Just get the profit and let the credit go"", still operates, and under this Government it is operating in the Development Bank. That ought not to be so. As custodians of the people's ""money, we should not let this bill go through without softie comment. We know that the bank is being used as a gimmick. The Government dare not take the Commonwealth Bank away. It was created by the Labour Party and developed to the nth degree by the Chifley Government. The Government does not want to interfere with the rampaging, free enterprise banks. This little wedge between the two sides is there only to gull the public. I rose to answer the honourable member for Barker and to support the statement of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. We do not think that, in principle, there is anything wrong with the Development Bank, but we say that it is wrong to circumscribe the bank by giving it a miserable allowance such as this and then to talk in grandiose terms about the tremendous job it is doing. If the Development Bank were used to foster the growth of rural products for export, it would be an enormous thing. As it is, it is a weak thing and it does not become very much stronger by being given another £5,000,000. The argument of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is completely valid. We should not only increase the capital of the bank. We should, in addition, make it easier for those who have no collateral to borrow from the bank, providing they are engaged in rural industry. We should not come down too much on the side of industrialization, but that is happening. Those people who have industrial collateral can get money from the bankIn a few years they will have got more money out of it than will the ruralists. That is where the trouble lies. You can get accommodation more quickly with industrial collateral, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has said. The measure should not be treated in this House as if it were.something miraculous. It is a miserable little alternative to banking properly rationalized by the Labour Party. [3.25] I have listened with.great care to. October, will bring the banks additional the discussion on finance on which the capital to £10,000,000. The result of those honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) two increases is that the capital of the bank embarked. Quite frankly, with the greatest will now be £25,857,000, in addition to will in the world I found it very difficult to which, as the Treasurer said in his second-: make up my mind on exactly what he reading speech, the bank has substantial wanted and what he expected to happen. In the first place, he virtually condemned the Development Bank, root and branch. Then he said that Mr Chifley had introduced certain banking legislation which, according to him, was ever so much better than the banking legislation as it has evolved under the present Menzies Government and the previous Menzies Administration in which Sir Arthur Fadden was Treasurer. I have checked a statement that I heard the late right honourable member for Cowper, Sir Earle Page, make on more than one occasion. He said that when the Chifley banking legislation went through the functions of the Commonwealth Savings Bank were completely altered. Sir Earle said quite clearly in private conversation that he did not think that Mr Chifley fully realized what his own legislation was going to do. He went on to say that the Commonwealth Savings Bank had ceased to operate according to the original intention-whic h was to use the savings of small depositors for the benefit of home builders, small farmers and so on-and that its original function had been completely lost when the bank started to be used as a pool from which money in large amounts was drawn for the financing of activities other than those I have mentioned. There is not the slightest doubt about the truth of that statement by the veteran statesman, Sir Earle Page, who knew this whole matter from beginning to end, because he took an active part, as a member of the first Commonwealth Bank Board, in the formation and development of the Commonwealth Bank. What was evolved from the original Commonwealth Bank of Australia was a banking corporation, of which the Development Bank is a department. The purpose of this bill has been made quite clear by the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Hold). It is the provision of a further sum of £5,000,000 for ""the Commonwealth Development Bank, which, with the £5,000,000 already provided for in the",43,Commonwealth Banks Bill
109,Mr Drummond (New England) Commonwealth Banks Act Enacted Last,"reserves of its own and also employs considerable sums borrowed from the Commonwealth Savings Bank. I have no great wish to develop my argument on a purely party political basis. It is quite obvious that, no matter what may be said on either side of the House, there is agreement that the measure should be passed. Of course, when it comes to the question of whether or not the measure makes adequate provision, it is the traditional function of the Opposition always to claim that what the Government does is not adequate and that what the Opposition would do, were it in power, would be magnificent. Experience shows that when an Opposition making such a claim does attain power the promised magnificence fades to a tinselled sheen with no pure gold in it. We will ho doubt hear quite a lot from the Opposition on those lines. I do not intend to argue on this measure merely for the sake of argument. It is most interesting to examine the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959-61, which the present bill will amend. According to section 72 of that act the functions of the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia aire as follows:(a) to provide finance for persons(i) for the purposes of primary producthe personnel to carry it on they did not tion; or (ii) for the establishment or development of industrial undertakings, monwealth Banks Act the position was that particularly small undertakings, in cases where, in the opinion of the Development Bank, the provision of the finance is desirable and the finance would not otherwise be available on reasonable and suitable terms and conmental stage on his farm. When such ditions; and (b) to provide advice and assistance with a view to promoting the efficient organizastorekeepers carried the man on the land tion and conduct of primary production ' or of industrial undertakings. This is particularly apropos to what I have to say. Section 73 (1.) of the same act provides as follows:In determining whether or not finance shall be provided for a person, the Development Bank shall have regard primarily to the prospects of the operations of that person becoming, or continuing to be, successful and shall not necessarily have regard to the value of the security available in respect of that finance. Let me take the last few words of that provision in order to refresh the memories of members who were present when that legislation was debated. A strong point made by the Treasurer of the day,Sir Arthur Fadden, and by speakers on the Government side was that the supreme purpose of the bill as applied to rural production was assistance to people who had small resources and had experience, in some cases, of operating the necessary plant, but did not have the money to make their operations on the land a success. Having directed the attention of the House to those points I shall pass on at this stage to the question of how far the activities of the bank are helpful to those engaged in primary industry. AnythingI may say which may appear to reflect upon the head of the Development Bank or his officers is said not in the way of captious criticism but in order to express my views on why, in my experience at least, this bank has not always proved as successful as my friend from Barker( Mr Forbes) claims it has proved in that well-ordered and extraordinarily well-governed state, South Australia. I believe that the first great difficulty that the founders and organizers of the bank were met with was the lack of trained personnel to handle the kind of business which the bank was established to carry on. When they had the business and have sufficient finance to do what they wanted. Prior to the passing of the Comthe great private trading banks provided, not as long-term loans, but as their equivalent, overdrafts which carried the man on the land through a great part of the developfinancial assistance was not available the until times improved. At other times, because of extraordinary circumstances, the Rural Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank came to the assistance of the farmer. At one time the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales granted loans to farmers. As the result of action taken by various governments in New South Wales, many men were saved from ruinous bankruptcy. The men who were helped by the bank had no security to offer. Their entire equity was pledged among the bank, the store and the firm handling their wool. They had no reserves of finance and the money lent to them by the bank was designed to carry them through a particularly difficult period. Unfortunately, the restrictive deposit policy followed by the Commonwealth Bank right up to the time when this Government gained control of the treasury bench killed the capacity of the private banks to finance long-term primary development as they had been financing it in the the past. Something was needed to fill the gap. I propose to refer to some remarks passed by Professor J. N . Lewis, Professor of Agricultural Economics at the University of New England. Professor Lewis's appointment is the first that has been made to the Faculty of Agricultural Economics in Australia. That this should be so is an eternal disgrace to a country that is so dependent on primary production. Professor Lewis's statement appears in the current issue of the journal of the Australian Institute of. Agricultural Science. The statement readsThree major trends are affecting the ability of primary producers to undertake development of their own properties. That statement has special reference to the measure that is before this House. The question arises whether some additional amount should be provided to the Commonwealth Bank over and above the amount provided in this bill. Professor Lewis's statement continuesThese are: The greatly increased amount of capital required for modern farming. Any one who has paid regard to farming will know how step by step the horse, the bullock and the plough have been replaced by tractors and complicated modern machinery. The second trend referred to by Professor Lewis isThe reduced ability of farmers to finance development expenditure out of current income as a result of the cost-price squeeze being experienced develop his property by investing his income. by major rural industries. The third trend isThe withdrawal of the trading banks from long and medium-term financing of development undertakings and their increasing tendency to confine thrift, courage and enterprise of the people their operations to providing short-term working in my part of the country. They have set capital. Those are major reasons not only why we Their problem is not confined to increasing should increase the capital of the Commontheir development from income. On the wealth Development Bank but also why we contrary their problem is to find sufficient should take an even wider view. I am not money and sufficient faith in what they aro foreshadowing an amendment to the bill, doing to make good on the land, 8.MARCH,.1962.]._ Commonwealth Banks Bill. 643 but I do suggest that the Government give earnest consideration to my remarks. The article from which I have quoted continuesPointing out that larger amounts of capital will almost inevitably have to be employed in agriculture if the average earnings in that industry are to remain comparable with those in urban occupations, Professor Lewis says that "" without a high rate of capital formation Australian agriculture will come to be characterized by low-income rural communities, such as those existing in many parts of the United States and typical of peasant populations of many other advanced industrial economies."" That is not a situation that we can lightly overlook. Professor Lewis points out that there is a tendency to-day for big concerns to buy up farms. He warns that unless we are careful a new serfdom will develop in this country and that the individual farmer with reasonable financial strength, guiding the operations of his property and providing for the future of his family, will be replaced by people who will be working virtually under contract conditions. That will inevitably lead to a reduction in the status of the man on the land. I agree with Oliver Goldsmith that the decay of the rural population as compared with the rest of the population is the beginning of the decay of a nation. Professor Lewis statesIn the long run either rural credit facilities will be improved, preserving our traditional familyfarm organization of agriculture in the face of greatly-increased capital requirements, or some other organization will tend to emerge in which the farm family is likely to have less independence and considerably less control of management decisions. That statement has extreme relevance to the measure that we are now debating. The honourable member for Barker said that the farmer will never be content to borrow money for developmental purposes when he cannot reasonably expect to be able to The problem associated with development from income is the inability of the individual to provide reserves as in the case of companies. I have great admiration for the aside money that they cannot now touch. We are indebted to the Faculty of Agricultural Economics at the University of New England and to Professor Lewis for the work that they have done. Professor Lewis was able to induce a bank in the New England district to lend £13,500 to a man for development of his property. The man concerned raised the income of that property in a dry year from £2,400 to £15,000. He changed the cost-income ratio from about 60 per cent, to 32 per cent. That is understandable. If you are not over-capitalized and if you produce a greater number of animals and fatten them, the proportion of cost to income will fall. The trouble is that it has not been found possible to do this in many cases. I suggest that there may be some vacillation, not only in government circles, but also in banking circles, as to what is to be the real policy of development in Australia. In the first place, I think that, on the banking side, it is utterly wrong to tie the Development Bank, which is designed for rural development, in with, industrial development. There ought to be provision for industrial development, but the two things are entirely different. Rural developproducers that brought about the crash. ment is long-term development to a greater extent than is industrial development. What is really necessary is a land mortgage bank to take care of that side of development while the Development Bank carries out the functions which we ourselves forecast would be necessary. It would attend to the needs of share-farmers who had the know-how to farm their own properties. It would provide the capital they needed to purchase properties and plant, so that they could know that feeling of security that freehold gives. It would assist junior farmers-youn g men bred to the game who understand the work of a farmer. Men whose land was not properly developed but who had some assets would be able to get money to expand their production. But all that means expanded rural production. What does this nation want? Is there some vacillation on this matter? We need all we can get from our major source of exports and that is land production, which provides 80. per cent., or slightly more, of our exports. We want all that; but if we get it, may we not be faced with the necessity to sell our produce at unpayable prices? I put some ideas on paper, a little crudely perhaps, a few years ago under the title "" Australia's Dilemma "". I pointed out that unless the problem of making primary production more profitable was faced, we would find a decline in the returns to primary producers. This would throw them out of line with those in secondary and tertiary. industries and we would have exactly what we have nowa considerable amount of unemployment. It is not a matter of what this Government has done or has not done. The trouble is this imbalance between the primary producers' returns and his costs, and between his returns and those offering in other avenues of employment. As soon as the income of the primary producer is affected, the impact is felt throughout the economy. I hear the constant claim from the Opposition that the present unemployment in Australia could have been avoided, but if members of the Opposition study the calamitous events that took place in ths 'thirties, they will find that it was the im-' balance between the returns of the primary producers and those of the secondary In New South Wales alone, we had 250;O0O persons unemployed, although the population was only half of what it is to-day. The rest of the Commonwealth was similarly affected. This is something that we must face up to. We have to decide where we are going. We cannot face up to this problem unless the Development Bank, which we are gradually building up, is trained and organized to meet the responsibilities that it should accept. It must be apart from normal banking and yet have certain banking responsibilities to assist primary producers. It is up to the nation to provide the wherewithal to ensure that the farmer who increases his output will not find him-self depressed by what has been achieved on the one hand with the assistance of the Development Bank and, on the other hand, by his own. initiative. In other words, he must be sure that his own efforts will not rebound against him and produce a depressed condition in his industry. I do not wish to prolong the discussion except to quote one final passage from the report of the Commonwealth Development Bank, which I think is very significant. The report for 1961 statesDuring the year, assistance by way of loan was approved for 2,060 applicants for a total of £10,8 million. This compares with the aggregate for the full year 1959/60 of 770 advances for £5.3 million. The total loan balances of £21 million outstanding at the end of the year comprised £10.7 million rural and £10.3 million industrial. This compares with the 30th June, I960, figures totalling £15.6 million (rural become re-absorbed into industry quickly. £6.8 million, industrial £8.8 million). This is but an infant enterprise. I think its objective is worthy of the support of all parties in this House. I congratulate the Treasurer and the Government on having brought down this measure to provide additional capital, but I ask them to look at some of the aspects of the matter I have raised and to ensure that something that was started off with good intentions shall not founder on an imbalance between the returns to primary producers and those obtained by other sections of the community. There are obligations that must be accepted if the community is to get the full benefit of this measure. rise to support the bill. I listened witn interest to the speech of the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes). The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) has already replied to many of his statements. All I want to say in answer to him is that I have yet to learn that the constituents of any other honourable member have been able to go to any bankthe Development Bank included-wit h a request that has been completely successful. The statement of the honourable member for Barker to that effect was too silly for words. Apparently the honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond) is following the line that the Australian Country Party has adopted in similar debates previously. The honourable member for Parkes told the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) that this baby was left by the Country Party on the Liberal Party's doorstep, and the Liberal Party has not yet woken up to the fact that it is there. The attitude of the Labour Party has not altered since 1959, when the Commonwealth Development Bank was established. Obviously the bank was born because of the success of the Industrial Finance Department and the Mortgage Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank at the end of the Second World War. The Industrial Finance Department did a great deal towards the rehabilitation of many men coming out of the services. In my own electorate many ex-servicemen, with the assistance of the bank, were able to In other Words, the two departments to which I have referred assisted both in the industrial and the rural fields when a quick switch-over from a war-time economy to a peace-time economy was necessary. It was obvious to the Government-and apparently also to the trading banks-that if these departments of the Commonwealth Bank were allowed to continue to prosper, they would present a very serious challenge in the banking field to the trading banks. So was born this Commonwealth Development Bank which had imposed upon it the restriction of capital to which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) has referred. I propose to deal with the activities of the bank in the last twelve months. The bank is to be congratulated for the degree of success that it has achieved. But it has achieved its success not because of the assistance that this Government has given it but in spite of this Government's action in allowing it a meagre capital with which to operate. The Government told the bank that it could accept deposits, but we know that it receives no deposits other than those which come to it from the Commonwealth Savings Bank which help to provide capital for its operations. The Labour Party wants a Commonwealth Development Bank. This country is crying out for development. But we do not want an organization which is misnamed development bank. We do not want an organization which is hamstrung and restricted. As the honourable member for New England has stated, only 2,060 applications for assistance were granted last year. Good Lord, do you think for one moment that if we had a real development bank we would receive only 2,060 applications for assistance from the whole of Australia? It is too silly for words. The Labour Party wants a development bank in the real sense of the term. We would",46,Commonwealth Banks Bill
110,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [3.54],"1like to see the Industrial Finance Department and the Mortgage Bank Department continue to expand as they were expanding at the end of the war. We do not want the Commonwealth Bank to have foisted on it a development bank which is so restricted business for which the assistance is sought, and hamstrung that it cannot become a serious competitor of the trading banks. The legislation provides that the trading to succeed before considering the matter of banks shall become agents for the Development Bank. If a man has reached the limit of his overdraft with a trading bank and wants to buy a piece of machinery or some plant, if he bas an industrial undertaking, or a tractor or farm machinery if he has a farm, do you mean to say that the trading bank would allow that client to go through its door? He would be sent to the end of the counter in the bank and told that he could obtain the equipment and plant that he needed under hire purchase. We know that practice has been going on because the trading banks are associated with hire-purchase firms. What grounds, then, has the Development Bank for expecting that the trading banks will act as agents world which has a development bank. for it? Last year, when the credit squeeze was the ultimate goal of which is to foster upon us, the trading banks took the oppordevelopment in much the same way as the tunity to get rid of accounts that they did Commonwealth Development Bank seeks to not want.

The Labour Party conletter from a trading bank, the risk, if the tends that if we are really interested in loan is made, will be borne by the Development Bank? The manager of the Commonwealth Development Bank is restricted in his activities by an act of Parliament. It is true that he looks to the success of the the integrity of the individual and the possibility that the business will continue security, but security is necessary. To suggest, as has been suggested, that this amendment to the act is marvellous from the point of view of primary and secondary industry is carrying things too far. We know that the legislation has been amended only because the Industrial Finance Department and the Mortgage Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank were so successful. From its inception, in 1959, the Commonwealth Development Bank became an instant success, as indicated in the report of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, to which I shall refer later. Australia is not the only country in the Western Eighty countries have development banks, In the last twelve months in particular, The first definite signs of production is consumed in Australia. The development, if we really want increased production, the only restriction that sbould be imposed on the capital of this bank is inability to use it.. I do not say that the Development Bank should throw money about willy-nilly, but while it can use capital, following the same lines as it follows to-day in the granting of loans, it should have that capital. We have to increase production to build up overseas balances. The need for money for development is obvious when you go into Queensland. It is true that the rural industries have increased their production by about 40 per cent, in the last ten years, but production could be stepped up further if the necessary money were available. As the population increases, the demand for primary products rises. The growing internal demand makes it necessary for every encouragement to be given to primary production. I believe that the Development Bank should be closely associated with the Commonwealth Research Organization. I know for a fact that at this very moment in Neebo, near Mackay in Queensland, in the Isaacs River area in that State, field parties from the CSIRO. are investigating the area. I know also that the CSIRO. has information concerning what have come to be known as the Dawson and Fitzroy River basins in Queensland. A couple of years ago a senior officer of that organization told cannot get it from the trading banks. Many me that the primary production potential of those two areas is enormous-the best in the Commonwealth. Capital is required for their development. If there was a real development bank, not one hamstrung by the limitation of capital so that it can deal with only 2,060 applications in twelve months-thos e applications were spread over the Commonwealth, not coming from only one area-and if the bank was working in close association with another government instrumentality, we would get that substantial increase in primary production for which we are all looking and in which, to all intents and purposes, the Government also is interested. Though the Development Bank was subject to all the restrictions that were imposed by this Government, through the credit squeeze, on the banking system last year, its resources were fully employed. If the Government believes in a development bank, let it lift all those restrictions, and let the institution be a real development bank. It is true that the trading banks could use this bank to enable them to withdraw their support from some primary producers if they wanted to do so. But the position of the trading banks to-day, as disclosed through the very substantial support for the recent Commonwealth loan, is such, apparently, that they have more deposits than people looking for overdrafts, or else that their customers are cutting back on their bank overdrafts, following a direction to the banks in November, 1960, as part of the credit squeeze. It is quite obvious from the development of the companies and institutions on the fringe of the banking system that the old order is changing, giving place to the new. Apparently the trading banks, by virtue of tbeir association with the hire-purchase companies in a very substantial way, are appreciative of the Scientific and Industrial changes that are taking place within our national financial organization. If this Development Bank is to play its part amid these changes taking place in the financial organization of the Commonwealth, the Government must lift all these restrictions on it and give it capital so that those who are desirous of developing their properties or their undertakings can get the necessary accommodation from that bank, if they farmers have told me personally that the Development Bank is conservative in outlook. This conservatism has been brought about purely and simply through the limitation of its capital. Another matter to which the Government should give serious consideration is the interest rate. According to the report for the year ended 30th June, 1961, the interest rate on moneys received through the Development Bank at present is 7 per cent. -the maximum rate for bank overdrafts in most banks throughout Australia. If tbe Development Bank is to be a real development institution, and if it is to serve that purpose, it must lend at low rates of interest. The cheaper the money, the greater the use that will be made of its services. To-day the primary producer faces high costs all around him, and receives low prices for his products, by comparison with his costs of production. If you propose to load a 7 per cent, burden on him through the interest charge on a loan for development, he simply will not borrow the money and the development will not take .place. The piece of machinery will not be bought. If the man concerned is a farmer, the whole community suffers, because there is a loss in production. .On the other hand, cheap money would mean extra production and development, and work for those who to-day are unemployed. All that is bound up with this question. The objections that we of the Labour Party have to this measure relate to the restriction on capital and the high interest rate of 7 per cent. That rate should be cut back. Then we would get the production and development so sorely needed. Incidentally, a reduction in the interest rate might well mean the difference between a man being able to borrow money to remain on his farm and having to go off it. Many farmers, as a result of their experience in recent times-and particularly last year, when bank overdrafts were called up-hav e had a pretty bad fright. NowI turn to the report for the year ended 30th June, 1961, of the Commonwealth Development Bank. of Australia. On page 30 we find the following statement:Full use of the Bank's present resources is being made, and it is already clear that in the national interest the present resources will require the report shows that all the resources of tb .be augmented substantially. The honourable member for Barker said surer ( Mr Harold Holt) said in his speech, that no applicant had been knocked back; this increase of the bank's capital by but the bank's report states that full use £5,000,000 was part of the plan to rehabiliof the bank's resources had been made, tate the economy and get it back onto somewith 2,060 applications granted throughthing like an even keel.

I suggest also that as this bank, was meet their requirements. not set up for the purpose of making a profit for shareholders, as is the case with ing economy, and a country either prothe private trading banks, then the interest gresses or retrogresses according to the level rate charged could be reduced, and cheaper of capital investment, whether in the private money made available to those seeking sector or the public sector. The credit loans. The report also saysDuring the year, assistance by way of loan the expansion of Australia's economy. was approved for 2,060 applicants for a total of Consider the chaos that followed. The £10.8 million. This compares with the aggregate for the full year 19S9/60 of 770 advances for £5.3 million. There is an urgent need for. the services of the bank to be expanded. . Customers are waiting to avail themselves of these services. This is borne out by tbe report -whic h shows that the number of people, who secured accommodation increased by 250 per cent, between 1959-60 and 1960-61.. On page 31 of the report appears a table headed "" Classification of Loans approved according to Amount"". The total number of loans was 2,060. Of these,. 1,469 were for amounts under £5,000. Five loans were made in the industrial field for amounts over £50,000, of which two were for £100,000 or more. The important point emerging from the table is that 1,469 loans were for less than £5,000. If a farmer buys a tractor to-day, half of his £5,000 has gone before he can turn around. By the time he buys a few sheets of iron to put up a shed to house the tractor, and makes a few urgent repairs to fences and other installations, he has very little left out of his £5,000. the report says on page 31The average amounts of the loans approved during the year were Rural £4,300 and Industrial £15,025. The table shows that more than 90 per cent in number of all loans approved during 1960/61 were for amounts of £10,000 or less. It is only six months since the bank's capital was increased by £5,000,000, and the bank were fully utilized. As the Treagreat benefit, not only to the Development Bank itself but also to the economy as a tunate enough to get some of the money to The economy of Australia is a developsqueeze of last year applied the brakes to number of bankruptcies increased and wholesale unemployment followed, and the Government was forced in January last to make available by way of grant extra money to the States in an attempt to reduce the level of unemployment, which had risen to more than 130,000 persons. I hope this additional capital will be quickly employed, and that we will see, as a result, a further step along the road to development. I support the bill, because the Development Bank is vital from the point of view of Australia's progress. It is vital for increased production in the future, particularly primary production, and it is vital from the point of view of employment in primary industry. explanation, Mr Speaker. I claim to have been misrepresented both by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) and by the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr by an act of this Parliament. It is true Riordan). They both said that 1 had been stupid enough to get up in this House and say that every applicant for a Development Bank loan in South Australia had been accepted. I shall read to the House what I said. It is contained in a "" Hansard"" proof which I have before me, and which has been unaltered. I saidI. have been pretty closely in on a large proporto be increased, when this is to be done, tion of the transactions made by the South Australian Branch of the Development Bank with rural industry in that State, because the electorate by any borrowing or transfer from other of Barker is the area in South Australia in which the greatest amount of rural development is taking place-in a State in which the high rainfall zone is fairly restricted. I cantherefore say, without fear of challenge, that the bank in South Australia has never, since its inception And this is the pointrefused a loan to an applicant on the ground that it. did not have sufficient funds available. If the honourable member wants to know the actual proportion of applications granted in South Australia, it is four-fifths. ^ It seems that this bill should have the unanimous support of all honourable members, and we are, I think, on both sides of the House endeavouring to approach it in a constructive manner. This measure has been brought down as part-and a very desirable and appropriate part-of thc Government's policy to expand employment. It is part of the Government's policy to push on as quickly as possible with the development of this country. The extra £5,000,000 allocated by this bill will bring the capital of the bank up to about £20,000,000. In terms of banking capital this is a large amount. It is comparable with the capital of the biggest of the private trading banks, and I think it is about double the capital of any of the other banks. It is perfectly true, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), I think, pointed out earlier in this debate, that the Development Bank does not have access to large deposits, although under section 74 of the principal act it does have the right to receive deposits, and the fact that it does not get them is simply a result of the exercise of choice by the public. I think it is appropriate that when wo decide to provide this extra capital, which is necessary and desirable, we should do so that the bank can borrow. It can borrow from other banks. Directly, or indirectly, this is a grant of money, repayable, perhaps, by those who borrow it indirectly. Nevertheless, it is a hypothecation of Commonwealth credit to those who would not otherwise qualify for that credit. It is therefore appropriate for the resources of the bank openly by an act of this Parliament and not banks. Honourable members will remember that section 85 of the principal act statesThe Treasurer may, from time to time, out of moneys appropriated by the Parliament for the purpose, but not otherwise, lend to, or deposit with, the Development Bank such amounts . . . as are agreed . . . That provides another way of giving the bank extra capital. I think that in point of fact it might have been more appropriate to use the machinery of that section rather than the machinery envisaged in the present bill to make additional capital available to the bank. I do not say that the extra capital should not be provided. Let me not be misunderstood on that point. When we read the annual reports of the Commonwealth Development Bank, and particularly the last one, of course, we see a conspectus of its activities. But the reports do not, I think, really disclose the nature of the functions which the bank is",50,Commonwealth Banks Bill
111,Mr Forbes,I wish to make a personal,54,Commonwealth Banks Bill
112,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [4.23].,"discharging. May I remind honourable certainly the development of mineral members of the bank's real functions. resources. Here we have our great opporSection 72 of the principal act providesThe functions of the Development Bank are(a) to provide finance for persons(i) for the purposes of primary production; or (ii) for the establishment or developpeople, one would say that a higher proporment of industrial undertaktion of our resources ought to be channelled ings, undertakings, In cases where, in the opinion of the Development Bank, the provision of the finance is desirable and the finance would not otherwise be available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions; . . . Section 73 (1.) statesIn determining whether or not finance shall be provided for a person, the Development Bank shall have regard primarily to the prospects of the operations of that person becoming, or continuing to be, successful and shall not necessarily have regard to the value of the security available in respect of that finance. I have summarized the provisions of the act a little, but that is, briefly, the charter of the bank. The Development Bank is not to take over the proper functions of the other banks. That is not what it is for. I think that the prime purpose of the bank is to channel resources and money into directions which are desirable from the national point of view-int ofieldsin which, for some reason or other, there is not the financial backing which gives the security required in a normal banking operation, or in which the money would not be available from some other source on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions. I come now to the matter to which, I think, the honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond) was turning his mind. As the position is, we have various requirements to enable us to make the best of our available resources in Australia. I agree with honourable members on both sides of this House who say that making the best of the available resources requires a measure of full employment as well as everything else. I think that honourable members will agree that, when one looks at the Australian economy and at what has happened in the last two or three years, one sees that the most significant frontier of development-the field in which we can get the best results from the employment of additional resources-is almost tunity both to increase exports and to replace imports. Looking at the matter from the standpoint of applying our resources in a way which will do most to raise the standard of living of the Australian particularly small into the field of minerals. I think it is rather a pity, then, that there is some doubt about the functions of the Commonwealth Development Bank under section 72 of the principal act, part of which I read a moment ago. It states that one of the functions of the bank is to providefinancefor the purposes of primary production. The act does not, I think, define the term "" primary production "". If one looks at the definition of this term in other acts, one finds that in all probability this expression does not include mining. Certainly, as defined in the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act, the term does not include mining. Nevertheless, mining, in one sense of the term, is primary production. Again, is a mine an industrial undertaking? One of the functions of the Development Bank stated in section 72 of the principal act is to provide finance for the establishment or development of industrial undertakings. I suppose that a mine is an industrial undertaking. It would have been better if these things had been explicitly expressed in the act. I regard this point as being of particular importance because of the need to obtain from Australian sources more money for the promotion of oil drilling and prospecting in this country. Some time ago, I wrote to the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) about the provision of finance for the search for oil, and the right honourable gentleman very courteously referred the matter to the Commonwealth Development Bank. On 16th May, 1960, he transmitted to me the result of that reference to the bank. His letter was in these termsI have now received advice from the Managing Director to the effect that the provision of finance by the Development Bank for oil search purposes is regarded as being beyond the scope of that Bank's activities. Under the provisions of section 73 of the Commonwealth Banks Act 19S9 it is incumbent on the Development Bank in providingfinanceto be satisfied that the enterprisefinancedhas a reasonable chance of becoming, or continuing to be, successful. The Managing Director has pointed out that oil prospecting ventures are necessarily speculative in character, and that it would not be possible for the Development Bank to satisfy itself with regard to section 73 of the Act in relation to particular oil-prospecting ventures. I feel that there is perhaps some straining which could be sold, so that the bank could in the managing director's interpretation of recoup itself from those ventures which were section 73 of the act. That section provides successful and write off the losses of those that the bank shall have regard primarily which were not successful, and still balance to the prospects of a venture, and the out. managing director has taken the word "" primarily "" to mean that it is incumbent on the bank to have regard to the prospects be to provide risk capital, the second to of a venture. The words "" primarily "" and provide capital to help our exports-o r at "" incumbent"" are different and they have least our balance of payments-and the different meanings. This is particularly third to provide re-adjustment capital, parapparent since, when one reads section 73 ticularly for those rural industries where of the act, one sees that the draftsman there is a reason why producers should be inserted the word "" primarily "" in opposition helped to remain prosperous on the land. to the word "" necessarily "", which appears The reason may be that owing to a shift later in the section. The proper construcof world markets, or methods of production of this section, I think, is a little different tion, the producers are not in a position to from that set out in the letter which I have carry on profitably under their previous just quoted. It seems to me that we have here a case in which Australia's interest in seeing that capital is available for the search for oil the example of oil. I do not think I need justified action which would be unorthodox go beyond that. It is eminently desirable in banking terms. The Development Bank, for Australian capital to be available for however, by its very nature and by definithe development of our oil potential. It tion, is an unorthodox bank. It exists to might be said, "" Surely the Stock Exchange do things which an orthodox bank does can provide this capital?"" Perhaps the not do-particularl y to have regard to the Australian investor has been lax in not national interest. I suggest that the bank has three functions I do not think that any impediment will in this regard. The first relates to risk occur in the future, whatever may have capital. I know that honourable members occurred in the past, but it was desirable, will say that the provision of risk capital is and it is desirable for risk capital to be not a banking function. It is not an orthoavailable from Australian sources for oil dox banking function, most certainly. I development. know that honourable members will say that this sort of capital should come from the market in various ways. So it should, for export opportunities. I think I menindeed, and one hopes that it will. But tioned earlier this week in the House the when it is not available from the market, necessity to build up buffer stocks in our and when Australia's interests require that export industries. Let me again give one it be made available in some way, the example. I cite our steel industry as a Development Bank, it seems to me, should typical example; it is becoming a source of properly step in and undertake the venture. major export income for Australia. We The terms on which it does so might have to hope that it will continue as such, but if it be non-orthodox banking terms, because is it will need to carry large buffer stocks. participation in a risk venture necessarily These stocks are necessary for a combinaimplies participation in the profits should the tion of two reasons. First, overseas export venture succeed. Of course, normal bank interest does not cover that kind of thing. Perhaps we do not want the Development Bank to be the equity-owner of large slices of risk capital. [Quorum formed.] As I was saying, the provision of risk capital might be made acceptable to the bank by some kind of machinery taking up rights Tbe first of the three functions seems to methods of production. Let me give examples of these three things. Dealing, firsr, with risk capital, I give grasping the opportunity to accept the risk. The second function is to provide capital orders cannot be obtained unless continuity of supply can be assured, and secondly, the internal market fluctuates. Unless we have considerable buffer stocks we cannot be as effectual as we should be in the steel export field. 1 am well aware, of course, of the technical difficulties of holding steel buffer producers, but very much the opposite. stocks. Most of the stock would not be held in the form of finished products, except in some of the main bread-andbutter lines. They would be held further down the production list in the form of ingots or something of that character. With an Australian production of 4,000,000 tons of steel a year, now rising to 4,500,000 tons a year, one would think that buffer stocks to the order of 1,000,000 ' tons a year, representing a value of £20,000,000 or £25,000,000 worth of production-no t including, of course, the fixed -charges-woul d be needed. This is the kind of thing which we surely should have done in the last six months. If We had built up these stocks we would have provided a much higher level of employment in the industry at a time when employment was needed, and we would be emerging in this period with a much greater capacity to export, and a much greater capacity to . earn future export income. I mention this simply as an example of the kind of thing which can be done, and should be done. If the finance is to be obtained, perhaps the Development Bank is one of the places from which this kind of finance might be obtained. I come now to the third kind of thing I had in mind, namely, re-adjustment capital. This is something which is required particularly for our primary producers, who need it and have merited it and should get help. One thinks particularly of the dairy industry, which is facing difficulties that are likely to be of long term duration. We should be helping the individual man on the dairy farm. Ih the last few years we have provided, through price support and direct subsidies, some -hundreds of millions of pounds for this purpose, and yet, in many cases-particularly in New South Wales, but not so much in Victoria-the dairy industry remains a depressed industry. We should not tolerate a position where a large group df people are permanently condemned to low incomes, particularly since, with the prospects of meat expansion-if one were to go at it on a big scale, and look at it in a constructive way-som e part of this industry could be converted to a condition where there would be no hardship to the dairyInstead of being low-income people they would become high-income people. This process of re-adjustment is something which requires large capital. The Government has been granting subsidies and not getting returns from those subsidies, and also not giving to the dairy-farmers the return to which they are really entitled. Surely this is the kind of field in which the Development Bank might provide readjustment capital for the help and the expansion of production in areas where real opportunity for development still exists, but there needs to be some change in outlook away from the traditional patterns. I have tried to put a few very basic, very sketchy, but constructive ideas. The Development Bank is not and should not be regarded as a substitute for a normal trading bank, whether it be the Commonwealth Trading Bank or a private trading bank. It is an unorthodox bank, established for a purpose that is not entirely a banking purpose. But it is nevertheless a desirable bank in the national interest. It is for the purpose of giving employment in this situation that we are now being asked to increase the capital of the bank by £5,000,000. The Australian Labour Party believes that there should be a blueprint for the continuing development of Australia and that full employment should be sustained. We believe that such a programme should not be halted, hindered or disrupted because of a shortage of finance, and that the developmental and financial policies of Australia should harmonize in resolute action leading to rural and industrial expansion. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) has offered some criticism of and advice to the Government. He has expressed the view that the people should have higher incomes. The Australian Labour Party declares that all people should be given a chance to earn a living, that there should be full employment, that there should be a continuing rise in the standard of",54,Commonwealth Banks Bill
113,Mr Luchetti (Macquarie) [4.46],"living and that all the proceeds from production in this nation should be spread over the whole community... The honourable member has expressed his views as to how additional finance for the Development Bank might be expended. We are glad to hear some one on the Government side say a word in favour of the Development Bank'.' When it started, it was damned with faint praise by most members of the Liberal Party who, on a number of occasions, expressed their fears as to what the bank was likely to do to the private trading banks. If full consideration, is to be given to this measure, we should go back to the beginning-to legislation introduced into the Parliament by the former Treasurer, Sir Arthur Fadden, and to .later legislation introduced by the present Treasurer ( Mr of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, Harold Holt). The purpose of this legislation was to dismember and divide the Commonwealth Bank. At that time, it will be remembered, the Commonwealth Bank had a charter. I regret to say that the charter has been departed from in recent years. For the edification of honourable members, and so that these important words will not be forgotten,. I propose to read' the charter to the House. Upon these words, the case of the Opposition rests.' We support the proposal to increase the capital of the Development Bank by £5,000,000, but we point out that there should be continuing growth in this country. This growth should not be piecemeal or haphazard; it should not be in dribs and drabs. There should be a blueprint for development and a blueprint, for the finance that will keep the development proceeding, with all available people fully occupied. The charter of the Commonwealth Bank as we knew it prior to 1959 saidIt shall be the duty of the Commonwealth Bank, within the limits of its powers, to pursue a monetary and banking policy directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia, and to exercise its powers under this Act and the Banking Act 1945 in such a manner as, in the opinion of the Bank, will best contribute to the stability of the currency of Australia; the maintenance of full employment in Australia; and the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. We would like to think that we were returning to those fundamental principles. Instead, we have haphazard additions 'of sums of £5,000,000 to the capital of the Development Bank. Instead of this hit and miss, stop and go, eccentricfinancialpolicy of the Government, our requirements should be measured, but not only for the next six months or twelve months. We should say to the Development Bank, and the other banks serving the nation that adequate funds will be available to provide for the full employment of our people and the development of our country. This Government finds itself in an extraordinary situation. Only a short time ago, it introduced the measures which resulted in what has become known as the credit squeeze. The credit squeeze became the policy of the Government and of the banks. The Development Bank also adopted this policy. Mr Warren McDonald, Chairman was concerned about what was happening and expressed his opposition to it. He made the plea that something be done to save the Development Bank and that it be given an opportunity to serve the people in the way that some of the more wishfulthinking members of the Australian Country Party probably hoped the Government intended. I believe that when the Development bank was established some members of the Country Party thought it would be the panacea for all the ills of people living in country areas. They hoped that this bank would solve their problems and country people would have no further need to worry about the money required for fencing, pasture improvement and well sinking. Of course, members of the Liberal Party had an entirely different philosophy. Mr Warren McDonald, in the course of comments published in the "" Journal of Industry"" of March, 1961, saidDevelopment Bank finance is designed to assist those whose needs are not met by the other lenders . . . That, of course, is well known to us. all. He went on to sayIf might bave been felt that a time of financial difficulty .would be the very time at which such a bank would function to the maximum. There is plenty of evidence thit the community is not aware that we suffer from the same restrictions as the other banks. That ""is the opinion of Mr Warren McDonald, the person in charge of the bank. He made that protest then, and it was not new. He had protested on other occasions at the harmful policies of the Menzies-McEwen Administration. He had pointed out that the Development Bank had been established to help people on the land and had been held out as the one institution that would overcome their great problems. He had also pointed out how necessary it was forfinanceto be made available. The ""Sun-Herald"" of 12th February, 1961, reportedFOR DEVELOPMENT BANK: CHAIRMAN. Legislation Amendment Urged as Necessary. The Reseive Bank should be given discretionary power in applying credit restrictions to the Commonwealth Development Bank, the chairman of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation ( Mr fine speech this afternoon, dealt in detail W. D. McDonald) said last night. He went on to support his contention with quite a number of other expressions. If one reads the various statements about the Development Bank, one finds that some of the difficulties are referred to by Mr If that is to persist and if this important Warren McDonald in the report of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation for 1961. He dealt with the fact that the Development Bank was subject to the credit squeeze. He saidDuring the year the Bank was required to observe qualitative and quantitative restrictions imis one matter that ought to be cleaned up posed by the Reserve Bank of Australia in its supervision of the banking system as a whole, for it must be realized that the law, as it stands, requires that the Development Bank shall be subject to controls similar to those applicable to any other bank. We live in an extraordinary land of fantasy and make-believe where the people are told, ""We have the Development Bank and all these avenues to help you overcome your problems "". But at the same time a financial institution, which should have been used to help build up our important primary and secondary industries to provide goods for sale and for the winning of new markets, was being hamstrung by legislation introduced by this Administration. "" Banking Corporation to inspire ' bold new schemes' "" was the heading of a newspaper report of another statement by Mr finance at present for either primary or Warren McDonald. He must have been very depressed when he found that this Governmenta Government, a coalition government-ha d so harmed this important financial institution. Mr Warren McDonald, who is the Chairman of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, was formerly a Country Party election candidate, so his words ought to be heeded and respected by all members of the Country Party and other members on the Government side of this House. ""The Commonwealth Development Bank has been set up to fill a special need in the economy"", said Mr Warren McDonald. How disillusioned many people have been in regard to that aim. We all know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Development Bank could play an important part in the development of Australia if it were freed of the shackles that are holding it back at the present time. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), in a very carefully thought out and exceptionally with the structure of the bank and the fact that the bank is hindered at present because it is not allowed to do what most other banks do, that is, accept deposits from its customers and those with whom it deals. bank, which should play such an important role in the economic expansion of Australia, is to be denied the right to receive deposits for the purpose of expanding and developing its activities, the Government has something for which to answer. This immediately. The Development Bank should be permitted to accept deposits. Another matter which urgently requires attention is that the Development Bank should have more direct contact with the people. The relationship that exists very largely to-day whereby the private trading banks and other banks become the agents of the Development Bank should be removed and a new outlook should appear under which the Development Bank will go into the country towns and villages and make direct personal contact with the people, know their problems, appreciate their difficulties and help to meet their requirements. If that were done, I believe that a much greater service would be rendered to the country people who need secondary industry. I ask honourable members to have regard to the fact that the Liberal-Country Party private trading banks have their own special interest in these matters. Various speakers, including Mr Warren McDonald, have expressed the view that the private trading banks were suspicious of the Development Bank. That is an important consideration. What happens when a customer in Bathurst, Orange, Dubbo, Inverell, Albury, Wagga or anywhere else goes into a private trading bank seekingfinancialhelp for the purpose of expanding or developing his property? Very often he is told, "" There are no funds available ""; and the Government is blamed immediately because of its restrictive measures. The customer is told that no funds are available because the banks have had to curtail credit. He is not given overdraft accommodation, but is sent to another part of the bank where he is offered money at hire-purchase interest rates. Every one who has given any thought to the problems of the man on the land appreciates that his fight to make things go and show a profit on his property is more difficult to-day than ever before. Yet farmers have been compelled to seek funds from the hire-purchase partners of the private trading banks, or sent along to receive money from solicitors' trust accounts. Development Bank were extended along In that case they have to pay through the nose for the money they require to develop their properties. WhatI am saying, Mr Deputy Speaker, is not hearsay; it consists of facts and information that I have received from my own constituents. One of my constituents came to me with his tale of woe. He was a good customer of a bank. He sought additional finance for the development of his property. When he asked for that money, he was told that the bank did not have the money, but it could be made available by the hire purchase branch of that bank. On another occasion he was sent to a solicitor so that he might receive money from a certain trust fund at a prohibitive rate of interest. Is that sort of thing to be tolerated in this country? Is that the way we will help the man on the land? Is that the way we will expand production. Is that the way we will win the fight for the development of our land? If that is to be the way, Sir, it is no wonder that Australia has gone backward over the last fifteen months or so, that there has not been development and that there has been a drift of people from the country areas to the great capital cities and other cities along our coastline. We need financial leadership, and 1 believe that the Development Bank could help to give the financial leadership that is required in Australia at the present time. Most people in country areas are doing all within their power to try to attract new industries. Some of them are offering land; others are offering assistance in various other ways. They all want to see their areas developed and the population increased. But the recent census revealed the unhappy state of affairs that quite a number of centres have not managed to retain the excess of births over deaths and that people are leaving the country areas and going to the great capital cities. There is need forfinancialleadership if we are to have decentralization and development in reality. The honourable member for Cowper to-day, dealt with the work that could be performed by the Development Bank and how it could serve the people in country districts by helping to establish new industries and safeguard old industries. I believe that if the know-how and experience of the those lines very substantial progress could be made. I think of the promises that have been made. When I look at the speech delivered by the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) when he introduced the 1959 banking legislation, I see that he said that the Development Bank would have adequate resources. Every member of this House must know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that adequate resources have not been made available. These words of the Treasurer seem to have a very hollow ring to-dayThe Development Bank will have the powers and resources necessary for the purpose of its important functions. He said nothing about its being subjected to the credit squeeze; he said nothing of the fact that there had been a continuing demand for funds, as is revealed in the report of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. He went on to sayI wish to stress, however, that none of its powers or resources will be capable of use except for the purpose of the functions I have described. All of those purposes and functions are quite all right, but what is required is the essential money to do the job. The former Treasurer, Sir Arthur Fadden, no doubt would have made us all very happy. In the course of his speech to the Parliament when introducing the banking legislation in",57,Commonwealth Banks Bill
114,"( Mr Mcguren), In A Very Fine Speech","1957, he said this with regard to accepting depositsThe bank will have power to accept deposits from the public, but it is not envisaged that the bank will rely on deposits as a major source of funds. The Treasurer will have power to make advances to the Development Bank. It would be a good thing if the Development Bank were permitted to function as was originally intended by the former Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia. It would be a good thing if it were permitted to accept deposits from its customers and so augment its reserves and be able to expand its activities. I have been looking over the "" Hansard"" reports of that time. I was very interested to read the wo.'ds of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) and to listen to his speech to-day. I was very interested in the way in which he clearly divided the attitude of the Australian Country Party from that of the Liberal Party. Undoubtedly, this Government is facing a very serious problem. The greatest evil in the Administration now-as it has been ever since the coalition began-is the unholy alliance that exists between the Liberal Party and the Australian Country .Party, for their ideas on some of these 'matters are diametrically opposed. Their 'views are completely divorced; they think .in different terms entirely about many things. When I read of the extraordinary views of some of the members of the Government parties, the wishful thinking of members of the Country Party hoping that this legislation would solve all their problems, and when I think of the attitude of some of the members of the Liberal Party in regard to it, I realize that that division is greatly emphasized. For instance, at page 497 of volume 22 of the ""Hansard"" report for 11th March, 1959, the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser) is reported as having saidTherefore, the scope for the. operations of the £5,200, and he has an overdraft from his -Development Bank becomes increasingly smaller as' the profits from rural enterprises generally bank of a mere £290. He owns a tractor, decrease. According to the honourable member for but he cannot get twopence from the De-Wannon, we should not be to-day voting velopment bank to get on with the work an increase of £5,000,000 to the funds of of increasing production and of building the Development Bank because, instead of a stake for himself there. Both he .requiring additional funds to develop, this and his wife have been reared on the land institution should now be requiring less money than ever before. The honourable member for Wannon went on to sayWe will serve no useful purpose if we do not recognize the limits to the functions of tbe Development Bank at present. The honourable member clearly indicated the point of view of the members of the Liberal Party on the Government side. I often think of the views expressed by the radicals of those days who were members of the Country Party. The two outstanding radicals of those times were the honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond), who is still in this Parliament, and the late Sir Earle Page. They dazzled their colleagues in the Country Party with their views about what should be done. They had the vision splendid and they wanted the requisite funds to get the job done. They suggested such works as the Nymboida Gorge scheme and new States, and they were prepared to make money available to do those jobs. Sir Earle Page, in referring to these objectives, said that the real triers should get the opportunity to reach them. I made representations on behalf of one real trier of Australia who was seeking assistance from the Development Bank. I wrote to the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt), but it did not help this man's case very much because the Treasurer does not take a personal interest in the affairs of the small people. To him, representations by way of letter represent merely a piece of paper to be referred on, and that seems to be the end of it. The man on behalf of whom I acted is a man of substance, a hard-working man, a man who has built up his assets by the sweat of his brow. He owns 650 acres of land at Mount David valued at £5,400. He paid cash for the land. He owns it; it is unencumbered. It has a building erected on it, and he wants to erect other buildings, put up a fence and improve his pasture. He owns a. home at Bathurst valued at a truck and all the natural assets of a man who has worked all his life on the land, and could have played an-important pairt in its development. What are the views of honourable members opposite about the Development Bank. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Stokes) in this place said there Would be no lack of capital for it. The honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) was afraid that the bank would interfere with the private trading banks, arid for that reason, he expressed very grave concern about the development bf this grand institution. He said that it would have unhindered access to the whole of the financial resources of the Commonwealth Bank, aggregating £734,000,000. He also made other statements. For instance, he saidI believe that the Development Bank should aim at certain objectives. The first should be to increase efficiency. ' He was not concerned about anything else. The honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr to be given all the money that is necessary Turner) also expressed very great concern about the bank and the possible dangerous effects of its operation on the Commonwealth Bank. He saidThe short-term danger is that money poured into' the Development Bank and pushed out to various borrowers'may well have an inflationary effect on the economy. Fancy making a^statement like that in this day and generation, with all of its problems! Again, he saidMr Deputy Speaker, for the reasons which I have stated, I support the general purport of the legislation, but I have grave fears that the Gommonwealth Development Bank could be twisted right away from its purpose and used to destroy an institution. I emphasize that those were the words of the honourable member for Bradfield. It is true that this legislation was passed as one of the last legislative efforts of the former Treasurer of Australia, Sir Arthur Fadden. It was a sop to the Country Party designed to slow up the Commonwealth Bank of Australia which had the powers! the resources and the right to make money available for the man on the land, for the home-builder and for the development of this country. The people of northern Australia, whether they be in Queensland, the Northern Territory or Western Australia are just as keen as we are to advance Australia fair. We want this country to go forward. It can only go forward if adequate money is made available to permit it to carry on these developmental tasks. We must harmonize our objectives in development with our financial capacity. We must work as a team for the development of this country. This country cannot afford recessions, stagnations or unemployment. We have to go forward taming our countryside and developing our country, not plundering it, which has been the order in recent times when land has been worked to the bone, where holes have been dug in the ground and when bauxite has been shipped to some other part of the world. We want to see the minerals won from our soils processed in this land. We want to see the people living in the north ot Australia accepting that area as their home. We want a wise land policy for the north of Australia. We want the people in the Northern Territory and Western Australia to achieve these objectives. Haworth) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) began his speech, as he finished it, by saying that full employment should be available to all in Australia. That, of course, is the policy of the Liberal Party; but I am afraid that I would be transgressing the rules of the House, Mr Deputy Speaker, if I were to engage in an economics debate with the honourable member. Nevertheless, I point out to him that this measure which the House is considering at present is one of a dozen measures brought down by the Government in the last few weeks with the exact intention of doing what the honourable member wants to have done, namely, to inject more finance into the economy, to increase employment opportunities, and generally to restore confidence in the country. This amount of £5,000,000, added to the amount of £5,000,000 given to the Development Bank last October, means that in the last six months an additional £10,000,000 will have been made available to the bank for lending. The bank opened its doors on 14th January, 1960, and within",60,Credit Restrictions Should Be Eased
115,Mr Deputy Speaker (Hon. W. C.,,62,Credit Restrictions Should Be Eased
116,Mr Fairbairn (Farrer) [5.15],"The.just over two years it has a capital of £25,000,000. reserves and it may borrow sums, and has borrowed them, from the Commonwealth Savings Bank. The annual report for the year ended 30th June, 1961, showed that the bank had assets amounting to more than £45,000,000. Yet, honourable -members opposite refer to it as a puny bank which is not allowed to expand. They say, "" You started this off and you are squeezing it out. You are making quite certain it will never get any further."" Yet, in a period of two years the bank has built up its assets to more than £45,000,000. The Development Bank is filling a gap that needed to be filled. If there is any reason why it has not expanded more than it has done it is because the Government was prevented from establishing such a bank at the time that it first tried to do so. All honourable members who were here at that time know perfectly well that in 1957 this Government introduced a measure, one of the purposes of which was to establish a Development Bank. What did we get from the Opposition on that occasion? We had every possible form of delaying tactics, both in this House and in another place. The honourable member for Macquarie said that he had been referring to copies of "" Hansard"" of previous years. I am only sorry that he did not peruse "" Hansard"" a little more closely. He should have told, the House that he voted on twenty separate occasions on one night against the establishbanks or the like. ment of the Commonwealth Development Bank. As a result of those Opposition tactics, of course, it was necessary for the Government to declare the measure an urgent one. The twenty divisions that were taken occupied about two and a half hours of the time of the Parliament. That time was wasted because of the delaying tactics of honourable members opposite. At that time the Labour Party had a majority in the Senate and as a result, it was not possible to establish this very essential part of the banking system until we had a majority in both Houses of the Parliament. Honourable members opposite say that we are not giving the Development Bank adequate opportunities to expand. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) said that the bank was emaciated and would It also has substantial not grow. Let us look at the way in which it has in fact grown. The honourable member for Macquarie brought forward the case of a "" real trier ""-that was his assessment. He said that he wrote to the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) to try to get a loan for this man. Surely the honourable member knows better than to expect the Treasurer to override a statutory body which functions in accordance with rules and regulations. Of course, the Treasurer may say, if he cares to do so, that he will have another look at a case, but he is not going to supervise every case and over-ride decisions made by the Development Bank. No doubt loans have been refused in many cases but there are numerous, reasons for such refusals. The first reason probably is that the purpose for which a loan is sought does not come within the scope of the charter of the bank. Every one knows that the bank's charter states that the purpose is to cover a field which is not covered by the trading banks, and which is concerned with development alone. That is a reason why many applications for loans from the Development Bank are refused. The purpose of the bank is to encourage development of propertiesparticularly those which will help to increase the volume of exports from this countryin circumstances in which suitable loans are not available from the existing financial houses, whether they be pastoral houses, banks should send an officer along to inspect? that I want answered is: Were the trading banks approached? I am not speaking of the particular case referred to by the honourable member for Macquarie. In many cases it has been found that people have applied for loans which come within the scope of the trading banks, and that the trading banks were not approached. The people concerned went straight to the Development Bank to ask for something which was within the scope of other lending organizations. Often it is found that applications are for carry-on funds and not for loans to",62,Credit Restrictions Should Be Eased
117,Mr Luchetti,D o you not think the,63,Credit Restrictions Should Be Eased
118,Mr Fairbairn,"The first questioncover particular aspects of development. It may be that a person wants to put a little more superphosphate on his place, or that he wants to do something that would normally be covered by the day-today running expenses. Of course, the Development Bank was not established to meet such purposes. Then there is the question of whether the enterprise for which a loan is sought has a prospect of success. Can a politician judge whether that is so? Is he as well equipped to judge the prospect of success as is a bank manager who has known the person concerned for a considerable time? The applicant for a loan may not be a suitable risk. In other cases it is found that people and so on. The man on the land has who are very plausible turn out to be much better at talking than at running an industhe extent of seme £22,000,000. So, try or a business when their background, their history and their ability are looked into. at working. reasons which could be advanced. No one knows the reason for the refusal of a loan in a particular case. if you do not know. of the case raised by the honourable member, because I think that one should not discuss individual cases in a national parliament. An individual case obviously is something between the person concerned and the bank. It should not be bandied about in the Federal Parliament. How are we to know what the issues were? Another relevant question is whether the product can be sold and whether the loan, if granted, will result in an increase quote scripture. The Chairman of the of production. Failure to satisfy those conditions may be another reason for the refusal of loans. Honourable members opposite have said that we are not extending the activities of the Development Bank, but let us look at the approvals that have been granted. It is easy to pick up one case in which there was a refusal to grant a loan. Instead, we should look at all the cases in which the applicants succeeded in obtaining loans. We must remember that this bank has been operating for only two F.1715/62 -R -[26 ] years. It has had a tremendous task in obtaining suitable officers who know how to value land, how industries are run, and so on. Yet we find that the bank has rendered considerable service, both by way of loans and assistance in the purchase of tractors, machinery and hire purchase generally. The bank has made loans worth some £22,000,000, covering, on the rural side, pasture improvement, clearing, fencing, water conservation, the erection of farm buildings, the acquisition of plant and equipment, the purchase of live-stock, the provision of working capital and sundries, been assisted, in this very short period, to instead of knocking this bank, and instead of honourable members opposite saying that it is a little bank, that it is emaciated and cannot grow, let them for once give a word of thanks and pay a tribute to the people who have established the bank and who have shown, in such a very short time, that they have erected something which has a place in the country and is doing a first-rate job to bridge a gap. First, we should congratulate the former Treasurer, Sir Arthur Fadden, who introduced this measure originally but, owing to the efforts of the Opposition, was unable to have it placed on the statute-book. We should also congratulate the present Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt), who introduced an almost identical measure and has succeeded in getting it into operation. I think it has operated with a degree of success beyond the wildest dreams of many people. We should congratulate also the chairman of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, Mr Warren McDonald, who is a first-class man. I am sorry that he was quoted by the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) but, as they sav, the devil can Commonwealth Banking Corporation ^as had a magnificent career. He is a distinguished engineer and has done a lot of excellent work in that capacity. He is a businessman. While in the Army he rose to the rank of brigadier and he was a distinguished administrator.

He even tried to put his views into practice on one occasion, but I am sorry to say he was",63,Credit Restrictions Should Be Eased

122,Mr Fairbairn,"I am not speakingunsuccessful. I refer to the time when ne tried to enter this Parliament as the representative of the electorate of Hume. Tlie person who defeated him is now sitting in the House. That is about the one failure that Mr Warren McDonald has had. From the country's point of view it is probably fortunate that he did fail on that occasion. I must say that it would deflate one's ego a bit to be defeated by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller). I say that Sir Arthur and the present Treasurer should be congratulated and I mention particularly the chairman of this bank for trie excellent job he has done in setting up the institution. There is one section of the instructions any other method I know of. We must to the Development Bank which has not realize that it is essential that we try been mentioned here and which I think is to step up the quality of farming. most important and should have greater stress laid upon it.

This goes, of course, not only That advice and assistance are badly needed every shape and form. I would not say in both industry and primary production that they are inefficient; some are more to-day. Recently, when Mr Warren McDonald was addressing the Agricultural efficient than others. A recent survey made, Bureau of New South Wales at Hawkesbury I think, in the electorate of Indi by some Agricultural College, he stressed this side Melbourne university students showed the of the bank's charter. I shall read part of necessity for this type of advice from banks his speech because I think it is something or from any system from which it is availwhich we should consider and bear in mind. able.

As a matter of fact, tbe meeting takes place in the Holbrook Shire Hall at 8 o'clock to-night. I mention the meeting in case some of my constituents happen to be listening. I think this form of farm management club is something which could and should be encouraged in every way by the Government and by the Development Bank, because 1 see a greater potential for it improving the efficiency of farming than We cannot go around thinking that everyto the best of his ability, because surveys have shown that some and probably the for the farmers but also for industry in carried out a survey and visited some 147 properties to get an idea of how effective By using to the acre in some districts, and you see It was not only in respect of pasture improvement that it was discovered that there was so much to be done.

Twenty per cent, of the farmers made no provision at all for the supplementary feeding of stock, and on 25 per cent, of farms the standard of household water supply was so low that usage was limited to ten gallons or less per person a day. The students, in this and other ways, show the incredible backwardness of the farms in Australia in a modern age. One could understand this, perhaps, if it was in the outback of the Northern Territory. But I think it shows enough to stress my point that there is still a tremendous area that needs improved efficiency and better management on both the farming and the industrial sides. I am glad that this charter has been given to the bank, and I do not doubt that it will assist in this way. I recommend the bill to the House and congratulate the Government on making available yet another £5,000,000 for the Development Bank. bairn) at last enlightened me upon the reason for the existence of the Country Party. He has pointed out the incredible backwardness of some of the members of the farming community and that accounts for some of the representatives they send here and for the political philosophies they espouse. I would like to take up the honourable member for Farrer on several points which he made in his speech. First of all, he questioned the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) who had challenged the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) to do something in a particular case. The honourable member for Farrer considers this Parliament is not the place in which to air the disabilities of the private individual or the single individual. That remark is odd, falling as it does from the mouth of a man who has so long and so willingly supported a very distinguished Australian-and his rights and privileges-in the person of Mr Government. I should like to discuss the Reg. Ansett. All public legislation should reflect the attitude that a man is worthy of proper consideration irrespective of his estate. Of even greater importance is the fundamental duty of the Treasurer in administering any act of Parliament for which he is responsible. The charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank is set out in sections 72 and 73 of the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959. Section 73 providesIn determining whether or not finance shall be provided for a person, the Development Bank shall have regard primarily to the prospects of the operations of that person becoming, or continuing to be, successful and shall not necessarily have regard to the value of the security available in respect of that finance. If the Treasurer, who is the custodian of this legislation, will not apply himself to the detail involved in the administration of it, what is the use of the parliamentary system? The Treasurer cannot abdicate his duty to ensure the implementation of legislation governing the administration of statutory corporations, just because of some "" hifalutin "" philosophy of non-interference. This approach was demonstrated just recently by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). He was asked by my friend, the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Mclvor), whether he would give some attention to the obtaining of financial assistance for some of the municipalities in Melbourne. In reply, the Prime Minister said that he could not force the banksno doubt he could not even ask them-to give a loan or to lower their interest rates. In the field of restriction the Government and its supporters have no hesitation about applying their power. In the field of expansion they are unduly hesitant. The honourable member for Farrer attempted to mislead any people who may be listening to the debate, and to have a misleading impression conveyed by the record, in giving his interpretation of the parliamentary procedures that were followed in 1957 when the Government attempted to force through a fundamental alteration to the structure of the Commonwealth Bank for the benefit of the private banks. In that regard the honourable member's statements are refuted. Let me refer briefly to the bill now before us and its relevance to the aims of the likelihood of the measure fulfilling those aims, and whether it is in line with the Government's duty to see that the Commonwealth Development Bank becomes a major banking institution. This has been a great debate for platitudes. We are all very keen about development. I do not know exactly",64,Credit Restrictions Should Be Eased
123,Mr Bryant (Wills) [5.33],The,66,Credit Restrictions Should Be Eased
124,Honourable Member For Farrer ( Mr Fair,"what honourable members opposite mean by the term ""development"". It would seem that it is something wbich must be carried out but which cannot be carried out with sufficient profit to private investors and therefore is a public duty. Therein lies the fundamental difference between the philosophies of honourable members of this side of the House and those on the Government side. The Treasurer saidThis measure therefore represents a further step for the promotion in a tangible way of the objectives of national growth and development, to ment confines itself to a very frugal sum which the Government is firmly committed . . . What is involved in the measure? The capital of the bank is to be increased by £5,000,000. That is a very small part of the sum total of Australia's national wealth, or even of the funds held by the banking system itself. The latest statistics available indicate that altogether approximately £2,000,000,000 is involved in the banking system and that approximately £400,000,000 is involved in hire-purchase agreements. Yet the Government thinks that, when it invests a further £5,000,000 in this Commonwealth instrumentality, it is introducing dynamism into the drive for development, a return of prosperity, and a regaining of employment. When we say that, we are not knocking the bank; we are knocking only these people opposite who cannot see that they have a duty to use the resources of this nation in a more visionary and expansionist manner. Despite the fine phrases that were used in describing the functions of the Commonwealth Development Bank when it was established a couple of years ago, the fact is that, when it is compared with the whole Australian financial structure, it represents another fading vision. The same is true of so many other proposals that this Government has implemented or other instrumentalities which it bas set up within the last few years. We on this side of the House appeal for a new approach to the activities of the Commonwealth Development Bank and to banking generally. There is no doubt that this bank could be a great instrument for the development of the nation and for meeting the needs of the individual citizen. Unfortunately, honourable members opposite fail to adopt that attitude in their approach to the activities of the banking system or to government generally. To assess the value of this sum of £5,000,000 by which it is proposed to increase the capital of the Development Bank, we must relate it to the general financial structure. I find it handy these days, Mr Speaker, to refer to Boeing aircraft, whicb we buy in fairly substantial numbers and each of which costs £2,500,000. The Viscount and Electra aircraft which bring us to Canberra each week cost £1,000,000 and £1,250,000 respectively. In this country we are used to dealing in multimillions of pounds; but when we come to an issue such as the present one the Governindeed. We of the Opposition approach this matter not in an attempt to knock the Development Bank or to stifle it, but in the hope that we may be able to press the Government into adopting a more visionary approach. The honourable member for Farrer said that the bank was expanding beyond the wildest dreams of, presumably, an unlimited number of people. The 1961 report of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation states, at page 31, that the Development Bank had made 2,060 loans. Of that number, 508 were for amounts between £1 and £2,000; only two were for amounts over £100,000; and 429 were for amounts between £5,001 and £10,000. Only 2,060 loans had been made up to 1961, yet the honourable member for Farrer said that the bank was expanding beyond people's wi.'dest dreams. It would not be difficult to nnd dozens and dozens of ordinary banks in the cities of Australia with more than 2,000 accounts on their books. The Government has not displayed a visionary, expansionist or flexible approach to the activities of the Development Bank. To use a colloquialism, the proposed increase of capital is only chicken feed. The proposed increase will not meet the bank's own requirements. At page 30 of the 1961 report of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, in a reference to the Development Bank, this passage appearsFull use of the Bank's present resources is being made, and it is already clear that in the national interest the present resources will be required to be augmented substantially. That is the view not only of people on this side of the House and of the casual observer, but also of the officers and board of the bank, for whom our friends opposite have such a high regard and to whose views, therefore, we must pay some attention. So, judged on the report of the board, which was handed to the Treasurer and submitted to the Parliament under the terms of the relevant legislation, this measure fails to meet the requirements of the bank. At the present stage of Australia's development, we cannot regard £5,000,000 as being a substantial augmentation of the bank's funds. As I pointed out earlier, it is a comparatively small sum when considered alongside what the Government hopes to achieve by this measure. We have become accustomed to the Treasurer and his colleagues, to the accompaniment of optimistic phrases, introducing measures which we know full well cannot possibly achieve the results that it is so desirable to achieve for the national well-being. The Development Bank has to be expanded substantially. Its charter has to be widened. Opposition members are convinced that it has to apply itself more Government to do something rather specvigorously to the charter which it has been tacular. Banking, I believe, has failed to given and expand into the community take up the slack in the community. This generally. So, Mr Speaker, we say that is a changing world. I believe that the the measure does not meet our requirephilosophy of the Liberal Party, based on ments. The bank itself is failing to be a materialistic concept of evaluating a developed in the way in which we thought person's place in the community by his it would be developed. Everybody was preassets, is failing to meet the needs of the pared to have high hopes for it a couple community. We have only to examine the of years ago. We have looked in vain to difference between the approach to hire members of the Australian Country Party purchase and the approach to banking to support us. Operating as they do as finance to see this. A citizen goes into a another satellite of the Liberal Party of bank and applies for finance and he is Australia, the country person can look in asked for security. It is obvious that that vain for assistance from the Country Party occurs in the Development Bank also. In in developing resources. I should like to examine for a moment citizen. That is what the hire-purchase section 73 of the Commonwealth Banks system does. A person can go into a car Act to which reference has been made. show-room with a deposit of £400 or £500 This gives to the bank its charter to provide and drive out a £2,000 motor car simply finance to persons for the purposes of priby signing on the dotted line. He is taken mary production or the establishment or at his face value.

But the the operations of that person becoming, or continuing to be, successful and shall not necessarily banking system is not doing that. I believe have regard to the value of the security available that this is where it is lagging. in respect of that finance. I do not represent an electorate in which many people go to the Development Bank for support. But I happen to come across instances as does every honourable member, I presume. Honourable members on this side of the House are convinced that the principle stated in this section is not being applied any more than the spirit of section 47 of the Repatriation Act is being applied. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) and the honourable member for Macquarie raised this point this afternoon. We feel pretty certain that the Development Bank is applying ordinary banking principles to applicants for loans. Of course, the Development Bank was established to apply a different principlea new principle-and bring a new concept into the field of banking. This is a field which could have offered the greatest possible opportunity to the this age, the banking system should be able to invest in the integrity of the ordinary hire-purchase companies. They are invesThis is a held into which the Development Bank could venture in a more spectacular way. I hope honourable members opposite, encouraged by members of the Country Party, will do something of this nature. Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) pointed out this afternoon that this bank could move into the field of unorthodox banking where ordinary banks will not venture. It could be an equivalent of the Export Payments Insurance Corporation, lt could be an extension of the attitude exemplified by the National Shipping Line and of that which has occurred in the airline industry in which the Government uses the resources of the community, not necessarily or specifically for the community's benefit, but to protect private enterprise. It uses the community's whole resources as a subsidy for private owners of the means of production. This is one of the great dangers that we face in the oil industry. That indusindustry in Australia. There is no private try, was handed over to private exploiters. So we find that subsidies have been given for oil search but the Government will not own a pint of the oil which has been discovered. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) expressed an attitude which I am afraid is fundamental to the philosophy of the Liberal Party. He said that when the private enterprise magnate does not feel there is any dividend to be gained in a certain field it should be left to a Government instrumentality and public enterprise. When the field has been ploughed and the crop planted, along will come others to reap the benefit. We believe that this is something to which the citizens of Australia should give close attention. There are some fields to which I think the Commonwealth Development Bank ought to turn its attention. I cannot understand why development should always mean something far beyond the horizon. It seems that it must always be rural the principles which have been written into development. It must be as far away from its charter are sound. We have to invest where people live as possible. National in the integrity of the every-day citizen development should include everything in which is apparent every day of the week. the community.

You walk in somewhere and you development as to put a beef road through can buy something on terms. This exemplithe back-blocks of Queensland or the fies the reliance placed on the face value of Northern Territory. There is a field for the ordinary citizen. The banking system the Development Bank. I believe that it should be a great support for municipalities. Local government in Australia is struggling under a tremendous burden with insufficient funds. It has to pay high interest rates. The honourable member for Of course, this is a high interest government. Local government and community development could well be fields in which the Development Bank could expand. It might also expand in other fields such as housing. If we must remove certain sectors of the economy from the ordinary banking procedures so that the bankers themselves apply different sets of values there is ample scope for us to do so in an imaginative way. There is one field in which the Development Bank could have more flexibilitythe Commonwealth's own activities. It has been mentioned on the other side of the chamber that there should be another steel firm in Australia which could embark on the establishment of a new steel industry. It is doubtful whether any State government has the resources to do so. But the Commonwealth Bank and the Development Bank could well support a State government which desired to embark on this kind of industrial venture. I believe the time has come to apply a new principle in banking. First of all, we have to depart from the materialistic concept that a man is only as good as the security he owns. This concept has turned the Commonwealth Bank into another rich man's bank. If you go into a bank in a country town, as I have done, and inquire on behalf of some people how much money they would need to buy an £11,000 or £12,000 property in the district, you are told that they would need £8,000. That might be a small sum to honourable members opposite but it is a large sum to the average Australian. I believe that the Development Bank and will fall behind in the role that it has to play in the comniunity unless it, too, accepts Speaker, I support this bill, and I congratuthese values.

127,Mr Barnes,"Our credit squeeze hasour economic policy was to divert funds from non-essential industries into our basic industries, and the results of recent Commonwealth loan raisings are a complete vindication of our efforts to continue the expansion and development of Australia. One honourable member suggested that funds should be provided for local authorities. There was even a suggestion that funds be provided to start a steel industry. There is an indication, again, of socialization. I would agree with honourable members opposite that it is absolutely necessary to have another steel industry in Australia in order to make use of our undoubted mineral resources, because I agree with the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) that therein lies the greatest opportunity to build up our trading balances not only by earning more abroad but also by saving on our import costs, in the way that we will save when the new oil industry is established in Australia. The discovery of oil in Australia, I may say, is due to the imaginative policy pursued by the Government, which also gives the industry great prospects of success. Most members on this side of the House realize that the Opposition has never changed its policy of outright nationalization. Members of the Opposition do not like the term "" nationalization "" and have endeavoured to shed it and escape from it. I think it was in 1948 that we had a lot of talk in this Parliament about the so-called Blackburn amendment. That amendment was just a variation of the Labour Party's all-out policy of nationalization. ment was moved at a Labour Party conference in the early 1930's, but it was buried by the Labour Party and was disinterred only when it was realized that the people of Australia were not very pleased with the policy of outright nationalization. banking. -Order! ing, because I am dealing with some of the ideas put forward in this debate by honourable members opposite. To-day, instead of the Blackburn amendment we have the Labour Party talking about "" democratic socialism "". The Labour Party is trying all the time to escape from admitting that its policy is outright nationalization, but its real objective has been disclosed during this debate. That objective is the nationalization of banking by back-door methods. The Labour Party has misled the people. It has even misled the executives of the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" because that newspaper has accepted the term "" democratic socialism"" at its face value. The efforts of the Labour Party to escape from the term "" nationalization"" remind me of the old aboriginal who was presented wilh the latest model of boomerang by the tribe, and made himself a nervous wreck trying to get rid of it. I believe that that is the position of honourable members opposite. The Development Bank fills a gap which just has to be filled, especially in our country areas. We have many people of ability on the land, very often people who started out in quite recent years without the necessary funds to develop their farms. Forty or 50 years ago a man could start a farm or take up a selection and, so long as he had a tent, an axe, a plough and a shovel, and was prepared to spend a bit of sweat, could make a success of it. To-day extensive capital is needed to provide greater efficiency on the land and enable us to compete in the markets of the world with our primary products. We depend very desperately on the land to provide the increased funds necessary to bring about that efficiency. Unfortunately the position of people on the land has deteriorated greatly, not only as a result of rises in costs but also from the considerable shrinkage in the prices that we obtain overseas for our primary exports. We have nearly doubled our production of primary goods. Since 1938-39 I suppose we have increased the production of wool by about 75 per cent., and we have nearly doubled the production of sugar from the same area of land as was previously used. Only by these means have we been able to keep people on the land. As the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) pointed out, the man on the land looks to his income as a source of development funds. It is part of the psychology of the man on the land to develop",70,Credit Restrictions Should Be Eased

A very considerable portion of our income goes back into the land to increase our efficiency and to protect ourselves against the vagaries of Australia's banks. They are part of the great economic very uncertain climatic conditions. Mr J. R. Fraser -It helps you to keep a race-horse or two, does it not? do that. At all events, we look to our income for developmental purposes, because the man on the land does not like to borrow up to his limits. That is an old policy of farmers. They realize that they do not have complete control over their incomes. They must accept the price that people overseas are prepared to pay for their goods. The farmer does not know what future seasons will be like, particularly in Queensland west of the Great Dividing Range. We might have several years of drought, which would very nearly wipe out the farmer. If he has many debts he would go under. That has been the history of many people in Queensland. I think it applies also to other parts of Australia. A farmer's calculations may be upset by conditions that change as quickly as a bolt comes from the blue. I remember that in northern Queensland some years ago there was a strike of the meat workers and the entire fat cattle turnoff of northern Queensland for the year remained on the properties. It must be remembered that in northern Queensland we have only one season and, if we miss the opportunity to market, we must hold the cattle for another year. That would mean a loss not only to the pastoralists but to the community of northern Queensland in particular and the community of Australia in general. Those are some of the uncertainties that confront the man on the land. The honourable member for Barker quite very limited.

I know that people in my electorate feel that In New South Wales the average holding the Development Bank is designed to profor wheat and sheep is 21,000 acres. The vide finance to people who have sufficient capital employed is £45,000, on which the collateral to obtain finance from the existing return is 3.5 per cent. In Victoria the trading banks. That is not the purpose of the Development Bank. We do not want to displace the private structure not only of Australia but of the British Empire. No other banking system can boast a reputation as high as that of the English banking system. During the war years the banks were under very strict control and since the war tbey have had a very hard row to hoe. They have been controlled in many ways. Interest rates have been controlled. Unfortunately, the Government has no control over the fringe banking system. Prior to the introduction of the Government's economic policy the financial institutions outside the traditional banks were lending money at 10 per cent, on call. Such finance is readily usable in city areas, where it is easily repaid, but in rural areas it is useless because owing to conditions beyond his control-fallin g export markets and rising internal costs-the farmer is in a serious plight. The 40-hour week, for instance, was a grave set-back to the primary industries. Do not let it be thought that I am advocating a reduction of hours. In my remarks a few weeks ago I did not advocate a reduction in working hours. I have asked honourable members opposite what is their attitude to a 35-hour week, which we Would have had if Labour had been able to form a government.

Many of these people had high hopes that the Development Bank would be an inspirational institution that would give the kind of security that those engaged in primary industry, above all, have missed so much. Most of us in other walks of life have tried .to surround ourselves with a measure of -.security, and we have been able to do so 'j.much more than have the primary producers.

When another institution has indicated that it will make accommodation available under very stringent and costly terms, the borrower has been obliged to go to that institution. The fact is that in the year 1960-61, the Development Bank provided in all The other point I want to make while from overseas, including consumer goods, and labour to more essential needs. It was said that some luxury or less essential industries were making great demands on men and materials. The thesis was that we had to have a credit squeeze so that, on the one hand, we could dampen the demand for consumer goods and, on the other hand, we could divert men, capital and materials into more essential industries. What happened? The credit squeeze of £5,000,000 and the measure now before certainly dampened demand for consumer us proposes a further increase of goods. It hit both essential and non-essential £5,000,000.

No doubt see him."" We ran into these complaints everywhere. Of course, one does not have to go to the Northern Territory to hear them. They can be heard virtually on any farm in this local community. Everywhere it is the same-the farmers are being forced into the hands of the usurers for loans, though usually it is only short-term accommodation that they need. This so called Development Bank is stunted and inhibited in what should be its function and purpose. This is not the dream that many young enterprising Australians had when they heard of the creation of a development bank which allegedly would give particular help to the man on the land and 'also its instrumentalities. The bank officials to the man in small-scale industry. That dream has not materialized, and I do not think it would be appropriate for this Parliament, in any mood of self-satisfaction, to pass this bill without realizing that as part of the process of growing, this Development Bank will have to be capitalized to a far greater extent than it is to-day if it is applicants for blocks would be required to to be the institution we would like it to be. carry out certain improvements including The bank's report indicates a total of 2,060 approved applicants for loans in a twelve-month period-no t a great many really when it is spread over primary and secondary industry. naturally, one hardly expects to receive in such a report advice on how many applicants were not satisfied-'ho w many were knocked back. But I can retail stories from my own experiences. The honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond) who has no political axe to grind, frankly told the House this afternoon that he had many unsatisfied clients of the Development Bank among his constituents. If every honourable member were frank enough he would acknowledge the same sort of thing. It is true that in many instances, applicants funds will allow, but the land is not being are not entitled to loans as they could get accommodation elsewhere. But many are not in that position and I have in mind at the moment particular cases, one of which I have told honourable members about before. I will tell the story again because it has progressed further. A young chap who lived in southern New South Wales and whom I know very well went into a ballot conducted by the Queensland State Government for a block in a subdivision in central Queensland, up around Urunga. Only four blocks were available for the 500-odd applicants. This is what I was referring to before when I. spoke about all the youngsters who would like to get on the land. The list of applicants was whittled down to something like 325, because some of them were not regarded as suitable persons for the ballot; they lacked the necessary experience of farming and generally did not conform to the standards required by the State department in control of the ballot. Finally, 300-odd went to the ballot and this close friend of mine was one of the lucky ones. But he could not get a penny from the Development Bank, after having passed the scrutiny of the.State Government and of raised all the conventional problems that a bank does raise: What would happen if there werefloodsor bush fires? Here was a nationally desirable projectthe subdivision of a big area of land that was being virtually wasted. Successful fencing, water conservation, the building of sheds, the provision of dipping troughs and other things of that sort. All these things had been stipulated and these young fellows who won the ballot were willing and indeed I suppose that desperately anxious to get on the land. But my friend could not get one penny from the Development Bank! In the long run, he got some money from the Queensland Agricultural Bank. He has gone on with the job, but he was not put on the property by the Development Bank. He has been there for two years now and he is going along quite O.K., though not as well as he could. He has had to provide agistment-othe r people have been renting parts of the property. He is progressing; he is buying as much cattle for breeding purposes as his utilized to its full capacity, to the disgrace of Australia and to his own frustration. This young fellow will get by. He will meet his commitments all right. But he received no encouragement from the Development Bank. That sort of story is, unfortunately, too familiar. I am hoping that what is said in this Parliament will seep through to the Development Bank. It is all right for bank officials to say that politicians cannot make judgments about what is a good project for a bank to finance, but tbere must be some checks, for nobody supposes that the bank officials are the final authority in these matters. T dare say that they will appreciate comments coming back to them and that, perhaps, there will be an easing of the policy and a bolder and a more imaginative approach. What is more, if the bank did' this it would have the support of the Australian people and the Australian Parliament. Just as our speeches here had, I am sure, some effect in getting additional capital of -' £5,000,000 on two occasions recently, I am | hoping that our remarks here to-day will ' lead to the Development Bank taking a less cautious approach in these matters. It is merely begging the question for Government supporters to say that there is no shortage of funds; that there is money in the bank and no excessive demand for money. Of course there will be money left in the bank if you disqualify a lot of the applicants. That is one certain way of ensuring that all the funds will not have been expended at the end of the year. I hope that there will be a bolder and more imaginative approach by the Development Bank to its task and that such an approach will have the sanction of this Government. I strongly suspect that at least the Leader of the Australian Country Party, with whom I have had some interesting and informative conversations about this matter, would be much our way In supporting such an approach. I believe-and I do not say this as political banter-that the Development Bank has been held back principally by the Liberal Party and the ^interests that it represents. This is someg, thing that is inhibiting Australia's development. My final point is that the whole concept of a Development Bank ought to have been related to the broader concept of Australian development; it should have been an integral part of an overall plan for national development. How marvellous it would be if, instead of scraping along with successive credit squeezes and* ad hoc decisions, merely edging our way along the road towards development, we were to set up national targets for Australia's development and back them with a strong Development Bank. [8.50] Mr Speaker, the purpose of the bill before the House is to increase by £5,000,000 the capital of the Commonwealth Development Bank. This is really a second instalment, making a total increase of £10,000,000 during the current financial year. So that we may get our facts quite straight, let me say also that this brings the immediate resources of the Development Bank to close on £26,000,000. Of course, the bank has many other resources at its disposal. It has power, for instance, to borrow from the Commonwealth Savings Bank. When all these financial resources are taken into account, it will be readily realized that the Development Bank must exercise a very substantial influence on the kind of lending for which it was designed. I agree with the honourable member for Barton( Mr Reynolds) that the conditions applying to other financial institutions, in regard to the previous twelve months' transactions, have applied equally to the Development Bank. In other words, the bank's policy has been of a slightly restrictive nature, perhaps, compared with what their normal lending activities would be. First of all, we must fix clearly in our minds the object of this bank. The establishment of the bank constituted a novel departure. As we know, it took over the activities of'the Mortgage Bank Department and the Industrial Finance Department of the Commonwealth Bank at the time of the re-alignment of the Commonwealth banking institution. In the first annual report issued by the bank, which is now before honourable members, while the bank accepts the possibility, and even foreshadows the probability, that it will require more resources, it appears that so far the funds at the bank's disposal have been sufficient. At the same time, if the bank is to develop as we hope it will, and play an increasingly important part in the progress of our rural and smaller secondary industries, then it is obvious that it must require additionalfinancialassistance in the future. It is interesting to consider the attitude of the Opposition to the reconstruction of the Commonwealth banking institution which took place in 1959. The Opposition completely rejected the legislation when it was introduced in 1959. On page 811 of",75,Credit Restrictions Should Be Eased
141,Mr Mackinnon (Corangamite),"""Hansard"" of 19th March, 1959, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) is reported as having saidThe title of the bill ought not to be "" The ComLabour Party. He said that during its monwealth Banks BiU"" but ""A Bill to strangle the Commonwealth Bank"" -and I remind the House that we have How wrong he was? Since that legislation was enacted, not only the Development Bank but also the various other sections of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation have gone from strength to strength. On page 812 of the same volume of "" Hansard"" we find that the Leader of the Opposition said:This is not good legislation. These bills are not brought forward to reform the banking legislation but to deform and mutilate the Commonwealth Bank. How wrong he was again! I think he must have known, when he made that remark, that with normal developmental progress in banking in Australia such things do not happen in the way that he foreshadowed. In fact the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, in all its activities, including its Reserve Bank function, has achieved signal success. I ask honourable members to cast their minds back to the slightly more imaginative approach to financial matters of the late King O'Malley, who is credited with being the Labour progenitor of the Commonwealth Bank. He had a much wider conception of these matters than any of the honourable gentlemen opposite have to-day. He was a man who was essentially an Australian, and who was not loaded down with socialistic banking theories. When he advised his government to establish the Commonwealth Bank, he visualized it, not as an institution designed to capture financial control of the economy, but as an organization which would be of value in the development of Australia. King O'Malley would be turning in his grave if he could hear the speeches of some honourable members opposite. As I said, the bank took over the activities previously carried on by the Mortgage Bank Department and the Industrial Finance Department of the Commonwealth Bank. It was specially designed for small undertakings, as a source of finance supplementary to those existing in the ordinary financial structure of the country. I would like to refer to several remarks made by the honourable member for farkes ( Mr Haylen), who sits on the front bench occupied by members of the Australian period of operation the Development Bank before us the first report of the bank covering a full year's operations-ha d been strangled because it had not been provided with enough funds. I suggest that the people of Australia, who are interested not only in the activities of the bank in promoting the future development of Australia, but who are also vitally interested, from the pocket angle, in the successful conduct of the bank's financial operations, would support the contention that a novel institution like this one should hasten slowly, and establish its pattern of lending so that its resources will be distributed in the most effective way. The honourable member for Parkes, in my opinion, did not make any valuable contribution to the debate when he voiced those remarks. I would like to make another point in connection with the criticism that has been offered by honourable members opposite. First of all, let me say that it is rather embarrassing for me to try at this stage to make some sort of a reply to the honourable member for Barton, because, in my opinion, the honourable member had absolutely no conception of the purpose of this institution. He made a very emotional speech, I agree, but he was completely irrational when he talked about inspiration, for instance. I do not think we should dwell too much on inspiration when talking about banking. Banking is not a matter to be played around with by emotional Labour politicians. Matters such as those affecting the Development Bank must be considered from the point of view of benefit to be derived not only by those borrowing the money but also by everybody else in Australia. Therefore, I believe, we can disregard the comments of the honourable member for Barton. He appeared to regard this institution, which, as its charter clearly shows, is designed to assist small undertakings, as one which should make loans for public works purposes, and play a role in providing finance for national developmental schemes. That is, perhaps, a pleasant anticipation. Possibly in the distant future the bank's functions will be widened to cover such activities. At the moment, however, we have other well-established institutions, such as the trading banks and the Reserve Bank itself, which have funds that can be made available in very large amounts for the kind of project that the honourable member evidently visualized. Let us, then, dismiss that kind of completely irrelevant comment from our consideration of this legislation. I think it would be well for us to redundant secondary industry which will refresh our minds about the lending policy operate on a marginal cost basis. Nor do of this bank. I shall refer to a directive we want to encourage people to take up that has been made available to most honorrural lands in a marginal cost area, proable members in this chamber, concerning ducing commodities that are already the bank's lending policy. I know, and I dependent upon an uncertain export market, think all honourable members know, that as we know is the case with certain of our there have been some disappointments export industries at the present time. I among persons who have approached the think that precautions in this respect are bank. It is obvious that when an institution wise. I have had referred to me cases of such as this opens its doors for the first young men who wanted loans to assist them time many people will gather at those doors in marginal enterprises in an export industry who have had their applications for finance which was having a struggle at the time. rejected by other institutions. They say to themselves: "" Here is the rich uncle from policy states that the need to ensure that Borneo. Let's see how we get on with the bank's funds are available for develophim."" inevitable-that many people who have had special circumstances the bank will not be an incomplete knowledge and understanding able to approve applications which do not of the bank's lending policy have been have any developmental features and which disappointed. Clause6 of this directive saysIt will be necessary for prospective borrowers have been concerned with cases in whicb to establish to the satisfaction of the Developprospective borrowers have been disapment Bank that the finance sought is not otherwise available on reasonable and suitable terms pointed about the interpretation of this and conditions. I suggest to my honourable friend from somebody else of a debt on land that had Barton that possibly the young man he not any particular developmental prospect is mentioned, who had the selection in Queensoutside the meaning of the interpretation of land, came within that category. It the bank's activities. appeared from what the honourable member said that this man had not tried to raise finance through normal channels and finally was accepted by the Queensland finance will usually be made available by rural bank, or whatever it is called. way of a term loan repayable over periods Furthermore, Mr Speaker, let me suggest suited to each individual case. The repayto you, with your knowledge of the cattle instalments at half-yearly intervals. The industry, that the young man in question instalments will be of equal amounts coverwas probably extremely lucky that he did ing principal and interest or, alternatively, of not buy a lot of expensive cattle on the equal amounts of principal, plus interest market of a couple of years ago, because he But where a new enterprise is involvedmight have found himself in very serious financial trouble if he had done so. Clause8 of the directive refers to the prospects of the industry in question and it saysEfficiency, managerial capacity and integrity of the applicant, as well as the prospects of the industry in which the applicant is engaged or intends to become engaged will be important considerations in the assessment of proposals. Well, I think that is reasonable. I do not think that in this country of ours we should encourage people to go into some small Clause 10 of the directive on lending It is quite likely-in fact, it is mental purposes will mean that except in merely involve a change of ownership of land or other assets or the taking over of debt from another lender. Probably we all clause. It is quite obvious that if the bank is to be developmental, the taking over from I refer also to the method of lending. Clause 11 of this directive states that ment will normally require to be made by this is important, because it is a major consideration to the borrower-o r in other appropriate cases, the first instalment date will be a matter for special consideration. In other words, it is not intended that these loans by the Commonwealth Development Bank shall be long-term ones such as loans on first mortgage. I think that in that respect again some disappointment to prospective borrowers may occur if they are seeking a fixed loan which does not involve any immediate repayment. They are seeking a loan which would be treated as an encumbrance on the property, rather than a loan of short term to be repaid within a reasonable time. These are important matters, and I think that, obviously, many people who do not understand the principles involved will be disappointed. Clause 18 of the directive states that the Development Bank will, in appropriate cases, provide hire-purchase facilities for the sources only on unreasonable or unsuitable acquisition of producer goods such as machine tools, factory equipment, farm tractors, agricultural implements and transport vehicles other than passenger-carrying motor cars. The maximum available term of hire will depend on the type of goods financed. I believe that this is one field in which the bank can and will play a very important part in the future, because I think it will relieve the farming community particularly, and, to a lesser degree, the small man in secondary industry, of some of the very costly interest involved in hire purchase agreements. This is a particular element of the bank's activity which should be, and will be, extended. Another point arises, Mr Speaker, in relation to the type of loan. The Development Bank will be prepared to accept second or subsequent mortgages over and above an existing debt. I think that some of us have probably dealt with cases of this kind where there is a considerable encumbrance on land or on a business and sufficient working capital is not available to keep the enterprise going, although it has possibilities have been sufficient for the demand that the for development, and the bank has come to the rescue by lending an additional amount over and above the existing encumbrances. My friend, the honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn), gave a very good on this side of the House asserted that the account of the extension activities of the Development Bank had not been able to bank, and I think that its efforts in this enter sufficiently into the provision of finance field will be of tremendous value, particufor quite a number of people who had larly where a farmer or a man engaged in a small industrial venture is in a marginal position financially and is having trouble in directing and developing the enterprise to the best advantage. The work of the bank in this respect, I believe, will be of tremendous value to industry as a whole. This extension work, of course, is not confined to the Development Bank. The Commonwealth Trading Bank and the private trading banks engage in it. This work represents a great contribution to industry generally. I sum up in this way: The Development Bank provides finance for farming, or secondary-industry ventures which give promise of increased production or productivity. It is a supplementary source of finance to be taken advantage of only when finance is not available from conventional sources or would be available from those terms and conditions. The objects of the bank demand that the development aspect of the enterprise for which the lending is undertaken must be treated as fundamental. The bank must have regard to the venture's prospects of success. Finally, Sir, borrowers must give the maximum security available, but the bank will adopt, and, I believe, is adopting, a flexible approach. I commend the bill to the House. I think that honourable gentlemen opposite also, despite their criticisms, regard the Development Bank as a valuable institution. Speaker, the Opposition supports this bill, which will increase the capital of the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia by £5,000,000. Although we support the measure, we are very critical of a number of aspects of the bank's operations, and particularly of the fact that the bank has not been permitted or encouraged to develop fast enough. Had it been permitted and encouraged to develop fast enough, its capital up to the present time would not bank would have had to meet. Nor would it be sufficient now, even with the additional £5,000,000. Earlier in this debate, honourable members",78,Credit Restrictions Should Be Eased
142,Mr Cairns (Yarra) [9.6],"Mrsought funds from it. Speakers on the Government side of the chamber answered those assertions in various ways. I recall that the honourable member for Barker( Mr The honourable member for Corangamite Forbes) this afternoon said that the bank had never refused to lend money to any person because of a shortage of funds. I do not think that any speaker on this side of the House asserted that the bank had done so. We have always said that the Development Bank had failed to lend to applicants because it applied conservative commercial standards to lending-that it had eliminated applicants by applying to them standards similar to those applied by the ordinary commercial banks. ""We have never said that the bank had turned away anybody on the ground that it had insufficient funds to lend. We submit now, as we submitted continually in 1960 and again in August, 1961, that the capital of the Development Bank is insufficient for the purpose of making the real contribution to national development that such a bank ought to make. The honourable member for Barton( Mr Reynolds) made that point very clear by citing a number of cases. I , too, can cite cases. I have records of ten applications to the bank, eight of which were refused and two of which were accepted. In none of the eight cases in which the applications were refused were any of the conditions mentioned by the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Mitchell) present or applied. Those eight applicants were refused loans because they did not have enough security. One aspect of that, of course, was the impact of the Government's restrictive policies over the last twelve months. Certainly, when a bank or any other lending authority is considering the security that a borrower possesses, it takes into account the market prospects for the sale of the goods that he produces. The prospects of borrowers have been considerably depressed by this Government's economic policies. In each of the eight cases that I have mentioned, the ordinary standards of security, property, ingentleman would make. He criticized the come and prospective income were applied. What was needed in that situation was not a bank that was applying the somewhat conservative commercial standards that are applied everywhere but a bank which would introduce a catalyst or dynamic into the situation that would enable those people who can to go into production and produce up to their potential, without having regard to their existing security, or even to the prospects .of the market. made a number of points. He referred to the attitude which the Opposition adopted at the time of the establishment of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. He referred to a statement made by the Leader of the Opposition to the effect that the splitting up of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation was something to which the Opposition was opposed. Of course, we opposed that splitting up. We said it was unnecesary; and those who were in the House at the time will recall that we quoted some excellent authorities. We quoted extensively the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), and the Treasurer at that time, Sir Arthur Fadden, who had said exactly the same thing during the four or five years preceding their successful attempt to dismember the Commonwealth Bank. Our submission then was that the action being taken was harmful to the Commonwealth Bank; and our submission now is that the Commonwealth Bank would be greater if those things had not been done. That was where we stood at the time, and that is where we stand now. The honourable member for Corangamite referred to the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) who said that the Development Bank had been strangled because it had not been provided with sufficient funds. I have already referred to that matter. What the honourable member for Parkes was saying was that the Development Bank had not been provided with sufficient funds to do all the work that was needed to be done by such a bank, that it had been restricted and that as a result it had applied ordinary banking standards. The last point raised by the honourable member for Corangamite to which I want to refer is one that I expected that honourable honourable member for Barton( Mr Reynolds) for saying that what we needed in banking was a bit more inspiration. I can understand the honourable member for Corangamite objecting to that proposition because, if any member in this House lacks inspiration infinancialand banking matters, it is the honourable member for Corangamite. What this country needs, particularly in its financial, economic and banking policy, is some imagination and inspiration, and the honourable member for Barton was completely right in making the submission which he did. We want less of the pinch-penny, narrow attitude that has been prevailing in these conservative financial institutions that are admired so much by the honourable member for Corangamite, and with which, from time to time, he has had very close association. The Development Bank is a specialist bank. It was established on a principle with which the Australian Labour Party approves. Broadly speaking, its purpose is to provide loans at relatively low interest rates for those who do not have the income, assets or security necessary to obtain funds from the commercial banks in the ordinary way. That is why the Opposition approves of the extension of the capital of that bank by £5,000,000. But we criticize this provision because the Development Bank has been restricted. It is, as the honourable member for Barton said, clearly now a bank of last resort. The people who want to borrow from it have first of all to be turned down, in effect, by the trading banks. Tbis means that the Development Bank enters into the field of lending on low interest rates in competition not with the trading banks themselves but with their hire-purchase subsidiaries and the fringe institutions. as the cost of land enter into the situation, I think that some honourable members opposite fear the power of such a public bank. They fear that if this bank is freed from the restrictions that have been put upon it, if the wraps are taken off a bank of this sort, and it is allowed to operate without restriction, then the higher-profit and higher-interest competitors will face some real competition. Honourable members opposite, of course, occupy two roles in this respect. Some of them are directly concerned with primary production-farm ing or pastoral activities-and some of them are business people. In the first of those roles they want to borrow money, and they have the incentive to want to borrow it at low rates of interest. Then again, honourable members opposite represent commercial interests and they are in the position also of being money lenders themselves, and they want therefore a system which will circulate money at a high rate of interest. So there is something of a split personality in their attitude to a measure of this kind. Looking at the position as farmers they see the Development Bank as a good proposition because it is a powerful public bank that can lend money at a low rate of interest; but looking at the position as investors they see this bank as a competitor with organizations in which they invest their money-perhap s one of the trading banks, if they have been at the game long enough, or one of the hire-purchase companies 'that have come in within the last ten years, or one of the fringe institutions that have come'in during the last two or three years. This is not a simple proposition from their point of view. The Development Bank is supposed to look at the possibilities and at the enterprise of the situation rather than at what has already been achieved. The essence of development is that we have to weigh up the things that are possible, the things of the future. The essence of a commercial banking proposition is that you look at the past, at what you have accumulated already, and at what security you have. I repeat that the essence of the proposition from the point of view of the Development Bank is that we look into the future and we ask in effect, "" What are the possibilities in this position or in that position? "" Such things and I think in a number of the cases that were mentioned by the honourable member for Corangamite this is the essence of the problem. In so many cases the real difficulty of getting development in Australia is that in the place where development is really possible you cannot have that development because of the high price of land, and so development is forced out into marginal areas of production. We put people who have development prospects in some cases into an uneconomic situation by putting them only in places where they can afford to buy land. It is not surprising that we have developmental problems in a situation such as that. Of course, that those problems exist and that the commercial lenders are unable to meet the situation is well recognized. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) some time ago in this debate quoted Dr. H . C Coombs, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. Dr. Coombs saidBanks generally regard lending to rural producers as good and safe business, particularly in I had been arguing that it was insufficient good seasons, high commodity prices and appreciating land values. Those are circumstances when the ordinary commercial banks are able to lend, but something new and something quite different was required. That this new requirement has not been met completely was emphasized by a statement made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports earlier : to-day. Crawford who at one time was secretary of the Department of Trade and is accepted, in this field, as an authority. Sir John Crawford saidIt did seem to me that the paper went very close to admitting that the most profitable lending for the banking system, at least under existtrading banks in August was £865,800,000. ing economic conditions, is not in the rural field, except to the extent that hire purchase is was it in September, 1961? It was associated with banking. That proposition simply means that in the rural field the ordinary banking system under existing circumstances is not finding opportunities for profitable investment, except if it operates under the hire-purchase method. We know very well that the trading banks have not been anxious to lend in the rural field and we know also that what happens is that the bank manager says, in effect, "" Go around the side of the bank where you will find another door with another name over it; you will be able to borrow there at two or three times the bank rate of interest"". Some time ago in an earlier debate on this matter, I pointed out to the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt), who happened to be in the House at the time, that this was happening. I refer honourable members to ""Hansard"" of 18th October, 1961, at page 2217. I had been arguing that the capital of the Development Bank was insufficient to meet the needs of rural producers, who were in the position I have just described. I pointed out that the statistics showed that the amount of money lent by the trading banks in this field in a preceding period had fallen by £11,800,000. The Treasurer interjectedIn recent months their approvals of overdrafts or 5 per cent. But the decline of the prihave increased substantially. I saidThat still remains to be seen. We still have to find out what "" substantially "" means. to rely on the trading banks because they were not lending in this field, and therefore the Development Bank should be pushed harder and further. The Treasurer said that that was not so, that the trading banks were meeting the requirements and the amount they were lending was increasing. We can now look back over the period and ascertain whether the Treasurer was He quoted Sir John right or I was right. The proposition can be proved quite easily. I refer to the "" Monthly Review of Business Statistics"". When the Treasurer and I were making these statements, the amount of money lent by the private The Treasurer said it was increasing. What £856,000,000! In October it was £861,000,000 and in November it was £852,000,000. The Treasurer was proved to be wrong on that occasion. Of course, his proposition was based on what had happened in July, the month before he spoke. He had these figures ahead of me, because he gets them in a different way. In July, 1961, there had been an increase on the month before. In June, the figure was £874,000,000 and in July it was £884,000,000. This was the time when some optimism was coming back to the Government. It thought a recovery was taking place and it was feeling confident and optimistic. This was influencing the Treasurer. But he was proved wrong then and I submit he will be proved wrong now. The methods of the ordinary commercial banks are not the catalyst for the development that is needed, and will not lift the Australian economy as it needs to be lifted. There has been a decline in loans by banks over the last twelve months, almost consistently but with one or two variations. The trend with every bank except the Development Bank has been a decline. The decline with the Commonwealth Bank from January, 1961, to the last figures I have-thos e for November, 1961-ha s been from £153,000,000 to £146,200,000, vate trading banks has been from £942,000,000 to £852,000,000-1 0 per cent -twic e the rate of decline of the Comproved by the circumstances to be true. monwealth Bank. As I said, the Development Bank is the only bank that has increased its loans and the question we must ask is whether in the provision of new money for development we need to get increasingly outside the ordinary commercial, conservative tests that are being applied predominantly by the financial system to-day. Recovery demands a catalyst from outside the ordinary commercial system. Commercial loans are, of course, not outside the system; they are part standards and practices. that are continuof it. But the Development Bank is outside the system. It can help to provide the money that is needed. It should lend more; it can lend more; it must lend more. It is not doing enough. We do not suggest it is limited only by the amount of capital. It has about £25,000,000 worth of capital and it has borrowed about £16,000,000 from the Commonwealth .Savings Bank, a total of over £40,000,000. Altogether at November, 1961, it had lent only £44,300,000. Of that amount, a substantial part was on hire purchase. This was really lent in another department of the Commonwealth Bank, which was subsequently coupled to the Development Bank -afte r it was formed. In November, 1961, loans on hire purchase had reached £20,400,000 compared with about £17,000,000 or £18,000;000 when the Development Bank was formed. Therefore, it has lent only another £3,000,000 on hire-purchase contracts since it has been established. Its other advances have risen not from zero to £23,900,000, where they were in November, 1961, but from about £15,000,000 or £16,000,000, where they were soon after its establishment. The net increase in that period is only between £8,000,000 and £10,000,000. Obviously the bank is not doing the work it can do and obviously some persons in positions of responsibility have no intention of allowing it to do the work that it can do. I do not intend to go back over the debate. However, I want to point out that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports was able to anticipate this position when the bank was established. He said that this state of affairs would arise and what he said on that occasion has been We are not, of course, criticizing the Development Bank for what it has done; we are criticizing it for what it has not been allowed to do. We ask that it should do what, in fact, it can do. The question really is whether the Development Bank will function particularly as a nonconservative commercial lender, operating with the principles and priorities of development in mind, or whether it will be substantially coloured by the ordinary banking ously applied. The Development Bank was established on a sound principle, but that principle has not been fully applied. The Development Bank has been unduly restricted. Its capital is probably sufficient for the limited field it has been allowed to enter, but its capital is not sufficient for the field it should enter. It does not enter this field because honourable members opposite and no doubt those in control of policy are afraid of what they call public enterprise or socialism. Therefore, people are forced into the hands of the usurers, as the honourable member for Barton said. It should be compulsory for the hire-purchase companies and other fringe banking institutions to place pawnbrokers' signs over their doors so that people can really understand what kind of concerns they are. That would make it clear to people that the public bank, the Development Bank, is the place where money can be obtained at low rates of interest-no t just a place where it should be able to be obtained at low rates of interest-instea d of from the modern twentieth century usurers. Usurers had a stinking reputation in mediaeval times and it has hardly improved since then. It is because members of the Country Party and others have a split personality on this matter that this bank does not really develop properly. They oppose a banking system that would be of great advantage to them as farmers, because they do not like public enterprise and socialism. They are scared away from the practical, economic, financial function of a bank by words. Until they can become accustomed to testing what is done by the actual conditions and not by the hypnotic effect of words, this problem will remain unsolved. The solution is only a matter of using public enterprise more and more significantly, despite the fact that it is called socialism and is regarded as a scare device, as though it were hot or possessing an electric current so that one is repelled from it every time one thinks of it. Therefore, one is unable to see the way in which it functions in practice and the significant difference between the high interest, exploiting, usury type of financial operation and the ones that can be fitted effectively into an economy such as ours. "" I conclude, as the honourable member for Barton cbncluded, by saying that what is necessary in this country is a national plan, a plan that will have projections and targets of what can be achieved in this field and what can be achieved in that field, so that the people, through their democratic vote at election time, can vote on what will happen to the country economically and not on matters that have nothing whatever to do with the real, practical problems upon which their lives and the lives of their families depend. We need to bring to the minds of the Australian people the fact that we must have priorities; we cannot have unlimited spending even on motor cars, beer or television and at the same time have the fundamental things upon which national strength depends. We have to make decisions on these matters. We cannot hope to have some kind of steady development unless we have concerted action by the people who are making the decisions on these matters. Of course, everything that the Govern.menthas pretended to do in the last four vor five years in the nature of public policy :or national planning has had none of those things in it. The Government has become characterized by its stop-and-go, hit-or-miss methods. If we want to choose that kind of action under the name of laisser-faire or free enterprise, or under the name of acquisition and getting in for your cut, we are free to make that choice; but we will not develop national strength and a spirit of common action in those circumstances. I submit, Mr Speaker, that all those things are involved when we have to make up our minds whether we are for or against a bank like the Commonwealth Development Bank and whether that bank is to work to the fullest possible extent or is to be held back and restricted in the interests of private competing interests that are taking far more than their fair share out of the Australian economy. Speaker, for about the last 30 minutes we have heard the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns), in a fairly cleverly phrased but very rambling speech, try to get his fellow members out of what they said and what they meant in the speeches that they have made on this bill previously. We heard the honourable member for Yarra say that none of the other Labour speakers had said that a shortage of funds in the Commonwealth Development Bank had caused that bank to refuse to make loans. That is not true. Other speakers from the Labour side in this debate did say that a shortage of funds had meant that the bank had been unable to approve loans. Then, Mr Speaker, in trying to get other honourable members out of what they said, he stated that the real trouble was that the bank had applied the ordinary banking tests to the various applicants who had been refused. That just cannot be possible, because if the Development Bank consistently applied the ordinary banking tests to applicants for loans from that bank it would not have lent any money at all. The first qualification to enable a person to obtain a loan from the Development Bank is that he should have been refused a loan by a trading bank. So, if the same standards are being applied by the Development Bank, there would not be any successful applications at all to that bank. The honourable member for Yarra mentioned that he had a total of ten cases that he could quote, of which eight had been refused. for Reid asks me whether I have had experience of cases where loans have been refused by the Development Bank. Yes, I have. Probably unlike many honourable members of the Opposition who have spoken in this debate, I have had personal experience of the Development Bank and its officers and their attitude towards this new venture and towards applicants. I",81,Credit Restrictions Should Be Eased

144,Mr Uren,Hav e you not got any?,86,Credit Restrictions Should Be Eased
145,Mr Holten,"The honourable memberbelieve that from that personal experience I have learnt a lot about banking. One thing that I have learnt from these people, Mr Speaker, is that when an applicant does not obtain a long-term loan from the Development Bank at the minimum rate of interest he is naturally disappointed that the interesting fact. I mention these things to bank has turned down his application; but very often-in fact, in nearly every caseit has been in the man's own interest that his application should be turned down. The officers of the Development Bank have a tremendous responsibility to the individual applicants. If they advance money to an applicant, they have a responsibility to see that he is in a position to meet his commitments, to live and to have a reasonable amount in addition. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) mentioned one case in which the application was rejected before the House. He said that the Treasurer ( Mr We all want to see the people who Harold Holt) should do something about that case. What will be the position? Who is to judge which applicants should be accommodated by the Development Bank? Is it to be left, as the honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn) said, to a member of Parliament to decide whether £10,000 or £2,000 should be advanced to a man to be invested in a certain project, or is that decision to be left to the experienced and conscientious officers of the Development Bank? I say that that decision should be left to the officers of the bank who are entrusted with that job. If a member of Parliament is to come on to the scene, it should be to make representations on behalf of his constituent; but he should also accept the decision of the bank as being one that indicates an attitude that the bank wishes to help people to develop their properties or to get a start in life, whilst not wanting them to put around their necks a big load that they cannot possibly carry. The honourable member for Macquarie also said that he considered the agency for the Development Bank should be withdrawn from the private trading banks so that the people might have more direct contact with the Development Bank. The very reason why the trading banks have been made the agency for the Development Bank is to give the people more points of contact with that bank through the normal trading banks. What is more, there is nothing to prevent a person who wants a loan from going direct to the Development Bank, if he wishes to do so. According to my information a large proportion of the Development Bank's customers have their accounts with the private trading banks. That is an show just how much reliance we can place on the inaccurate statements of honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) said that the interest rate charged by the Development Bank is too high-that it is 7 per cent. The truth is that the interest rate charged by the Development Bank is not 7 per cent. The maximum rate charged by that bank is 6 per cent. for Braddon says it is still too high. are starting off in primary or secondary industry get their money at as low an interest rate as possible, but under the present cost structure of the nation the bank must pay its way. on it. for Kingsford-Smith is one of those who subscribe to the idea that if you want more money you just print it and do not worry about increasing production. As we all know, the Development Bank was established only two years ago-o n 14th January, 1960. It resulted from what was virtually an amalgamation of the old mortgage bank and industrial finance departments of the Commonwealth Bank. That amalgamation gave greater flexibility of operation, more capital and wider borrowing powers. What was most important of all was the fact that this was an unorthodox bank, as the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) has said. It was something new. It was a courageous venture by the Government to help the development of Australia. In considering applications for a loan, the important factor was not the security an applicant had to offer but his integrity, his character, his past performances in his chosen sphere, his past performances in meeting hisfinancialcommitments and his chances of success in the",86,Credit Restrictions Should Be Eased

149,Mr Holten,"The honourable memberproposed undertaking. In other words, this Government was prepared to back the judgment of its qualified officers as to the character, courage and intelligence of applicants rather than consider the security which applicants had to offer. The question of lower interest rates has been mentioned. At least, in the hire-purchase field, the Development Bank does advance money at reduced rates of interest. On such transactions it charges a flat rate of 4J per cent. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr ness executives and people wishing to underCairns) said that the Development Bank has not done as much as it could do. What did honourable members opposite expect the bank to do in its two short years of existence, especially having regard to the fact that many of the other banking institutions have been established for over 100 years? When the Government first introduced this legislation, the idea was to start with a nominal capital of £15,000,000 and then see how things went. That was a sensible attitude to take. Instead of rushing into the venture and providing a huge amount of capital for it, the Government decided to put £15,000,000 into it and see what eventuated. The Government has recognized that the Development Bank's funds are required and desired by the people, and, in its wisdom, it decided within the last six months to make another £10,000,000 available. This bill proposes to make available a further £5,000,000. I remind honourable members that an additional £5,000,000 was provided for in the Budget last year. There has been some talk about the number of applications for advances which have been refused by the bank. It is interesting to note that 2,060, or two out of every three applications made to the bank were approved during last financial year. The important fact is that nine out of ten of the loans advanced have been made to rural industries. The Development Bank has played an important part in ensuring the future of Australia and has contributed to the welfare of primary producers who, as we all know, are faced with enormous problems due to constantly rising costs and declining overseas prices. The establishment of a special bank to provide funds for these people is of great practical assistance to them. The honourable member for Kennedy said that there should be co-operation between the Development Bank and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. Co-operation with a scientific organization would be good, but, as other honourable members have pointed out, one of the most important functions of the Development Bank is to provide rural specialists and industrial consultants to assist its borrowers. I remind honourable members of the scholarships that have been awarded by the Development Bank to busitake university courses. In other words, this is not only a financial institution; it is a far-reaching, far-seeing project which has been and will continue to be of great benefit to Australia. On the subject of rural advisers, I was very pleased to hear the honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn) speak of the need for the establishment of farm management clubs. That is a subject which has keenly interested me personally. If we cannot do something along those lines through the Development Bank and the Treasury, then the Government must assist in the establishment of these clubs through the Department of Primary Industry. I sbould like to recall to honourable members some of the statements I made on 29th September, 1960, on this subject. When speaking on the Estimates for the Department of Primary Industry, I saidI should like the Minister that is, the Minister for Primary Industryto investigate a special project that I have in mind and to consider whether it would be possible to contribute a sum from that £50,000 to pay the salaries of farm experts attached to farmers' clubs or groups. I was speaking about the extra £50,000 that is made available to the Minister from primary industry to be used at his discretion for special projects. The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) interjectedThe honourable member has mentioned this before, has he not? I repliedYes, I have, and I want to stress it further now. I went on to speak in terms similar to those used by the honourable member for Farrer, and I pointed out how in the United Sates of America an experiment was conducted along these lines. I think the story beaia repeating. For the purposes of the experiment, two groups of twelve farms were taken. One group of twelve farms was given the benefit of the services of farm management experts, while the other group of twelve farms was not. At the end of twelve months, the financial results of the two groups were calculated. It was found that the incomes of the farms that had the advantage of scientific and expert knowledge had increased by 50 per cent., while those of the farms which did not have this benefit decreased by 25 per cent. My authority for this statement is the Director of Rural Broadcasts, Mr Douglas, who is employed by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I join with the honourable member for Farrer in making a plea to the Government, to the Minister for Primary Industry, and to the Treasurer, to have another look at the proposal that, in the interests of the future of our primary producers, we should subsidize the payment of salaries of farm experts to be attached to groups of farms throughout Australia. Perhaps an experiment could be conducted, as it was in America. We could take two ""roups of farmers in similar localities and farming under similar conditions. We could see what the financial results were of the two groups, one having the benefit of scien6 per cent, was too high, the honourable tific advice and the other without such advice. In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, I quite all right"". say that this bill is another move on the Government's part for which it deserves to be congratulated. I listened to the that we would like lower interest rates, speeches of honourable members opposite, but that it is hard to achieve them because including those of the honourable members of the cost structure. for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti), Barton( Mr gave me the impression, at any rate, that Reynolds) and Kennedy( Mr Riordan). he was not over-concerned about farmers They tried to insinuate into the minds of having to pay 6 per cent, interest on the the people of Australia the impression money they borrow from the Development that there was a rift between the two Government parties on certain aspects of Bank. this Development Bank bill.

Party were worried because they thought Taking together the two points I have menthat the bank was going to do a lot of tioned one is left with a definite impression harm, while the supporters of the Country that the County Party is running along Party were against that attitude. I want behind the Liberal Party on this issue that to assure the House, that there is no basis it is afraid to attempt to alter any part of for such a suggestion. It was made, as this legislation and that it is quite prepared I have said, by more than one honourable to let the farmers throughout the country be member opposite. To my mind, it was simply an attempt to break up the unity on this side of the House and to try to drive a wedge between the Government parties. I assure honourable members opposite that their attempt did not run a drum and never will. to make two points before I launch into my speech. I have been shocked, in listening to the proceedings this afternoon and to-night, as the poor old Whip must, to find a certain trend in the speeches of some of the supporters of the Government. They implied that farmers who have not been assisted by the Development Bank are no-hopers. Do not twist. for Gippsland was not here all the time. I happened to hear all the speeches. The honourable member for Indi( Mr Holten) referred to interest at the rate of 6 per cent as being a part of the cost structure. In reply to an interjection by my worthy colleague, the honourable member for Braddon( Mr Davies), that member for Indi said, "" It is a part of the cost structure"", dismissing it with a shrug of his shoulders, as if to say, "" It is The honourable member for Indi did not",87,Credit Restrictions Should Be Eased

I condemn it out of hand as do all the Labour members in this Parliament and all members of the Labour movement throughout Australia. Let us take, for instance, a loan of £10,000 which a farmer is able to obtain from the bank. He must pay 6 per cent, interest on it, or £600 a year. If the rate of interest were 4 per cent., and I would certainly have it down to that rate if I had my way make the loans interest free, and we would sense, when its purpose is to help struggling examine the possibility of doing that.

Considering the work that it has to do for primary and secondary industry the bank is still growing very slowly. It was born in April, 1959, but did not actually commence operations until 14th January, 1960. Its charter has been read to-night by two or three of my colleagues, who have quoted from pages 20 and 21 of the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959-1961. The functions of the Development Bank, as set out in section 72 are(a) To provide finance for persons(i) for the purposes of primary production; or (ii) for the establishment or development of industrial undertakings, particularly small undertakings, in cases where, in the opinion of the Development Bank, the provision of the finance is desirable and the finance would not otherwise be available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions; and (b) To provide advice and assistance with a view to promoting the efficient organization and conduct of primary production or of industrial undertakings. Those are the functions of the bank as set out in section 72. Section 74 deals with the powers of the Development Bank which, in sub-section (ii) are set out as follows (a) to receive money on deposit; (b) to borrow money; (c) to lend money; (d) of exchange, promissory notes and Treasury bills; (e) Commonwealth and other securities; (f) to establish credits and give guarantees; (g) of money; (h) and (i) to do anything incidental to any of its powers. This all sounds very big, but the inadequacy of £14,100,000 in 1961. In 1960, 12,764 of the capital granted to the bank greatly customers were helped, to the extent of restricts its functions and powers. How has £14,400,000. Is it not fantastic that the the bank carried out these functions which Development Bank has had to enter the I have outlined? The report of the Comhire purchase field? I do not believe this monwealth Banking Corporation is very was its original intention at all, but in an well produced, and I give the corporation endeavour to get short term profits from credit for it. It was issued towards the end its loans it has gone into the hire-purchase of last year, but it is a cold and statistical field in which a tremendous amount of document. What is missing from it is the debt has been created throughout Australia. vast human side of the bank's work-the This field has been extended by a bank thousands of interviews between bank officers and prospective customers, the rejections and personal difficulties and personal tragedies. This aspect does not appear in the report. It is the great unwritten story of the Development Bank. It is the really true picture which is missing from the frame, and the frame is the statistical story in the report. Many of the rejections would probably be tragic. I know of some of them from my own experience in my big rural electorate in Tasmania. It covers half the island, and has 21 different rural industries and, of course, a great variety of agriculture. I know of many applicants who have asked for help from this bank and I know of some cases where the applications have been rejected. I know the tragedy and the disappointment that has occurred, but this part of the story is not written into the corporation's report. Many of Tasmania's small farmers, because of their inability to get money with which to carry on, are forced to work on other jobs outside their farms. What a fantastic story in this twentieth century. It is the sort of thing you might expect in the middle of a depression-farmer s having to go out and work on public works to keep their farms going. The farms are not keeping them; they are keeping the farms because they have not been able to get the capital they desire from this bank or from any other source. It is a tragic story. to buy, sell, discount and re-discount bills honourable member for Braddon, has reto buy and sell securities issued by the minded me, money is too dear. That is the case.

The corporation's report tells of 11,586 hire purchase customers who have been helped to the extent",90,Credit Restrictions Should Be Eased
161,Mr Davies,And money is too dear.,91,Credit Restrictions Should Be Eased
162,Mr Duthie,"As my colleague, thedesigned to help agriculture and small industries. I was appalled when I learned that this bank had entered the hire-purchase field to get quick profits. It is evidently more concerned with that activity than with widening its field of assistance to primary producers. Last year straight out loans were granted to 2,060 customers to the extent of £10,800,000. I looked up the number of rural holdings in Australia, and in 1959-60, according to the Commonwealth Year Book, the number was 262,242, reduced by 600 in the four years since 1956. These holdings involved 241,247 owners, lessees or share farmers. Yet out of that vast number of rural holdings only 2,060 were assisted by loans from the Development Bank last year. I do not think that is good enough. The corporation's report does not mention the thousands of rejected, disappointed and disheartened farmers and industrialists and the shattered hopes of many people. The method of selection of customers is a very interesting feature of the act which established the bank. Section 73 provides(I) In determining whether or not finance shall be provided for a person, the Development Bank shall have regard primarily to the prospects of the operations of that person becoming, or continuing to be, successful and shall not necessarily bility of errors of judgment in assessing the have regard to the value of the security available in respect of that finance. This is a completely revolutionary provision in banking legislation. I believe it restricts the officers of the bank in their interviews with prospective clients. But it does more than this; it demands that the officers make a searching check of each applicant's character, ability, background, business acumen, and so on. As I have said, this section provides that. . . the Development Bank shall have regard officer would ask, ""What is the value of primarily to the prospects of the operations of Jim Smith's farm and plant? What is his that person The applicantbecoming, or continuing to be, successful and tained in a day. Mistakes or errors of shall not necessarily have regard to the value of judgment in the field of security are imthe security available in respect of that finance. Would this not be the first time that such had its activities limited by the conditions conditions have been laid down in banking under which applicants can be accepted. practice, with emphasis not on security but That is its first limitation. on the chances of economic success and on character? I believe that the emphasis on character before hard cash is good. It is bank's charter, which provides that the excellent. It is an important change in bank shall help farmers and industrialists emphasis, and we do not condemn it out of hand. But I maintain that this condition, taken in isolation, opens up a wider margin for errors of judgment than the checking of security as a condition of a loan. Here is a customer, Jim Smith, wanting £3,000. He is a dairy farmer who wants to increase his pastures and sow them with clover and re-fence his property, and an examination almost as thorough as a security test is made of his whole background, his farming methods and ability to make his dairy farm a success. Even if he passes this character test the prospects of his industry must also be examined. An excellent farmer who is heavily capitalized can be ruined by market fluctuations, sudden ill health, bad seasons, or disease in his crop or herd, as the case may be. WhatI am getting at is that so many imponderable factors can crowd in upon a farmer that his chances of success in the future can be destroyed. Therefore, the officers of this bank must be specialists in reading and assessing personality values far outside the realm of royalties or the field of finance. Precise judgment of human values is a matter of top priority in the work of these officers. That is why I say that the possisuccess potential of applicants is very real. No doubt hundreds of farmers and business applicants have been rejected under the terms of the charter set out in section 73 of the Commonwealth Banks Act. Assessment of security as a prerequisite to the granting of loans is easy when compared with the assessment of the prospect of success. Assessment of security is primarily a matter of economic and financial statistics. For example, an investigating bank balance?"" Such matters can be checked easily, and probably can be ascerprobable. So the Development Bank has The second limitation is set out in the only when they cannot get help from private banks or insurance companies. This is certainly a very good provision from the applicant's point of view. It provides an avenue of assistance when other avenues have been closed. But up to a point, it ties the hands of the Development Bank. A few years ago the Government carved up the Commonwealth Bank into four or five different segments. In doing this, the Government weakened the overall impact of the great Commonwealth Bank on the nation. It turned the Commonwealth Bank into a bankers' bank when it re-created the Commonwealth Bank Board, which had been the curse of the bank from 1924 to 1930. The competition value of the bank has definitely been reduced. The Development Bank has had its wings clipped. As the honourable member for Yarra( MrI have not heard of any instances of bullyCairns) pointed out to-night, there is no fulling or discourtesy on the part of the bank'3 blooded competition between the Development Bank and the private banks. The old form of competition no longer exists. The Development Bank has had its hands tied behind its back by the limitations that have been imposed upon it under the act. It has been confined, combined and circumscribed. It can deal only with cases that have been rejected by the private banking organizations. Perhaps that puts it a little bluntly, but there is a lot of truth in the statement. I repeat that the Development Bank to a large extent can deal only with cases that have been rejected by other sources of financial assistance. Therefore, where does the competition come in? The third limitation placed upon the Development Bank is vital. I refer to its lack of capital. That is evidenced by the bill now before us, which is designed to increase its capital to £25,000,000. That sum still falls far short of what we would like to see in a full-blooded development bank. The bank is still playing around with the mighty task of rural development. I do not intend to go into all the ramifications of rural development; that subject has been covered splendidly by my colleagues on this side of the House and some of the members on the Government side. The need for rural development is as obvious as the fact that the sun will rise to-morrow morning. It was a gem of disparagement of the actual In spite of all that has been said about it, working of the bank. Surely to goodness in spite of the terms of its charter, in spite the honourable member for Wilmot cannot of the notes of praise that have been raised by honourable members opposite, in spite of the introduction of this bill to raise its capital by £5,000,000, the Development Bank is still only playing around with the tremendous task of fully developing the primary and secondary industry potential of Australia. It is like a very shiny, expensive Cadillac which has only a model T Ford engine in it. cial bomb, as my friend from Hunter suggests. The Development Bank has the capacity to do what we would like to see it do, but it has not the necessary capital. It may even have the necessary personnel. I believe that the men who are running this bank are earnestly trying to make it work. officers. I repeat that, although it has the capacity outwardly, it still has not sufficient capital to enable it to give the boost lo development that we of the Opposition would like to see. For all those reasons, the Development Bank is but a shadow of the institution that Labour will make it when we assume office within the next twelve months. Deputy Speaker, if I had expressed an opinion about the Commonwealth Development Bank similar to that which has been expressed by the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie), I certainly would not be voting in favour of this addition of £5,000,000 to its capital. If the bank is not more efficient than the honourable member suggests, surely he should not vote in favour of the bill. All sorts of speeches have been delivered by Labour members on this subject. Some honourable members have praised the bank, some have praised its officials, and some have found fault with the institution; but the speech delivered by the honourable member for Wilmot was a gem",91,Credit Restrictions Should Be Eased

Honourable members will recall that one increase of £5,000,000 I think members of the Labour Party said has already been provided for in the Commonwealth Banks Act 1961, which was enacted in October last. As a result of these two increases the capital of the bank will now be £25,857,000, in addition to which the bank has substantial reserves of its own and also employs considerable sums borrowed from the Commonwealth Savings Bank. I have heard described as insignificant the amount at the disposal of the Development Bank. I think that a Government supporter said that the bank had been in operation only for two years. The Treasurer dealt The Bank has now been operating for just over years, and its record in its allotted field is already an impressive one.

169,Mr Turnbull,"I know what the with that matter. He saidwe supported the bill to establish this bank will not receive the loans that they require. this Government thought about it. In On several occasions I have asked the Treasurer in this House whether section 73 (1.) of the act is being implemented. On every occasion the Treasurer said, ""Yes"". He has made a study of the subject. On one occasion, after I had asked a question, he went so far as to make a supplementary reply after he had had investigations made, and he said that he was quite satisfied that the bank was implementing this sub-section. I have found out that when somebody fails to obtain a loan it is not prudent to make the general statement that his application has been wrongly rejected. It is necessary to investigate these cases in order enough. They say that they want more to ascertain the details. The honourable member for Barton asked who decides these things. He asked whether loan applications were rejected, due to the opinion of the bank. He said that that was not good more. But if Labour had stayed in office enough. Then whose opinion should be there would not have been any legislation given? The Development Bank has special officers of getting on the band-wagon. The Labour who have been selected for their knowledge and ability to decide these questions. WhoI am in favour of providing more money should decide the matter? Should some member of Parliament be able to influence the decision? Who should decide? Surely to remember that the money comes from to goodness the men who have been selected for their knowledge of these matters should Wilmot said that the Government had taken make the decision! The members of Parliament in this House represent all of Australia and people who have been refused a loan can easily come to them. Members can then go to the Commonwealth Bank and tralia and the honourable member can obtain find out the reasons why applications were rejected.

He said that many rejected and I have found that those cases youngsters want to get onto the land and were not as they had been stated. would like blocks. Where are the The honourable member for Barton used youngsters to come from? Are they to the words, ""When we think of this come from the electorate of the honourable Development Bank "". When we think of it! member for Barton? The point is that this Why, the Labour Government had years in bank may lend money only to people whom office and did not think about it at all! But fairness to the honourable member for Barton, I must say that he meant to ask what we envisaged when we discussed the Development Bank. I envisaged that the Labour Party did not think about it, or, at least, did not establish it. Now that it has been established, Opposition members say that it has not enough money. I think that the money provided has been sufficient, and the Treasurer has said that more will be provided if necessary. I could supply a list of things of which Labour has not thought. Once these things have been embodied in legislation Labour members say that the legislation is not good money. What about homes for the aged? for homes for the aged.

Let me say that the bill will provide the bank with an extra £5,000,000. If the enlarged capital proves inadequate to meet the demand, we expect the Treasurer, who I am pleased to see in the House now, to provide additional money. All these things have been made clear by members to constituents and they have been made clear to members by the Treasurer. This bank really fills a want in Australia by giving opportunities to young men of ability who want to go on to the land. It is not intended to broadcast the money among all school leavers in an effort to put them on the land. The men who control this bank are charged with a great responsibility. First, they have to lend the is not a bank at all. It is only a moneypeople's money, and that is a very heavy responsibility. Secondly, when they make a loan, they have to be as sure as they possibly can be that the borrower will make a success of his venture. Otherwise, the loan would only hinder him in getting on in life and would not help him at all. As one honourable member said, the rejection of applications is sometimes in the best interests of the applicants. That is very often the case. When it is said that many people have been rejected, honourable members should look into the cases individually. If they do that, they will find that some of the people who have made applications are not suitable.

The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) in discussing this bill made it clear that the Development Bank lending institutiona kind of pawn-broking establishment that is glorified with the title of bank. He said that banks receive deposits and utilize them for the purpose of making advances to borrowers. The receipt of deposits is an essential of banking, and this institution, the Development Bank, does not receive deposits. It is a simple and undisputed rule of banking that advances create deposits. I have no time to go into the A.B.C. of banking. It is also a simple rule of banking that banks can lend amounts equivalent to at least seven times the amounts of the deposits they hold, without any danger of insolvency. That, of course, is because advances create deposits.

However, if he did not say that, it could still be a danger. Such a danger could exist in some, or even many, of the operations of this money-lendbg institution, and the people of the community would have to bear the burden of the losses. That would be a subsidy to development made by the community generally. But such a subsidy could be paid direct to the Commonwealth Bank, and the Commonwealth Bank, by engaging in the developmental and lending operations to be undertaken by this so-called Development Bank, could at the same time immensely increase its hire-purchase operations in competition with the private banking institutions, and make big profits for the people of this country. That would reduce the overall subsidy to general development. Of course this country needs development! We need more farms. As the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) pointed out, there are fewer farms to-day than there were ten years ago. In order to put people on the land so that we may develop the hinterland of this country we need an institution that will finance people who have the necessary knowledge-the sons of farmers, people who have been rural workers all their lives and who want farms. We could enable them to secure farms of their own. That is what is wanted. way the results of its maladministration of Are there many such people?

So, to put 50,000 men on the land would cost £1,000,000,000. Yet this Government comes forward and says that in order to remedy the drift from the country to the town, in order to develop our rural industries so that we can increase the primary production which is essential for the development of our secondary industries, and the sale of which abroad is so necessary to enable us to meet our commitments to overseas lenders and to private institutions that have invested their money in this country, it will increase the capital of the Development Bank by £5,000,000. This Government, with the greatest degree of national vision that it possesses says, "" We will give the bank another £5,000,000."" What will £5,000,000 do? Why, £5,000,000 is only a means of providing petty cash for those who already occupy rural holdings. It is not enough to expand existing holdings, which will continue to diminish as rapidly as they have diminished in the past ten years-a t the rate of thousands of farms a year. That is the unenviable record of the Government in connection with primary production. Yet here it makes a big to-do about what it calls a development banka pawn-broking institution, in effect, whose operations will be limited.

Production has also increased compared with production ten or fifteen years ago, and this is directly and indirectly leading to employment of a much greater number of people than was the case earlier. 1 am glad that all honourable members who have spoken in this debate support this measure to increase the capital of the Development Bank. I can well understand the difficulties of honourable members opposite, because they realize the benefit that the Development Bank has been, and will continue to be, under the present Administration. But, because it is the creation of the present Government, they are not prepared to concede that the bank provides a benefit. When measures such as the one we aTe now debating come before this House honourable members opposite endeavour to show that the Development Bank is not performing the functions for which it was intended when the legislation was passed in 1959. The honourable member for Melbourne cise so much caution after it has been Ports( Mr Crean) criticized the capital operating for some time. The honourable structure of the bank. He implied that member for Yarra argued without logic. the Government was hamstringing the On the one hand he said that the bank bank because the bank had relatively no needed more money in order to do the job deposits and because its capital structure that he wanted to see done, but on the was different from that of the normal tradother hand he said that he did not want ing banks. The honourable member conthe Development Bank at all. He regretted tended that the Development Bank had been that the Government had seen fit to introforced into the field of hire purchase so duce legislation changing the structure of that it could continue to make loans to the Commonwealth Trading Bank and primary producers and small secondary establishing the Development Bank. The industries. From his extensive knowledge honourable member cannot have it both he must know that that is not a correct ways. Either he accepts the alterations representation of the facts. The capital made in the legislation or he does not. One structure of the bank is different because has only to compare the security provisions its purpose is different. The functions of of the Mortgage Bank Department with the Development Bank demand some degree those of the Development Bank to know of risk in the advances that it makes. It that loans made by the bank to the rural is unlikely to attract deposits in the way community could not have been made by that other trading banks attract deposits. the old Mortgage Bank Department and The Development Bank is designed to fill that therefore the loans that have been a gap that the other banks do not fill. It made are directly the result of legislation is not designed to take the place of other entire field of banking. The honourable member knew that his criticism was incorrect because he knew that the Development Bank is an amalgamation of the Industrial Finance Department and the Mortgage Trading Bank. It was left to this Government to make available to the rural industries the advantages that the previous Labour Administration made available to secondary industries but which it denied to the rural sector of the community. The present Government rectified the position and placed the rural industries in a position of equality with secondary industries. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) claimed that the lending policy of the Development Bank was conservative. He implied that its policy did not differ from that of the normal trading banks. That is incorrect. However, although the bank's policy is more liberal than the policies adopted by the trading banks, I think that at times it tends to err by adopting an over-cautious attitude.

It is very natural tor a bank of this kind to show a degree of caution in its early years of existence while it feels its way. It may not need to exerintroduced not so long ago by the present Government. This afternoon, when I was absent from the chamber, the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) quoted from a speech that I made in 1959 on the .Reserve Bank BilL He has since spoken to me and told .me that he had paraphrased what I said, claiming that I had said that the rural industries were saturated so far asfinanceis concerned, and therefore there was no need to increase the funds of the Development Bank. I do not propose .to re-read the speech that I made on that occasion, but the honourable member will know that his summary of what I said was quite incorrect. A check of ""Hansard"" will show that it was incorrect. On that occasion I was submitting that at a time of falling prices in the rural community, projects that would otherwise be profitable become unprofitable, and since the Development Bank must look to the profitability of a possible enterprise as the main criterion for granting a loan, clearly at a time of lower prices propositions for which the bank could have advanced money in a period of greater profitability would be outside its scope of operations in a period of lower prices. That is quite clear and in no way implies, as the honourable member suggested, that the position of the rural industries has become satu-Does the honourable member claim to have rated so far as finance is concerned. That was the term used by the honourable member to me in conversation. Changing the meaning of an honourable member's words has become characteristic of the honourable member for Macquarie. It is something that we on this side of the House have come to expect from him. Primary producers in particular should be heartened by the last annual report of the Development Bank. For the year 1960-61, of a total of 2,060 loans, 1,997 were for amounts less than £20,000. The bank was designed primarily to assist small undertakings. Quite clearly, that is being done. Of the 2,060 loans granted in the last financial year, 1,876 went to the rural community. Clearly great emphasis is placed on the rural community by the Development Bank. The average loan has been between £4,000 and £5,000. The purposes for which those loans are made are well known F.1715/62 -R -[28 J to honourable members and do not need re-emphasis. I wish to refer now to a matter raised earlier in the debate by the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes). Repeatedly the States undertake closer settlement schemes. After having been put on the land the settler sometimes approaches the Development Bank seeking finance. Sometimes the Development Bank is not able to provide finance in those circumstances because it believes that the closer settlement scheme sponsored by the State is not a viable proposition. If there were closer liaison between the States and the Development Bank such situations need not arise. The States should take the initiative to see that this situation does not arise. They must realize that if they place people on blocks of land, it is up to them to see that those people are able to earn a profit from that land.

The position regarding the movement of these tanks would not have changed very greatly in the past decade. It is not a question of whether we can move an individual vehicle but whether we can move it in an organized way and use it for combat purposes. There are many details of this matter which have not been made clear to us by the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer). If a regiment, a brigade or a division of these vehicles is to be moved a vast amount of other equipment is required. They could not be moved for fighting purposes on their own, and they could not be moved over our vast spaces without other services. Fuel, oil and rations are required as are does, that the first duty of any government, recovery equipment and workshops. It is whether it is the present Government or a obvious that the number of vehicles involved succeeding government, is to protect the would greatly exceed the number of fighting security of the population that it governs. vehicles that had to be moved.

If they were to be moved by rail, in all we have treaties with this and that country, probability they would have to be moved no matter how powerful they may be. You at a time when they would not be subject to have potential allies and you have potential enemy action. If we were likely to use these vehicles we know that hostilities will not break out in Australia, it would be under conditions in such a way that our potential allies themof emergency when we were threatened with selves will be immobilized and the only invasion or when invasion had actually defence on which we can finally rely is that begun. If you glance at a map of the railwhich the Government builds and maintains way system, Mr Speaker, you will agree in this country? with me that it would be no great problem for an enemy to interfere with the movement of these tanks by rail.

As we vehicles can be moved as a fighting force. possess only a few of them we cannot afford In addition to the auxiliary equipment which they would require in such movement, tanks would require also very highly trained and skilful crews. I could not imagine that we would see a column of these vehicles proceeding along the road with yellow signs fore and aft indicating that they were being driven by learners. Driving these tanks is no job for learners. I have driven these vehicles in circumstances in which there was no room for amateurs. One must be a highly skilled member of a crew to do anything with them. I am sure every one in this House realizes that in addition to possessing the tanks we require highly skilled personnel to handle them. I do not put this forward as criticism of the Minister or his department. I expect that the Minister will have answers to these It is no use the Government saying that enemies.

We would criticism of himself or his department, to be wise to take his words to heart on this give us some further information on this occasion because they are as vital to us aspect.

Let me remind honourable members that in the two major wars in which we have been involved in this country we had some one to stand between us and our enemies while we prepared to do our fighting. Can any one in this place give any guarantee that that will happen a third time? There is no such guarantee in the wide world. We want the assurance that this country can stand on its own feet and that if it is threatened it can put up a reasonably good defence system of its own. To-day, as years ago, we have the man-power capable of defending this country if it is given a reasonable deal in the matter of equipment and training. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr world have in this task of raising production. Gray) has been speaking about a very important subject-defence . He has reminded us that we are facing a threat of war. We are constantly reminded of the danger of Communist imperialism, as evidenced by open warfare, by subversion or by the more insidious form of destroying civil liberties. No amount of propaganda will remove this threat from Australia; no amount of voluntary curtailment of our civil liberties will prevent subversion, and no amount of military preparedness will protect us. The only real way in which we can meet this menace of imperialist communism is by cutting the tap-root of the Communist system. We shall not meet it by building up defence forces, by building up a great store of rockets or war machines of one kind or another, by having a much more effective security service than we now have, by any amount of propaganda or by any number of agreements that we sign with other countries. As I have said, we can defeat this great menace only by cutting its tap-root, destroying it and removing it from Within the last few days Mr Khrushchev pointed to this matter of production as culture. He saidWe sharply criticize the present state of agriculture. In the shortest possible time it must double or treble its output of the most important products . . . This is demanded by life itself; this is in the interests of building communism. Now comes the punch line. Mr Khrushchev is reported as having said that the party's task was the creation of abundance. Once Russia and its allies overtook the most advanced capitalist countries nothing would stop the victorious march of Communist ideals. That is precisely the way by which we shall overcome and remove this threat to world peace and world security-by outproducing the Communists. We should look now to the handicaps which we in the free We have two prime handicaps. One is the hangover from the bad old days of extreme nationalism which is preventing trade from flowing evenly through the world and preventing us from using our natural resources to the most effective extent. The other, of course, is the existence of prejudices within industry which limit production. We hear a good deal of those prejudices in debates in this chamber. I want to speak to-night of the most pressing problem of all at the present time, the production of foodstuffs. The great handicap limiting the production of foodstuffs in the world to-day results from the failure of the various producing nations to get together and rationalize the production and distribution of food. It is of vital importance that some sense of order be brought into the production and distribution of foodstuffs. The population of the world is going to double within the next 40 years. That will be within the lifetime of many honourable members of this Parliament. Within the next 40 years we will",102,Adjournment
206,Mr Ian Allan (Gwydir) [11.15],"have three-quarters of the world's population living in the Asian area. The population of that area is now largely undernourished, according to present world standards. It is a population that will demand ample supplies of food. It will demand, next, plenty of the fibres that are needed to make clothing, and, finally, it will demand a plentiful supply of the raw materials that form the basis of industry. Here is our prime task at the present stage, and we must appreciate its vital importance in the present scheme of things. It is primarily by the production of ample quantities of foodstuffs that we are going to destroy communism in the world. We will not do it by building up great defence forces or by any other such means. This is, as Mr Khrushchev has pointed out, the crux of the whole cold war. The French Government has recently State Parliament by ten or twelve seats. The advanced a plan for the rationalization of other was in South Australia, where we have the production of wheat. Wheat is probbeen faced for years with the most blatant ably the most important of all the foodgerrymander in the history of Parliaments, stuffs in the world, and it is the intention and by far the worse political gerrymander of the French Government, and of the existing in the British Commonwealth.

207,Mr Galvin (Kingston) [11.25],"Ihis statement on the radio. He said he had reached a situation in which three avenues were open to him. He said it was unfortunate that the people had not given sufficient votes to either the Labour Party or the Liberal-Country Parties to enable either of them to govern South Australia and to enjoy the confidence of the House. He said that one course open to him was to govern and take a chance on what might happen later. Secondly, he could, as he said most people seemed to suggest-and as I think most fair-minded people in the State would suggest-infor m the Governor of South Australia that the majority of the people disagreed with his policy, explain that Labour had a clear majority in the State, hand in his commission and suggest that the Governor send for Mr Frank Walsh, as the leader of the Australian Labour Party. Then he dealt with what he said was the third avenue open to him. He said, ""You know, there are two Independents elected, and if I were to suggest that Mr Walsh be given a mandate, it would disfranchise these two electorates"". He said that their representatives would not have a chance to decide who should govern the State. There are, as he said, a couple of events that will occur shortly. There is, for instance, a festival of arts to be held soon, which would normally be attended by the Premier, his Ministers and their wives. No doubt great pressure was exerted by many of them in an effort to hang onto their offices until after this festival of arts, so that they could attend important social functions. Therefore, the Parliament must be put off until the festival is finished. What will happen then? Easter follows, of course, and perhaps some time after Easter the Premier will call up a legend for himself as "" honest Tom Parliament together and let the IndepenPlayford"". He is more dishonest politidents decide what should be done. Mr Speaker, whatever may have been has been. It is a sorry state of affairs when the result of the election on 3rd March in the Premier of South Australia refuses to South Australia, when nineteen Labour heed the voice of the people and accept Party candidates were elected, as against their decision as recorded by their vote. eighteen Liberals, it is obvious that in the done during his long term of officeI do electorates which returned the independent not deny that he has done some good for candidates the people made it crystal clear South Australia-histor y will record that he that they rejected Playford and his Liberal not only relied on a gerrymander to defy policy, because the Liberal candidates in the will of the people but also refused to both of those electorates were beaten candidates. It is quite obvious that the electors in Ridley and Burra want nothing to do with Playford and his policy. So this Premier of South Australia, who has for so long denied the people, democracy in that State, is to hang on to office. I do not suggest what he may try to do in the next few days, but at least he intends to hang on to office, accept ministerial salary and carry on. He. should do the honest thing and hand in his commission. Time and time again in this Parliament and elsewhere, Mr Speaker, we condemn the rulers of the Soviet Union, China and Spain and other countries because they will not give their people the right to elect their own government. The people of Asia who aspire to democracy look to Australia as a beacon of democracy. They look to us to set an example, but we now have the Premier of South Australia adopting the principle of guided democracy. Evidently, he proposes to teach Soekarno a lesson. Playford wants to institute guided democracy, and so he tries to cling to office. I have heard members of Parliaments in India, Singapore and other parts of Asia ask questions about this undemocratic State of South Australia, trying to ascertain why the undemocratic situation there is tolerated. What do honourable members think those people will say when they see the example now being set in South Australia? A really Communist policy is being adopted. That policy is: The end justifies the means. What is now happening in South Australia gives the Communists a classic argument to use against our way of life. The South Australian Premier has built cally than any other member of Parliament in this country or any Premier of any State Whatever good Sir Thomas Playford has heed the voice of the people when they gave their decision clearly under the parliamentary system in vogue in this country. The lights of democracy have been flickering for a long time in South Australia, and Tom Playford will snuff them right out if he has his way. His actions, as demonstrated by the statement that he has made to-day, set a poor example to the people of Asia whom we are trying, by means of the Colombo Plan and in other ways, to encourage to adopt our way of life. The South Australian Premier has joined the ranks of the great dictators alongside Khrushchev, Stalin, Franco and Mao Tse-tung. He has joined the dictators who deny their people the right to elect a government of their own choice. By all the rules of fair play, Playford should follow the traditional custom of countries of the British Commonwealth of Nations and hand in his commission when his Government is beaten in an election. He should accept the will of the people. Unfortunately, he chooses to hang on to office at all cost. The people will not tolerate this, Mr Speaker. He has got away with the gerrymander because they have been fairly easy-going, but -Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired. Speaker, honourable members will recall that about eighteen months or two years ago there appeared in the press speculative stories which many people-wit h good foundation, I believe-though t were put about by the honourable member for Kingston( Mr Galvin). He aspired to leave this Parliament and lead the Australian Labour Party in South Australia to victory in a State election. The stories gained great currency. The honourable member, in a television programme, denied them at the time-as , indeed, he had to do. This evening, he has listened eagerly on the radio here in Canberra to Sir Thomas Playford's statement, and he has greeted with fury the news that Sir Thomas does not intend immediately to rush to the Governor of South Australia and resign his commission. I think that this attitude on the part of the honourable member for Kingston will raise anew the speculation which I have mentioned. Obviously, the reason for the honourable member's attitude is that he expects, and no doubt is plotting and planning to get, the call to return to the State sphere in the very near future. He now sees the prospect of this being put off. While I am talking about this subject, Sir, I would like to say something about this curious view of the tradition in parliamentary democracy which has been mentioned this evening by the honourable member for Kingston. Honourable members opposite trot it out whenever the circumstances suit them. Whatever the honourable member may say, under parliamentary democracy based on the British model, which we in this country and the people of most other countries of the Commonwealth of Nations accept, the traditional view is that the party which commands a majority in the Parliament forms a government. Whatever the honourable member for Kingston may do to try to hide this fact behind a smoke screen, until the position is determined the Australian Labour Party does not command a majority of the members in the South Australian Parliament All that Sir Thomas Playford said this evening was that he would let the Parliament decide. In other words, he will call the Parliament together as soon as is practicable, and he will accept the Parliament's decision. If the honourable member for Kingston were a good parliamentarian, he, However, Sir, I did not rise to deal with the trivialities, aspirations and ambitions of the honourable member for Kingston. I rose principally to deal with a subject that was discussed last evening. It has been raised again this evening by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Gray). I think that the House owes a debt to the honourable member for his contribution to the debate on this subject. Unlike the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) and the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant), who discussed this matter last evening, and to whom the House is not indebted for their remarks, the honourable member for Capricornia at least exhibited an absence of heat and a sense of responsibility in his discussion of a matter which is very important to the defence of this country.",104,Adjournment
208,Mr Speaker (Hon. Sir John Mcleay).,,106,Adjournment
209,Mr Forbes (Barker) [11.35],"Mr too, would take that attitude.I do not agree with the point of view that His criticism in relation to the Centurion the honourable member put. I would agree with him if his argument about the Centurion tanks were designed to establish that our roads and bridges are not good enough to enable us to transport them and that the -break of gauge on our railways prevents us from moving them about the country, or that we could more easily move these tanks from point to point if we had better roads and bridges and a better railway system. But that was not the argument honourable members opposite put forward. The argument put forward by the honourable member for Grayndler and the honourable member for Wills last night was that there had been mismanagement and bungling in the approach to our defence policy for the very reason that we had acquired the Centurion tanks at all. As I said, last night, if the matter is to be looked at from that point of view, consideration must be given to how we expect to use our defence forces, and in particular our tanks. After all the tanks are only a support weapon to the infantry arm. The view of the Government, firstly, is that it is not within our capacity to defend ourselves frjom a major threat by our own unaided efforts. That point of view would appear to me to have been challenged by the honourable member for Capricornia tonight. Quite clearly his view is that Australia should build up its defence forces to the point where we will be able, by our own unaided efforts, to defend this country. I should like to know whether that is the official view of the Opposition because if it is, we would be delighted to hear it. We would be delighted to know that gradually the Opposition was coming around to our view, namely that this country must be defended adequately. We would be delighted to know also that the Opposition was prepared to vote sufficient money to achieve adequate defence. I suggest to the honourable member for Capricornia that not one member of the Opposition would be prepared to vote a penny more for defence than the Government is spending at the present moment, let alone approve the astronomical amount that would be required to achieve the state of affairs which he regards as desirable. tanks was based on the assumption that we should be able to defend this country by our own unaided efforts. If the Centurions are used they will not be used on Australian soil but somewhere to the north of Australia where we envisage we may be called upon to defend ourselves. Therefore, they will be transported by sea. The honourable member said that he has had something to do with tanks. No doubt he has been in positions such as I have been in. He knows that even in the thickest jungle country, if by a superhuman effort it is possible to get a heavy tank in front of the infantryman, he values it as he does his life. If we have the means to take even one Centurion tank to the point at which we have to fight a future war, it is well worth having such a tank. That the question be now put. The House divided.

McEwen, J. Question so resolved in the affirmative. Original question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.53 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated:Employment. Mr O'Brien asked the Prime Minister, upon notice1. Has the Government sought to transfer the responsibiUty for employment from itself to local authorities? 2. If so, can he say whether this action by the Government has made it obUgatory for ratepayers to borrow excessively to provide employment, and has caused many local authorities, particularly in Queensland, to become incensed? 3. Is the Government placing on citizens a responsibility for creating employment which it should itself carry? honourable member's questions follows:1. No. Whilst the Commonwealth is itself a substantial employer of labour, it is quite contrary to the Government's views to suggest that the Commonwealth should assume the sole responsibiUty for providing jobs in AustraUa. My Government does, however, accept the responsibility for creating conditions favorable to the achievement of the highest possible level of employment compatible with rapid growth and the maintenance of reasonable stability. 2. See answer to 1. Harrison, E. James 3. No. This is a task for both private enterHayden, W. G. prise and pubUc authorities. It will be apparent James, A. W. from the statement.

A. make further borrowings up to £100,000 within Bird, A. C. the current financial year, subject to the approval of the State government concerned. The local authorities concerned are not, of course, obUged to increase their borrowing by reason of this decision, but it was represented to the Commonwealth that many of them were not only able but wiUing (indeed eager) to do so in order to carry out works within their competence. Local Government Finance. Mr Reynolds asked the Prime Minister, upon notice1. Is he able to say whether severe and generaUy increasing burdens are being placed upon ratepayers by the continuance of the outmoded system of financing local government substantially through levies on property owners? 2. Have the New South Wales Government and the Local Government Association requested the Commonwealth Government to convene a threetier conference of federal, state and local government authorities for the purpose of discussing proposals for a more effective and equitable means of financing local government? 3. If so, has the Government given consideration to this request? 4. Does the Government propose to convene this conference? 5. If not, under what circumstances would it consider doing so? are as able member's questions are as follows:1 to 5. The Premier of New South Wales wrote to me on Sth May, 1961, asking me to make arrangements for such a meeting. The AustraUan CouncU of Local Government Associations and other local government bodies have also asked the Commonwealth to convene a conference of this kind.

213,Mr Menzies,"The answers to the honorState legislation, the Commonwealth's firmly held view is that any action on matters affecting local government finance should originate with State governments. wealth Government believes that the Commonwealth should not sponsor arrangements for a conference of this nature. However, if the State governments should collectively agree to engage in such a conference with local authorities, the Commonwealth would also be willing to participate. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. Mr Malcolm Fraser asked the Minister representing the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, upon notice1. To what extent have the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's discoveries in relation to solvent-degreasing, carbonizing, shrink-proofing, melange printing, combing control and fellmongering been adopted over tbe last ten years in Australia and abroad? 2. Have the organization's Si-Ro-Moth'd, Sironized and Si-Ro-Set process 'been widely and successfully adopted? 3. Have there been production difficulties in the adoption of any of these processes; if so, why? 4. Is Si-Ro-Mark branding fluid now exclusively used by wool-growers; if not, why not? the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization has supplied the following information:1. Solvent degreasing of wool -The only commerthe United Kingdom and the United States of cial unit at present using the solvent degreasing process is that of G. H. Mitchell and Sons Limited, Hindmarsh, South Australia. The plant has a capacity of over 2,500 lb. of wool per hour and is currently treating about 20 per cent, of Australia's total production of wool tops. Production in 1961 was nearly 8,000,000 lb., and about 33,000,000 lb. have been produced since the plant began operation. Other Australian firms are considering adoption of the method. Considerable overseas interest has been shown in the solvent degreasing process. Wool textile firms in the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, the United States of America and Germany have sent representatives to study its operation in Australia. However, installation of plant for solvent degreasing involves a large capital outlay and for this reason the process is likely to be adopted only when new plants are being built or worn-out scouring units are being replaced. Carbonizing -The amount of fibre damage that occurs in the CSIRO. modification of the acid carbonizing process is very much less than that in conventional processes. During subsequent spinning and weaving this shows up in reduced yarn breakage and a better product. The process has, therefore, been most readily accepted by vertically integrated mills in which the wool under goes further processing after carbonizing. Commission carbonizers do not show the same direct advantage from using the process; however, there is some slight increase in yield of wool. Although no exact figures are available it is estimated that the method is used by about half the carbonizers For this reason, the Commonin Australia. It is known to be in use in some foreign mills but no data are available to permit an assessment of the extent of the adoption overseas. Shrinkproofing Treatment -Blankets treated by the CSIRO. shrinkproofing process are now being produced by several Australian mills and are being widely used in hospitals, since they can be sterilized many times by boiling without shrinking, felting, or discolouring. Woollen knitwear treated by this process is being produced by two leading Australian manufacturers and wool in top form is being shrinkproofed by several firms. As a result of a recent visit to the United States of America by one of the officers from the CSIRO. Division of Textile Industry who worked in cooperation with the Wool Bureau Incorporated, several large American knitwear manufacturers are operating the process. Other American firms are to use this method of shrinkproofing for the treatment of woven fabrics. The same CS.1.R.O. officer is now assisting the International Wool Secretariat to extend the using of the process to the United Kingdom and continental Europe. Melange Printing -The modified technique developed by CSIRO. is now the basis of most melange printing in Australia. The process is also being used overseas. Noble Comb Control Unit -The automatic controller for Noble combs has now been manufactured in considerable numbers by an Australian firm. The device is installed in every major worsted mill in Australia and New Zealand. When current orders are fulfilled, 132 units will be operating in Australian mills. A total of 25 controllers has been exported to New Zealand, America. Further units for export are on order. Fellmongering -The CSIRO. process for recovering wool from damaged sheepskins and from sheepskin pieces is being applied very successfully by two Australian fellmongers. There has been some reluctance by other fellmongers to use the process. One reason that has been given is that its adoption requires some expenditure on plant. It appears that there is a good prospect for wider application of the process in the future. As far as is known this process is not used by many overseas fellmongers; however, one firm in Scotland is known to be using the method. 2. Si-Ro-Moth'd Mothproofing Process -This process has been widely adopted in Australia. Seventeen firms are authorized to use the trade mark Si-Ro-Moth'd. About two-thirds of the Australian production of apparel wool is being treated. It is believed that most Australian production of knitwear and blankets and about 90 per cent, of carpet wools are now mothproofed with dieldrin, which is the basis of this process. In overseas countries the trade mark Si-Ro-Moth'd is not used. Treated goods are identified by several different trade marks. There are about 100 textile mills in the United States of America producing woollen goods mothproofed by the process, more than 200,000,000 lb. of wool being treated per annum. In Great Britain, about one-quarter of woollen goods produced are similarly mothproofed. The",108,Answers To Questions
214,Mr Freeth,"The Minister in charge ofprocess is also being used in Europe, Japan, and elsewhere. It has provided an economic answer to the problem of moth attack on wool. Sironized Washable Non-iron Effects -Ten Australian firms are authorized to use the trade mark Sironized. The process was first introduced only two years ago. At present the garments being manufactured are mainly men's shirts, girls' school tunics and boys' knickers. Current production is estimated at about 33,000 garments per annum. The Sironized treatment comprises two operations -shrinkproofin g followed by flat setting. As mentioned in connection with shrinkproofing, an officer of the C.S.r.R.O. Division of Textile Indusnical service facilities and the extension of the try has recently spent six months working with the Wool Bureau Incorporated in the United States of America and is now with the International Wool Secretariat in London. He has assisted overseas manufacturers with the introduction of the Sironized process. The method is that being used in Britain and Holland and it is anticipated that its use will increase as a result of this collaborative extension work. Si-Ro-Set Durable Creases and Pleats -Si-Ro-Set is now established throughout the trade in Australia as a simple, cheap and effective process. Sixty firms are now licensed to produce garments with Si-Ro-Set durable creases, principally women's pleated skirts, men's and women's slacks, men's suit trousers, and schoolwear. Practically all the Australian production of women's pleated wool skirts is now being treated with Si-Ro-Set. There arefirmsin each capital city and at Bendigo, Victoria, operating on a commission basis for the clothing trade and more than 200 clothing manufacturers are handling Si-Ro-Set garments. About 3,500,000 garments have been treated since the process was introduced in 1957 and at present more than 1,250,000 garments are being treated annually. Nearly all Commonwealth and State Government departments and instrumentalities are now using Si-Ro-Set treated garments for their uniformed staff. In America a modified reagent is employed in a Si-Ro-Set type treatment. There are now more than 90 treatment plants in the United States of America and Canada, and there are 130 manufacturers supplying treated garments. Nearly 4,000,000 treated garments are being produced per annum, mainly men's suit trousers, and men's and women's slacks. No recent productionfiguresare available for other countries but electrical power or fuel. An extensive programme the International Wool Secretariat reports that considerable quantities of treated garments are being produced in the United Kingdom, Holland, Germany, Japan, and New Zealand. Smaller quantities are being produced in South Africa and various other countries. In the United Kingdom there are 20-30 firms using the process and 1,6001,700 retailers selling treated garments. 3. There have been no unusual production diffiwould be no point in duplicating in C.S.I.jR.0. culties in the adoption of CSIRO. wool textile experimental work which is already being done on processes in industry. Some problems have arisen a most impressive scale in USA. The approach and have been overcome, but these would not be in CSIRO. is therefore to concentrate on some considered unusual in the application of any sew process in the wool textile industry.

A number of small units to a CSIRO. design. which hitherto had not been required to adopt procedures of this nature. The greatest difficulty arose from lack of technical staff to extend this process into industry and to ensure that recommended procedures were followed. However, the recent addition of technical staff to the Australian Wool Bureau has greatly altered this situation. Similarly, initial difficulties in the use of Sironized treatment have been overcome by the work of the bureau's technical staff, who advise industry as to suitable fabrics and the procedures necessary for making up garments from treated materials. The wool industry has, in the past, lacked these techresults of CSIRO. research should be greatly facilitated as a result of such services becoming available in Australia and overseas. 4. There are fourteen Australian firms licensed to produce Si-Ro-Mark branding fluid and over 125,000 gallons of fluid is being produced per annum. About 95 per cent, of the brands on Australian sheep are Si-Ro-Mark. This fluid is usely exclusively in those States where legislation requires the use of scourable sheep brands. Desalination of Water. Mr Webb asked the Minister representing the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, upon noticeCan he furnish any further information regarding experiments being conducted by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization into the production of fresh water from salt and brackish water? the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization has supplied the following answer:There are a number of processes which can be used to convert salt or brackish water into fresh water. At present, however, all these processes are too expensive for general use. In some cases this is due to the initial cost of the equipment and, in other cases, to the running costs, generally on water desalting is being conducted by the United States Department of the Interior and, in the financial year just completed, over 3,000,000 dollars were spent on this work.
