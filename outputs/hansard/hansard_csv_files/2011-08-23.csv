My first is that the Let me also cite some remarks on this international nature of cybercrime, reflecting topic by US President Obama, speaking on in turn the international nature of the 29 May 2009. He had this to say: internet, makes this kind of international It is the great irony of our information age-the cooperation essential if authorities in any one very technologies that empower us to create and country are to join with authorities in other to build also empower those who would seek to countries to achieve appropriate responses to disrupt and destroy.

I want you could replace the word American with to highlight my concern that focus needs to Australian or indeed the identity of peoples be given to allowing these companies of any country around the world. He said that sufficient time to implement the new tackling the problem of cybercrime was: requirements that will be imposed upon … about the privacy and the economic security of them. Thirdly, I point to some of the nonAmerican families. We rely on the Internet to pay trivial issues of process, fairness and equity our bills, to bank, to shop, to file our taxes. But of approach which have been highlighted in we've had to learn a whole new vocabulary just to the very good report of the Joint Select stay ahead of the cyber criminals who would do Committee on Cyber-Safety. My view is that us harm-spyware and malware and spoofing and we need to see a response from the phishing and botnets. Millions of Americans have been victimized, their privacy violated, their government on some of these issues. identities stolen, their lives upended, and their Let me turn firstly, therefore, to make the wallets emptied. According to one survey, in the point that there is a growing and past two years alone cyber crime has cost international threat from cybercrime. I quote Americans more than $8 billion. I repeat the point that similar remarks could first international treaty which addresses be made about the peoples of any nation crimes committed either against or via including Australia with perhaps some computer networks and it deals particularly appropriate scaling down of that particular with online fraud, with offences related to figure that he quoted. The fundamental point child pornography and with the unauthorised is that cybercrime is international in nature. access, use or modification of data stored on We have known for more than 15 years that computers.

I I want to briefly turn to the second point I might add that the long promised internet want to highlight this evening which is that filter from Minister Conroy is not a practical the impact of this legislation on or workable solution, as he appears to have telecommunications carriers and internet in practice conceded by hastening extremely service providers is significant. Drawing on slowly with that particular policy. my previous experience I can observe that We know that criminal gangs in many the task of compliance with legal and parts of the world, Russia and many other regulatory obligations is a substantial one for countries, target consumers all around the carriers and internet service providers. It world including in Australia. We know that occupies a substantial amount of time and fraudulent activities over the internet emerge resources.

The other key point to Nigeria either. The central point is that make is that when the regime changes and international fraudulent and criminal activity the legal obligations applying to carriers and over the internet is occurring in many internet service providers change there is a different countries. Accordingly, if we are to significant lead time in those companies find solutions to these problems, there must changing their compliance arrangements.

Mr Stephen Smith: The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Yes. Defence is examining pelvic and groin protection equipment as part of a broad program responsible for the development and delivery of a new soldier combat ensemble that includes body armour, load carriage systems and personal protection equipment. The Modular Combat Body Armour System issued to some personnel deployed to the Middle East, Timor Leste and Solomon Island areas of operations includes an add-on groin protection apron. This can be worn when required and on the direction of in-theatre commanders With the roll out of the Tiered Body Armour System, other options to improve pelvic and groin protection are being acquired and further investigated. Defence has begun a trial of a tiered pelvic protection system currently used by the British Army in Afghanistan. The first tier is a light weight garment that is worn as protective underwear. It is designed to help protect the groin areas from the fine dirt and shrapnel particles that result from explosions. Personnel in Afghanistan will be issued with this protective underwear by November this year. Sufficient stocks are being procured to issue to the next rotation of troops occurring in early 2012. The second tier is a heavier and more rigid ballistic groin protection system worn on the outside of the combat uniform and is designed to provide increased protection against larger shrapnel fragments. It can be worn together with the protective underwear or separately. A small number have been purchased and will be provided to Mentoring Task Force Three this month as part of a trial to obtain user feedback on the performance and ability to integrate with the current soldier combat ensemble. Based on results of the trial, a wider acquisition of pelvic protection systems is likely to be conducted .",135,Notices Ensure That Local Needs Are Being Met And
