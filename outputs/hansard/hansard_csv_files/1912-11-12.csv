13,' Mr Joseph Cook,"Is, not the MinQueensland and Western Australian redistribution schemes were referred back to the Commissioners, the Chief Electoral Officer attended to the matter at once, and I have no doubt he has done the same in this instance. Electoral Act provides that the Minister may direct the Commissioners to propose a fresh distribution; and, as I understand the Department cannot act until authorized by the Minister, and time is important, will the honourable gentleman give instructions at once to have the report referred back to the Commissioners? trouble about the matter. The Chief Electoral _ Officer attended to the other States divisions immediately. up the Chief Electoral Officer, and he tells me that he can do nothing without the authorization of the Minister. about the matter. Home Affairs, inform the House as to what has been done by the Department to cope with the outbreak of typhoid at Port Augusta? able member informed me that he would ask the question, and I have thereforeobtained the following memorandum from the Engineer-in-Chief:There are eleven cases of typhoid among our employees and persons relating to these employees. One of the employee's daughters, aged nineteen, died this morning. Whole of cases are at hospital. Doctor cannot definitely state cause of outbreak. Two fresh cases occurred yesterday, not amongst our employees. Health officer here intends prosecuting local butchers for insanitary condition of premises. Two butchers last week at Quorn fined £ 2 1 each. analysis of water as soon as received. We have forwarded supplies of tents, and everything that could be done has been ordered to be done.

32,Mr Thomas,"The answers to the2. Before the transfer of the Teiritory it was practicable for South Australia to make an interchange between officers employed in the Northern Territory and those employed in similar positions in the Southern State, but such would not be possible in the Commonwealth, which has no similar service to which transfers could be made. For example, officers engaged in the Mines, Railways, Agricultural, Stock, Lands, Education or Police Departments, could not have similar positions found for them in the Commonwealth Service anywhere else in Australia. External Affairs, upon notice1. Is he aware that the following circular has been issued to the railway employees of Northern Territory :"" Northern Territory RailwaysTraffic Superintendent's Office. Darwin, 14th August, 1912. Free Carriage of Domestic Supplies for Employes. Circulars regarding domestic supplies, dated 8 / 9 / n and 10/6/12, are hereby cancelled, and all concerned are notiis more important that, in times of peace, fied that the concession has been abolished in accordance with the Administrator's orders. H . V. FRANCES, Superintendent, per C.V.""? 2. Is he aware that the State Railways provide free carriage of domestic supplies for its workers ? 3. Considering the tropical conditions not sufused for war purposes and the destruction fered by those in the more favoured States, will he take into consideration the desirability of reverting to the old system? Q honourable member's questions are :1. Yes. 2. Yes, on conditions. 3. Although the practice operates unfairly in favour of railway employees as compared with employee's in other branches of the Government Seiviee, the concession would probably not have been withdrawn were it not for the fact that it was abused. One of the conditions was that no alcoholic stimulants should be included in the packages of domestic supplies carried free, but this condition was not observed. breaches of this rule led to the Administrator directing the issue of the circular of the 14th August. the Prime Minister been directed to the following cablegram which appeared in yesdated 24th September, 1911, stated that the terday's AgeThe newspapers state that Germans are making inquiries at Cardiff with a view of placing a limitless order for coal to be given immediate delivery in the Mediterranean. said, must be offered to carry the coal for one, two, or three months at the option of the charterers. I know that the merchants and ship-owners of Great Britain are careless of the position in which they place the Empire', but, in my innocence able member is now travelling beyond the limits of the question. Minister think that this coal might be used against the Empire, and, if so, will he draw the attention of the Imperial authorities to the matter ? orable member's question I doubt whether the King's Ministers would thank us if we were to advise them how to manage their own local affairs. It is, of course, unfortunate that, as a matter of business, the products of one country may be used in time of war against that country, but it civilization should proceed on the undeP standing that people are conducting their businesses in a human way rather than on the assumption that merchandise will be of members of the human race. honourable member for Melbourne asked me the following questions, upon notice1.

39,", Mr Thomas","A few days ago thebut it is otherwise in Papua, where "" ing, might change the balance of population in a few weeks, ( i ) In a more settled country, adequate representation may be obtained by counting the individuals; in a country like Papua one must not only count the individuals, but also reckon the interests involved, and, not only this, but also the interests that may be involved later on. be secured by nomination-no t by election. sentation of interests sounds undemocratic, but the truth is that one cannot always apply democratic principles to a country like Papua, where the conditions are so different from those obtaining in the countries in which these principles were evolved. For instance, the principles of Democil, and the Leader of the Opposition in the cracy would demand that the Papuan native should have a vote-a t any rate, those who pay taxes-ye t the sturdiest Democrat in Papua would never dream of acceding to such a demand. (c) A large proportion of our revenue consists of money granted by the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth is entitled to nominate the members who are to deal with the appropriation of this money.. (d) The native population outnumbered the Europeans in Papua by two or three hundred to one, and the only way in which it can be represented is by a system of nomination. aware that there are few, if any, Europeans in Papua who would countenance the ill-treatment of natives, but I cannot think that an election would ever be conducted on lines of native policy, or that purely native questions would arouse much enthusiasm in the breast of the average voter. which, to the Government, is the most important of all, would be of little or no importance to most of the elecserved in the form of statuary, I desire tors. It would be a great assistance to have members, upon whose sympathetic assistance we could rely in the discussion of these matters, which we consider of so much moment, and this can be best secured by nomination. -By way of personal explanation, I may state that I was, at one time, in favour of elected members, but on consideration have altered my views. sentation should be granted, but it is thought that the time has not yet come. 3. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council considered a suggestion of the expenditure of £30,000 on Woodlark Island for the purpose of constructing a tramway, and after referring it for an expression of opinion of the residents of the island, which was unfavorably reported, that, in the opinion of the Council, there was not sufficient justification for the expenditure of so large a sum of money as that suggested on work for Woodlark Island. 4. 25th March, 1912. fresh development, especially in minAUSTRALIANS.

I notice that several increases are provided on these Estimates. that they are not justified, because I think that if there is one Department in the Commonwealth that certainly has to keep going, and that depends largely upon the ability 'of its officers, it is the Attorney General's Department. I Believe that the officers are working, during the sittings of Parliament, under a pretty severe strain. Some of the increases seem to be fair; considering the amount of work that falls to the lot of the omcers affected, and the special expert skill that is: required from them. Indeed, some of the salaries are low when one takes into account the quality of the service required. I need not specify instances. The Committee is, however, entitled to know whether there is any principle of regulating these increases, or any standard up to which offigiving the public, and the cers can work. There appear to be increases every year in some cases. Is there any standard which, when reached, will be regarded as indicating the normal salary attached to the services of an officer? Every year there seems, to be an in-crease beyond the amount prescribed by the Public Service Act. There is no doubt a large amount of work to be done, I believe that a Bankruptcy Bill and there was particularly a heavy strain during the past year. I suppose that the The Department business of the Department is likely to expand rather than to remain stationary. Perhaps also the Attorney-General can tell us whether the Crown Solicitor's visit to the United States and Great Britain was one of inquiry as to what was. being done in relation to trust administration and control ? Was he instructed to make any investigations generally in industrial matters, chiefly in connection with combines and trusts in restraint of trade?

73,Mr Glynn,"at the time tlie Australian Industries Preservation Act of 1906 was being debated that the sections were ultra vires, so that it was no surprise to those conversant with the matter to find that the High Court had declared that our power over corporations did not extend to their State as well as to their Inter-State operations, and. that the scope of our powers was held to be confined, as is the case in connection with ordiformulated as the direct result of a joint nary individuals, to Inter-State operations. I understand that the Crown Solicitor went to the United States to make inquiries on this subject amongst others. States? General can tell us. I think that, at any rate, he went as far as Canada. He left here with that object. But we should like to know what the scope of his mission was. What was he directed to inquire into? I can understand that a good deal of useful information might be obtained in the United States and Canada. For instance, in the year 1910 a Canadian Investigation Act was passed, supplementing Acts similar to our Australian Industries Preservation Act. The Canadian Investigation Act enables special Boards to be appointed to inquire into the operation of alleged combines. They thoroughly investigate the operations, and report to the Attorney General. I do not want to go into details as to their operations, but I may say that the experience of their working has been, according to reports to the Canadian Government, to show that these investigations were much more efficacious than penal legislation in controlling, and in some cases disto England, I should like to say that the solving, combines. There have also 'been Commissions in America. There was one especially in connection with the Steel Trust, presided over by a Judge, and recommendations for a new method of control formed part of the report of the Commission. There are several other suggestions to which I need not at present refer; but I think that if any information has been obtained by the Attorney-General's Department, the result of Mr Powers' mission, and the extent to which he carried it out, should be explained to the Committee. General) [3.40] -The honourable member for Angas* has asked a question with reference to the Bankruptcy Bill. No doubt that Bill is a very important one. It can, [193]2 in no sense of the word, however, be termed a party measure. I should be very glad to see it pass this Chamber during the present session; but the convenience of the House is to be consulted, and while the Government 1 will do everything in its power to facilitate its passage, its proper discussion must be permitted. As the honourable member knows very well, this measure has been and several effort by a number of persons of standing ancl reputation in this branch of the law, and this Government claims no more credit for its formulation than have former Governments. I have simply brought it up-to-date, and, as presented to the House, I hope that it represents the hest that can be done .at present in regard to bankruptcy. I trust that the honourable member will not do more in the direction he has indicated after what I have said. We shall not insist upon passing the Bill through the House this session. The House will have the opportunity, and if time is available, we ought to go on with it j if not, we ought not to do so, because it is a very important matter. I come now to the honourable member's inquiries in relation to the Department generally. Its business is, with the development of the country, growing very rapidly. That, of course, involves more work, and demands a larger staff. I do not think it is too much to say that the office at present is understaffed-that with fresh avenues of activity opening on every side, and involving litigation, inquiry, and supervision, it necessarily follows that there is a great deal of work to be done. In regard to the Crown Solicitor and his trip business for which he went there primarily was in connection with prosecutions conducted, in the first place, by the Crown in the Commonwealth, and further contemplated prosecutions that may affect the same matter in England. He did not go upon a Commission of Inquiry; but it was the intention of the Government to ask him to go to Canada and America and to inquire .and report upon matters which are of interest to this Department and the country generally. Owing, however, to the date for the hearing of the Vend case being unexpectedly set forward, the Crown Solicitor returned direct, and did not visit either Canada or America. These Estimates provide for only two increases other than those provided by the Commissioner. One is for the Crown",20,Attorney General

76,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"AttorneySolicitor, and the other is for the Chief Clerk and Assistant Parliamentary Draftsman. As to the Crown Solicitor, his duties have enormously increased since his appointment. For example, when he was appointed, there was a staff of one. There is now a regular staff of seventeen, and, including temporary hands, a total of twenty-four. That is insufficient, and will have to be supplemented shortly. There is now a control of agencies in all States, and supervision of all work done. The taking over of the Northern Territory and the Federal Territory have added very much to the work of the Department. As honourable members know very well, there has been much litigation in which the Commonwealth has been interested, involving, particularly in connection with the Vend case, a truly enormous volume of work. Honourable members may realize, by the length of the hearing of the case in the Court below, the extent of the work involved in its preparation. No man could have given more attention to the case, or served the Crown more faithfully, than did Mr sonally, I do not care to discuss these matPowers orable gentleman. he acted singularly at all, because in every action in which the Crown is interested die is always most painstaking, accurate, and in every way efficient. I think the Commonwealth is very fortunate in having a Crown Solicitor of his standing and ability. There is a very great deal of work -connected with every acquisition of land by the Commonwealth. When territories are taken over, there are questions of title and compensation to be decided, and there has to be a scrutiny of settlements. Then there is the defence of all actions in which the Commonwealth is involved; and the -preparation of contracts, leases, and so forth. The Crown Solicitor is receiving at present £r,ooo per annum. That is a lower salary than any Crown Solicitor in Australia is receiving. The Crown Solicitor of New South Wales receives ,£1,650 per annum, and in that State there is also a solicitor to the Railgaged in the Arbitration Court. Beyond way Department. I think that the salary we now propose to pay him-£1,25 0 per annum-is a very meagre recognition-and I say this advisedly-of his work. orable member. that, owing to Mr Powers' action alone, quite appreciated the question which was the country has been saved in one particular case £20,000. As the result of his successful conduct of the motor prosecution, fines to the extent of £20,000 have been received by the Government. Then, again, with regard to the Post Office claims at Perth, we saved £70,000 less than the claim. In the circumstances, therefore, I think the salary is only what is fair and reasonable. As to Mr Castles, the Chief Clerk and Parliamentary Draftsman, he is, as honourable members who have had the good fortune to come in contact with him know, a most able, accurate, and painstaking officer. He is a barrister and solicitora professional man of good standing and long service. He has a most intimate knowledge of South Australian law, which, now that we have taken over the Northern Territory, is of the greatest possible benefit to the Department. I am sure that the honourable member for Angas realizes that. ters. tralian laws are now running in the Northern Territory, it seems to me that we should have in the Department a man of Mr Castles' type. We are proposing to give him an increase of £ 5 0 so that he will receive a salary of £ 6 5 0 a year. Mr Stewart, the Clerk of the Arbitration Court, receives the same salary, and it is smaller than that received by the Assistant Secretary to the Treasury. It is a much smaller salary than the men who are doing corresponding work for the States get. He is an efficient draftsman, and a capable man all round. In regard to the other items of note in these Estimates, there are no other increases except those which the Public Service Commissioner has given agreements, in the ordinary way under the Act. But we have taken on a typist in the Secretary's office. In the office of the Crown Solicitor, in Sydney, there are a 5th class clerk and a 3rd class clerk. In the high Court there is a chief clerk in the place of Mr Stewart, who is now exclusively enthat there are no alterations-n o additions to the staff, and no increases in salary.

I asked for the information on this. occasion, but it has not yet been .given to me. When I get it I shall make it available to honourable members. Thirty or forty inquiries have been made regarding alleged trusts and combines, but, except -in three or four cases, the latter have been confined to one State, or, for some other reason, are not under the control of the Commonwealth. It is, of course, necessary for the Department to obtain some information as a starting point for its investigations, and this information is not to be obtained readily. We are at a great disadvantage in this respect, but we have a. large amount of information regarding trusts and combines, some of which I shall make public to-morrow. mation asked for by the honourable member for Maribyrnong was read out by the Attorney-General. I , myself, with a view to sending it to the Old Country, asked for a -return to be made during the recess, showing the operations of the Arbitration Court, and, if I recollect aright, a letter was sent to me indicating the position up to the 31st December last. An annual return would be a good thing, and would remove misapprehensions as to the work of the Court. Such returns would have to be examined very carefully, to justly weigh the work of the Court. According to the information supplied to me, only nineteen cases were heard between the 15th December, 1904, when the Act came into force, and the 31st December, 1911, and only nine awards were made. Some of the awards,, however, such as the Shearers' award, resulted from a hearing, extending over sixty-four days, and the Tramway dispute occupied a still longer time.' ments have been drawn up. dealt with piece-meal. needed for the investigation of the complex relations of employers and employees throughout. the Commonwealth. At the present time it is beyond the power even of the President to do ample justice in every case, because men are summoned long distances to take part in proceedings in which there are, perhaps, as: many as 200 respondents, and in which their interest is very small. In a certain, shipping case, one man, who owned only two vessels of 15 or 16 tons burden , was summoned from 1 Adelaide to Sydney to take part in a dispute in which other respondents were men controlling vessels of 6,000 and 7,000 tons register. I do not in the least wish todiscount the excellent work done by the Arbitration Court, or to minimize the care and patience displayed in its investigations. While only nine awards were made, over 100 industrial agreements were arrived at in 1911. During the first year, only four industrial agreements were made, though of late years there has been a great increase in the number. But, in this matter, close analysis is necessary to get at the facts. Sometimes as many as fifteen or twenty agreements, are made in connection with the settlement of one claim. In the Engine-drivers.' case, agreements were made separately in Melbourne, Sydney, and Broken Hill, as if between different partiesthe Tramways case. be very helpful to honourable members in informing them of the work of the Court, and in guiding them to an estimate of the value of the results of our legislation. I wish to add that I have not suggested that the Attorney-General should go on with the Bankruptcy Bill.

Some time ago, I drew attention to the work done for the ""Commonwealth by the jProthonotary of the Supreme Court of ""Victoria, without fee or reward. On that occasion, the Minister Great care is of External Affairs promised to bring the matter under the notice of the Attorney General.

I do not think anybody will deny that that work has been efficiently done. O'Halloran does his work very well indeed. do the Justices of the High Court. The Victorian Government have since reconsidered the matter, and have allowed Mr which are rendered to the Commonwealth. O'Halloran to receive some reward from the Commonwealth for the work which he performs. But the remuneration which is paid by the Commonwealth represents little more than one-half of what the Prothonotary could obtain from outside firms for this particular work. it. £150 was offered by a firm of law Stationers for doing the same work. The Commonwealth ought not to be less liberal than is a private firm, especially as Mr The work performed by our Registrars is O'Halloran has not been remunerated for the work which he has performed on previous occasions. which makes his case a particularly hard one. I feel sure that the Attorney-General has no wish to utilize any man's services and abilities for less than their market value. As the officer did the work in question in his own time, and not in that of the State of Victoria, I hope that the Attorney General will recognise that he has a just claim to more liberal treatment. I would like the Attorney-General to tell us whether the sums which Parliament votes to the Registrars of the High Court in the different States ever reach their intended destination? Of course, the States must fix the salaries of their own officers, and when the Commonwealth asks those officers to discharge extra duties on its behalf, the States have necessarily to say whether or not they will grant' them increases. If a State officer who is in receipt of a fixed salary of £500 a year, performs additional duties for the Commonwealth-the Commonwealth paying the State for the services which he renders it -it is only fair that he should receive an increment. those services in his own time. was brought under the attention of the ComLater, his sermittee last year by the honourable member for Coolgardie, and, on that occasion, I mentioned the position taken up by Queensland in this connection.

It is important administrative work, and I think it is It is this circumstance highly desirable that representations on this matter should be made to the States. General) [4.22] -In regard to the representations of the honourable member for Coolgardie and the honourable member for Darling Downs, the position taken up by the Commonwealth is that we pay for all services rendered to the Commonwealth. But we have no means of catching hold of a State servant, and saying to him, "" We are going to pay you for the work which you do for us."" We have to pay the State which employs him, ancl the State sticks to the money. I agree with the honourable member for Darling Downs that that is not a fair course to adopt. But I see no way by which we can prevent it. We cannot ask Mr O'Halloran to leave the employment of the State. We pay £100 a year for the special service which' he renders to the Commonwealth. As to the advisableness of making representations to the States, we have already done that on many occasions, and, generally speaking, our efforts have been resultless. I agree with the honourable member for Darling Downs that, if a State officer, who renders service to the Commonwealth, for which the State is paid, does not receive the benefit of the money thus voted, he is being cheated.",25,Attorney General

That gentleman has rendered the Commonwealth very valuable service, and for the Victorian Government to refuse to allow him to of this Parliament is absolutely wrong. But surely the Attorney-General's Department can devise some way of adequately remunerating this officer for the work which he has performed already, and for the services which he will be called upon to render the Commonwealth in the future. I recollect the occasion on which there was an appeal to the High Court in connection with the result of the Riverina election. For three weeks, Mr O'Halloran had full charge, under the direction of the Court, of the scrutiny, recount, inspection of documents, & c , and very often he was engaged in his labours until n o'clock at night. In the most painstaking manner, he so arranged matters that they could be presented to the Court in a very expeditious fashion. I have always felt that such an officer should be adequately rewarded for the services which he renders. The amount on the Estimates does not represent anything like an adequate reward in this connection. On the occasion to which I have referred, all the litigants held him in the highest esteem for the admirable way in which he discharged his duties. I ask the Attorney-General to see if it is not possible to make some provision whereby effect may be given to the intention of this Parliament by insuring that the money voted by it shall find its way into the pockets of its rightful recipient, and not into the coffers of the State. would apply the same principle to every officer whose services are utilized in the same way? State officer renders valuable service to the Commonwealth in his own time, he should receive whatever remuneration this Parliament in its wisdom may see fit to grant him from time to time. can do. I have already made inquiry into value of the man's services to us. this particular case, and will make further inquiry into it. any State should wish to deprive a valuable ferent matter altogether. The services of officer of the remuneration to which he is the prothonotary of a Supreme Court are justly entitled. Mr O'Halloran did not constant, and on his regular duties as a render service to the Commonwealth in the hours which properly belonged to the Victorian Government as his employer. He gave many hours of his own time to the discharge of his duties to the Commonwealth, and thus saved litigants a great deal of expenditure by shortening the propersonally benefit by any vote ceedings. Surely the Attorney-General and the Department are not so barren of resources as not to be able to prevent the intention of this Parliament being frustrated by the action of a State Government? I trust that some method will be found to adequately remunerate this officer for services for which he has practically received no payment. nise the difficulty is one not' easy to surmount, unless some arrangement is come to with the States under the Public Service Act. Every time a particular work is done by a State officer, we cannot give him so much money. It is impossible to tell to what extent the work has been done during his time of service as a State officer, or to what extent the Commonwealth work may have diminished his vitality for the performance of the State work. I dislike mentioning names, particularly in connection with this Department, because otherwise we do not know where we shall end in considering the Estimates. I recognise the valuable work done by Mr O'Halloran, who, from what I have heard, has not been adequately remunerated for the special duties he has performed. Speaking generally, complaint has been made from time to time that certain State officers have not received the special fees or allowances paid by the Commonwealth to the States; but we cannot very well interfere in the internal discipline and management of State Departments. The Public Service Act, by section 36, enables us to arrange with a State for the performance of any work or services by a State officer; and I suggest that, if the work be fairly constant, we ought to arrange with the State as to what is, the annual value of that work. determine what shall be paid to the State. the majority of cases, we pay the adequate",26,Attorney General

One reason why some of the States have declined to allow the payment to be made to the officer direct, is that previously special grants have been made for services outside the ordinary State work. For instance, in South Australia, officers in the Postal Department were called upon to do certain work for the Savings Bank, and for those services they were paid directly by the Bank.. This was discontinued under the Commonwealth regime, though before Federation, it had practically been discontinued in a good many offices. In the District or Local Courts of South Australia, certain officersreceived additional payment for work inconnexion with.the registration of licences, births, deaths, and marriages, and soforth; and in some instances these payments constituted the bulk of their annual? salary. That system was discontinued,, and a specific salary paid to cover all services ; and it may be that, because of this,, I special payment by the Commonwealth isobjected to.

220,Mr Riley (South Sydney) [5.17],"an arrangement for Mr Justice Higgins tosit continuously in the Court, or, perhaps, appoint another Judge to deal with arbitration matters, and assist him? This is a very important branch of the Commonwealth Service. If the wheels of industry are in any way stopped through parties not getting opportunities to go to the Arbitration Court, it will mean a very serious loss to manufacturers and commercial men. The Arbitration Court is a very important one; and if we can facilitate its operations by allowing cases to get a quicker hearing it will, I feel sure,give the greatest satisfaction to the parties concerned therein. The Postal employees have had to'apply to the Court, and the hearing of their case was almost completed when the Judge was taken to another State, and the case was, consequently, postponed until after Christmas. That is not fair treatment. Will the Attorney-General see if it is not possible to allow the work of the Court to proceed without interruption, or, if he cannot do that, will the Government consider the advisability of appointing another Judge to the High Court Bench, so as to allow the work to be pushed forward as quickly as possible? The honourable member for South Sydney has opened up a line of argument which 1 had intended to raise. There is a considerable amount of dissatisfaction in the country in regard to the present methods of work in connection with the Arbitration Court. No part of our work is attracting more world-wide attention than is our endeavour to settle disputes, and arrange our industrial machinery by means of conciliation and arbitration. In all parts of the world, people are investigating and inquiring as to how our judicial machinery to settle industrial disputes is working. To my mind, the Arbitration Court has utterly failed to meet the situation. The long, dreary intervals, the lengthened procedure which is necessary, the difficulty of getting a hearing, the considerable delays which are occurring in getting access to the Court are far from encouraging the settling of industrial disputes. lieves that conciliation and arbitration are reasonable and Christian-like methods of settling disputes, particularly those relating to the every-day life of the community, I contend that there should be the easiest possible access to this Court, and without the slightest delay in any direction. That Mr Justice Higgins, or some other . Judge, Justice Higgins has been able to do. so much is, I think, a tribute to his energy and ability. I very much deplore the sometimes far from complimentary personal references which are madt to him and to his decisions. Honourable members in this Chamber, and some officials high in the Government service outside, have not thought it beneath their dignity to cast reflections upon his decisions, altogether overlooking the fact that Mr Justice O'Connor gave, in. my opinion, much stronger decisions in favour of the workers than Mr Justice Higgins has ever done. If these two Judges found it necessary, in the process of administering the law, to insist upon better conditions for the workers, it is no reflection upon them, but a direct reflection on the administration in the past for the honourable member to enter upon a defence of a Judge in this way, and so invite a reply from an honourable member who may happen to hold a different opinion? I think it is to be regretted that the honourable member should bring up these personal considerations. No attack has been made upon Mr Justice Higgins that I am aware of, and, therefore, no defence from the honourable member is needed. I think that His Honour would not thank the honourable member for entering upon a defence of him in Parliament. It is a well-knownrule of the House that we may not criticise a Judge except on a specific motion; and, if we may not criticise a Judge in an adverse sense, by implication, therefore, the honourable member may not enter upon a defence of Mr Justice Higgins when no attack has been made. member for Brisbane is not, in my opinion, in order in discussing .a Judge at all, either favourably or otherwise, except on a specific motion; and I was about to call him to order when the honourable member for Parramatta intervened. the methods of access to the Arbitration Court are not what they ought to be. The delays in getting to the Court are altoAs one who begether unreasonable.

232,Mr Finlayson,"I admit that that the Court, and see that the cost of the proceedings there is not in the nature of a tax. would. There are some excellent men remarks of the honourable member for Brisbane furnish considerable thought. The procedure of the Arbitration Court was to have been freed from all legal technicalities, their introduction being expressly prohibited by law; but the honourable member is right in saying that, notwithstanding, every case bristles with technicalities. Owing to the fact that the cases are largely handled, not by legal experts, but by laymen, the agents of the unions and of the employers, proceedings are dragged out, and expense is enormously increased. I have heard the right to ask a particular form of question vetoed on the ground that the question desired to be asked was in its nature one that should be asked during cross-examination. What the Court should aim at is the discovery of the merits of the dispute, so that absolute justice may be done; but when you adopt the laws of evidence as affecting examination, cross examination, re-examination, and the like, ard require ordinary laymen to deal with cases, delay is sure to occur. Whati t means in the case of a uniori is often that, instead of a trained lawyer being employed for one day at,j say, twenty guineas, some one like Comrade Sutch is employed for fifty days atfiveor ten guineas a day. The present system encourages untrained, inefficient men to go into the Court, to the wasting of its time, the lengthening of proceedings, and the increasing of expense. Under the law, paid a glints are debarred from appearing in the Court, but it will be generally admitted that, as a matter of fact, they do appear. Consequently, the unions are not saved -either the expense of lawyers or the expense -of the untrained, inefficient semi-lawyers Who appear for them. This fact is worthy -of the attention of honourable members on both sides, because it should be our desire to protect the funds of the unions from the consequences of misfortunes of this kindI shall not say abuses, because this may not be intentional. To deal directly with the proposal of the will be only too Happy to conduct cases honourable member for Brisbane, which we for them, without charging expenses such are called on to face on the spur of the as Comrade Sutch"" charged. moment, I ask first, what check would there be on litigation if these were to be no fession think of that? penalties for losing. work. am'ong the union secretaries, and some others with a little more human nature food for in their composition than ordinary mortals possess. Such secretaries, knowing that their unions would have nothing to pay, would be ready to show their ardour and business capacity by bringing questions before the Court under every pretext, and on every occasion, with the result that the Court would be glutted with business, and bond fide disputes, which should be heard without delay, would have to await settlement for long periods. ber has a poor opinion of the capacity of the President if he thinks that he could not deal with frivolous cases. him to say at first whether cases were frivolous.

I mention this to illustrate the fact that, with the best will in the world, a Court cannot safeguard the interests of employees against, let us say, the inefficient manager of the affairs of a union. I join the honourable member for Brisbane in urging that steps be taken to reduce the expense of procedure in the Arbitration Court. The best way to facilitate the hearing of cases is to make the practice of the Court easy, so that a man who is without legal training may be able to conduct business before it.

Under the present system, we have neither the certainty which comes from the conduct of proceeding's by trained men, nor the common-sense procedure which can be conducted by ordinary laymen. does not make for industrial peace. tem makes for the stirring up of disputes in the industrial world, and that the toilers, and public generally, are beginning to realize this. It is a good thing for the community that these facts are becoming widely known throughout Australia. agree that there is need for more expedition in the procedure of the Arbitration Court, although I admit that the Court has done excellent work. There have been no complaints from industrial organizations regarding its work. At the present time, however, it is hardly capable of performing all that it has to do. That is the position to which the honourable member for South Sydney desires to draw attention, with a view to preventing delays, if possible. Nothing will more quickly sap the confidence of both employees and employers in this Court than the occurrence of vexatious delays. Unless there is very good cause for adjournments, I think that when a case is commenced, it should be gone straight on with until finished. A case should not be heard for a few days, then adjourned for two or three months, heard a little further, and again adjourned. That is the sort of procedure that was condemned in New South Wales under the State Act, and will be condemned if it takes place under the Commonwealth Act. There have been delays recently in the Commonwealth Court, and they are responsible for this discussion. I wish our arbitration laws to have a fair trial; and I am not disappointed with the result up to the present time, but I acknowledge the need for simplification of procedure. Expense often arises because of the difficulty of applying to the Court. A layman knows more about the industry in which he is concerned than a lawyer can know, and is better able, in many cases, to. present to the Court a case in which it is affected. But the forms of application are often such as to make it difficult for the layman to rightly approach the Court. In the conduct of cases, the experienced layman who has been selected for the work can facilitate the hearing better than a legal man. Notwithstanding what has been said by the honourable member for Wentworth, my experience is that cases do not last as long when conducted by laymen as when conducted by lawyers. A lawyer has to learn the terms and technicalities of the industry with which the case is connected. This occupies a considerable length of time; and yet, in the presentation of a case, mistakes are often made by lawyers for want of technical knowledge. The trained layman, however, will present his case without making such mistakes. He knows the points which it is desired to present to the Court, and' he can put them as concisely as possible, with the result that the hearing is more expeditious than it would have been had a lawyer been employed. To-day, at Newcastle, there is sitting a Committee which has done more work in six months than the old Arbitration Court, did in six years. It is composed entirely of representatives of the employers and employees. Counsel is not permitted to appear before it. Its members are threshing out the points in dispute, and coming to a decision upon them within"" a reasonable time. ber believes in Wages Boards as opposed to the Arbitration Court? mittee in question is a. voluntary Board. It 1 is the very thing for which we have been asking for years. If we have not sufficient Justices of the High Court to hear cases which claim the attention of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court within a reasonable time of their being listed, additional Justices should be appointed until the accumulated business has been disposed of. Otherwise, we shall revert to the system which formerly obtained in New South Wales, and under which cases were listed for two or three years before they were heard. If such a condition of affairs is ever brought about in connection with the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, we can say good-bye to arbitration, and we shall have to resort to the old order of things when industrial strife was always rampant. I ask the Attorney General to seriously consider the necessity of appointing an additional Justice of the High Court, or seeing that the President of the Arbitration Court devotes the whole of his time to the hearing of the cases which are listed for his decision.",34,Chairman Th E Honourable Throughout These Estimates No Doubt

My own opinion is that if industrial legislation is to be applied to rural and reasonable remuneration as will enable workers ber think that it should be? whether it should be. But if that class of legislation is to be applied to rural industries, it should be applied through local Boards dealing with small areas. Take the case of my own electorate.

I contend., should be dealt with by State legislation. The Federal power of arbitration was not designed to meet peculiar local characteristics. If our rural industries are to be dealt with by industrial legislation, they should be dealt with by State legislation. In my opinion, the congestion of work in the Court arises, more than anything else, from the tendency to drag to it many cases that could be more easily, expeditiously, and cheaply settled by the State tribunals. honourable member for Richmond voices the Conservative mind, which has always, been opposed to any extension of legislation of this character j but he has not told us. why men employed in rural industries should be denied social justice, any more than are men employed in mines. If the honourable member had been in close touch with the working of the Court, he would have found that many of the difficulties which alarm him disappear in the hands of a capable President such as we have. The basic principle is that every one, however unskilled ,, is entitled to receive such fair 1 him to maintain his wife and children as they ought to be maintained in a civilized community. Evidence is taken, in the different districts, as to the cost of living, and on the facts ascertained is fixed the living wage. Whether it be cold on one side of a river and hot on another does not enter into consideration, except in so far as the fact may affect the cost of living. We are told that it is impossible to conduct some industries on the eight hours principle; but that idea is disappearing,, because employers find that they do not get. so much return from the longer, hours as from the shorter. This has been proved all over the world, and quite a revolution has taken place .in last two years. I had the pleasure of spending a little time in the Court at Mildura and Renmark, and there I found that the employers not only made no objection to the eight hours principle, but were quite willing to accept it, although the work of picking fruit must be performed quickly, as in the case of reaping wheat. ber think that the dairying industry could be conducted on the eight hours principle? enced dairymen and butter-makers who work on the eight hours principle. orable member not to discuss fhe eight hours question. out that practical experience is dissipating objections of the sort.

Brisbane is not a lawyer. talking about; and I recommend the honourable member for Wentworth to spend some time in the Court, when he will realize that stances vary, it is true, in regard to emthere is a President who sees to the proper conduct of the cases. By both the present and the past President of the Court, no waste of time is allowed. At present, men of experience, though laymen, conduct the cases much better than they could be conducted except by lawyers of the front rank, who are quick to master details and to understand the case theoretically. As a matter of fact, with the exceptions I have mentioned, the laymen at present engaged handle the cases very much better than any lawyers could doj and this, of course, arises from the special training they are getting. The costs depend on the magnitude and the novelty of the cases presented; worker, and the ability of the industry to and we are apt to forget that it is comparatively recently that this kind of tribunal was established. The success of the Arbitration Court has been so great that it is being resorted to by organizations of working men all over the country; and there is no doubt that there will be a rush of work in it for some little time. When an award is once given, however, it will, in all probability, continue until some slight adjustment is asked for. and the fresh proand in this connection I suggest that, inceedings, of course, not requiring witnesses stead of the parties having to pay for the from a distance, and so forth, will not occupy nearly as much time as the proceedings in the first instance. In the future, it may be hoped that the President of the Court will be able to devote his exclusive attention to his industrial duties, so that it may not tie necessary to have adjournments from time to time. For the time being, the position can be met only by an additional Justice, just as excess of work in any other walk of life has to be coped with. There is an extraordinary idea abroad that this Court cannot handle rural industries, because the conditions vary so much; but, as a matter of fact, the Court has successfully handled many other industries covering the whole area of the Commonwealth. Of course, the conditions vary, but there is always a certain margin left within which the parties may meet. The main thing that a working man requires is a fair return for his work, with reasonable conditions and fair treatment in regard to accommodation, and so forth. Thisquestion of accommodation arises in connection with many rural pursuits, but it does not present any insurmountable difficulties.. The circumstances in this connection do not vary from State to State, except in so far. as wages are concerned. The circumployers, but that is a matter that does not come into consideration. If the Court had to take into account the profits of an industry, and all that kind of thing, no doubt the issues would be very complex, but it is very properly laid down that an industry that cannot pay fair and reasonable wages should not exist. into consideration before a minimum wage is fixed. is no such thing as a system of profit sharing at the present time. The skill of the carry more wages, may have some influence; and, to some extent, there is evidence of the kind suggested. The cost o£ this litigation is forcing federations on both sides, but the Court is' a movable one, and endeavours to accommodate itself to the people, so as to reduce expense as much as possible. I hold the view that as this Court is instituted in the interests of the whole community, a greater proportion of the costs should be borne by the country, shorthand .writing and typewriting of the evidence, there ought to be shorthand writers and typewriters attached to the Court to provide copies for the parties and the Judge. At present, the cost of the typewritten evidence forms a very oppressive burden on many of the smaller organizations, and particularly on emploj-erswhen these happen to be small in number. As a matter of fact, the Government have been rather stingy in staffing this very important Court; and I have no doubt that honourable members with larger experience than myself could make several other suggestions. My own experience of the Court leads me to the opinion that there is not much waste of time, once a case gets there, and then the time occupied depends on the novelty of the evidence presented. In our few years' experience, a vast amount of knowledge in detail as to the cost of living has been gathered; and this, of course, will shorten proceedings, unless a change arises.",37,Foster Th E Shearers Public Opinion In This Connexion Within The

280,Mr Spence,"Hardly, because thereIn one large case, with which I am personally connected, we are looking forward to an award which will continue indefinitely, with perhaps variations so slight as not to take more than a day or two to adjust. There are some very exaggerated ideas as to what this Court can and cannot do; but, personally, considering the limitations imposed by the Constitution, as interpreted by the High Court, I am astonished at what the Arbitration Court has been able to achieve. The Judge, at present, is tied up in every way; but if , in the future, he should be given all the power that is enjoyed by the Judges of other Courts, we may, I think, as far as human ingenuity can procure it, have peaceful working in our industries. We have had times of prosperity, when, as the history of trades unionism and the labour movement will show, is the opportunity usually taken by unions to demand improved conditions; and I have no doubt that, but for the Federal and State Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration, we should have had a great number of disputes and strikes. Richmond favours the State tribunals, but if he considers what has occurred in New South Wales, he will find that the grievance there for a long time was that those interested could not reach the Court at all. Cases were sometimes listed for a year or two, and never got any further. Moreover, a State Court could not so fix wages as to do justice to those who appealed to it, and at the same time provide for the adjustment of wages in an adjoining State. The honourable member for Richmond admits that in industries in which there is competition only one Court can effectively deal with cases. But he thinks that there are industries in which competition between producers in different States does not enter. honourable member says. I was alluding to unfair competition. rural industries there is competition when one producer cuts against another. There is even competition in regard to the employment of labour on tramways. there are better conditions obtaining in a tramway service in one State than in another, the tendency will be for the best workmen to go to the State where they can secure the best treatment. Moreover, discontent is created amongst the workmen in the State where the wages are lowest; and when there is discontent amongst workmen, the service is inferior to that which is given when every one works heartily and with good will. What is the use of shutting our eyes to facts? The honourable member says that we are responsible for many disputes because we have opened the door to the Federal Arbitration Court. Naturally unions will go to the Court from which they can secure the most effective justice. Our duty is to open every door, and let them decide what they will do. It is not for us with superior airs to dictate to them. If the honourable member were in close touch with trade unions he would find that they are managed by levelheaded, common-sense men. They are not children, to be dictated to. They will naturally go to the tribunal from which they think they can secure the best award. Undoubtedly the feeling has been in favour of appealing to the Federal Arbitration Court where that has been possible. I do not say that the employers always favour that Court. Generally they prefer Wages Boards. We have, in connection with the Federal system, however, the principle of The honourable member for compulsory conciliation, which is really on. the lines of Wages Boards, though it is not nearly so effective and valuable as the arbitration system. In the Arbitration Court, sworn testimony is given, and it is tested by cross-examination. The Wages Board system does not give us that advantage. I know of cases where awards have been given, by a Wages Board that were found fo be unworkable, because they overlapped other industries as to which evidence was not taken. The consequence has oeen the production of a certain amount of troubleThat has been the case in the building trade. In the Arbitration Court, any one who has testimony to give can be heard and examined. The door of the Court is open toall. Of course, the success of the whole system depends upon the kind of menchosen to preside. It requires a rare combination to make a successful President. He must have afinely-balancedmind, and must be sympathetic and considerate all round. Fortunately, we have such men inour midst in every State-me n who will dojustice according to the evidence laid beforeIf them. decisions of the Arbitration Court? have accepted the Court's decisions.

294,Sir Robert Best,"I do not meantheir own tribunals established for the purpose of dealing with State disputes. The idea was that disputes which are of an Inter-State character should be dealt with by a tribunal of a Federal character. Hencei t was that, with the unanimous approval of this Parliament, the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court was established in 1904. But the Arbitration Act has been grossly abused in the way I have referred to, insomuch as, I suppose, hardly more than two or three cases which have come before the Court have not been manufactured. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. for dinner, I was attempting to demonstrate that, much as I sympathized with the principles of arbitration, our experience in Australia has not been of eulogiums tliat have been passed upon it by honourable members opposite. I attempted to show by the actual experience of the Federal Arbitration Court how the spirit and intention of the Constitution has been distinctly perverted by reason of what has actually taken place under the existing Jaw. I showed that it has resulted in an increase of industrial disputes throughout Australia, and that in the majority of cases artificial disputes have had to be manufactured in order to enable the parties concerned to get before the Court. I said also that in two other instances the experience of arbitration has been even less fortunate. If we go to New Zealand, where arbitration has had its longest trial, we unfortunately discover, in respect of it, a record of failure. The principle of arbitration was introduced there amidst the highest enthusiasm. When the system was first introduced, unions almost "" fell over one another,"" so to speak, in their anxiety to secure registration, and to obtain the admitted the law to expire. What they have vantages and benefits of the conciliation and arbitration law. benefit from it. they anxious to cancel their registration? is bad. is that the awards have not all gone in the one direction. It is for that reason that the leading unions are cancelling their registration in order to be relieved of the Arbitration Court. where arbitration has had its longest trial, we find a record of unfortunate failure. As one who is in sympathy with the principle of arbitration, I regret that that should be so; but it is the first essential of arbitration that the awards of the Court, whatever they are, must be loyally accepted. If they are not, then no system of arbitration can possibly succeed. We saw only the other day that certain of the more aggressive spirits of a union at Waihi had cancelled their registration with the Court. The more moderate men-the legitimate trade unionists-were not prepared to go so far, and this action having been taken against their will, they formed another union with the object of securing re-registration. The consequence of this registration on their part, and of their anxiety to secure a peaceful tribunal to settle their industrial differences, is that a character that justifies the they have been subjected to every violence, and almost tyrannous efforts on the part of the revolutionary spirits. If that is the way in which the unions receive arbitration, the system cannot possibly be a success. If means that these peaceful tribunals, established with such hopeful results, must be regarded as a failure. I come now to the experience of New South Wales, where a system of arbitration was in force for some years. legal men. Court there became so congested that it was impossible for the industrial unions to get their disputes and differences dealt with by it. The outcome was that the law had to be repealed. time. technical objection. The Government perdone is not to re-enact the old system of arbitration, but to evolve a system of Wages Boardsa system under which it is competent for the Industrial Court tonominate Wages Boards to deal with industrial disputes. That, I venture to say, is the true solution of the problem.

303,Sir Robert Best,"That is a veryBoard in connection with the same industry. The honourable member for Darling stated that frequently the sole question is: "" What wages should be paid, having regard to the cost of living in a particular district,"" and I am quite prepared to believe that that is very often the question to be determined. The system of Wages Boards to which I have referred goes immediately to the point, whereas arbitration avoids it, inasmuch as it provides for uniformity as far as wages are concerned. The Wages Board system has special regard to locality, and takes immediate conditions into consideration. correct. The Federal Arbitration Court awards differentiate even in the matter of shearers' wages. differentiation in that particular industry. experience of Wages Boards provides us rates are uniform. Sir ROBERT. BEST -There was at one time some differentiation. said that he did not think he had the power to do that. an effort was made subsequently to differentiate, but the result of the whole reference to the Federal 'Conciliation and Arbitration Court is that at present there is uniformity so far as wages in that industry are concerned. It is this very uniformity that must be guarded against, because, as the honourable member for Darling has pointed out, the conditions of an inmeans, upon the model of the Wages dustry in a particular locality often constitute the question to be taken into immediate consideration. That simply means the multiplication of Wages Boards. The Victorian law, which affords a very fair model, provides for differentiation in respect of different conditions. We hear complaints of delay, but delay has been essentially incidental to the arbitration law. It is incident to our Court; it was notoriously incident to the New South Wales Arbitration Court, and New Zealand has had a similar experience. Whilst in individual cases there have been delays in connection with Wages Boards decisions, those delays are exceptional. The rule is to secure an early, if not an immediate, settlement of the matters in dispute. It is important to remember also that those who assemble as members of a Wages Board to fix wages and conditions, are not vernment. men who are obliged to be enlightened as to the actual facts by the calling of witnesses, but men who, by reason of their own expert knowledge and"" intimate acquaintance with the industry in respect of which they are called upon to adjudicate, are familiar with everything connected with it, and with the aims and aspirations of the workers. These are the men who adjudicate, and who come to what is a fair and reasonable decision in all the circumstances. To show that that is so, I need only refer to our experience in Victoria, where the appeals to the Industrial Court are but few. Indeed, an appeal to that Court is quite exceptional. I daresay that those which have taken place could be counted on the fingers qf one hand. If , then, our sole anxiety is to secure the most satisfactory and expeditious tribunal for the settlement of industrial disputes, our with the necessary guide, and nothing that has .taken place justifies the extraordinary anxiety that has been exhibited in certain quarters to secure a reference to the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court for the purpose of obtaining a settlement of industrial differences. Our experience of Wages Boards has been all the one way. The references to these tribunals have been completely satis-, factory to the persons concerned in the differences and disputes, while the settlements have been of such a satisfactory character that practically no appeals have taken place from those decisions. We should, therefore, be justified in extending by every Boards system, a scheme for the further settlement of Inter-State industrial disputes. I admit that there must be a Federal tribunal to deal with questions where competition exists as between the States, and where the wages paid in an industry in one State are not the same as those paid in a competing industry in another State. A Federal tribunal could readily be established for the purpose of co-ordinating and settling those differences.

I do not know what the Cabinet exigencies may be, but it does appear to me to be somewhat a misnomer to call this the Department of Externa] Affairs, when it is really administering affairs that pertain to things which are essentially internal, and, therefore, more properly belong to the Home Affairs Department. I have looked through the various items in these Estimates, but I cannot find a single item in connection with advertising the Commonwealth.

What was the reason and justification for advertising Eight Hours Day by the Department of External Affairs? To those questions I received these replies1. The back page of a special number, measuring 17 inches by i r inches. 2. Yes. Copy of the publication has been placed on the table of the library for the information oT honourable members. 3. 20th April, 1911. 4. There was no advertising of Eight Hours Day by the Department. The then Minister was of opinion that it would tend to prevent misconception if an immigration announcement were to appear in a publication which represents a class of the community which was erroneously supposed to be adverse to immigration. Included in the price per page, £<oo was for the supply of 1,000 copies of the pubVication, which were sent to England for distribution. The first matter of policy in this regard is that the Labour Call is a party journal, and, I venture to say, in the judgment of right-thinking persons, a vile journal. In this return of Government advertising, I cannot see that a single party journal except the Labour Call has been favoured in this way. It looks like a bribe. The Labour Call is essentially a party journal of a somewhat vile and infamous character. I endeavoured to get a copy of it this afternoon, but failed to do so. I have here some extracts from the copy in which the Commonwealth advertisement appeared. On the flyleaf is a Labour poem from the pen of the honourable member for Wannon. Now the advertisement is justified by the Minister upon the ground that the Labour Call is a publication which represents, a class of the community which was erroneously supposed to be adverse to immigration. The whole copy shows that this journal' is adverse to immigration, and this particular poem isan evidence of thatBe merciful ! O Ruler great, When famine riots in the State, And mows the people down.

Wherefore is the Prophet Deakin branded as a inisinformer of the people, a .false prophet whose teeth rattle loosely over words of no meaning, a wild and whirling yapper of senseless yap, and a pretentious wind-bag. The Government was false to Parliament when it inserted this advertisement in a journal whose object is to deride and denounce a section of the Parliament. On page 15, there is an article on "" The Sponging Press."" got £ 6 0 ? applied by this purist organ, the Labour Call, to such insignificant newspapers as the Argus, the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald, and the Daily TelegraphLies and misrepresentations, suppressions and .contortions of the truth, the taking-out of matter from illuminative contexts, the lopping off of truth conveying conclusions, the misquotations and outrageous silencing of too logical Labourites, all manner of journalistic uncleanfinesses, of canting hypocrisies, of unbelievably dishonourable press practices-thes e are the weapons with which the anti-Labour press is ""dealing it out"" to Labour.

Yet this Government inwed circumstanced firm serts in the journal that prints these libellous statements an advertisement for which they paid out of the people's money six tunes its true value. much as would have been charged to any private advertiser. Ministers have sent to Great Britain a publication which decries and defames this country.

Yet they have spent the money of the people in decrying the country that has given them these great and glorious opportunities. complain of in the. advertisement itself, which paints Australia as a good place to come to, and invites immigrants.

And you underbid your brothers for the priviferences that we must advertise to the world lege to work. You have seen your slave-wife starving, and the baby in her lap.

The verses are worthy of this great poet, and of the Labour Call in which, they are printed. it shows how easy it is to make money in Australia. graded Ministers are when they spend public money on advertising in this journal, and give as a reason that they are of opinion that it would tend to prevent misconception. The fifth stanza reads thusWill you shiver at the muck-rake With the lash above your shoulders like a narrow flag unfurled? The whole thing is ridiculous. The writer, a member of this Parliament, tells the people whom the Government invite to come here, that they will "" shiver at the muck-rake"" with the lash above their shoulders. things as is here depicted in Australia. These statements are an insult to our country. It is a shame that a man should put these lies into rhyme, and that they should be printed side by side with an advertisement paid for at the expense of the public, inviting people to come to Australia. I am sorry that the Government should degrade themselves by making use of a journal of such a low-down partisan character for the purpose of building up their own party. The payment for this advertisement almost looks like a bribe to their own press in order' that that press might present to a very small section of the community false views as to what other parties in Parliament are doing. speech to which we have just listened was of great interest to the Committee. I think it will have come home to every honourable member that in future any Government which may happen to be in power will require to be extremely careful where it places Commonwealth advertisements, and to what newspapers it gives a semi-official status in countries other than our own. Even if every statement made by the journal which has been quoted were true, would not that circumstance make it the more infamous that such statements should be circulated abroad ? Have we reached the position that there is so much venom in our party difnot Australia as she is, but Australia as she seems to minds which are poisoned, and to which truth is foreign ? Every Australian, to whatever political party he may belong, at least owes it to his country that he shall do nothing to defame her or to make her ridiculous and loathsome in the eyes of the outside world. Whether or not If such stuff is paid for, we attract immigrants to this country, whether or not we succeed in building up here a white buttress of our race, we must realize that we are a debtor people, and as such we depend absolutely upon our credit in the Old Land from which we sprang. To circulate at the public expense in the Mother Country such trash as has been quoted is the most ridiculous and puerile thing of which any Government could be capable. I wish now to say a word or two in regard to the Department of External Affairs That Department and the Department of Home Affairs strike me as being two. of the most extraordinarily named Departments that we have in the Commonwealth. Just as the chief duty There is no such state of of the Department of Home Affairs seems to be to meddle with the business of every other Department and to have none of its own, so the Department of External Affairs appears to have no machinery to enable it to discover anything relating to those external affairs which are of vital importance to the Australian people. I have asked some questions of the Department with a view to eliciting information as to its efficiency as organized to-day. I have found that the Minister who is responsible for its conduct is mainly concerned with what is happening in the Northern Territory, and has no time for anything else. But I would point out that things may be happening oversea which may be of vital importance to us. The point which I wish to bring under the attention of the Committee is that perhaps the most important Australian affair external to Australia is the condition of the British Navy.",45,External Affairs

But I want to ask honourable members to listen to such a reply as the Minister may vouchsafe to the inquiry, "" What channel has he for ascertaining definitely the adequacy or otherwise of the British Navy at the present juncture ? "" We know that there are troubles in Europe which at any moment may embroil the great Powers, and with them our own Empire. In the event of such a contingency arising-and it is by no means unlikely-it is a matter of supreme importance to Australia that the British Navy shall be equal to its responsibilities. I venture to say that in this Australia of ours it is quite impossible to get an External Affairs which is regarded as imanswer to so simple an inquiry as, "" What steps have been taken in regard to reinforcing the Mediterranean Squadron? "" It is held by some persons in England that to reinforce that Squadron at the present juncture will be to vitally weaken the North Sea Fleet, and so expose the heart of the Empire to a sudden attack from Germany. When one looks at the figures relating to the naval strength of the two Powers, one sees that there may be some reason for this contention. I find that, during the present month, Great Britain has only thirteen Dreadnoughts in the North Sea, as against eleven German Dreadnoughts if the three recently building are in commission, and only three battle cruisers as against three German battle cruisers if battle cruisers have been sent to the Mediterranean. It will be seen, therefore, that the numbers are approximately equal, and as a crisis may arrive at any moment gent interest in our own affairs by endeavouring to ascertain whether or not the Imperial Navy is really adequate to our necessities. After all, Australia would be the spoils to the victor in any European war. The mere fact that we have a. Labour party in Australia would not be sufficient to warn off all comers who want this land. Yet the honourable member for Dalley inquires, '' What business is it of ours ? Why should we bother? "" It is a matter of vast importance to us; and yet we have absolutely no machinery to enable us to ascertain exactly how the British Navy is faring in regard to its world-wide responsibilities. Minister of External Affairs that he ought to exhaust all the opportunities at his command to follow up these external problems so thoroughly and constantly that in Australia at any moment we may be able to obtain the same information as may be imparted by a responsible Minister in the House of Commons. The mere fact that our country is called Australia, and another part of the Empire is known as the United Kingdom, will not avail us one whit should the Empire fail. Therefore, it is a matter of supreme importance that we, who are charged with the safety of the Australian people, should know exactly what dispositions are being made to keep over our heads that Imperial roof under which we have been nurtured through our century of life. Coming to that side of the Department of portant in this CommitteeI refer to the Northern TerritoryI cannot help thinking that the administration of that Territory has reached a rather ridiculous pass during recent times. We all know what happened in connection with the Northern Territory Lands Ordinance. It was passed through the Cabinet at the instance of the Minister, with all the courage of a Czar, and was contemptuously kicked out a! fortnight later by the Legislature. We know what the Government are doing in regard to the question of alien labour in the Territory.

A vast number of adherents of the political cause -of honourable members opposite have been appointed to well-paid positionsa number of them' to very well-paid positions. We had the wildest anxiety on the part of the united party opposite to obtain difficult ; and the Government could think the services of Mr Nielsen, who was becoming very inconvenient to the New South Wales Government, his views on the land question being out of all harmony with those of the State Government.

Under the circumstances, 1 think I am in order in referring to Mr Nielsen, and I am certainly in order in referring to the wild anxiety of the Minister of External Affairs to get Mr Nielsen to take on the job of land administrator in the Northern Territory. I am inclined to think, although I do not know Mr Nielsen's successor, that the Minister did not suffer any great misfortune in not succeeding in obtaining Mr ter has not been referred to by the MinisNielsen's services. I cannot help thinking that Mr Nielsen's views on the land question are altogether too fanatical and extreme to insure any reasonable discretion if he occupied such a position of high authority. ence in that respect between Mr Nielsen and Mr Ryland. is qualified fo go to the Northern Territory ! Did he not take some leading part in the strike in Queensland ? I understand that Mr Ryland was walking about Sydney with a strike ticket in his hat last year as a strike delegate. I know that there are extenuating circumstances in connection with his appointment, because he stood as a candidate in. the Labour interest, and was eminently qualified, therefore, to draw a large Government salary ever afterwards. The point is, however, to get the very best man we can to administer the lands in the Northern Territory. The work of the Lands Administrator is not easy, but very involved and of nothing better than to throw the position as a sort of sop to a political adherent. It is something in the nature of a scandal that such a man should be singled out for political favours, and sent to administer so There is one more point to which I desire to refer. It has always been usual for Ministers to make a statement in introducing the Estimates of their several Departments; but we are now: treated more cavalierly than ever in the past. We are entitled to information as to what the Government propose to do with regard to honouring the agreement with South Australia, especially in connection with building the north and south transcontinental line, or alternatively as to what other lines they propose. This is a matter of large of some £4,500,000. There is, I think, an understanding-in my opinion, a very bad agreement-wit h South Australia, binding us down to construct the line; and South Australia will naturally expect something like a recognition of our obligation under that agreement. However, we have not had a whisper from Ministers, and I think that honourable members from South Australia will be as surprised as I am that the matter in charge of these Estimates. My .own view is that we ought to make some arrangement with South Australia to enable us-honourably , of course-to break the understanding to a certain extent, so that the line may run west through Brunette Downs, and link up with the West Queensland lines. We should then be opening up some excellent country for settlement, and would eventually link up the West Queensland line with the New South Wales lines, and provide means of saving vast bodies of stock in drought periods.

I hope the Minister will deal with this question, and satisfy honourable members that his intentions, at any rate, are reasonably good, if his performances have been extraordinarily bad. It would be helpful to the Committee if the Minister of External Affairs could give some outline of the Government policy in regard to several of the leading branches which he is administering, so that we' might be able to grapple properly with the problems we have to face. We look to the Government for a lead in these larger subjects, many of whicli are absolutely beyond the arena of party politics, and in which honourable members on both sides take a great interest, having every desire to arrive at a proper and just solution. First of all, there is the Northern Territory. When the Works Estimates vvere before us, we could not expect the Minister at that stage to give us a comprehensive view of what steps he was taking for the development of the Territory; but now, I think, we are entitled to a clear statement as to what the general policy of the Government is. We are placed at a further disadvantage, inasmuch as we have no official report showing what has taken place in the Territory during the last twelve months. I notice from the evening newspaper that Mr Atlee Hunt, the Secretary to the Department, is lecturing tonight before the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia on the development of that Possession j and I presume that the substance of his lecture is to a great extent official. It would be very interesting if the Minister were to elaborate the information there given. For instance, we Hunt will give a concise description of the physical features of the country, and a resume of the steps taken in the direction of inducing settlement; and the Minister might be able to afford some idea of what those steps are. for the honourable member to go and listen to Mr Hunt. ing that we can get information in no other way. The frankness of the Minister o of Trade and Customs is to -be commended ; and, perhaps, we might go to the extent of allowing the permanent secretaries to give us here, the explanations which in the past have been afforded by Ministers, but which are now denied us. We are further told that Mr Hunt will indicate the nature of the efforts that the Government are now putting forward to attract different classes of settlement. That is the kind of information which I am asking the Minister of External Affairs to give to us. He ought to have a full grip of the problem, having himself visited the Territory, and he ought to be able to enlighten us. We are also informed that Mr Atlee Hunt was to state that the principal type aimed at is that of the agriculturist, or the one that combines agriculture and grazing. He was to point out that it will be necessary to await the results of the experiments now being carried out at the Government farms in the Territory before indicating to settlers which will be the more profitable crops, and the best methods of growing them. He was also to state thathis personal view is that stock-fattening will for a time be the most profitable form of industry that the settler could engage in. FurthermoreI t has already been decided that the Government will grant facilities to settlers in the way of frozen storage. The works will probably be ready by the end of next year, and the Government will then arrange for the shipping companies to call at the Territory for the frozen freight. It is a good thing to see that the Secretary of the External Affairs Department is letting the public know what the Department is doing; but it would also be a good thing if the Minister, in his responsible position, would give us in this House a complete view of everytiiing that is transpiring in connection with the Northern Territory, both in regard to development and as to the steps which are being taken to attract settlers. the monopoly in frozen meat up there. will take what I am suggesting in all seriousness. I urge him to yield to the appeal we are making, and to furnish us with a statement of his policy.

397,Mr Groom,"I hope that the Minister has suddenly discovered that there is a big problem in the Northern Territory. His party were ten years in office, and did nothing. the situation is rather interesting. Here is a Minister who is carrying out an agreement which we made, and instead of answering an appeal which we are addressing to him now, he sits in his corner gibing. That is the Ministerial attitude when a statement of policy with respect to the Northern Territory is requested. Admiral King Hall, speaking on Saturday night, saidThe White Australia policy was a policy which must have more than bits of parchment behind it, if it was to be enforced in years to policy is to be a continued success, there come. Although a very good start had been made in the Defence Forces, he candidly confessed to a feeling of uneasiness when he saw how slowly this great island continent was being that at the last Premiers' Conference they peopled, for a large population was necessary in order to carry out the large naval policy required for this great country. It seemed unlikely that this magnificent country would not some day be coveted, if left so empty, by other grants, arranging with the shipping companies nations whose peoples were overflowing the brim of their own countries. must be peopled as fast as possible. capable man was a national asset for the' defence and prosperity of the country, and only ignorant people thought otherwise. Here is a gentleman occupying a high official position, and who spoke in a purely non-party sense. I do not wish to introduce his name into this debate with a view of exciting partisan controversy; but I think that he stated a proposition which every thoughtful Australian will recognise as absolutely true. We cannot deal with a great. continent like Australia, and keep it as a white country, unless we are prepared to take steps to bring into the Commonwealth people who will become settlers and help us to defend it. That is the position which the Admiral makes so plain; and I trust that the Minister, when he makes a statement, will tell us that he endorses it to the full. I hope that he will not merely tell us that he is theoretically in favour of this policy, but that the Government of which he is a member intend to take all the practical steps they can to develop a proper immigration policy for Australia, so that we may secure a steady and continuous flow of desirable settlers. So far, immigration has been entirely promoted by the States. In 1906 the honourable member for Ballarat, who was then at the head of the Government of the Commonwealth, at a Premiers' Conference held in Sydney, made an offer to the State Pre[i94] miers to co-operate with them in the matter of imimigration. On behalf of the Commonwealth, he intimated his willingness to submit to Parliament a proposal by which his Government would combine in bringing to Australia a steady flow of immigrants. He further offered to negotiate for shipping in order that we might have a regular supply of vessels coming to Australia, not only bringing immigrants, but, by going right round the continent, securing regular transport for the north as well as for the south. Unfortunately, the State Premiers at that time turned the proposal down. I am glad to see that at present a different view is prevailing, and that the State Premiers now recognise that if an immigration must be co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth. Accordingly, we find passed the following resolutionThat the Commonwealth be asked to provide 25,000 assisted passages per annum for immiand paying the cost of transportation on a uniTherefore, Australia form basic rate, the States to select the immiEvery grants, and place them, as at present, any State being at liberty to supplement the number of assisted passages allotted to it at the same rate. That was an offer by the States to cooperate with the Commonwealth with a view of taking common action in the matter of immigration. PayAustralia does he not become a Commonwealth citizen? Does he not belong to us as much as to the States? able member speaks of the States as if they were hostile alien agencies. the States ourselves? What nonsense it is to try to create the idea in the public mind that there are two sets of people, instead of regarding every man brought to Australia as a citizen of the Commonwealth. and act upon it. Unless we are to help the States to bring out these Australian citizens, we can never properly defend this continent of ours, and keep it as a white country. the land.",50,External Affairs

Did they accept it? Ministers talk immigration, and tell us how wonderfully population is flowing to Australia as the result of the land tax-althoug h they give no proof of that statement-bu t how did they treat the offer of the State Premiers? The reply of the Minister of External Affairs was that they had given careful consideration to the proposal contained in the letter of 6th February; that the resolution of a recent Premiers' Conference quoted appeared to amount to a recommendation that the Commonwealth should contribute a sum of, approximately, ,£150,000 a year to the cost of the work of introducing immigrants to Australia, now carried out by the State Governments, without their altering any . of the other arrangements incidental to that policy; and that, in their opinion, it would not be wise to introduce a divided control. There is no indication of compliance with the offer of the States, but, on the contrary, a deliberate turning down of their proposal. There was a frank refusal to have anything to do with it. We know that some of their party are opposed to immigration.

It was received here some time in May, and the Government had possession of it before the Governor General's Speech was read at the opening of the present session. What proposition did he submit to them in respect of immigration? He wroteThe satisfaction which the marked increase in the number of emigrants from Great Britain to Australia has caused has been qualified by the increasing anxiety I have felt owing to the block from which the movement is suffering at its most important point, that of finding transit for those willing and anxious to make their homes in the Commonwealth. Unless some rapid increase in the means of transit occurs, a serious, perhaps disastrous, check to Australian immigration is bound to occur. case of emigrants prepared to pay their own passage-money in f u l l (in the steerage) is worse than in the case of the assisted class. For some time past the passenger steamers have been quite unable to cope with the demand, and although the shipping companies have provided, and are providing, new steamers, the situation is getting worse. Could we have a stronger statement? Sir George Reid points out that the increase of emigration to Australia is viewed with general satisfaction, but that the means of transit are utterly inadequate. He says.It does seem a thousand pities now that such an unusual demand for passages to Australia has arisen, that we should find ourselves in danger of a contrary movement setting in. He does not desire that contrary movement to set in, and I think that all Australians will agree that it would be a thousand pities if anything occurred to check this desirable flow of people coming voluntarily to Australia. He continuesWhen people cannot get a chance of departure until several months after they are ready to embarky ft is easy to-see' .what is likely-to happen This proposition on the part of the High existence of these delays, as a matter of fact, is tested and proved by actual experiments from time to time, in the shape of applications for berths at the offices of the various shipping companies. He is making here no mere vapid assertion, but a careful, deliberate statement, based upon actual knowledge which he has obtained from the shipping offices. His facts are beyond dispute. He goes on to say-I have had interviews with deputations of passenger agents and the heads of the shipping companies-wh o are both deeply interested, the former in earning commission, and the latter in promoting traffic-and I am bound, after the most careful and earnest consideration, to state that I am convinced some assurance, given by those in authority, that emigration to Australia will be encouraged and assisted for a period of at least four or five years, is needed by_ the shipping companies before they will build the number of passenger steamers necessary. It must be remembered that cargo steamers cannot be converted into passenger steamers, either temporarily or permanently, without a very large outlay. The modern requirements now wisely insisted upon cause ship-building for passengers to be a vastly more expensive task than it used to be.

The Government do not even ask the States to co-operate with them. The States alone are engaged at the present time in an active immigration policy.

"" [9.40] -It is a pity that the Minister of External Affairs has not followed the usual courteous custom of explaining to the Committee the nature of the Estimates of his desire on the part of the present Government sible. There certainly appears to be no desire on their part to volunteer any information as to the policies of their several Departments. The present Minister of External Affairs, following the discourteous lead that has already been set by other members of the Ministry, treats the Committee with silent contempt. He places his Estimates upon the table, and expects the Committee to vote the sums required without a word of personal explanation from him concerning the important developmental questions associated with his Department. He is not prepared to volunteer any statement to honourable members of the Opposition, who are entitled, as a right, and not merely as a concession, to have the information for which Gothey ask. Perhaps one reason why it is not forthcoming is that the Minister has no particulars in his own possession beyond those which the Estimates themselves give. That has been our experience, so far, in dealing with the Estimates of other Departments. When we have asked for an explanation of certain large items of expenditure we have found Ministers totally unprepared to give any information, and when pressed they have had finally to admit that they^ have not the information to give ; that, as a matter of fact, they do not know the business of their Departments. And this is the way in which the business of the country is being conducted by a set of Ministers who pride themselves on their great capacity for administration. As a matter of fact, they show a great capacity. for knowing nothing about the Departments which they administera great capacity for incapacity. I do not remember this Committee being treated in the same scurvy manner by any previous Administration, and it is only charitable to assume that it is not from want of manners, not from a desire to be discourteous, or to appear loutish, but simply because the members of the Ministry have not taken the trouble to inform themselves as to the details of their Departments, and consequently are not in a position to give the information to which the Committee is, entitled as a right, and which ought to be volunteered by any Minister when his Estimates are submitted for consideration here.

How do you know that it is true? quoting from the Age. . that journal. tainly do not, but I notice that whenever honourable members opposite want to quote anything which tells against this side, they do not hesitate to quote the Age, and do not question whether it is true. It is sufficient for them that it appears in the Age, no matter how extravagant it may be; there is no question of its truth then with them. It is only when the criticism is turned to themselves that they begin to throw doubt on the veracity of the statements, and that, again, is characteristic of them. To resume the quotationThe Chief Surveyor, Mr Day, has been away for three months, and has been represented by Mr Worgan, the chief clerk and draftsman, who has the distinction of being the only old officer left with any pretence to power placed this vast Territory, which the Commonin his hands. him? a lovely way in which to run a Department. I wonder what the Minister of Home Affairs thinks of the method. There are no ""chasers"" employed there; there is none of that paraphernalia which the honourable gentleman prides himself upon having introduced into his own Department. suggest to him the advisability of having a heart to heart talk with the Minister of External Affairs, and seeing if he cannot instil into his mind some of the up-to-date business methods which he prides himself so much upon possessing in a marked degree ""chasers"" after these omcers. and that is one of the few good suggestions that I have heard from the honourable member. survey the country from the office? Mr Day is not the only administrative officer away. The heads of these Departments are not all surveying the country, . J dp not .think that ..thft Minister of Home Affairs found it necessary to absent himself from his office in order to survey the Yass-Canberra territory. He sent there a Chief Surveyor and a staff; he did not go himself. I do not know whether the gentleman to whom am the honourable member for Dalley refers is a practical surveyor. for Wakefield. Professor Spencer a surveyor; is he away surveying the country? aborigines. proceed with the quotation?Professor Spencer is away with the Administrator, and has been represented by Mr J. T. Beckett, also a new arrival. The railway engineer, Mr Francis, is in Melbourne, and has left no representation. The Administrator hurried away while still arranging the organization of many new Departments. That, is the way in which the Northern Territory is managed and administered. The Minister of External Affairs has no reason to be proud of his administration of wealth took over in order that it might be populated at the earliest possible opportunity. It is being settled and developed by the heads of Departments running all over the country, apparently without any set purpose, and leaving nobody in charge of the offices, where they should be in order to direct the energies of their subordinates, who should be at work which, presumably, they themselves are now doing. I The quotation continuesI t follows, as a natural course, that all matters here are in a most unsettled condition. The carpenters are on strike. The labour troubles have not made the work of the acting rigime any easier, but have accentuated the difficulties of the situation. There is a lot more, but I do not intend to quote it, to show the manner in which the Northern Territory is being administered. Why was it taken over? more difficult for the officers who are there ? You may pitch into me as much as you like, but why should you pitch into the officers ? question might very well have been directed to the Age, which published this article for public information.

481,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"Thatonly go to those sources which are always upheld by them as reliable. When the Minister in charge of these Estimates does not condescend to inform the Committee of any particulars concerning his Department, or his administration, or the policy governing the Department, we are, perforce, obliged to look to the press, and any other source, for the information required. We have no other means at our disposal. We cannot go behind the Minister's back to the officers of his Department, and ask for the information, because if we did he would charge us with doing something underhand. When we ask him straightforwardly here for the information we cannot get any satisfaction, and so we are thrown back upon the press, which may or may not be accurate. We can only quote what is stated in the press, and try to probe and find out if the information is accurate. The only person who can supply us with proper information is the Minister, who is asking us to vote money for carrying out what appears to us at present to be a careless, ineffective, incompetent, and, in many respects, extravagant administration of the public finances. We have not yet had a policy' announced by the Government in regard to the Northern Territory. When we were asked to take it over, it was pointed out that one of the urgent needs of the Territory was the settlement of population. It was represented that it was too big a problem for South Australia to manage, that she had expended huge sums, and incurred great liabilities in respect to the Territory which she was not able to finance. We were asked, not only to take over the Territory, but also to recoup South Australia for the whole of the money which had been lost, and the whole of the liabilities which she had still to meet in connection with the attempted development of the Territory, so far as it had gone, and its administration. We have done that on the good faith of those who put forward those grounds, and who urged as a further reason that the question of defence made it imperative that this portion of Australia should be peopled at the earliest possible opportunity, in order that we might have effective occupation rather than run the imminent risk of invasion at any time. What has been done in the matter of attracting population? Since 1910 we have had a Ministry with a splendid majority behind them, with funds rolling in more rapidly than was ever the case before. They have had more than double the revenue that any previous Government had j they have had "" money to burn,"" as I see some Labour people in Western Australia have stated as a reason why they should have applied to the Government for employment. What have they done to develop the Northern Territory? It is as empty as when they took it over. ing with it for ten years. honourable member has not been in Parliament very long. Had he been following Federal politics before coming here, he would know that the Territory was not taken over by the Commonwealth until this Government came into office, and that, tlierefore, we had no control over it, as it was then under the South Australian Government. It has had the Territory for upwards of two and a half years, and what has it done? It has sunk something like three-quarters of a million there, but what is there to show for the money? A few Socialistic experimental farms, employing a few hands at pottering about, but giving no practical settlement or developmental results ! There has been no attempt to advertise the resources of the Territory so as to attract people there. The Commonwealth is as much exposed to invasion to-day as it was when South Australia had the Territory. population ? were we going to put population when we took over the Territory ? There are millions of acres crying out for development, and population should be put on them. Thousands of persons are brought to this country yearly to increase the population of already congested areas around the metropolitan centres, while the wide spaces of the Northern Territory are left unoccupied, and a source of danger, because a temptation to invasion by those Eastern nations, whose territories are overflowing with people, and who are looking for new fields. The estimate of expenditure for this year is no less a sum than £848,500. honourable member seems to think that a small matter. What is a million pounds to him? Our friends opposite can fritter away millions. They have £22,000,000 to fritter away this year, although preceding Governments had to be content with £8,000,000, and less.

They consider the representatives of the people impertinent because we ask how the money is being spent, and desire to exercise control over its expenditure. need for expenditure, but we acknowledge our duty to our constituents, which is to see that that expenditure is wise and proper. The expenditure of this Government on the Northern Territory, and in many other directions, is not wise nor prudent, nor is it justifiable. There are some 117 officials in the Northern Territory who are being paid fairly high salaries-£3° ° ^ a n upwards, and, in some cases, are provided with residences. But could they keep out an Asiatic invasion? Do they effectively occupy the Territory? We wish to know what is the policy of the Minister for the development of the Territory? Have any steps been taken to secure a considerable number of immigrants? Is money to be frittered away year after year merely to keep honourable members are reminded that prua few defeated Labour candidates in fat billets? I should not object to defeated Labour candidates being pitchforked into billets at high salaries if they had the qualifications necessary for the performance of the duties with which they are intrusted. But we have no indication that they possess these qualifications, and, in some instances, at least, the possession of these qualifications by them has been called into question. Provided that they are qualified for the posts they are given, I would not object to such appointments as long as more qualified men were not debarred from the chance of getting appointments. The Government is only playing with the development of the Northern Territory. It is not dealing with it in a statesmanlike way.

Act was passed in 1910, which has been administered wholly by this Government. During this period, it has done nothing to develop the country, and the Minister in charge of the Territory has not told us what is the policy of the Government in regard to it. We tried to get information from him when dealing with the Budget, . and again when the Works Estimates were under discussion, but failed on each occasion, and appear likely to be unsuccessful We recognise the now. If at first you don't succeed, Try, try, try again. honourable member would say, "" Do not worry."" It is our business to worry. The increasing of expenditure means the imposition of more taxation on the backs of Labour, a prospect which we cannot view without serious alarm. We shall not always have seasons of unexampled prosperity, though I wish that we might. howler. soon as the note of warning is struck, and dence is necessary in times of prosperity to guard against ill effects in times of adversity, we hear about calamity howling. But even at the risk of being called a calamity howler, I venture to point out that we are drifting into dangerous waters, that we cannot expect this period of prosperity to continue for ever, that there are not wanting indications of a change, and that it is time we called a halt. It is time that we understood where all this huge financial expenditure will land us. I do not mind a large expenditure so long as we know that we are proceeding upon safe lines. member's time has expired the circumstances, I must reserve what I have to say for my second lap. --Will the Minister report progress now? a half two matters to which I wish to direct attention in connection with the administration of the High Commissioner's office.

It is upon this point that the High Commissioner has made a complaint. 1 am sorry that some attention has not been given to it, because the sum set down upon these Estimates in this connection is exactly similar to that which appeared on the Estimates of last year. The High Commissioner points out thatIn advertising the Commonwealth in Great Britain and on the Continent, it will, I believe, 1908-10. be found advisable to arrange two distinct £ schemes-on e aiming at securing an increasing '5,?77>3 6 2 tide of emigration to Australia and a greater ... ... 1,816,739 5,982,035 volume of investments and further enterprise,, the other seeking to promote a better knowledge >.947,6S4 7>733i4'6 of the range and quality of Australian exports, with a view to promote an increasing demand for our products in British and foreign markets. The High Commissioner also points out that, with the funds at his disposal, it is impracticable to include a vigorous and business like campaign for advertising our food products.
