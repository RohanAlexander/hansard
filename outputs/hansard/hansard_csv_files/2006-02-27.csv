Eades, H. Fraser, J. Siegel, T. McNamara, and B. Baker) published in 2003 which casts serious doubt on the assumptions and methods used by the companies, Eqvator and Sprakab, which are contracted by the Government to produce language analysis reports to assist with the determination of claims for refugee status. (2) What is the Minister’s response to the set of guidelines for the use of language analysis in relation to questions of national origin issued by an international group of linguists – Language and National Origin Group (2004) – and published in the International Journal of Speech, Language and the Law in 2004. (3) How does the Government justify the continued use of Eqvator and Sprakab in the investigation of the nationality claims of asylum seekers. (4) What is the cost of a language analysis report from (a) Eqvator and (b) Sprakab. (5) What sum has DIMIA spent on these reports in the last 12 months. (6) What investigations have been undertaken by the Department to ascertain more reliable means of verifying nationality claims of asylum seekers. Mr John Cobb-The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The agencies used by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) for language analysis are amongst a small group of specialised agencies in the world which provide this service to countries conducting refugee status assessments. In Australia, language analysis results are not determinative of nationality and decision makers have to weigh up all available information when reaching their conclusions about the origins of visa applicants. The weight which decision makers give to language analysis results will depend on the circumstances of each individual case. Historically the overwhelming majority of language analysis results has helped to substantiate the claims made by visa applicants about their origins in circumstances where there is usually no other independent information to support their claims. In this regard the claimed Afghan boat arrival caseload was the overwhelming focus of language analysis in protection visa processing by the Department. Some 85% of that caseload was granted protection visas by the Department in the first instance. The two agencies currently used by DIMIA for language analysis are amongst a small group of specialised agencies in the world which provide a relevant service. (2) The ideas set out in the document, where these are relevant to Australia, appear to be broadly consistent with the approach followed by the Department and review tribunals in relation to visa processing. The document places emphasis on the analysts holding particular personal academic qualifications. The language analysis agencies used by Australia in relation to protection visa processing place importance on formal qualifications but also apply broader institutional methodologies in relation to skill and competency maintenance and, importantly, quality assurance and empirical testing of analysts. (3) See answer to part (1). (4) The average costs of a language analysis report from: (a) Eqvator– $1133. (b) Sprakab– $686. (5) The total cost of language analysis checks commissioned in the 12 months to 31 October 2005 was $24,363. (6) DIMIA is always open to opportunities to obtain information which might assist in visa decision making.

It would be of potentially significant commercial value to Telstra’s competitors if they could access this information. For example, access to this information would allow competitors to revise their own level of spending on advertising so that they could match or exceed Telstra’s expenditure. Also by providing an aggregate amount of Telstra’s promotional spend, Telstra’s competitors could obtain a reasonably good understanding of the split between Telstra’s advertising spend (which has been estimated by external organisations) relative to Telstra’s spend on direct mail and telemarketing. Such knowledge could put those competitors in a position to compete unfairly with Telstra in circumstances where they are not obliged to make reciprocal disclosure of the amounts they spend for the same purpose.

There have been no new cases in which assets have been frozen under the Charter of the United Nations 2443 and 2444, nor have there been any assets unfrozen during that period. Iran (Question No. 2680) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 28 November 2005: (1) Has he seen the reported comments by Brigadier-General Mohammad Kossari, head of the Security Bureau of the Iranian Armed Forces, that Iran has ready martyrdom-seeking individuals who are ready to strike at Iran’s enemies. (2) Is it the Government’s assessment that this statement is confirmation that the Iranian regime is supporting suicide bombing as a political tactic. (3) Does he have information on Iranian involvement in suicide bombing attacks. (4) Has he seen further comments by Brigadier-General Kossari that enemies of a nuclear Iran could not do a damn thing to stop Iran developing nuclear weapons. (5) What part is Australia taking in international efforts to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons. (6) What was the value of Australian trade with Iran in the most recent year for which statistics are available. (7) What is the Government’s response to the view that Australia should apply trade sanctions to Iran if it proceeds with the development of nuclear weapons. (1) and (4) Yes. (2) and (3) The Government has not seen any information suggesting that such operations have been carried out. Statements such as those made by Brigadier-General Kossari appear to be intended as a tactic by some in Iran to threaten retaliation if international pressure on the nuclear issue increases. (5) As a member of the IAEA Board of Governors, Australia has played an important part in international efforts aimed at preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability. Since September 2003, Australia has supported and helped secure a series of IAEA Board resolutions on Iran. These resolutions have included calls for Iran both to cooperate with the IAEA in its investigations to determine the nature of Iran’s nuclear activities, and to maintain and re-establish full suspension of all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, as Iran committed to do in the context of negotiations with the EU3 (UK, France, Germany) on a long-term agreement. Most recently, Resolution GOV/2005/77 of 24 September 2005 found Iran in non-compliance of its NPT Safeguards Agreement and foreshadowed reporting Iran to the UN Security Council. I ( Mr Downer) have taken regular opportunities to impress on Iran Australia’s concerns about Iran’s nuclear activities and our expectations that Iran cooperate fully and immediately with the IAEA.",164,Questions In Writing

(7) Did the 1989 Second Optional Protocol on the Covenant Aiming at the Abolition of the Death Penalty enter into force on 11 July 1991. (8) Had Australia acceded to the Second Optional Protocol on 2 October 1990. (9) When, where and with what result has Australia held discussions with Singapore concerning Singapore becoming a party to the Second Optional Protocol. (10) Did Australia on 28 January 1993 declare acceptance of Article 41 of the Covenant. (11) When, where and with what result has Australia held discussions with Singapore about Article 41 of the Covenant. (1) Yes, except for Article 41 which entered into force on 28 March 1979. (2) Yes. (3) Australia co-sponsors relevant resolutions at the Commission on Human Rights and in the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly that strongly appeal to all states that have not yet done so to become parties to the International Covenants on Human Rights, including the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. (4) Yes. (5) Yes. (6) As the only states which can become a party to the Optional Protocol are those which are a party to the Covenant, the question of raising the Optional Protocol with Singapore does not arise. (7) Yes. (8) Yes. (9) As the only states which can become a party to the Optional Protocol are those which are a party to the Covenant, the question of raising the Optional Protocol with Singapore does not arise. Australia’s long-standing opposition to the death penalty is well known. Singapore maintains a position of support for capital punishment. Australia has traditionally co-sponsored resolutions at the Commission on Human Rights that call upon states that have not yet done so to abolish the death penalty",165,Questions In Writing
238,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:and, in the meantime, to establish a moratorium on executions. Australia has also co-sponsored related resolutions in the Third Committee of the General Assembly. (10) On 28 January 1993, the Government of Australia declared that it recognised the competence of the Human Rights Committee to receive and consider communications under Article 41 of the Covenant. (11) As only States Parties to the Covenant may make declarations under Article 41, the question of raising Article 41 with Singapore does not arise. Western Sahara (Question No. 2683) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 28 November 2005: Does Australia recognise the sovereignty of Morocco over the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara. Australia is aware of the competing claims over the territory of Western Sahara. Australia supports an early and durable political settlement on the Western Sahara that is acceptable to all directly interested parties and supports the earliest possible holding of a referendum to allow the population of the Western Sahara to exercise its right to self determination, so long as that remains the only process fully endorsed by the United Nations for resolving the dispute. A UN-sponsored referendum would provide a clear indication of the wishes of the population of Western Sahara. National Security: Terrorism (Question No. 2746) Mr Tanner asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 30 November 2005: (1) When did any of the police or security services (ASIO, ASIS, ONA, AFP, State police services) first request the Government to amend the Criminal Code Act 1995 along the lines of amendments put to the Parliament on 2 November 2005 in the Anti-Terrorism Bill 2005. (2) On what date was the most recent request of this kind made to the Government by any of the police forces or security agencies. (3) Prior to the Prime Minister’s announcement of these amendments, did the Prime Minister or the Attorney-General or any other Minister conduct a meeting with the heads of all security agencies to co-ordinate the approach to be taken in respect of the announcement. (4) Is it normal practice to convene a meeting of the heads of all security agencies when a government announcement is being made that may affect a security operation. (5) Was the timing of the raids which led to the arrest of numerous terrorism suspects in Melbourne and Sydney brought forward as a result of the Prime Minister’s announcement. (1) to (4) The issue of the specificity of the terrorist offences in the Criminal Code had been raised in various contexts for some months prior to the legislative amendments. The Government commissioned a review of counter-terrorism laws after the London bombing which included whether amendments were needed to the terrorist act offences. This work was progressed through normal Government processes, including the involvement of intelligence and law enforcement agencies, over July– November 2005. Setting legislative priorities is a balancing act which can be rapidly modified by changing events. The London bombing on 7 July 2005 was such an event.

(5) No. BHP Billiton (Question No. 2758) Ms Bird asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 1 December 2005: (1) Has the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) been approached by Mr John Edwin Pink regarding BHP Billiton and concerns about the company’s share price. (2) What action has ASIC taken on Mr Pink’s concerns. (3) Is it a requirement that questions put by a shareholder at a company annual general meeting must be answered by the relevant company executive. (1) ASIC advises that Mr Pink first approached ASIC in May 2001 raising his concerns about a fall in the BHP share price in 1997. ASIC advises that Mr Pink’s concerns were also referred to it by the NSW Attorney General’s Department in November 2001. (2) ASIC advises that it assessed Mr Pink’s concerns, both at the time of his initial complaint and following the referral from the NSW Attorney General’s Department. ASIC concluded that the facts identified by Mr Pink did not support his allegations of wrongdoing. Accordingly, ASIC did not take any further action in regard to Mr Pink’s allegations. (3) Section 250S of the Corporations Act 2001 (the Corporations Act) requires the chair of an annual general meeting (AGM) to allow reasonable opportunity for the members as a whole at the meeting to ask questions about, or make comments on, the management of the company. Under section 250T of the Corporations Act, the chair must also allow reasonable opportunity for members as a whole at the meeting to ask the auditor questions relevant to the audit and the preparation and content of the auditor’s report. Further, section 250PA allows a member of a listed company who is entitled to vote at the AGM to submit a written question to the auditor prior to the AGM. Universities (Question No. 2783) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, in writing, on 5 December 2005: (1) Are universities required to follow rules on the use of funds provided (a) for Commonwealth Supported Places and (b) from Student Contributions; if so, (i) do the rules preclude the use of the funds for teaching or recruiting international or full fee students and (ii) how does his department (DEST) monitor compliance.

(4) Did the University assign the costs identified in part (3) to funds sourced from DEST and other funds; if so, what amount and proportion of the sum spent on each trip was paid from each source. (5) Does the University pay the Vice-Chancellor’s salary from funds sourced exclusively from DEST; if not, from what source or sources was the Vice-Chancellor’s salary funded for (a) 2002, (b) 2003, (c) 2004, and (d) the period 1 January to 30 June 2005. Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Universities may use the funds they receive for Commonwealth supported places through the Commonwealth Grant Scheme (CGS) and from student contributions for their general operations subject to compliance with the Higher Education Support Act 2003 (HESA) and guidelines made under the Act. Guidelines made under HESA require higher education providers to charge fee-paying overseas students a tuition fee that is sufficient to recover the full cost of delivering a course. My Department monitors compliance with the legislative provisions in HESA, including through the data submitted by providers as part of the Student Data Collection, the Audited Financial Statements and the Institutional Assessment Framework. (2) (3), (4), (5) La Trobe University, like all Australian universities, is an autonomous institution; as such it is not required to provide the information referred to in Questions (2) and (3) to the Australian Government. According to La Trobe University accounts for 2004/05, the university received 61.5 per cent of its total operating revenue from Australian Government sources (including HECS). The costs referred to by the Member are not sourced in the University’s accounts to individual lines of income. The manner in which each university utilises Commonwealth funding is conditional on each university complying with the quality and accountability requirements, in accordance with Section 19 of the Higher Education Support Act 2003. The quality and accountability measures require all higher education providers, including La Trobe University, to present a financial statement annually to my Department, verifying that they are, and are likely to remain, financially viable. These financial statements do not require individual expenditure items to be matched to sources of revenue. Universities’ financial statements are audited by the relevant State Government under whose legislation the University is constituted and governed. My Department is not supplied with to the details of an individual university’s financial and travel accounts. La Trobe University’s governing council has publicly stated its intention to conduct an independent audit of travel by all senior management staff. Military Detention: Mr David Hicks (Question Nos 2788 and 2789) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 5 December 2005: (1) On what date did the United States Government (a) capture and (b) charge Mr David Hicks. (2) For what period has Mr Hicks been imprisoned by the United States Government at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. (3) Is Mr Hicks entitled to the presumption of innocence. (4) What is he doing to ensure Mr Hicks receives a fair trial. (1) (a) Mr Hicks was captured by Northern Alliance forces in Afghanistan in early December 2001. He was handed into United States custody by the Northern Alliance. I do not know the exact date that occurred. (b) Mr Hicks was charged on 10 June 2004. (2) Mr Hicks was transferred to Guantanamo Bay in January 2002. (3) Yes. (4) The Government has consistently urged the United States to ensure Mr Hicks’ trial proceeds as expeditiously as possible. The Government has had discussions with the United States administration regarding the Military Commission system. The Government obtained additional commitments relating to Australian detainees which will apply to Mr Hicks’ case. Those commitments include the following: Based upon the specific facts of his case, the United States has assured Australia that it will not seek the death penalty in Mr Hicks’ case. Australia and the United States agreed to work towards putting arrangements in place to transfer Mr Hicks to Australia, if convicted, to serve any penal sentence in Australia in accordance with Australian and United States laws. Conversations between Mr Hicks and his lawyers will not be monitored by the United States. The prosecution in Mr Hicks’ case does not intend to rely on evidence in its case-in-chief requiring closed proceedings from which Mr Hicks could be excluded. Subject to any necessary security restrictions, Mr Hicks’ trial will be open, the media will be present and Australian officials may observe the proceedings. The Australian Government may make submissions to the Review Panel which would review Mr Hicks’ Military Commission trial. Should Mr Hicks choose to retain an Australian lawyer with appropriate security clearances as a consultant to his legal team, that person may have direct face-to-face communications with their client. Mr Hicks may talk to his family via telephone and two family members are permitted to attend his trial. An independent legal expert sanctioned by the Australian Government may observe the trial of Mr Hicks. Following the preliminary hearing in August 2004, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I instructed officials to seek some improvements to some operational and procedural aspects of the Military Commission process. A number of improvements, including to the rules of procedure, have occurred since then and the Government will continue to monitor the process. Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Question No. 2801) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 7 December 2005: (1) In respect of the communiqué of the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting held in Malta from 25 to 27 November 2005, what specific representations has the Australian Government made to encourage other Commonwealth Member States to (a) accede to and effectively implement the United Nations Conventions and Protocols related to terrorism, (b) support the conclusion of a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism during the sixtieth session of the United Nations General Assembly and support the early entry into force of the International Convention",168,Questions In Writing

(1) Australia was actively involved in negotiations to draft the communiqué of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) held in Malta from 25 to 27 November 2005. The final communiqué was endorsed by all CHOGM delegation heads, including the Prime Minister.

Major Powers and Global Interests Branch (Question No. 2811) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 7 December 2005: (1) How many Australian Public Service and Australian Defence Force personnel are currently employed in the Major Powers and Global Interests Branch of the Department of Defence; and within each of the four sections that comprise the Branch: United States section; Europe Middle East and Rest of the World Section; United Nations, Peace Operations Section; and Space Programs Section. (2) Who is currently serving as the Assistant Secretary, Major Powers and Global Interests Branch; and who are the Directors of the four sections within the Branch.",171,Questions In Writing
245,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) The precise number of people within the Major Powers and Global Interests Branch (MPGI) in Defence varies over time but, as at 10 January 2006, there were 29 positions in the Branch– 28 Australian Public Service positions and 1 Australian Defence Force position. The Branch now has five sections: Americas section (5 positions); Joint Facilities and Technical Programs section (4 positions); Iraq section (5 positions); Afghanistan/Middle East section (7 positions); and United Nations Europe, Africa and Peace Operations (6 positions). The final two positions making up the 29 are the Branch Head and the Branch Administration Officer. The responsibilities of MPGI Branch changed with the creation of a fourth Branch in International Policy Division in mid-January 2006. After this re-organisation, one Branch will have responsibility for Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Middle East, Africa and United Nations Peace Operations. Another Branch will cover the United States and Joint Facilities, as well as Europe and the Americas. This Branch will also assume responsibility for North and South Asia from the existing Asia Branch. (2) The current Assistant Secretary MPGI is Mr John Owens. As a matter of policy, Defence does not publicly identify non-Senior Executive Service officers. Ecuador (Question No. 2813) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 7 December 2005: (1) Has he read the email titled ‘Shipwreck in the Galapagos Islands’ sent to him on 26 November 2005, by survivors of the sinking of the Darwin Explorer near Puerto Auyora, Santa Cruz, Galapagos Islands, Ecuador, on 13 September 2005. (2) Can he confirm that despite registering with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) before leaving Australia they found it very difficult to notify the Government of their plight because: (a) there is no facility for notifying DFAT of this kind of trouble via the Internet and (b) they could not notify DFAT of the loss of their passports as they were prevented access to the necessary DFAT webpage because they could not provide a passport expiry date. (3) Can he confirm that the contact information regarding the Australian Consulate in Guayaquil, Ecuador, provided on the DFAT website on 13 September 2005, was misleading because the Government had already closed this office. (4) When was the Australian Consulate in Guayaquil, Ecuador, closed. (5) What is the Government doing to ensure Australian travellers can more easily contact DFAT in the event of an emergency where passports or other documents have been lost. (6) Will he seek an explanation from the Government of Ecuador regarding the circumstances and the cause of the sinking of the Darwin Explorer; if not, why not. (7) What is the Government’s travel warning for Ecuador and when was this warning first posted. (8) Can he confirm that in this region over the past ten years eleven passenger ships have sunk and two passenger ships have run aground; if not, why not. (9) Has the Government warned Australian travellers about this poor safety record; if so, when; if not, why not. (10) What is the Government doing to improve the warnings provided to Australians travelling to the Galapagos Islands. (1) Yes",172,Questions In Writing
246,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) (a) The on-line register is used to help consular officers find travellers in the event of an emergency. Australians overseas can contact the 24 hour DFAT Consular Emergency Centre on 1300 555 135, or any of our overseas missions to seek assistance. (b) Measures have been implemented on the passports website, in light of the increasing incidence of identity theft, to make it more secure and to prevent the online cancellation of passports by individuals who are not the rightful holders. In order to report a passport lost or stolen, people are required to provide the name of their guarantor or, in the event of the passport’s having been renewed, the expiry date. If a holder is unable to provide the required details for cancelling the passport online, they can submit an email, the address of which is located under Contact Us on the Passports webpage. Alternatively, by following the Smartraveller link from the Passports webpage, they will immediately see a 24-hour emergency contact phone number which is a free call from anywhere in the world. They would be put through to the DFAT Watch Office which would, by asking for some personal details from the passport holder to confirm identity, record the passport as lost. (3) The Australian Consulate in Guayaquil, Ecuador closed on 14 September 2005. The information on the DFAT website as of 13 September 2005 was accurate. (4) On 14 September 2005. (5) The government has provided a number of ways by which Australian travellers can contact DFAT to report their travel documents lost: (a) Via www.passports.gov.au; (b) By sending an email to passports.australia@dfat.gov.au; (c) By contacting the nearest Australian Embassy or Consulate (or Canadian mission providing consular assistance to Australians); (d) By phoning the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre (free call); (e) By phoning the Australian Passport Information Service in Australia or, after hours, the DFAT Watch Office; (f) By reporting the loss to Secure Sentinel– www.securesentinel.com.au (6) No. It is for the Ecuadorian authorities, and not the Australian government, to consider any maritime accident report and take any action arising from it. (7) The travel advice for Ecuador is available in full on the smartraveller website (www.smartraveller.gov.au). It advises Australians in Ecuador to exercise caution and monitor developments that might affect their safety because of the risk of terrorism and civil unrest. DFAT first issued a travel advice for Ecuador in October 1999. (8) No. DFAT does not collect statistics on shipping accidents. (9) The travel advice for Ecuador contains the following statement: “The safety standards Australians might expect of tour operators are not always met, including those operating in the Galapagos Islands. Written confirmation should be obtained from the travel agent or tour operator that their vessel is certified by the Ecuadorian navy to meet the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention standards.” (10) My Department keeps all its travel advisories under review to provide Australian travellers with a realistic understanding of the risks overseas, so they can make their own informed travel decisions in light of the potential risks. Melbourne Mailing Pty Ltd (Question No. 2822) Mr Bowen asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, in writing, on 8 December 2005: ‘Did the Minister’s department engage Melbourne Mailing Pty Ltd at a cost of $27,500: if so, what services were provided under the terms of this contract.’ following answer to the honourable member’s question: On1 April 2005, following an open tender process, the Department commenced a three year contract with Melbourne Mailing Pty Ltd for the provision of a mailing house service for the receipt, storage and distribution of citizenship kits, affirmation kits and other citizenship products.

(a) The Commonwealth sold the property to the State of Victoria on 13 December 1999. (b) In the Sale Agreement the State of Victoria acknowledged the heritage significance of the property and that the property was listed on the Victorian Heritage Register, which bound Victoria to comply with the requirements of the Heritage Act 1995 (Vic) in relation to the property. Victoria acknowledged that it must endeavour to maintain the heritage integrity of the property which included (but was not limited to) complying with the conservation management plan by Works Australia dated 1996 for the property, a copy of which was provided by the Commonwealth to Victoria.

DFAT did not have a Section 31 agreement in place in 1997-98 for the period 1 July 1997 to 17 May 1998, resulting in contraventions of Section 83 of the Constitution and Section 48 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997.
