That is what we object to to. It is interesting that one of the things that primarily in this bill. kept coming back during those consultations The Howard government’s move to reright around the country was people saying, move compulsory student unionism was a ‘Wow, do you know that for over a decade great advance for freedom in this country. we have been stripped of our funding, we The freedom to choose whether you want to have been slugged with further debt and not join a union or not is a fundamental freedom once have we seen the government actually that the Howard government stood up for. come out and talk to us and ask us about The government have decided they do not what we think.’ So it was quite newsworthy want to have a battle about freedom, because to many students at universities around the country that the government did indeed take Liberal Party demonstrating that they would the time to do that. rather pretend that this is the same debate The one other thing that I will correct the that we have had in the past, and instead they member opposite on which is also clearly have chosen to rely upon misinformation, very, very wrong is this view that the minisfalsehoods such as those that we heard from ter has discretion on the guidelines.

245,Mr Rudd (Griffith,"Prime Minister)Thursday, 19 March 2009 ----Petition: Pensioners sioners League to the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives. The petition draws the attention of the House to the following motion-moved by MrK Keeley, seconded and passed by financial members undersigned-that ‘a petition be circulated for the amount of the single pension to be increased to 75 per cent of married couples’ allowance immediately and also that the pension rate be increased before 1 July 2009’. It was seconded by J. Glanville and carried unanimously. The principal petitioner was Grace Johnson, who has written to me, ‘I certify that there were 570 petitioners.’ These are members of our local pensioner organisation. They do a good job; they are very dedicated to their members. It comes as no surprise to honourable members, especially those who are close to their communities, that the matter of the increase of the pension has been left to one side for too long. Notwithstanding the fact that the previous government introduced the there was a utilities allowance; and notwithstanding the fact that there was a bonus, pensioners really do need an increase. We went through the business of the drought, where fruit and vegetable prices increased; the increase in the price of petrol, which in areas where there is not a lot of public transport is a big problem; and, on top of that, pensioners, as a result of the real estate boom of two or three years ago, saw increases in rents without an appropriate adjustment through the rent allowance. So, all in all, pensioners have had a pretty tough time. I fully support this move. I think single pensioners are suffering quite dramatically. I have a church organisation in Hervey Bay that runs one of those supermarkets with out-of-date lines and bulk commodities and so on, and they tell me they are seeing 1,400 people a week. Fourteen hundred people in a fairly affluent town like Hervey Bay just says how hard the economic conditions are biting, and I think they fall very heavily on pensioners. I will be forwarding this petition to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions and I hope honourable members will take into account in future debates the call from the pensioners league. Capricornia Electorate: Electronic Funds Transfer Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (9.40 am)-I want to raise an issue that has come to my attention in my electorate concerning a constituent called Cheryl Daly. On 18 February this year, Cheryl went to a Rock Building Society ATM on the Capricorn coast to withdraw $360 from her Commonwealth Bank account. As it turned out, the ATM did not dispense her any cash. The customers following Cheryl in line to use the ATM were told that it was empty. Cheryl immediately went to another ATM to check her account balance and found that, indeed, the $360 had gone from her account-but of course she was not holding the cash. She phoned the Commonwealth Bank about the matter and the bank told her that she had to register a dispute to say that the money was missing. Cheryl also called the Rock Building Society, MAIN COMMITTEE",192,Aviation Legislation

247,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (9.37 Am),"I have received a petition from the Bundaberg Penwho informed her that they had to wait for the Commonwealth Bank to call them once the dispute was registered. This went on and on; we are talking about a chain of events which started on 18 February. Cheryl called the ATM disputes hotline five times during work hours and was getting no answers at all. She was repeatedly given different answers from the Commonwealth Bank on the time frame in which she should expect to receive her money-one week, two weeks, four weeks, six weeks. Finally, the ATM manager at the Rock Building Society did receive word from the Commonwealth Bank and released the $360 to Cheryl. This happened only a matter of days ago. The money was then transferred to the company that runs the ATM, which is Cashcard. We have two banks and a middle organisation in this story. The money sat in Cashcard’s hands for one week before further calls to the Commonwealth Bank led to Cheryl receiving the money yesterday. Cheryl feels that it is very unfair that this procedure took so long. I am sure all of us listening to this story here today are scratching our heads and wondering, in this day and age, when we have split-second electronic transfers and information technology at our fingertips, how this could take so long. I am told by ASIC that, in fact, there is a review going on at the moment into the Electronic Funds Transfer Code of Conduct, which all banks and financial institutions are supposed to abide by. That code of conduct has time limits for banks to observe in addressing these problems. They have 21 days in which to complete an investigation or advise of the need for more time to complete an investigation. Unless there are exceptional circumstances, an investigation is supposed to be complete within 45 days of receipt of the complaint. These periods of time are clearly too lengthy. This is a problem that ASIC recognises. There is a review into the EFT Code of Conduct, which I imagine all members of this House would support. I will certainly be writing a submission to that review telling them about what Cheryl suffered and asking them to review those time periods as a matter of urgency. (Time expired) Gilmore Electorate: Slice of Life Australia profit organisation whose purpose is to provide supported employment in hospitality for people with disabilities. I would like to read their story into the record, and to add how privileged I am to have been with them through their journey. Their story started in 2006 and took 18 months of difficult lobbying and several meetings with ministers and senators to obtain seed funding. Former senator Kay Patterson and I firmly believed in their proposal and went strongly into bat for the group. They were granted $25,000 and a two-year pilot project which allowed them to employ eight supported employees. Flagstaff Shoalhaven were given funding to guide them through all aspects of the establishment process. The pilot project was completed on 30 June 2008 and they were given a 12month stand-alone contract to prove their viability to deliver on their own. Just recently, they have been awarded their compliance certificate and they expect a decision on their status this month. I can only wish them well as they wait. Supported enthusiastically by Shoalhaven City Council, Slice of Life started their activities in the Reflections Cafe at the Shoalhaven Memorial Gardens Cemetery at Worrigee.

Slice of Life is presently working within the local community to establish a community style garden to provide disadvantaged people with an opportunity to connect with the earth and produce fresh vegetables in support of their commercial activities. In 2007, they were awarded the area consultative committee Stars of the Shoalhaven chairman’s award for community contribution, which was presented by the Governor General. Karen Anstiss, founder and managing director of Slice of Life, was awarded the Shoalhaven community boss of the year award in 2008. SOLA currently employs 17 local people, 14 of whom have a disability. Eight employees are supported by FaHCSIA under the disability enterprise scheme and nine others are supported by profit-making enterprises. SOLA have seven long standing volunteers, who are invaluable to the organisation. They provide work experience opportunities for schools and for local disability support organisations. SOLA’s turnover for the 2007-08 financial year was in excess of $250,000. This is an example of an enterprise that delivers on a number of fronts and one that is worthy of continued support to assist more disabled people who want to participate and contribute in her own right. I congratulate all who have been involved in the evolution of Slice of Life Australia. The community of Gilmore is very proud of Karen and her group of wonderful, special workers. Shortland Electorate: Prostate Research Centre Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.45 am)-Last Friday, I attended the official opening of the Hunter prostate research centre. As we all know, prostate cancer is a cancer that affects men. One in 1,000 men in their 40s will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, 12 in 1,000 in their 50s, 45 in 1,000 in their 60s, and 80 in 1,000 in their 70s. Prostate cancer is a disease that is more prevalent if one male in the family has had it. If a father has had it, his son’s chance of getting it is much greater. The Hunter prostate research centre will provide a holistic service to sufferers of prostate cancer and, in addition, will be an excellent research base. It is supported by the University of Newcastle and by the Hunter Medical Research Institute. I pay credit to Professor James Denham, a leading oncologist in this field, who has done a considerable amount of work. Forums were held in my electorate in 2005 and last year. The Treasurer attended the first of those forums and he and Professor Denham made presentations to well over 300 men who came to the sessions. Professor Denham’s vision was for this centre to be built in the Hunter, and he was able to achieve that because of the work of a number of people in the Hunter. I would particularly like to acknowledge Geoff Fryer, a survivor of prostate cancer, who donated $1 million of his own money towards the establishment of the centre. The Minister for Defence, the member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon, is patron of the centre. On the day of the official opening, Geoff Fryer and John Sakoff cut the ribbon. Leigh Maughan, who has added an extra dimension to the centre and to the profile of prostate cancer in the Hunter, was the emcee. I congratulate everybody that was associated with the day. I know that the centre will grow and thrive. MAIN COMMITTEE Petition: Fernlea House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions. The petition read as followsTO THE HONOURABLE THE SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPREThis petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the plight of Fernlea House which provides palliative care and support for people with a life limiting illness and their carers and, since opening in September 2005 has demonstrated the need for a service of this nature in the local area. Fernlea House Day Hospice has had more than 1600 attendances. This equates to more than 130 carer families having benefited from the support given to them. The service is supported by 88 trained Volunteers, recruited from the local community. We, members of the community, support this Project and want to ensure that Femlea House remains open. We therefore ask the House to support us in requesting that the Federal Government guarantee ongoing funding for Fernlea House. from 1,021 citizens Petition received. I would first of all like to say a large thankyou to Carl Robins from the Belgrave Rotary Club, who sponsored the petition, along with the Fernlea House Committee. Fernlea House came into being after Jan Lancaster donated a house to this great cause. In the 2004 election, as one of my election promises I gave a core promise to provide $800,000, simply because we had no local palliative care hospice. Sadly, in the Rudd government’s 2008-09 budget there was no additional funding for Fernlea House-and, believe it or not, they gave it only six weeks to close down, which is an absolute disgrace. We had an outcry from the volunteers, and media identities such as Derryn Hinch got behind the plight of Fernlea House. The Minister for Ageing, Justine Elliot, gave Fernlea House another 12 months. Sadly, that funding will run out in June this year. I am glad that the shadow minister for ageing, Margaret May, is sitting beside me; she has given her full support and I thank her. It is a shame that the government will not be looking after Fernlea House. Remember that these are dying and sick people in their final days. This government needs to show some compassion. I thank all those people who signed this petition. They realise how vital this issue is to the electorate of La Trobe and how vital it is to make sure that people who are in their final moments have quality of life, staying at Fernlea House, where we have fantastic volunteers doing an amazing job. I plead with the government to overturn its decision and make money available in this year’s budget.

Barramundi was not the only thing that hooked him in Karumba. He built his life around the people in that community, whom he would later go on to serve with great distinction in local government. Over a period of 23 years, Councillor Wilson served in public office and as the Mayor of Carpentaria Shire Council for seven years, and as the deputy mayor for another seven years. Councillor Wilson held the position of mayor until his death earlier this month. Councillor Wilson will be remembered for his time on the Carpentaria Shire Council as being a strong advocate for the gulf region-one of those self-reliant, grumpy people who stand up for their community in all circumstances, as an advocate, a builder and a defender of their community. They are wonderful people and Councillor Wilson was one of them and their leader. He worked closely with neighbouring shires and lobbied tirelessly for better services and infrastructure. That is how I met him, on a visit to Normanton, where Les showed his true nature both as a wonderful host and as a tough advocate for his shire and community. One of the things all successful sustainable regional communities have in common is that sense of self-motivation. Sustainable communities are made up of people with a can-do attitude and a visible, proactive response to change and challenges. Councillor Wilson demonstrated that he was always prepared to stand up and be counted. He was genuinely interested in sustainable solutions to providing employment and to keeping his community growing and vibrant. He played a significant role in the success of the local regional development agenda. He was always striving to develop innovative ways to reduce ratepayer costs and deliver superior services. He cared deeply about his community and often volunteered behind the scenes at community events and organisations. At the event I attended he was the host, the barman and in charge of the barbecue. He cared so deeply about his community. He volunteered for his rural fire brigade service, his SES and his volunteer marine rescue-he was a person who walked the walk and talked the talk. Councillor Wilson cared deeply for his family and is survived by his partner, Donna; his sons, Ian and Brian; and his grandchildren, Tara, Ella and James. Petition: Pensioners in support of older Australians. This petition, which I have with me this morning, has been signed by 7,090 older Australians. It is in support of those older Australians that I bring this petition to the House. The petition was brought about by the principal petitioner, Janice Elizabeth Holmes, who is the President of the Coolangatta Senior Citizens Centre in my electorate on the Gold Coast. The senior citizens group has hundreds of members and they were very concerned last year at the plight of senior Australians in this country. They are calling on the government to ensure, in the light of the released Harmer report, that senior Australians maintain a reasonable standard of living through the pension system. We hope that in this year’s budget senior Australians on pensions will see some increase in that pension. I would like to make special mention of a number of colleagues who have also had this petition running in their own electorates throughout Australia-the Hon.

I think everybody in this House knows just how tough it is out there at the moment. We do know we have a global financial crisis and we do know that senior Australians are having a difficult time. There is the rising cost of groceries and petrol-they are doing it tough. All of us in this House would want to ensure that senior Australians have the means by which they can take care of themselves, keep their well-being and their health in check and maintain a reasonably modest standard of living. These people are not asking for a lot, but they are certainly asking for a helping hand at the moment. I hope the Harmer report, which I know has been handed to the minister, will see some support through the budget process in May this year. I commend all those who have supported the petition-my colleagues and those senior Australians throughout Australia. I present that petition to the House today. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of older Australians draws to the attention of the House: the Rudd Government has overlooked senior Australians in the Budget pensioners are not able to maintain a reasonable standard of living because of the rising cost of living hundreds of thousands of pensioners are struggling to make ends meet which is impacting on their health and well-being.

Neighbourhood Centres Ms SAFFIN (Page) (9.57 am)-I raise an issue of importance to local neighbourhood centres, which provide vital social welfare services in my electorate and indeed in communities around Australia. I should point out that neighbourhood centres-or neighbourhood houses and learning centres, as they are known in other states-provide a range of community development activities and social welfare support in response to their communities. In Page there are neighbourhood centres in Lismore, Casino, Evans Head and South Grafton. Each centre runs a broad range of programs addressing local community needs including those for young people, Aboriginal youth, aged care, disabilities, child sexual assault, early intervention, child care and much more. Neighbourhood centres are non-profit organisations managed by voluntary committees and operated by part-time staff and volunteers. Most rely on a mix of government funding and fundraising or fee-for-service programs. Unfortunately, most neighbourhood centres are restricted in their access to other possible streams of income because they are not eligible for deductible gift recipient status under the tax legislation. To be eligible for DGR status a welfare agency needs to correctly fit the definition of a public benevolent institution, although MAIN COMMITTEE that status does not guarantee that they will get DGR. The definition of a ‘public benevolent institution’ is that it exists for the relief of poverty, sickness, suffering, distress, misfortune, destitution or helplessness, but this does not allow for activities which are preventative in nature-that is, which prevent people from becoming destitute or which give them more weight than the public benevolent institution definition. I wish to speak in support of the proposal put forward by the Association of Neighbourhood Houses and Learning Centres, ANHLC, that the charity tax laws recognise preventative approaches to addressing disadvantage. The main advantage of DGR status for neighbourhood centres is that some corporate and philanthropic donors will only provide funding to organisations that have DGR status. At present only seven per cent of neighbourhood centres qualify for this. I believe strongly in the old adage that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure; so it is with neighbourhood centres. Their services include programs that build resilient communities and help people avoid social exclusion. I commend the work of the neighbourhood centres in my electorate and their dedicated local managers: Noeline Olive at Casino, Paul Cruickshank at Lismore, Gretchen Young at the Mid Richmond Neighbourhood Centre and Skye Sears at the South Grafton neighbourhood house. AlthoughI cannot mention them all by name, I also want to acknowledge the work of the employees, volunteers and voluntary board members who keep these vibrant and vital community service centres operating and help to build resilient communities. Casey Electorate: Victorian Bushfires outer suburban Melbourne and regional Victoria, we have seen a wonderful community spirit and great volunteerism. We have seen it at so many levels, most particularly with our emergency services and at the relief centres at Yarra Glen and Healesville, right on the edge of my electorate of Casey. We have seen a volunteer spirit and determination to get in and help people affected at so many levels, and it has really been a touching example that has answered the question that many commentators have been asking for the last 10 or 20 years about whether community spirit is still alive in Australia in the way it was in the decades after the war. It is refreshing that that has been answered emphatically. We should not have been surprised, because Australians always pull together in times of difficulty. The fires have touched communities at so many levels. In the midst of a horror like the one around Melbourne-as you, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, would know, representing an electorate not far from mine-people naturally reach out for some good news. One of the most touching photos that appeared was of a CFA worker giving an injured kangaroo some watersland-very good! I am sure one of them did give a kangaroo some water as well, but you are right-the photo was of a koala. Numbers of people have spent countless hours and dollars trying to help the wildlife.

It is a touching story at the end of what has been a very terrible time for the Yarra Valley and the outer east. Deakin Electorate: Prue Ward woman I met a few weeks ago, when the Minister for Employment Participation, Brendan O’Connor, came to visit my electorate to hold a disability roundtable. This focused on workplace experiences for people with chronic illnesses, carers and employers in my electorate of Deakin and of course beyond those boundaries as well. It was held at the Nerve Centre in Blackburn, which is also home to groups such as MS Australia and BrainLink. In particular, BrainLink assists those people who have an acquired brain injury. Prue Ward was 27 years old in 2005 and working full time as a veterinary nurse when she was involved in a car accident whilst on her way to work. Prue suffered a fractured skull, bruising and swelling of the brain and a fractured collarbone and pelvis. As a result of the car crash, Prue also acquired a brain injury. After quite a long period of time, when Prue was ready to return to work, her boss, Dr Bill Harkins, and practice manager Natalie Burns welcomed her back and told her they were focused on her strengths rather than what she was unable to do. And there are some things that Prue can no longer do, such as lift heavy animals. That is quite a common occurrence of course in a vet’s practice. But Bill assures us that she is their best outpatient nurse and her skills are in working with clients one on one. Again, that is a very important part of any veterinary practice. The practice clients were certainly very supportive and happy to see her back, but it has been trial and error finding the right balance for Prue. When she first returned to work she was able to contribute four hours per week, but then went up to 22 hours. She found that was too much and is now stable on 15 hours. Although sometimes she feels she should be putting in more and doing more tasks than she does, it is an agreed outcome whereby everyone benefits, both Prue and the employer. Her colleagues also make sure that she does not work too hard and suffer from that. Prue told Minister O’Connor and I that her return to work gave her a feeling of normality and a sense of purpose. She says that it is great to be able to do some of the things that she used to. I congratulate Dr Bill Harkins, practice manager Natalie Burns and all the staff at Blackburn Animal Hospital for their approach to Prue’s return to work. AndI commend the courage and determination shown by Prue Ward in returning to the profession that she loves. I also commend the great work that BrainLink does for so many other people who have suffered an acquired brain injury. Member for Deakin, having known BrainLink’s great work and their terrific CEO. In accordance with standing order 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. MAIN COMMITTEE",199,Sentatives

256,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"I associate myself with your remarks also,Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Egypt and Israel Debate resumed from 16 March, on motion by Ms Annette Ellis: That the House take note of the document. delegation that visited Israel, Egypt and also the West Bank. The delegation was ably led by the honourable member for Canberra, Ms Ellis, and also included, as deputy leader, the honourable member for Maranoa, Mr Scott, Senator the Hon. Richard Colbeck, Senator Gavin Marshall and Senator Glenn Sterle. The delegation secretary was Ms Lyn Witheridge of the Department of the House of Representatives. As so often happens on delegations, political differences are set apart because we have been selected by the parliament to represent the parliament and Australia abroad. I would like to compliment the missions which were responsible for organising our visit: the Australian embassy in Cairo, the Australian embassy in Tel Aviv and also the representative office in Ramallah. The program was a very full and busy program, and we were in that part of the world in the run-up to the Israeli elections. Israel and Egypt are two geographically close countries but they have quite different political systems. Through the visit to the two countries, as the delegation travelled, we were able to ascertain the challenges confronting the government and the people of Egypt, particularly given the fact that President Mubarak is not as young as he once was. It was also fascinating to be in Israel prior to the recent elections. I often believe that Israel is judged by First World standards, yet actions by some people in other countries around Israel are judged by Third World standards. The world is sometimes particularly harsh on Israel because we sometimes expect it to have higher standards than the standards of people who seek to undermine that country. Israel is a vigorous and robust multiparty democracy. It was refreshing to be there and to talk to people. We were privileged, through the meetings that were organised, to get an insight into the likely outcome of the election, and a number of people predicted what actually happened on polling day. We were there before Israel’s action in Gaza. It is easy to understand how a civilised nation simply cannot permit rockets to pour down from the sky onto its population, threatening life and property. Numerous people have been killed in Israel as a result of rockets, particularly those launched from the Gaza Strip, an area which is controlled by the Hamas terrorist organisation. I believe that it really is important for discussion to take place-and I have to say that I found the work of the Peres Centre for Peace quite inspirational. It seeks to bring together Arabs and Israelis and to make sure that there can be a positive prognosis for the future, because, geography being what it is, the Arab population and the Israeli Jewish population will continue to live side by side. There are enormous difficulties. There have been discussions in relation to the so-called barrier fence. That construction, while inconveniencing Arabs on many occasions, has been built by the Israelis as a means of reducing the incidence of suicide bombing. I have been in Israel before, and I heard some chilling stories of how suicide bombing occurs. Everyone tells MAIN COMMITTEE",200,Sentatives
257,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (10.07 Am),"I was privileged to be a member of the parliamentaryus, though, that the barrier, while inconveniencing many Arabs, in fact has been successful in dramatically reducing the number of people who are murdered by suicide bombings. We were in one town, Ashkelon, on the same day as rockets rained down from the Gaza Strip. It is very close to Gaza. We did not know at the time that that had happened. It is very difficult for people to go about their everyday lives living under the threat of rocket attack. It is unfortunate that Hamas controls the Gaza Strip. If Fatah were in charge there, as it is on the West Bank, I am sure that the difficulties we have seen in recent times would not have occurred. I believe that Egypt has played a very constructive and worthwhile role in the Middle East. The fact that Egypt entered into diplomatic relations a very long time ago with Israel has meant that those two countries have been able to talk through their differences, and they have a relatively healthy relationship. The problem of Palestinian refugees is ongoing, and I suppose the indoctrination of young Arabs is a major difficulty as well. We spoke to a person who was responsible for Palestinian Media Watch. The idea of this program is to monitor what is being shown to Palestinians by Palestinian media. Some of the material that is broadcast amounts to indoctrination or brainwashing and encourages young Palestinians to hate the Israelis. This is a very negative start to life, and it is unfortunate. We visited the Dheisheh refugee camp with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and we had a briefing by Mr Thomas White, the deputy director of operations for the West Bank. We had a tour and people were certainly friendly, but I must say that as we were walking around I was quite shocked when two very small boys-they may have been five or sixwho had machine guns made out of wood pretended to mow us down. What worried me was the fact that young Palestinians at that age have that degree of hatred for people from the West. Is it any wonder that a number of them, when they grow up, in fact go on to carry out some of the terrorist activities which have appalled us all? Delegations these days work very hard, and this delegation was no exception. The report is a comprehensive report of what we achieved. My own understanding of Egypt, Israel and the West Bank has been substantially enhanced by the fact that I was privileged to represent the parliament as a member of this delegation. In particular, I would like to thank the ambassadors, Her Excellency Ms Stephanie Shwabsky in Cairo and His Excellency Mr James Larsen in Tel Aviv. Coincidentally, the ambassador’s wife, Mrs Larsen, is the daughter of a former Australian ambassador to Israel. In fact, she is living in the house that she lived in when she was a small child. The support staff from the two embassies were quite outstanding as well and it made our visit so much more worthwhile and productive to have people on the ground who put together a particularly good program. I thoroughly enjoyed the visit and I hope it enhanced the already good relationships between Australia and Egypt and Australia and Israel. I would like to see more delegations to that part of the world because we as a country need to understand the challenges confronting the Middle East. It is a place where people from different ethnic origins have lived together in a hostile environment for a very long time. Debate (on motion by Mr Hayes) adjourned. MAIN COMMITTEE Electoral Matters Committee Report Debate resumed from 16 March, on motion by Mr Melham: That the House take note of the report. to the committee’s report, I offer the chamber the apologies of my colleague, Mr Danby, the member for Melbourne Ports. He would have liked to have spoken on this report, being a member of the committee, but, as we all know, from time to time there are conflicting responsibilities and so he is not able to be with us here today. It is now fairly common knowledge that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has not supported the continuation of the trial of electronic voting that was introduced as a consequence of the report of the committee in response to matters raised after the 2004 federal election. That does not mean that the idea of electronic voting for either ADF personnel or vision impaired people is a bad idea. What it really means is that this was not the method that is going to be the solution to the main problem. The main problem I believe was the rate at which people in those two groups have been able to exercise their franchise to vote. Put very simply: this system was too clunky and too expensive. At the outset I acknowledge the disappointment of the vision impaired community. For the first time, some of them were able to exercise a secret vote if they had access to the polling booths where this trial was conducted. The electronic-voting provisions for vision impaired people could not be extended to all vision impaired people in the country and, as both the chairman and the deputy chairman indicated when the report was introduced into the House of Representatives chamber, the cost was somewhat prohibitive, at $2,500 per vote cast. It is important to note that this report has not been able to recommend an alternative method of voting for vision impaired people beyond that which existed prior to this trial. Despite the committee’s rejection of the trial for ADF personnel, we were able to make a recommendation for a change to the electoral act and a recommendation relating to an administrative matter within the military to establish a process for voting that satisfies both the needs and the situational circumstances that ADF personnel sometimes find themselves in as well as the needs of the AEC. That system should ensure a greater participation rate of ADF personnel in voting. At this time we have not been able to make similar recommendations in regard to voting for vision impaired people. Anybody who has been following the public hearings of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters will have noticed that quite a deal of attention has been paid to electronic voting in general, and we discussed a number of issues at our most recent hearings. Electronic voting is not new. It has been used quite recently in relation to the primary voting for the US presidential election. There are many systems available. We are moving towards a situation where the community can trust that new systems are able to deliver a proper result, as is the case with the transparent methods of voting we currently use. Despite the claim that was made by the deputy chair of the committee, Mr Morrison, I am not necessarily conservative in these matters. I believe that we can move quite quickly with electronic transactions in relation to our franchise to vote simply by adopting a model similar to that used by banks. MAIN COMMITTEE",201,Delegation Reports
258,Mr Sullivan (Longman) (10.18 Am),"In standing to speak briefly on matters relatingI jealously guard my right to vote and my right to vote for my chosen candidate on every occasion-and my chosen candidate on every occasion would be no secret to most people. Some people like to be a little bit coy about who they vote for, but I am quite happy to admit it. I also guard my finances, yet I trust my finances to electronic banking. One of the reasons I do that is that it is very difficult to find the time in this job to go down to a bank to conduct transactions. I believe that over time we will gradually be able to move to a fully electronic voting system, similar to the system used for electronic banking. The system I use with my bank-and I will not give them an ad-is called NetBank. They provide me with an electronic account number that is attached to my bank account. I determine a password and I have to provide them with the answers to two questions as a further check that I or somebody to whom I have entrusted my information are the only people accessing the account. I think a similar system could work with the AEC. Hopefully we as a committee will move to make some recommendations with regard to one of the issues that confront us generally with people and their voting franchise, and that is making a change of address to your enrolment details. Apparently anybody who makes even a very small change to their enrolment details has to fill out the entire form, which is in itself a daunting form. If it can be done online we could ultimately arrive through that to a system whereby people can make an application for a postal ballot online. From that, we can arrange to arrive at a situation where that ballot paper will be issued online. I think ultimately we will be able to arrive at a situation where the electronic system is trusted to an extent that people will be able to vote online. I think that will enhance people’s access to their voting rights even more. The number of articles that have been appearing over recent years in newspapers, in magazines or on those television shows that follow the news-I cannot give them any title other than that, to be honest-about the uptake of the internet by elderly Australians is simply because their grandchildren are teaching them how to use it as a means to keep in contact. I think we are moving to a situation in this country where computer literacy is growing in all areas, particularly amongst the young, who are the least likely to be involved in the electoral process at the moment. My understanding from some evidence we were given in public hearings a few days ago is that only four in every five people aged between 18 and 24 are on the roll. Twenty per cent of young, new voters are not engaging with the system at this point. I believe that is the case. I also know that people with vision impairment are able to use and access their own computers using audio, voice technology and special keys. I think that if we can develop electronic transactioning with the Australian Electoral Commission along the lines of developing and building trust in that system amongst voters then we can get to a situation where a great deal of what we do in the process of conducting elections can happen online. For those of us who are considered to be practitioners, that does raise a particularly interesting point: how do we communicate with people who are going to vote? How do we place in the hands of a voter the information that we would like them to have before they make that decision? In the same way that those who seek to break the law seem to get hold of technology a lot quicker than those who seek to uphold the law, once technology changes are taking place in relation to people’s interaction with the electoral system, my political party and the political party of those sitting opposite will move very quickly to ensure that we are able to have those interacMAIN COMMITTEE tions that we believe we need with voters in order to have them exercise their vote in a way that we would like them to. They may not particularly be able to be encouraged to do that, but we have changes of government in this country and that clearly points to the fact that people are able to respond to the arguments that we make from time to time. As a member of the committee, it is unfortunate that as a consequence of the practical trial that was run in the 2007 election it has been determined that a recommendation will be made to government that that trial not be continued. That does not rule out trials of another nature at another time or that the government will pick up the recommendation. The government, in making its decision, will be mindful of what the committee has said about the trial. The report also encourages a continuous effort by the AEC to look at better ways to provide these opportunities, particularly for people with vision impairment. While we have made recommendations about the way in which the electronic-voting trial went for Australian Defence Force personnel serving overseas and have recommended some changes based on advice given to us by the AEC and the ADF, we have not had any advice from military personnel who availed themselves of the system as to how they felt it worked. Essentially, it was again too expensive and too clunky, particularly for the military, to operate. In closing, I thank all the members that I served with on the committee-the senators as well as the members of the House of Representatives. I particularly acknowledge the work of the committee staff, the secretary, Stephen Boyd; the inquiry secretary, Kai Swoboda; Terry Rushton, who is a great help with information of a technical nature; and administrative officers Renee Van Der Hoek and Natasha Petrovic. These people have served our committee well in the course of this inquiry and with the couple of small interim reports that we have released. I am sure that they will continue to provide us with excellent service as we move towards developing the principal report, which is not that far away. Debate (on motion by Mr Broadbent) adjourned. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (10.32 am)-I move: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. South Australian State Aquatic Centre Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (10.32 am)-I have spoken previously about the poor quality of road infrastructure in Adelaide. I would like to speak today about the poor quality of sporting infrastructure in Adelaide. It is one of the frustrations of residents in Adelaide that we lack so many topnotch sporting facilities. In recent times, Sydney has hosted an Olympic Games and Melbourne has hosted the Commonwealth Games. Both Perth and Melbourne have hosted world swimming championships, and yet Adelaide has not had a FINA standard swimming pool since the early 1990s. The notion of a having a FINA standard pool has been around for a long time-at least since 1998. This project has stalled several times. I was very pleased, together with the former sports minister Senator Rod Kemp and the former finance minister Senator Nick Minchin, to work very hard to get $15 million for a FINA standard pool to be built on land owned by the City of Marion. That $15 million has been sitting in the City of Marion’s account since 2006. It is now worth some $18 million. I am pleased to welcome the announcement made last month by the South Australian government that they will be proceeding with the design and construction of the South Australian State Aquatic Centre. MAIN COMMITTEE One of the issues was that Macquarie Leisure was a partner of this project and pulled out of this project in January. That was disappointing news. But I do welcome the announcement by the South Australian government that they will be taking over the design and construction of the South Australian State Aquatic Centre. They have said that construction of the centre will commence within the next few months, and is likely to be completed by mid-2010. When this facility is built it will cater to elite swimmers, club swimmers, and people who swim for exercise, leisure, or rehabilitation. It will cater to people with disabilities, the general community and people learning to swim. Swimming SA has announced that it will host the 2011 Australian Age Championships at the Marion venue and will also be bidding to host the 2012 Australian Swimming Championships that will be the trials for the London Olympics. This week the Australian Swimming Championships are being held but, unfortunately, Adelaide has not been able to host this event since the early 1990s due to the lack of a FINA standard pool. The South Australian State Aquatic Centre will be an $80 million project and will also be constructed with a $27 million GP Plus Health Care Centre in Marion. The City of Marion has contributed $5 million to the project, as well as land for the site which is valued at about $10 million. There are a number of design improvements in the new South Australian State Aquatic Centre. The depth of the main swimming pool will be increased to three metres. The seating capacity will be increased to 4,500. And there will be an installation of a depth-adjustable pool floor for leisure water and learn-to-swim activities. This is a very exciting development for the south-western suburbs. It does open up the possibility of South Australia bidding for a whole range of things, including national swimming championships, school games and, potentially, some FINA events as well. It is something that I welcome. It has been welcomed by South Australian swimmers, including dual Olympic medallist Hayden Stoeckel, and also world record holder and multiple Paralympic gold medallist, Matt Cowdrey. Kingston Electorate: Fleurieu Peninsula Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (10.37 am)-I rise today to speak on an issue of great importance, and also a key primary production sector in the electorate of Kingston, and that is the growing olives and olive oil. This is not often given much attention. However, many of us around the country use olive oil on a daily basis. The production of olive oil on the Fleurieu Peninsula is incredibly important to enrich our local area, both economically and culturally. This has been fostered in the Fiesta! food festival on the Fleurieu Peninsula. The Fleurieu Peninsula is well known for its great wines, through McLaren Vale and other areas, but what is not as well known is the great food that is produced there. Fiesta! is a festival that does focus on the food, and the wine that complements that food. And as part of Fiesta! there are olive awards which really focus on great olive oil. I have been lucky enough to taste it. It was a unique experience to be able to taste olive oil-usually you taste wine-but it was great. You could really start to taste some of the great flavours in the olive oil that comes from the Fleurieu Peninsula. Olive oils, and the growing of olives, are incredibly to my electorate. However, the production of olive oil in the region is not without its challenges. One of those challenges is water, as with many things in South Australia. MAIN COMMITTEE But another challenge that faces the industry is the lack of transparency in terms of labelling, and that is what I will focus on today. Australian olive oil generally, and certainly the oil produced on the Fleurieu Peninsula, is of world best standard. I believe we need to consider advocating a standard for olive oil here in Australia. One concern that has been raised by olive growers is that sometimes there can be fruit other than olives put into olive oil but that fact is not labelled. It is very important that there be a clear standard in Australia that olive oil is exactly that and is made from olive fruit. In addition, the terms ‘virgin olive oil’ and ‘extra virgin olive oil’ are often talked about. Most Australian families understand that, for health reasons, extra virgin olive oil is the best sort of oil to be using. Often we see oil coming into our country which is called extra virgin olive oil but is in fact not refined or extra refined and does not have the same ingredients that extra virgin olive oil has. This is of great concern to the olive oil producers of Australia because they are competing in an international market with oils that are not of as high a standard but are labelled in exactly the same way. However, I recognise the efforts of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. They recently went to Malaysia to try to get these international standards that are so important for olive oil. Unfortunately, they were not able to achieve that. However, they are going to continue to work with their international partners to ensure that these standards are met. This is an issue not only for the olive oil industry but also for many consumers. Certainly, consumers are very concerned about what they put into their mouths and they want to know that what they are eating and cooking with is what they believe they have bought. In addition, the olive oil industry has other concerns and they are certainly concerns that I share. It is important that consumers understand the difference between different types of oil. BeforeI looked into this area, I would often go and grab whatever olive oil was on the shelf because I felt that it had good properties. But getting Australian consumers to understand the different types of oil and the effect that they have on one’s cooking and one’s health is also very important. I certainly support information being made available to consumers to help them make the choice about which olive oil is best for their family. In conclusion, I congratulate the olive oil industry in Australia but also the olive industry in the Fleurieu Peninsula which do a great job. Mr Ronald Conway Conway, who died this week in Melbourne and who wrote Australia’s best-selling work of serious social criticism after Donald Horne’s Lucky Country. While Donald Horne’s title has become part of Australia’s self-description, that book is now a period piece. By contrast, there is a timeless quality to Ronald Conway’s Psycho-studies of Australian Society, especially his accounts of the dysfunctional Australian male. Conway described himself as a conservative and was a frequent strident critic of much that was associated with the modern world-consumerism, materialism, feminism and especially the post-Vatican Council disarray of institutional Catholicism. Yet he was far too aware of the complexity of the human condition, and especially of the power and ambiguity of human sexuality, ever to be a straightforward barracker for conventional thinking. In turn, Conway was a school teacher, a practising clinical psychologist, a university lecturer and, for 40 years, an advisor on priestly vocations for the Archdiocese of Melbourne. He appeared regularly on 1970s ABC TV programs such as Any Questions and hosted commerMAIN COMMITTEE",203,Committees
259,Mr Abbott (Warringah) (10.42 Am),"I rise to pay tribute to a great Australian, Ronaldcial radio programs in the 1980s. He wrote and produced plays and musicals, mostly for 1950s and 1960s Catholic festivals in Victoria. From the 1970s, until about five years ago, he was a regular contributor to newspapers such as the Australian and magazines such as Quadrant. His six books, though, are his most enduring contribution to Australians’ selfunderstanding. The Great Australian Stupor, published in 1971, was followed by two companion volumes: The Land of the Long Weekend, in 1978, and The End of Stupor, in 1985. Being Male was published in 1986 and The Rage for Utopia in 1992. In 1988, he published a slim but elegant autobiography. His work has not always been as well promoted as it deserved, because he was rarely entirely on any side. Much of his work has the capacity to surprise, dismay or exhilarate a wide range of readers. Instead of cementing his position in the first rank of Australian public intellectuals, however, many thought that this made him not quite trustworthy. The danger is that his insights will be forgotten because they are not sufficiently partisan, even though he stands to the analysis of social behaviour in Australia as much as Edmund Burke does to conservative political thinking. Long before it was fashionable to feel people’s pain, Conway was quick to discern inner need, and for thousands of students, clients and friends he opened the doors of the emotional prisons that they had conducted for themselves. He had a strong sense of vocation to help people to look unflinchingly at what they really are and to make the best of it. Conway was almost addicted to making judgments but he was never judgmental. Long before the men’s movement, Conway was drawing Australian males out of the sterile macho ghetto of too little deep thought, too much manic activity, and emotional intimacy only with fellow drinkers. His particular gift was to help young men to understand that masculine love did not mean they would become sooks. As a university student, I had been much struck by a passage in The Land of the Long Weekend quoting a soldier of the First AIF’s letter home: When Jim died last week I took him in my arms, kissed him and cried like a baby. I loved that stupid big cow with my guts. I suppose June will think I’ve turned queer or something but she knows me better than that. They say the old Spartan fighters used to take men lovers into battle. I know we used to laugh ourselves silly when we read about it at school … men cuddling up to one another and all that sort of stuff. But I used to sleep very close to Jim more than once in the trenches … It felt good, decent, even grand to be close … Why didn’t Dad or someone tell me that when I was home? Why did I have to come over here to this dirty butcher’s shop of guns and broken bodies to find out? Where is Conway when so many feckless young gods are in such obvious need of a mentor? This philosopher of human frailty was a great Australian. He was indeed a prophet and he should be honoured in his own country. Robertson Electorate: Central Coast Mariners Ms NEAL (Robertson) (10.47 am)-I rise with pleasure this morning to pay tribute to the Central Coast Mariners, a team I certainly strongly support on the Central Coast and a team that has become very much a community icon. Only four years ago the Hyundai A-League was established, and I congratulate Frank Lowy for his foresight and his commercial commitment in getting such a wonderful competition off the ground. It has certainly been something that has really played a great hand in defining the Central Coast and giving it an identity, something we have been seeking for some time. MAIN COMMITTEE The Central Coast is located between Sydney and Newcastle and is often overlooked. People who see a reference to the Central Coast often consider that it is somewhere near Coffs Harbour, halfway between Sydney and Brisbane, but that is not the case. What has happened with the Central Coast Mariners is a clear statement to the rest of the world that we do exist and we do have an identity, and that team has been very much embraced by the community. The Central Coast Mariners have been there only for four short years but they have met with success, both in terms of the games they have played and the wins they have had. They have been in the final series in every one of those four years, and in two of those years they have been in the grand final. Unfortunately, we have yet to secure the great success of winning a grand final, but I am sure that that is not too far away. We had the great pleasure of being selected, because of our success last season, for the Asian Football Cup, and we have had the pleasure not only of seeing the Central Coast Mariners playing in China and other Asian countries, but also of seeing Asian countries come to play here in Australia-in fact, at our own Bluetongue stadium in Gosford. It is a stadium that I always say has the best view in Australia. I do not know whether it is the best use of land to have a stadium that has water views, but you can either watch the football and enjoy that or look across the water and enjoy that view at the same time, so it is certainly a fantastic venue. The Central Coast Mariners are in the Asian Football Cup. They had a fantastic game against Tianjin last night in China. Unfortunately, it was a two-all draw. There were some expectations during the game that they would win it by two to one, but unfortunately that did not take place. But I am certainly confident that they will continue to have success and hopefully they will play in the finals of the H group, where they are placed. I would also like to say that it is my great pleasure to see the commencement this season of the W-League as an adjunct to the Hyundai A-League. It really is a great thing to see women soccer players able to play professionally. They are not yet paid in the same way as men, and I hope to see as an aspiration in the future that they will have equal pay, but it is certainly great to see at least that professional players are supported by the men’s Hyundai A-League. I was thrilled to see that the Central Coast Mariners W-League team did very well, though unfortunately they did not achieve a place in the finals. I want to congratulate them, and I hope that all of them will continue to play and show the commitment that they have shown to date, because certainly I was thrilled to see them. A special thankyou to Lawrie McKinna, the coach-the whole team relies extremely heavily on him, and he certainly guides the team extremely well-and also to Lyall Gorman and John McKay, the executive chairman and the CEO, who have both been extremely hard workers and play a great role in keeping the team on its feet. Also, a special thankyou to both the New South Wales government and the Gosford City Council, who also provide the team with keen support, not only financially. But most of all I would like to thank the Mariners. Sturt Electorate: Jobs Forum in my electorate on Friday, 6 March. We held it at St John’s Lutheran Church hall, at Dernancourt, in the north-east of my electorate. I was delighted that the Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, was able to make the trip to Adelaide to be there himself, as was my colleague the member for Boothby and shadow minister for vocational education and traineeships. It was quite appropriate for him to be there. The jobs forum primarily consisted of MAIN COMMITTEE",207,Adjournment
260,Mr Pyne (Sturt) (10.52 Am),"TodayI wish to speak about the jobs forum that was heldsmall business people and also students. We were fortunate to have students there from St Paul’s College at Gilles Plains and St Peters Girls school from Stonyfell and about 80 or so small business people who came to tell Malcolm Turnbull, Andrew Southcott and me, as the local member, some of the things that government could do to get out of their way and give them the opportunity to make profits and, by continuing in business, employ Australians. At the moment, that is the highest priority of anybody in government. Some of the issues that they raised with us were obviously state issues. The primary concern amongst small business in South Australia from the state point of view is land tax. Land tax in South Australia has skyrocketed since the Rann government was elected. Land tax revenue has increased by a massive 265 per cent during the period of the Rann government. South Australia has the highest land tax for properties of $1 million or more of any state in the country, which of course is a tremendous disadvantage for business in South Australia. To put that in perspective, on a commercial property worth, say, $3 million-and many commercial properties would be about that price-South Australia’s land tax is $85,420; in New South Wales, it is $42,356; in Victoria, it is $24,975; in Queensland, $37,500; in Western Australia, $17,100; and, in Tasmania, $66,088. It is a major impediment to business in South Australia. Many people would ask: why has the tax suddenly increased so gigantically in South Australia? The reason is that so-called antiavoidance provisions were added to the Land Tax Act by the Rann government. That has led to a massive increase in land tax being paid by business-it is the great cash grab of the Rann government. On the one hand we have the Rudd cash splash here in Canberra but in South Australia we have the Rann cash grab, which takes the money out of the hands of the taxpayers of South Australia and puts it into the hands of Mike Rann. So on the one hand Kevin gives and on the other Mike grabs. Other issues were raised at the jobs forum, issues such as payroll tax, which has been a constant bugbear of small business throughout the ages, and, from a Commonwealth perspective, issues such as the award modernisation for hospitality, which is causing tremendous trouble and concern for those people with restaurants, cafes, bars et cetera. We heard stories this week and last week in Canberra about the effect on small business of the new award modernisation for the hospitality sector, and there is concern about the ageing population and the debt that future generations are going to have to pay back from, potentially, a lower revenue base. It took the Howard government 10 years to pay back $96 billion of debt in a growing economy. It is unbelievable to think how long it will take to pay back, in the shrinking economy that they have given us the $226 billion at least of debt that Labor have racked up. People were obviously also concerned about the bureaucratic processing time for the no disadvantage test. A huge backlog of agreements have been delayed and are unable to be processed by the Rudd government. They were also concerned that the government should pay its bills within 30 days to assist with small business cash flows. Unbelievably, that does not happen under the Rudd government. Not once did any of these businesses ask for a handout. They simply asked for efficiency, for government to get out of the way to make it easier for them to employ their employees and to stay in business. It was a very successful jobs forum. MAIN COMMITTEE Kokoda Trail Today as in 1915 men are dying so that the nation may live. There will come a new dawn, bringing with it peace and freedom for the peoples of the world, but we can reach it only by striving bravely through the storm and the blood and the grief of war. This was our darkest hour, the time of our greatest peril and our greatest generation. The first among them were the men who stood tall in the mountains of the Owen Stanley Range, the men of Kokoda. Success came at an enormous price: 625 were killed, more than 1,600 were wounded, 4,000 died of sickness. It is hard for us who were born in luckier times to truly understand what those men endured or what was at stake. That is why it is important that we go back to Kokoda. On ANZAC Day this year I will do just that, along with my friend and sparring partner the member for Cook, Scott Morrison, and eight young people from our electorates-four from the beaches of Cronulla and four from the streets of Bankstown; four young men and four young women; four young Anglo-Australians and four young Lebanese Muslim Australians; young people who have clashed in the past but young people who have more in common than they realise. If politicians from different political parties can be mates then so can people from different cultures and different communities. That is why we are calling it the ‘mateship trek’. We are not doing this on our own. Our patron is Her Excellency Professor Marie Bashir, the Governor of New South Wales. She will launch our campaign at the Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway in Concord on 18 April. Dr Jamal Rifi, the president of the Lakemba Sports Club, the man who led a number of community initiatives after the Cronulla riots, is coming with us. Rusty Priest, the former president of the New South Wales branch of the RSL, is helping as well. Big Australian companies and small local community organisations are all lending a helping hand. We are especially grateful to Qantas, which is getting us there. Leighton, Servcorp, the NRL, the AHA, Clubs Australia and the Australian Federal Police have all got behind the trek. The Bankstown Sports Club, Bankstown RSL and Canterbury Bulldogs have also put up their hands. So has the motorway that connects our two communities-the M5. We would not get there without them. But to get from one end of the track to the other, 100 kilometres, we are going to have to get fit and we are not leaving this to chance. Scott and I are about to undertake a unique form of training, something that is offered as a privilege to members of this place. In 10 days time we join the Army for five days of basic training at Kapooka in Wagga Wagga, all part of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program. It is a chance to spend a week with our service men and women to get a better appreciation of the work that they do for us and to get a step closer to understanding the service and the sacrifice of those who fought and died on the Owen Stanley Range. It was their sacrifice that made possible the new dawn that Prime Minister Curtin talked about, and made possible things that many of us today just take for granted. After six days on the steep and rugged trail we will arrive at a place called Isurava. There stand four granite tablets each inscribed with a word that captures the spirit of those soldiers-courage, endurance, sacrifice and mateship. That is why we are going to Kokoda-to help to heal the wounds of the events of three years ago, to help to build a generation that unMAIN COMMITTEE",209,Adjournment
261,Mr Clare (Blaxland) (10.57 Am),"Prime Minister John Curtin told this place in 1942:derstands that being an Australian is not about where you come from but where you are going and to understand what a privileged and fortunate life we lead. Kokoda is the place to realise this. It is a place where character was forged and friendships were formed, where lives were lost but something very special was gained, a place that explains who we all are, who we are as a nation, and what Prime Minister John Curtin called ‘forever the home of the ANZAC people’. Gippsland Lakes courage and wish him well on his journey. I rise to highlight community concerns in relation to the environmental health of the Gippsland Lakes and catchment. Gippsland Lakes are a tourism icon for my region and are highly valued by the local community. They are the largest inland waterway in the Southern Hemisphere and a quite magnificent network of lakes and rivers. The Ramsar listed wetlands are a feature of the Gippsland Lakes system. However, the environmental characteristics of the Gippsland Lakes have changed dramatically since European settlement about 150 years ago. For example, the installation of an artificial entrance has meant that a mainly freshwater system is now predominantly saltwater and this has had an impact on the vegetation and the environment of the lakes. Activities in the catchment with industrialisation of major towns and agricultural impacts have also flowed through to what is quite an extensive coastal lagoon system but, in the context of the size of the catchment, quite a small area of lake systems to manage the impacts that are flowing through from the catchment. The lakes are under stress as was pointed out by leading CSIRO researcher Graham Harris as long as eight years ago at a forum in Sale when he said that the lakes were at a tipping point and they could go either way. Signs of stress are evident in recent algal blooms. Over the past 10 years we have had quite a few and they have a major impact on people’s capacity to enjoy the lake system and also an economic impact in terms of the tourism industry. I am an optimist by nature and I believe that with the resourcefulness of the people, good science and the goodwill of so many volunteers on the ground in their practical environment at work we can in fact save the Gippsland Lakes. I am confident that the lakes can recover but it will take a willingness from governments at both levels to work faster and provide more resources to the community. The Gippsland Lakes task force has a target of reducing the nutrient load flowing into the lake system by 40 per cent and work has already begun in that regard. Currently the state government is considering its next round of funding for the lakes. There is normally a twoto three-year time frame. I believe the state government should allocate at least $10 million over the next three years to maintain and improve the environment of the Gippsland Lakes and catchment. The environmental challenges facing the Gippsland Lakes and catchment require ongoing and concerted efforts on the ground along with additional funding for the research required to overcome some of the knowledge gaps we currently have. The health of the lakes and catchment is critical to the social, economic and cultural life of our region and I will be continuing to fight to make sure we receive our fair share of state and federal government funding in that regard. My figure of $10 million is based on the original funding commitment from 2002 to 2006 of the former Bracks government, which saw $3.2 million per year provided for the task force MAIN COMMITTEE",211,Adjournment
262,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (11.02 Am),"I commend the member for Blaxland for hisactivities, which are primarily aimed at, as I said, reducing the nutrient flow into the system. Unfortunately, the former Deputy Premier, John Thwaites, cut that funding in half in 2006. Last year a public meeting attended by more than 200 people in Bairnsdale unanimously supported my position that both the state and federal governments’ funding commitments must be increased for the long-term health of the Gippsland Lakes and catchment. I believe that both the task force and the Gippsland Coastal Board have done a good job with the limited resources they have at their disposal. But if we really want to make a difference to the environmental health of the Gippsland Lakes it is going to take a lot more than the funding currently provided from the state and federal governments. Keep in mind the environmental challenges which the recent bushfires have also presented in the west of the catchment area. The burnt hillsides are going to be a threat to the water quality if we experience heavy rain before there is any chance for the vegetation to re-establish itself. There is an enormous amount of work required in the catchment area to minimise the impact of those fires in addition to the ongoing projects on private land to reduce the flow of nutrients. I understand the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has indicated that the Caring for our Country funding will be increased to assist in the bushfire affected communities, and I take him at his word that that will happen. From the Rudd government’s perspective, the contribution to the environmental health of the catchment has been 16 months of promises and unfortunately not a cent has made it onto the ground at this stage. That is not a record to be proud of. The Labor Party promised $3 million over three years during the 2007 campaign and to date not a single project has been funded. It is my understanding that the federal government has just finalised contracts for the money to be provided to the local catchment management authorities, but nothing has actually flowed yet to projects on the ground. The Gippsland Lakes will need our help now and into the future, and the community expects us to do better. Finally, in the time. I have left, I would like to highlight the questions that are arising now in terms of Australia meeting its obligations to the Ramsar listed wetlands. As I mentioned, the Gippsland Lakes is a Ramsar listed wetland. Australia was one of the first five founding nations to sign the Ramsar convention in 1971 and now, with 65 wetlands of significance, there is a concern that Australia-and this is not a criticism of the current government; it has been governments over many years-has failed to live up to the treaty. It is very easy to sign these treaties but we need to meet our obligations to these international conventions. It is something I will be pursuing further with the government. Petition: Asylum Seekers Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (11.07 am)-TodayI rise to present a petition that has been accepted by the Petitions Committee. It gives me great pleasure to do so. The petition was orchestrated by the Uniting Church in Australia Synod of Victoria and Tasmania and the principal petitioner is Mark Zirnsak, who works in their social justice unit. Mark is an amazing fellow. I have worked with him for many years and it is a pleasure to be involved in his many social justice issues and pursuits. Two thousand and sixty-four individuals have signed this petition. I know many within my electorate are very involved in the cause of asylum seekers within the community. It gives me enormous pleasure to be able to say that at least one of the requests in this petition will come MAIN COMMITTEE to fruition. We will be seeing legislation soon in respect of repealing the provisions to be able to collect bills from asylum seekers who have been held in detention. This has been an appalling situation for too long. We have actually presented to people who have been found to be refugees a bill for their detention within a detention centre. It has been an abomination. I have had many individuals come to my office who have subsequently been found to be refugees who have been presented with these bills. Their lives cannot go on with this huge liability hanging over their heads-they do not know where to go. Some of them have been involved in other legal action but have not been able to get assistance through measures such as legal aid because of this liability hanging over their heads. I know that the Uniting Church community and many churches within my electorate have been supporting these individuals. Mark Zirnsak and I, and many of my church communities, have been working tirelessly with a group of refugees under what is known as a bridging visa E situation. They are released into the community, but under the terms of their visa they are not allowed to work. Literally, we allow these people into the community and leave them to starve because they have no work rights, no access to social security benefits and no access to Medicare. Many individuals in my community are housing, feeding, clothing and supporting these individuals. Some of these individuals have then found and been granted work rights, and they have these enormous bills hanging over their heads. I have also had individuals who have chosen to return to their country of origin and have still been presented with this enormous bill for their detention. It has been unjust and I am applauding the government, particularly Senator Chris Evans, for moving on these issues. It has been part of Labor Party policy for some time to move in respect of these issues, and it is through the great work of church organisations and other concerned citizens within our community that we have reflected on the plight of these people who have come from horrendous situations-from war-torn conflict and from things we cannot begin to imagine. In this House the other day we were honoured to have Paris Aristotle from the Victorian Foundation for Torture and Trauma Survivors. He gav us a brief outline of the circumstances of some of the individuals they deal with who have come into our community-particularly those who have come recently from the African communities. What they have witnessed in their short lives has been appalling. Most of us would never expect that to happen to women and children in particular, and they are then dealing with migrating and making their home in Australia with all these other pressures around them. It is no wonder that sometimes these people find it very difficult to comprehend that we actually do want to make them welcome, when the government has treated them in some cases fairly appallingly. I want to thank the many petitioners who have signed it, and present the petition to the parliament. The petition read as followsMandatory detention of asylum seekers To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: The Australian Government currently has in place a system of mandatory detention of asylum seekers who arrive on-shore seeking asylum in Australia. Some of these Asylum Seekers, who after presenting MAIN COMMITTEE their case and going through the long process of assessment, are officially recognised as a refugee and given permanent protection under the Humanitarian Program, are still found to be liable for their costs of detention. Furthermore, cases where the Australian Government has initially refused to grant refugee status to someone who a court later determines is a refugee and undergoes prolonged detention as a result of the initial refusal appear to be billed for a larger amount, as a result of the prolonged detention resulting from the Government’s error. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to: Review the policy of the mandatory detention of asylum seekers, as it currently operates in Australia with a view to make any detention the minimum necessary to ensure the asylum seeker is not a threat to the health or safety of the community. Abolish by law any billing of asylum seekers found to be refugees or assessed as needing protection in Australia for the cost of any detention they have been subjected to. From 2,064 citizens Petition received. Mitchell Electorate: Hills Community Aid and Information Service Community Aid and Information Service, based within my electorate of Mitchell. The Hills Community Aid and Information Service is a not-for-profit, non-government and nonsectarian community organisation based at Baulkham Hills, near our local Centrelink office. It is responsible for what I regard as some of the most important work in our communitylooking after those who, in an ostensibly well-off and well-managed community, often get missed by government and its programs because of the social demographic breakdown of many government programs. This kind of service brings out the best in so much of our community and our people because it is largely a voluntary organisation. Of course, it receives so many generous donations from benefactors in our community and people who are willing to give their money to look after others who are not as well off as them. I would like to recognise and praise the patron, Alan Overton AM-recently the President of the Parramatta Leagues Club-the inaugural ambassador, Sonya Phillips and the directors-Geoff Green, Gloria Antonio, David Barnett, Bill Dixon, Emma McPherson, Jim Taggart and Ray Whiteman. These people make an enormous contribution to this community foundation that has been set up in north-west Sydney to make a big difference to people’s lives. We have some wonderful donors who have come on board to ensure that this community foundation of north-west Sydney is a great success. They include Heartland Suzuki, the National Australia Bank, the Hills Shire Council, DonorTec, Mitronics, the Hills Club, Elkie Photography, Office National, Coffee Club Rouse Hill and Donato Holdings. Of course the federal government has made a significant contribution by ensuring that this worthy foundation is a deductible gift recipient; therefore all money raised through fundraising events which are to the declared mission in the foundation’s articles receive a generous taxation treatment. Residents in Baulkham Hills and in my electorate know the importance and worth of this foundation. However, I would like to specifically acknowledge the efforts of a long-standing pillar of our Hills district community. While he is a resident of the neighbouring federal electorate of Berowra, he has been a part of the Mitchell community through his voluntary work MAIN COMMITTEE",212,Adjournment
263,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (11.12 Am),"I rise today to praise the ongoing work of the Hillsand capacity to care for others across many different levels. Bill Dixon has tirelessly served the Hills and Hornsby shires for more than a quarter of a century. He has served in a variety of roles with distinction, including in the Hills Community Aid and Information Service, with which he initiated the home and community services program in 1983. He provided transport to the isolated and the disabled, long day care and respite to the elderly, and home modifications and maintenance for the frail. In our tough economic times today, the Hills Community Aid and Information Centre also assists families in need, and it is seeing an increased demand. It is also seeing a more challenging time in raising money to meet that demand, and I believe government will have to take another look at and seriously consider ways of ensuring that charity and voluntary organisations are equipped to meet the needs of this upcoming challenge that we will face. The Hills Community Aid and Information Service offers no-interest loan facilities to cover expenses for these families, and also provides many other vital services. While the centre has been operated by the Hills Shire Council and has received federal government funding, Bill has held the office of president for six years and served as its treasurer for 18 years. During this time, he was able to grow the operation to include counselling support and a community bus. He has pioneered a spirit in the Hills and a wonderful community organisation that has delivered so much to so many. He still volunteers at Hills Community Aid and Information Service four days a week, in spite of advancing years, and provides support for emergency relief. He is most active in visiting our local representatives and ensuring that this vital organisation and foundation has the footing to continue. He is motivated by caring for others and he has made a wonderful contribution to our community. He has also served as a volunteer firefighter. Bill Dixon is someone who I regard as one of those fine Australians who has served in so many capacities and adds so much to the fabric of our society. He has also been associated with Meals on Wheels. He became its founding president in 1987. He successfully lobbied the government of the day for seed funding, and was granted $287,000. He went on to assist Meals on Wheels with setting up its organisational systems and structures. He has a fine history in voluntary work and making a great contribution in our community. I want to specifically acknowledge him here today. However, with the time. I have remaining, I also want to thank and congratulate all of the directors and the inaugural ambassador of the community foundation in north-west Sydney, praise the work they are doing for our community and assure them that I will be working to help them in any way I can. (Time expired) Economy nomic upheaval since the Great Depression. What started as a problem with the subprime market in the US soon became a credit crisis infecting international financial markets and is now impacting on the real economy right around the globe. The latest economic data is a reminder that Australia cannot escape the effects of the current global economic slowdown. The rapid downward revisions of growth and deep recessions affecting our major trading partners-China, Japan, the US and the UK-mean we will feel these effects for some time to come. But while we cannot completely shield Australia from the global recession, we can help to cushion the impact. That is why the Rudd government took early and decisive action to proMAIN COMMITTEE",215,Adjournment
264,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (11.17 Am),"Right around the world we face the worse ecovide necessary stimulus to the Australian economy. We have done this with the singular focus of supporting jobs. This stimulus is designed to keep money flowing through our economy to support jobs against this bleak global economic backdrop. The stimulus will find its expression in continued expenditure and capital works in local communities right around this country. In my own electorate, there are 45 primary schools who will receive up to $3 million each in capital works and a total of 60 primary and secondary schools that will each receive up to $200,000 for works and maintenance as part of the largest school modernisation program in Australia’s history. In addition to this, the Rudd government is also investing $13 million in two trades training centres in my local community, involving the construction and upgrade of facilities in 11 schools. As part of the stimulus package, builders will be able to link up with community housing providers to help deliver 20,000 units of new social housing and community organisations will be able to access funds for infrastructure and natural heritage programs to assist the unemployed and disadvantaged. Every household without ceiling insulation will be eligible for that insulation to be installed free of charge, and every household will be able to claim up to $1,600 for a solar hot water system. Many of those same households will be receiving at least one of the stimulus payments that are being made to families and working people throughout March and April, who will then go and spend this money on goods and services. The government is also investing $1.7 million in almost 30 local Penrith City Council projects, $5.2 million over the next five years for local road maintenance and $1.4 million for five local black spot projects, on top of the $800,000 for black spots already allocated last year by the Rudd government. Supporting jobs in our communities is the government’s No. 1 priority. I want to ensure that local tradespeople are helping to build and repair our local schools, that local insulation installers are putting pink batts in local houses and that local retailers and services are capitalising on the cash bonuses that are flowing into the local economy. To this end, I created a steering group of local business and community leaders, involving Mayor Jim Aitken and Alan Stoneham of Penrith City Council, Jill Woods of the Penrith Valley Chamber of Commerce, John Todd of the Penrith Valley Business Enterprise Centre, Paul Brennan of the Penrith Valley Economic Development Corporation, Gladys Reed of the Penrith City Centre Association, Peter Jackson-Calway of the St Marys Town Centre Management committee and Ian Palmer of the Schools Industry Partnership. This steering group will develop a local strategy to encourage local businesses and community organisations to take advantage of the funding opportunities in the stimulus package. The steering group agreed to embark upon such a campaign under the banner of ‘Keep Penrith Working’. In this regard, I will be hosting a special ‘Keep Penrith Working’ event next Wednesday, 25 March to give local retailers, tradespeople, service providers and community organisations some practical advice on how to tap into the money flowing into the economy. Already, we have over 120 people indicating that they will attend-a very strong response that demonstrates that people are embracing the opportunities in the stimulus package. The Parliamentary Secretary for Government Service Delivery and the Minister for Employment Participation will be in attendance. The event will provide an opportunity to bring together the different sectors of the local economy and give them a chance to develop important partnerships that will help to support jobs over the coming year. This initiative is a great example of how a loMAIN COMMITTEE cal community has decided to roll up its sleeves and pull together to do what it can to keep Penrith working. Civil Liberties Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (11.22 am)-We Australians are an easygoing people, and that is both a blessing and a curse-a blessing for the relaxed manner this engenders and a curse for the apathy which results. It is that apathy which is our greatest enemy. Forget the Taliban; forget North Korea. Our indifference has led us down a dangerous path to a point where we are sacrificing the very freedoms which made our nation so great. About 20 years ago, Australians protested en masse against the proposed Australia card, arguing it amounted to a gross invasion of privacy. Today we have already meekly surrendered far more of our privacy than proponents of that card ever envisaged, and we continue to do so with barely a murmur of discontent, naively accepting assurances from authorities that the erosion of our freedoms is in our own best interests. Consider the rapid expansion of surveillance powers granted to our law enforcement and intelligence-gathering agencies. Australia, with just over 20 million people, is tapping the phones and intercepting the email accounts of more citizens than the entire United States, with its population of 280 million. On a per capita basis, these Australian agencies conduct more than 10 times as many such intrusions into our freedoms as those in the US. Requirements for these and related attacks on our liberty, such as accessing phone company records, have been relaxed to the extent that a simple request from a ranking police officer is sometimes sufficient. No court order is required. The proliferation of CCTV cameras across the country also intrudes and will do so to an even greater extent if the government succeeds in linking all the cameras so individuals can be tracked, as well as watched and listened to, wherever they go. Perhaps even more disturbing is the widespread acceptance of the government’s proposed internet filtering system. More than 15 years ago internet use went mainstream in Australia with the promise of unfettered information flow around the country and around the world. The government is now trying to put the brakes on the information superhighway. The plan was initially billed as a way to combat child pornography, but the list of banned sites has now reportedly expanded to 10,000 containing ‘inappropriate content’. Faceless and largely unaccountable civil servants will determine what material is appropriate for our citizens to access. And the list of banned sites-which would reportedly include those linked to terrorism, abortion and euthanasia-is to be a secret. We will not even be told what information we are being denied. Backers of the plan-including the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy himself-have suggested their opponents are in favour of child porn. This outrageous claim is a red herring based on the hackneyed line that you have nothing to fear if you have done nothing wrong. I am afraid we all have something to fear when it comes to attacks on our civil liberties. While I share the Prime Minister’s respect for China’s stellar economic performance, and many other aspects of that society, I do not share his apparent admiration for Beijing’s authoritarian control over its people. The proposed internet filter mirrors the ‘great firewall of China’ and would also put Australia in a very small and not particularly respected club of nations which control internet access in this manner. Saudi Arabia should not be the model for the way in which our government treats its citizens. Furthermore, senior internet industry figures say the plan simply will not work, will dramatically slow access speeds and could hamMAIN COMMITTEE per both the public and private sectors by denying them information freely available to most of the world. Some here-possibly on both sides of this House-will smirk and say this speech is alarmist. But history is littered with examples of rulers who abused their authority. Once granted new powers, governments rarely relinquish them. The key is not to surrender in the first place. Do not accept the infringement of your rights, do not tolerate incursions into your privacy and do not allow our easygoing manner to manifest itself as thoughtless acceptance that authorities will always act in our interests. To do anything else is to court disaster. Police Force edge the pivotal role the police play in our communities and to offer my sincere support for the difficult and often dangerous jobs that they perform. In fact, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Detective Steve Quinn from the Camden Local Area Command, who last week was awarded the Combined Rotary Clubs of Macarthur Police Officer of the Year Award 2009. It is indeed a great honour and a tribute to his commitment to what is often a difficult, dangerous and unrewarding job. As you know, policing comes with a degree of risk that, thankfully, many of us will never have to face. I have stood in this parliament, along with colleagues from all sides, to honour the lives and memories of many fine men and women who, in serving their communities and in the execution of their official duties, regrettably have had their lives tragically cut short. When a police officer dies in the line of duty, it is a tragedy and one that affects all of us. It is certainly a heart breaking loss for their families and friends and also for our entire community. From my close dealings with the police over many years, I have come to understand that it takes a special kind of person and a special kind of courage and commitment to wear the uniform of a police officer, and we are truly indebted to the men and women who choose to do so. Police cannot be expected to protect the community if they themselves are not properly protected. Thousands of police officers and supporters, including ambulance officers, nurses, prison officers, and indeed many concerned members of the Western Australian public, met at a rally on Wednesday last outside parliament house in Perth to show their outrage regarding the number of assaults occurring on police officers that are going unpunished. This rally, the biggest that parliament house has seen in more than a decade, comes just days after a not guilty verdict on the assault of Constable Matthew Butcher that outraged the Western Australian community. This case is simply the last straw. Western Australians are incensed that an assault, which has paralysed a police officer while exercising his duty and protecting the community, can go unpunished and are now legitimately asking: ‘Who protects those who protect our community?’ I trust that is a sentiment that is shared by every member in this House. In an interview in Perth, on 13 March, the Prime Minister said: … our police including here in WA put themselves in the front line every day in very difficult and dangerous circumstances, most of which are never reported. I think it’s high time the community just got absolutely behind the police in everything they do. He went on to say: MAIN COMMITTEE",216,Adjournment
265,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (11.27 Am),"Many times in this HouseI have stood to acknowl… it’s time we had a new attitude of respect for the police because they are dealing with problems of violence, of domestic violence, of alcohol-induced violence, of binge drinking. … … … They are doing a first class job in the community, and I think it is absolutely important that we … use this event to, as a focal point to rally behind our police. Since the not guilty verdict one week ago there has been a massive outpouring of community support for Constable Butcher and the WA police in general. The community has justifiably described the outcome of the assault on Constable Butcher as outrageous and unbelievable and are demanding action against criminals who assault police. Police and the community feel abandoned by the justice system which, in this instance, has produced what many of the community would see as a travesty of justice. However, police in WA and across the nation have continued to carry out their sworn duties, as professional officers, of protecting the life and property of citizens, although currently they are hugely dismayed at this WA court decision. This week I spoke to Vince Kelly, the President of the Police Federation of Australia, about the case, and he said that it was of critical importance that those people who assault police should be convicted and punished appropriately. I am concerned that this Western Australian court decision will send the message that it is okay to assault police-in other words, that our cops are now fair game. The protection of the community is the basis of our law and order system, and this verdict in WA shows that there is a deplorable deficiency in the protection of those who protect our community. It is essential that we now gain a realistic scheme of protection and indeed respect for those people who we put on the front line to protect the community. It is now an urgent priority. Electorate of Cowper: Television Reception issue of television reception. It seems incredible that, in the 21st century, the TV reception in many areas in my electorate is just not up to scratch. Moonee resident Joanne Beresford recently contacted my office to confirm a problem which exists in the area of Moonee, only 10 kilometres from the major regional centre of Coffs Harbour but where the reception is grossly inadequate. It seems incomprehensible that, with a major regional centre, we can have places just on the outskirts of that centre that are unable to access quality TV reception. I wrote to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy back in 2008 about this black spot. The minister advised that the only realistic option for the residents was to apply for satellite television through Southern Cross Central or Imparja. Installing satellite television would require an initial outlay of well over $1,000 and that installation can take months. As well as a broadbrush satellite approach to television people also want local content. They want to be able to watch their local news. They want to watch local programs that reflect local communities. Services that are more focused on a national level or on larger regional levels do not meet that local need. So it is vital that we have a response that caters for local needs of local communities. When in government the coalition initiated the $35 million Black Spot Program, which provided quality TV reception where it was unavailable in local areas. In addition to that program was a program for some $13.3 million, which was a flexible program providing alternaMAIN COMMITTEE",219,Adjournment
266,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (11.32 Am),"I rise today to speak on the very importanttive technical solutions, such as digital retransmission, direct home-to-satellite solutions and various cabling solutions, in black spot areas. I think it is important in the 21st century that people have access, as I said, to quality TV reception. It is important that the government focus on finding ways to deliver local content to people no matter where they live. We believe in equity of access to a whole range of services. We believe in equity of access to health and education. In the 21st century, which is an information century and a century in which it is vital that people be kept up to date, quality TV reception needs to be part of that. This government need to focus on developing solutions to meet local needs in local areas where television reception is currently not up to standard. We have seen with regard to broadband that the government have left people in rural and regional areas in the lurch. They cancelled the OPEL contract with the rollout of broadband but to date have put nothing in its place. The National Broadband Network is languishing. It will be years behind by the time that network is delivered. What are people in rural and regional areas to do in the meantime? They are to wait with inadequate broadband services. People should not be abandoned by the government. The government must take up the cause of television reception and provide quality television reception to people no matter where they live. Corangamite Electorate: Spring Creek Development on a very pressing issue of concern to my electorate-particularly the community in which I live, the coastal town of Torquay. Late last year the Surf Coast Shire Council released a planning document which indicated that a strip of land that is undeveloped at the moment, a place called Spring Creek, would over the next 15 or 20 years be a likely place for future development of the coastal town that I live in, Torquay. The size of this coastal development would lead to Torquay being tripled in size. As a consequence of those planning documents which have yet to be developed by the council, the community engaged in a planned and coordinated campaign to ensure that every resident within Torquay and Jan Juc was aware of some of the thinking that the council was doing. This led about six weeks ago to a protest rally of around 2,000 to 3,000 local Torquay citizens coming together and demonstrating to the council that this development was excessive. I rise in this adjournment debate to talk about the broader phenomena-that is, when some 80-plus per cent of Australians live on or near the coastline, how do we keep the character of our coastal towns and protect those environments? These are some very significant decisions that need to be made. How do we provide ongoing employment to thousands of local tradies who actually built these towns that we live in? How do we make these towns sustainable and livable? As a relative newcomer to Torquay who chose to move my young family there because of the character of that community and the environment, I would hate to see those aspects of the community change were we to move down this path of effectively tripling the size of the population. I am going through the normal processes at the moment of securing a block of land and I hope to be able to build there in the short term and enjoy the very fabulous coastal environment. I think that, of any of the states, Victoria is doing an outstanding job in managing the very valuable and, of course, unique landscapes of our coastline. In the Victorian government’s latest strategy, the Victorian Coastal Spaces strategy, they are developing a broad policy MAIN COMMITTEE",220,Adjournment
267,Mr Cheeseman (Corangamite) (11.36 Am),"I rise to speak in this adjournment debateframework as a shining example, I think, not only to Victorians but also to other states in responding to the challenges of protecting our coastlines, protecting the communities and the character of those towns and responding to the great challenges that come from climate change and a rising sea level. The Spring Creek plan currently proposed by the Surf Coast Shire Council, in my view, is excessive. It is inappropriate to develop Torquay to such a substantial size. I know that the councillors, the mayor and the senior officers of the Surf Coast Shire are actively considering the various submissions that have been put forward by the community, and I look forward to the council making a decision on this development in the not-too-distant future. I certainly encourage them to abandon their current thinking. ANZAC Day day, short of sitting again tomorrow, prior to the budget of 12 May, and therefore the last sitting day before we as a nation commemorate ANZAC Day, the day when so many of our finest men stormed the beaches of Gallipoli at 4 am on 25 April 1915. It is fitting that we speak about ANZAC Day and commemorating it, especially in the wake of the ninth Australian warrior slain on the battlefield fighting for freedoms that we take so easily for granted. ANZAC Day, so many years ago, in many ways defined us as a nation. It defined our values; it defined who we are. It certainly portrayed us with strength and authority on the world stage. It defined us as a nation of men, women, boys and girls of courage who understand mateship and who support it-a nation that knows what it is to endure, as Dorothea Mackellar so eloquently reminds us, a land ‘of drought and flooding rains’ and indeed, as Victoria has taught us, of tempests and fires and, as the North has shown us, of dramatic floods. ANZAC Day showed us that we as a nation know how to stand up and be counted. I well remember the story of Billy Hughes at the end of World WarI working through the various treaties to conclude the war. When the US politely asked him how many soldiers he spoke for, he shot back that he spoke for 60,000 dead and asked the US how many dead they spoke for. Australia knows what it is to serve; we know what it is to contribute. Something like one in 10 families were impacted through the death of loved ones in World War I; so many more were injured. As we look to the modern commemoration of ANZAC Day, I encourage all Australians to take time out of busy lives to stop and reflect, to join a service, to be in a march or even to stand and wave an Australian flag-to be involved when the nation commemorates ANZAC Day. I look forward to being at the dawn service with the Oxenford-Coomera RSL at the crack of dawn on the 25th. I look forward to joining the Highway Christian Church for breakfast soon afterwards, taking the salute and speaking at the march put on by the Runaway Bay RSL club, moving to a tribute and wreath laying at the Paradise Point Bowls Club and then moving to a tribute at the Riverside community, all before lunchtime. Considering our busy schedules, I encourage us all to remember that ANZAC Day is a core part of who we are, especially as we have warriors right now, men and women, fighting on foreign battlefields across the world-fighting in wars not of our choosing but fighting for freedom that we intend to stand up for and defend. Take time out on this great day, ANZAC Day. Take time to remember those who have fallen, those who have served and those who currently serve. Take time to reflect on the great values that have been forged out of our service and to think of how each of us can continue to contribute to our community. MAIN COMMITTEE",221,Adjournment
268,Mr Robert (Fadden) (11.41 Am),"I am cognisant that this may well be the last sittingNation Building and Jobs Plan Jobs Plan will deliver the biggest investment in schools Australia has ever seen. Building the Education Revolution is about ensuring schools have modern facilities to ready students for the modern world. This includes multipurpose halls to meet the diverse needs of students and obviously to serve community needs as well, which is our great initiative; modern libraries worthy of the digital age rather than the Dark Ages; science labs and language learning centres to help students get the edge they need; and new modern classrooms. It is also about ensuring that schools have the resources to complete minor capital works and maintenance. In all, the Rudd government’s Nation Building and Jobs Plan is pumping $14.7 billion into our schools -public and private. I remind those opposite that our funding is designed for all schools irrespective of the sign over the gate. It will be delivered in just two years and it will go a long way to make up for 12 years of neglect by the Howard government, especially of public schools. I say that as a former organiser in the Independent Education Union, which spent a lot of time in private schools. One of the state school principals in my electorate told me that they have spent their weekends painting classrooms at their school because they simply do not have the budget for a fresh coat of paint. It is sad when you think of a principal having to spend time painting classrooms. This funding will ensure schools like this one can now carry out the urgent maintenance that is required and deliver the kinds of facilities they had resigned to the never-never under the coalition. It also means principals, teachers and parents can focus on their core business, which is about educating our students. I simply cannot describe how thrilled schools in my electorate are to be receiving this funding. I will leave that to a local principal who described it this way: This is exactly the kind of investment our primary schools have been crying out for, for years! This is not just in my electorate. It is in every single school, all 9,540 of them-in every community, in every town, in every electorate across the country be it Labor or Liberal or even National. This would not be the case if the opposition had their way. As a former schoolteacher, I simply cannot understand why anyone would stand in the way of better resources and better facilities for our school kids. But not only does the opposition not care about education, in the face of a worsening global financial crisis the coalition is not prepared to make the tough decisions required to protect jobs, support small business and stimulate growth in the Australian economy. We should have known. In government, the coalition ripped off public schools to the tune of $2.9 billion every year-do not get me started on universities-and refused to acknowledge the wider benefits of education, such as jobs growth and better productivity. Of course, public or private matters little. What really matters is the quality of education provided through schools, their physical assets and infrastructure, and the training of their teachers and other staff. I know this being the product of both systems, having attended a Catholic primary school and a state high school, and also having taught in both private and public systems as well. These are the issues at the core of the Rudd government’s education revolution.

It is why we are delivering record funding of $14.7 billion for schools across the board. It is why we introduced the education tax refund to reward all taxpayers who have school-age children. I hope they are collecting their dockets at the moment. It is why we are rewarding our best teachers and it is why we are improving accountability and community reporting in our schools so that we all understand what is going on in our schools. We, on this side of the House, well understand the value of teaching. I see the member for Braddon, who is a former teacher, is present, and there are a lot of former teachers on this side of the House. I will continue to meet with schools in my electorate over the coming exciting months as we work together in Building the Education Revolution. I ask those on the other side of the House to also put aside some of the baggage and issues that they have with respect to education and to embrace the education revolution. Do not be hypocritical in engaging with schools as we saw from the member for Dickson the other day in the House. Cowan Electorate: Yellagonga Regional Park regional parks within the Perth metropolitan region. It is located about 20 kilometres north of Perth City and six kilometres from the Indian Ocean. It is approximately 13 kilometres long and varies in width from one to 1.5 kilometres wide. The park comprises 1,400 hectares and is primarily focused on a wetland system that includes Lake Joondalup, Beenyup and Walluburnup swamps, Lake Goollelal and surrounding lands. It is my view, and that of the Friends of Yellagonga environmental group and others, that Yellagonga park is of not only regional but also national importance. This is particularly because of its natural, historical and recreational standing in a rapidly growing suburban area. The lakes and wetlands are the main and dominant features of the park. These lakes and wetlands are surface expressions of groundwater which are connected to the Gnangara Mound. As the management plan outlines, there is a wide range of recreational opportunities and facilities available to visitors. As well as the natural features, such as Lake Joondalup and Lake Goollelal, there is also the parkland setting at Neil Hawkins Park. The lakes and wetlands provide research and educational opportunities for better understanding of these wetlands, their ecosystems and groundwater interaction. The Yellagonga Regional Park lies between the cities of Joondalup and Wanneroo and adjoins the city centre of Joondalup, the regional focus of Perth’s north-west corridor. With regard to the national importance of this area, apart from a wide variety of ecosystems from upland forest, fringing wetland and aquatic vegetation to open water bodies, there is a rich diversity of ecosystems with great conservation value. The wetlands within the park are some of the last remaining freshwater wetland systems on the Swan coastal plain. The vegetation on the upland areas surrounding the wetlands was once jarrah-marri-banksia open forest and tuart-jarrah-marri open forest. It is also important to note that the wetlands of the park serve as important breeding grounds for local birds and serve as a refuge in the hot Perth summers for a diverse bird population. I understand that some of the species are migratory from equatorial regions. Wetland and upland habitats comprise paperbarks and gum woodland, helping to provide a habitat for a variety of waterbirds and bush birds. Given this level of biodiversity Lake Joondalup is considered of national significance and is listed on the Register of the National Estate. MAIN COMMITTEE",223,Adjournment
270,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (11.49 Am),"Yellagonga Regional Park is currently one of eightYellagonga Regional Park provides significant landscape and amenity value to the region. The park’s landscape provides strong visual connections both within and into surrounding areas. Many of the landscape character types contribute to the overall high visual quality of the park, ranging from mature woodland areas to extensive views of open water, along with its wildlife, to well-maintained areas of grassed parkland. Within the regional park, Luisini Winery can be seen off Lakeway Drive, adjacent to Lake Goollelal. In 1924, Enzio Luisini, an Italian migrant who had arrived in Western Australia from Umbria in 1908, made his first purchase of 20 acres of land in Wanneroo for the purpose of planting a vineyard. Although Luisini’s primary business was a drapery and supply store in William Street, Perth, he also sold wine to households around town as well as to the workers in the bush. The origins and operation of the winery and its role in the development of Wanneroo are closely tied to the life of the Italian community and their market garden industry between the 1920s and the 1980s. Once of the largest wineries in the Southern Hemisphere, it is now being restored by the National Trust. That project has my great support. There is an application in for federal grants to support that project. On6 March we were fortunate enough to have the Hon. Greg Hunt, shadow minister for climate change, environment and water, visit with me and the Friends of Yellagonga. I thank Kevin McLeod, Graham Sinclair and John and Heather Chester for that meeting at Lake Goollelal and the Luisini Winery. It was a great exchange of ideas and a good time to discuss issues facing this exquisite regional park. As a direct result of this visit, and after consultation with the Friends of Yellagonga and the chairman,Will Carstairs, I have proposed that this regional park, due to its significance not just to Western Australia but to all of Australia, be recognised as a national park. TodayI have commenced the campaign to make Yellagonga Regional Park a national park, having previously corresponded with the state minister and other stakeholders. I will keep the House advised of progress. Braddon Electorate: Ten Days on the Island Project lege of being able to launch the beginning of Ten Days on the Island in Tasmania in a project called Trust, which essentially was a partnership between Ten Days on the Island, the Tasmanian School of Art, the University of Tasmania and the National Trust of Australia, Tasmania. This project highlights a number of prominent homes in Tasmania: Oak Lodge in Richmond, Clarendon in Evandale, Home Hill in Devonport, Runnymede in Hobart and Penghana in Queenstown. If anyone has the opportunity to visit Queenstown, an extraordinary mining town on the west coast, you will find perched up on a hill the home called Penghana-which is an Aboriginal term meaning ‘where two rivers meet’. Robert Sticht, a mine manager specialising in smelting, came from the United States and lopped the top off a hill in Queenstown-he literally took the top off the hill-to put a house there which is Penghana today. He had a reign of 25 years as the mine manager at Queenstown. He used to survey the mine and the town from his hilltop fortress of Penghana. On Saturday, I travelled to Queenstown with my wife to launch an exhibition by Martin Walch, a very fine artist from Hobart who specialises in digital art. Martin was able to make a digital presentation of a 30-kilometre radius from Penghana of the streets and major houses in Queenstown and beyond. I would invite everybody to go to visit Penghana and also to look at the digital art exhibition along with some other magnificent photography by Martin Walch. MAIN COMMITTEE",224,Adjournment
271,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (11.54 Am),"On the weekend past I had the great priviOn Sunday, I went to the home of the former Prime Minister Joe Lyons and his wife, Dame Enid Lyons. That home is called Home Hill and is in Devonport. It is quite a remarkable home, because it is completely original, furnished almost as a personal museum by Dame Enid Lyons herself to perpetuate the memory of Joe Lyons, our former Prime Minister from 1932 to 1939. The career of Joe Lyons is coming to fore more and more because of research into the history of his political contribution. I think that is a fine thing. He was Prime Minister at an extraordinary time in Australia’s history. He literally died in the job; he died from overwork. He dedicated his life to politics. Dame Enid was quite an extraordinary woman too. Their early romance, by the way, is an extraordinary story on its own. In between being Joe’s wife and looking after their home, she managed to have 12 children, 11 of whom survived. She had 12 children in 17 years, looked after those children and supported Joe Lyons, who was a former Premier of Tasmania as well as our former Prime Minister. She then went on to become the first woman to be a member of the House of Representatives and the first female to be a cabinet member in the Commonwealth parliament. She was an extraordinary woman. She once said, famously, ‘The foundation of a nation’s greatness is in the homes of its people.’ She shared those values not just through her own life to influence those around her but also in the political sphere; she shared home values and perpetuated them at the national level. I had the great privilege of attending the launches at Home Hill and Penghana, and I would thoroughly recommend that, if you visit my beautiful patch of the woods, you visit those homes. (Time expired) Employment don, to speak today in this adjournment debate on a very serious issue affecting my electorate, my state of South Australia and our country-the impact of the Rudd recession on young people and their opportunities at work. We are 17 or 18 months into the Rudd government’s first term and people are starting to say, ‘They’ve had a fair go-it’s time that they can be judged on their policies and their approach to government, and to jobs in particular.’ It is my contention that the impacts of the government’s policies-in particular on young people-are significant, and that they will damage our country’s future for some time to come, especially this generation of young people who are finishing school and entering, or attempting to enter, the labour market. The government will be judged on-their benchmark will be-their record on jobs. Of course, on this side of the House, we have recognised that. We have outlined several policies which talk about jobs, jobs, jobs. The Leader of the Opposition has been very clear that the main priority of the opposition is jobs. Unfortunately, on the other side of the House, they are moving a series of policies which are impacting on the ability of young people to get a chance at a job. In particular, and I refer to some examples of these policies, the award modernisation-the modern award, the system which was moved by this government last year on an instruction from the Deputy Prime Minister to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission-is going to have a real and genuine impact on the ability of young people to get a job. We have seen, in recent days, several industries which are major employers of young people in this country-the hospitality sector and the retail sector, and in particular the newsagentsoutline just how damaging the award modernisation process has been for their industries and for their ability to create and support jobs. MAIN COMMITTEE",225,Adjournment
272,Mr Briggs (Mayo) (11.59 Am),"I rise with pleasure, following the member for BradIt is very dangerous, I think, for young people in Australia at the moment, where the government is implementing policies which damage their opportunities to get a job. On this side of the House, we want to see policies which help young people get jobs, not damage their opportunities. That is why the amendment moved by the shadow minister for employment and workplace relations is a good one-that we amend the current Fair Work Bill in order that, to use the Deputy Prime Minister’s own words from last year, the award modernisation does not increase costs to businesses or disadvantage employees. It is a suggestion that came from Senator Fisher and it is a suggestion that it would be well worthwhile for the government to take up, because the policies they are implementing are making it harder for young peopleparticularly those studying-to get an opportunity at a job. In the hospitality sector, which we know is a major employer of young people, part-time work helps them get through university. It makes it harder on these young people if they are at university and they cannot find the part-time work that would enable them to sustain their study in a reasonable fashion, and this impacts on their ability to do well at university for their future. This is a bad development. Eighteen months in, the government are now judged on their record and on their policy implementation. In addition to moving policies which are damaging the opportunities for jobs, what we are seeing is a new tax on students. It is quite extraordinary that you would put a new tax on students at the same time as you are reducing their opportunities to get a job. So what we are seeing now, after 18 months, is a series of policies-the award modernisation being one, the Fair Work Bill before the Senate being another and the new tax on students being another-indebting these young people for their future and making it more difficult for my generation and younger to get an opportunity to work, which we know is the key to their future success and to their future opportunities. I think this is a very negative reflection on the policies of the Rudd government. We know that this is the risk of the Rudd recession. The policies implemented by this government are reducing the opportunities for young people to get a job and they are damaging the future of our country, because long-term unemployment makes it harder to get back into the labour market in the future. I think that this is an issue that the government needs to consider in the break. I urge the government to do so, and to focus on jobs. Small Business Gold Coast Mayo, a lot of what small business needs in this country is encouragement. I want to talk about the encouragement which the government is putting forward through the stimulus package. The Rudd government is committed to supporting Australia’s small businesses through the global recession. The government recognises that small businesses are often the first to feel the effects of an economic downturn. In my electorate of Forde, the small business community appreciates the federal government’s support in this time of economic downturn. Small business will benefit from the government’s $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan introduced to support jobs and to invest in Australia’s long-term economic growth, and a $2.7 billion small business and general business tax break providing small businesses with a turnover of $2 million or less a year. Small business will benefit from a 30 per cent investment allowance in the form of an additional tax deduction equal to 10 per cent of the cost of MAIN COMMITTEE",226,Adjournment
273,Mr Raguse (Forde) (12.04 Pm),"While I understand the concerns of the member foran eligible asset. This is a great incentive for small business to continue investing in their local businesses. A 20 per cent discount on the pay-as-you-go tax instalment, payable by 3 March 2009, will provide an immediate boost to cash flow. There is a share in the $12.2 billion stimulus package for lowand middle-income households and individuals. The government will make a direct investment in schools, housing, energy efficient homes, roads and other local infrastructure. There is a $4 billion Australian Business Investment Partnership to support the commercial property sector and the thousands of small businesses, independent contractors and tradespeople who service it. And there is a $46 million investment in small business advisory services. This list of measures will ensure that small business is well supported into the future and, with the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, will help to support and bolster the economy in the short term. The groundwork in laying these foundations has been set in place for the Australian economy to grow stronger for when the nation emerges from the global recession. In fact, the Hon. Craig Emerson, Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, on 6 March this year, convened a roundtable with small business organisations and bank representatives to discuss small business access to credit during the global financial crisis. The Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy has established a small business banking complaints clearing house in the minister’s office to receive complaints about access to and the cost of bank finance to small business operators. I would like to thank the minister for his support of small business in my community and encourage any small business operator who is having difficulty accessing credit to provide their details to the minister’s office. On6 March 2009, the small business roundtable undertook to seek to maintain the level of funds available to the small business sector and to continue to make loans to small businesses. It also undertook to pass on to small business customers, to the maximum extent possible while maintaining prudential standards, reductions in the cost of funds and, on a case by case basis with respect to customer’s cash flows and their agreement, consider loan-restructuring options so that business can continue to trade. Those are the highlights of what we as a government have put forward in our support for small business. In this chamber just last week I spoke about the Gold Coast region, my seat being in the Gold Coast hinterland. We have a lot of things happening on the Gold Coast which are problematic in terms of the downturn in the construction industry. As I said last week in this chamber, there is a view that the Gold Coast are doing okay. I am here today to say that they are not doing so well. They certainly would like me to pass on to this House the concerns and note their push to put in $100 million of their own to get things going again on the Gold Coast. In the nature of the Gold Coast-the commercial interests and certainly the tourism market-in a downturn, particularly a global downturn, the tourism industry usually suffers very much. The Gold Coast also has a very large manufacturing base in the marine sector in the building of boats and other marine services. It is really feeling the pain right now. The government’s measures which I have just outlined will help and encourage small business to continue. I must congratulate the Gold Coast City Council on putting forward their $100 million stimulus package in a number of areas, similar to what the federal government has done on a larger scale. Communities and larger local government agencies on the Gold Coast are comMAIN COMMITTEE ing together, working within their regions, to understand the Rudd government stimulus package and how it can be of benefit to them. This is an endorsement of what the Rudd government has been able to do. I congratulate the Gold Coast for their efforts and offer every support we can give as a government. Petition: Redevelopment of Commonwealth Land Ryan Electorate: Traffic tives as the member for Ryan and to raise a couple of important local issues from the Ryan electorate, because they are of deep concern to the constituents that I have the great honour of representing here in parliament. The first issue is in relation to the sale of the ABC site in Toowong in the Ryan electorate. It will be well known that the ABC site in Toowong has been the subject of some controversy because of the detection of breast cancer amongst many women staff who worked at that site. So the ABC has now decided to move to new premises, and I understand a new facility will be constructed at Southbank in Brisbane. The people of Ryan will be interested to know that the ABC site is almost certainly going to receive considerable interest from potential purchasers and developers. Together with my friend and colleague in Brisbane who represents the council ward of Toowong, Councillor Peter Matic, I have been working very hard to draw this issue to the attention of the constituents that we both represent. We have put together a petition which has drawn enormous interest amongst the residents of Toowong and the surrounding suburbs. We have been absolutely overwhelmed by the support we have received for this petition. I would like to present the petition. Standing Committee on Petitions for consideration and will be accepted subject to confirmation by the committee that it conforms with standing orders. nificance of the site, a little bit about the history of the site, and about the issue of redevelopment of the site into parkland for the benefit of not just the people of Toowong and the surrounding suburbs but the wider community in Brisbane. It is one, as I say, that has drawn enormous interest, because this is riverside land. There is not much riverside land in Brisbane and I think that a beautiful site such as the Toowong parkland should really be something for the enjoyment and the pleasure of families. I can envisage all kinds of facilities on the river: barbecue facilities and family-friendly facilities for kids such as swings and slippery slidesthat kind of infrastructure that brings families together, that brings communities together. As I said, I am absolutely overwhelmed by the number of people from throughout the streets of Toowong, the families of Toowong, that have really come together to express their deep concern that this Commonwealth land will potentially be sold to a developer who might construct something quite unfriendly to the local landscape. Related to that is the issue of traffic congestion. People who live in the western suburbs of Brisbane, in the Ryan electorate, will know the streets of the western suburbs-Moggill Road, in particular, and Coronation Drive-are one giant car park in the mornings.

The petition talks about the sigall they can, in their respective roles, to flag the indecision, the lack of leadership, the lack of investment and the lack of funds from the state government and from the previous Labor council administration when it was in power. An interesting common thread is that, prior to Lord Mayor Campbell Newman taking charge in Brisbane, the period of the Labor administration in Brisbane City Council was almost a decade, and that matches the time of the state Labor government. Bar two years of the Borbidge Nationals government, the Labor Party has been in power in Queensland for nearly two decades, yet very little has been done to address congestion or to address traffic problems. Peak hour is not one hour; peak hour is many hours. I am certainly against the governance of the current Queensland government. Hopefully the people of Queensland will rectify that on Saturday, when they go to the polls and bring to George Street a team with fresh ideas, with a new vision and with competent ministers that can actually represent the people. So on the issues of traffic congestion and the sale of the ABC site, which potentially has enormous consequences(Time expired) Shortland Electorate: Telecommunications Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.14 pm)-I rise in the House to raise the issue of Mr and Mrs Hiles, constituents of mine who have become extremely frustrated by a telecommunications issue that has been running since August 2007; my staff and I are also extremely frustrated with this issue because we have been helping them over this period of time. It is an absolute disgrace that they cannot, and we cannot, get this problem resolved. Even after numerous attempts by my office contacting Telstra, Optus and the Telecommunications Ombudsman, this matter remains unresolved. Mr and Mrs Hiles have a telephone account with Optus; however, they have had issues with their telephone line. That phone line is owned by Telstra but Telstra is refusing to do repairs to the line. Telstra went to the house of Mr and Mrs Hiles and put in a temporary line, which is hanging in a tree alongside the house. As you can imagine, this is both dangerous and unsatisfactory. Mr and Mrs Hiles are concerned that they might knock the line down or that someone might fall over it and injure themselves. It is a highly unsatisfactory solution. Telstra has not come back to fix the line and bury it, and Optus will not do anything because the line is owned by Telstra. The bottom line is that, yes, the line is owned by Telstra, but Optus is willing to take money from Mr and Mrs Hiles each month and to keep their account but will not do anything to fix this line. Telstra are being very bloody-minded, as I am sure other members have found they are on a number of issues like this. This is not the only issue I have in relation to this type of problem. We have contacted the telecommunications ombudsman, who advised that he would seek to have the matter resolved. But his intervention has done absolutely nothing. The TIO advised that they would get a private contractor to come and bury the cable and that they would cover the cost. But, after numerous calls backwards and forwards to both Optus and Telstra, everything remains the same-nothing has happened. The issue of burying the cable went on, with both the customer and my office contacting the TIO yet again, the customer contacting Telstra and my office contacting Telstra and with the customer contacting Optus and my office contacting Optus. So both parties have been constantly contacting Telstra, Optus and the TIO. We have had an absolutely and totally unsatisfactory solution to this phone line problem. It seems to me that the system set up by the preMAIN COMMITTEE vious government to resolve these issues does not work. From my perspective, it is totally unacceptable that Telstra will not take responsibility for the line and that Optus has the hide to keep billing my constituents for this service. As I mentioned, this is not the only issue I have had with Telstra refusing to offer services to customers of other providers in relation to their lines. If Telstra are going to hold people in Australia to ransom like this there needs to be some action, and I put on the record in the House today that I will be fighting for action to be taken to resolve issues where Telstra are refusing to meet their obligations as set out in the legislation. This is not good enough and Mr and Mrs Hiles have suffered enough. Christmas Island Pipistrelle Ms LEY (Farrer) (12.19 pm)-I want to talk about the imminent extinction of a critically endangered animal species-that is, the Christmas Island pipistrelle, which is one of Australia’s smallest bats. If we allow this small mammal to become extinct, it will be the first mammal extinction in Australia for about 50 years. I have been contacted by a zoologist in the west of my electorate, Mr David Gee, who is part of a network, including the Australasian Bat Society and other conservationist and wildlife biologists, who are incredibly concerned about this. I have been touched and motivated by their concern, and I wish to try to use the House to bring this issue to the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett, because Mr Garrett has responded to the plight of the Christmas Island pipistrelle by referring the issue to a threatened species advisory panel. That is right-the imminent extinction of Australia’s first mammal for 50 years has been referred to a panel. The decline of this species has been staggeringly rapid, and the wild numbers are so low that now it is probably only months before the species will become extinct. The time that would be taken to deliberate on this animal’s fate by a committee will use up all the valuable time we have left. What we are seeing is extinction by committee. In the media releases from Mr Garrett, claiming to be a hero regarding the imminent extinction of the pipistrelle, there is no mention of time frames. There is no indication of when the committee will report or of any other timelines determined by the minister. We do not have time to deliberate. If it takes three months or so for a decision to be made, that could well be too late. We need continued pressure to be applied to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, and in my capacity as shadow minister for territories I am trying to apply some pressure to the minister responsible for Christmas Island, the Hon. Bob Debus. It is the case that species do become extinct and a sad reality of our ever-changing environment, but it is even sadder when no effort is made to prevent the extinction, or the effort that is made does not do anything to assist, particularly in a country as environmentally enlightened as Australia What the Australasian Bat Society is proposing is a three-stage program: an emergency rescue program aimed at catching the few remaining animals and establishing a captive colony; if sufficient individuals are caught and they survive being taken into captivity, a long term captive breeding program in a purpose-built facility on Christmas Island with experienced staff to run it, which would need to be maintained for 10 years; and targeted research to determine the cause of the decline so that mitigation actions can be undertaken. The threestage program would really be a last-ditch effort, because there are as few as 20 to 50 animals left. Any animals caught will of course affect the wild population, but we have no knowledge MAIN COMMITTEE of what is causing the extinction in the wild, so this is the only action we have left. If-and I agree with my constituent David Gee that it is a big if-a captive population can be established, it will buy time so that the environmental attributes that are causing the extinction can be identified and hopefully corrected so that captive-bred individuals can be released back on Christmas Island in order to re-establish a wild population. I think it is appalling that a government with the purported green credentials of this government is standing by and letting this happen. This is a tiny mammal which weighs less than three grams. In the big picture, people may say, ‘Who cares?’ But we should care, because when a species becomes extinct there is no going back and, if action can be taken to prevent it, we would all be better human beings for having taken it. If we do not succeed we can say, ‘We tried.’ If you look at the economic arguments, they possible do not add up, but this is not about economics. Christmas Island needs something to give it a lift, to improve its tourism and to make it a place where people think not just of its detention centre-and I think this could be one such issue. I call on the environment minister to take action, sweep the Threatened Species Scientific Committee aside and do what the Australasian Bat Society recommends: capture the bats and breed them in captivity. North East Tasmanian Innovation and Investment Fund Ms CAMPBELL (Bass) (12.24 pm)-Last year when the Tonganah sawmill in Scottsdale in north-east Tasmania closed down, this government stood ready to respond-not in a way which would simply brush issues such as sustainability under the carpet, to be dealt with some time in the future, but rather in a manner which aims to support investment, generate employment and create a sustainable and vibrant region. With that in mind, Senator Kim Carr and I announced the creation of and substantial funding for the North East Tasmania Development Package. This was a joint initiative of the Australian and Tasmanian governments. This package included the North East Tasmanian Innovation and Investment Fund-$3.7 million to support investment specifically aimed at generating sustainable new jobs. Key to its success and integral to the future of the region was the co-contribution component of this fund. For applicants to be successful they needed to be prepared and able to commit their own money to the projects proposed. And commit they did. The co-contribution to the federal government investment of $3.7 million was $3.3 million. This is an impressive sign of confidence in the region. On FridayI announced that there were 19 successful applications to the North East Tasmanian Innovation and Investment Fund. They came from a diverse cross-section of industry and have the ability to create 63.5 full-time jobs-sustainable, long-term employment. I announced the successful applicants at Woodlea Nursery, one of the successful businesses. The nursery’s owners, Doctors Tony and Anna Waites, run a specialist wholesale nursery which produces over seven million seedlings per year for a number of local forestry businesses. It is the only independent, accredited nursery for the Tasmanian wine sector and supplies around 30 vineyards. These are the stories that I am really proud to be able to tell. This young couple took over this nursery in 2007 after moving from Melbourne. They have invested heavily in the region and they have backed the region. As part of the grant there are three main areas of activity, providing enhanced and upgraded infrastructure to increase production of forestry seedlings and enabling the pursuit of large-scale plant contracts with major garden centres MAIN COMMITTEE throughout Tasmania and interstate. This is one example of the kind of commitment which exists in the north-east of Tasmania. Also successful were: Allan Barnett Motor Yachts, funded to upgrade their equipment and factory to cater for manufacturing larger vessels; Anchor Organics, whose project is the northeast red soil boutique potato project; AW and KSA Carter, to expand their business to install a new milking and herd management automation system; Bicanic’s Joinery, a business which, thanks to this grant, will expand into furniture making; and Branch Fabrication Pty Ltd, who have been funded for sand blasting and industrial painting services. A biologically controlled cool storeroom will be installed at Fernmania. Gilston Interiors’ business will be expanded. KJ Padgett and Co. will be able to improve the quality of fine pinebark produced by the company. Onion growing and packaging facilities will be modernised and employee facilities upgraded at LD and NA Lette. Mechanised Logging Pty Ltd will expand their plantation timber harvesting services. Mount William Lodge and Holiday Park will expand their accommodation, catering and laundry services. The agricultural and forestry machinery supply, maintenance and spare parts business of North East Ag Sales will be expanded. A wellness centre will be developed at Barnbougle by RG Sattler Nominees. Samjack will expand their log trailer manufacturing. Scottsdale Art and Framing will use its grant to add to downstream processing in Tasmania through the manufacturing of local speciality timber picture framing attached to a retail-wholesale art and craft gallery showroom. Scottsdale Pork will expand its piggery. And Stronach Timber will fund an expansion to their green mill. As you can see, these are a diverse range of businesses which stand to benefit from this funding. It was an exhaustive application process. There were some 60 applications-a high number which I believe also signals that there is much confidence in the future among businesses in the north-east of Tasmania, particularly in these hard global economic times. The applications were assessed by a panel of three, which included representatives from both the Tasmanian and Australian governments as well as a community representative. That representative was John Beattie and I would like to thank him for the commitment he made and his contribution to this process. Throughout this period I have said often that we do not want to be going through this again in 18 months time or, for that matter, in two years time. I am hopeful that we have set in train the development of sustainable jobs which will in turn lead to a sustainable region. The northeast of Tasmania is a vibrant and wonderful place. It is a region which, yes, has suffered its share of setbacks and which, like the rest of the country, is not immune to the effects of the global financial crisis. Through the North East Tasmanian Innovation and Investment Fund, we are investing to create more than 63 jobs, and we are witnessing what happens when businesses across a community are given the opportunity to invest in themselves and in their region. (Time expired) Aged Care paigner for the elderly in my electorate of Swan. I spend plenty of time in my electorate talking to older people and the organisations that represent them. One of the places that I visit regularly is the Bentley Park Retirement Village in the southern part of Swan. My latest visit was in February, when I held a Q&A session with the residents about the issues that concern them. One of the issues that concerned the residents the most was the plight of the aged-care MAIN COMMITTEE",229,Adjournment
277,Mr Irons (Swan) (12.30 Pm),"Members will be aware that I am a committed camindustry. I have spoken at length on this issue in the past but will do so again today, because the problem has not gone away; in fact, it appears to be getting worse. In the last aged-care approval round between 2008 and 2009, Western Australian aged-care providers sought only 536 of the available 1,208 aged-care places allocated by the government. The reason for this, which the government does not seem to accept, is that aged-care providers are effectively losing money on every additional government aged-care place. Costs in the industry sector have been rising much faster than government funding has risen. This has a significant impact on aged-care providers, such as the not-for-profit SwanCare, which runs Bentley Park. Sadly, the government and the Minister for Ageing seem to be in denial on this issue. Remarkably, the Minister for Ageing described the 2008-09 round as healthy and competitive. My message today is clear: this crisis must be resolved sooner rather than later or the industry will collapse. I want to demonstrate the importance of having a financially secure aged-care sector by referring to a project which was designed and formulated during a period of greater financial security under the previous government. Next week it will be my pleasure to return to Bentley Park for the opening of the new Kingia facility. I have had an initial glimpse of the new building and I can confirm that it is impressive. The centre contains 82 beds. The design of the building is uplifting and there are good outdoor and indoor spaces. The entry wing includes a cafe, a hairdresser, a gift shop and a pharmacy outlet. The dining, lounge and sitting areas encourage residents to enjoy companionship and shared activities. I understand that SwanCare wants to complete the project with the further addition of a 78bed wing and a community day therapy centre to provide aged-care services to the wider community. What is particularly impressive about the building, however, is that it caters for both residents requiring low care and residents requiring high care. I know from talking to residents that they do not like constantly having to move as they advance through the agedcare system in this country-from their home to residential, from residential to low care and from low care to high care. At this stage in life it is uncomfortable and difficult to adjust to unfamiliar surroundings. This has unfortunately been the norm in the aged-care sector for quite some time. This new innovative complex will alleviate this pressure. The cost of the construction of this facility has been met entirely by SwanCare. However, the ability of SwanCare and other aged-care providers across the country to invest in facilities such as Kingia will be severely constrained by their poor financial position. Until the Minister for Ageing solves this aged-care crisis the industry cannot progress. This crisis is here now and there is no point pretending that it is not. Forty per cent of aged-care providers in Western Australia are under enormous stress. This government seems to show no interest in the aged-care industry. I understand that the Prime Minister was invited to open the Kingia facility. The Prime Minister is a busy man and I understand why he was not able to attend. However, I believe that Bentley Park did not receive any direct communication from his office whatsoever. I would have thought this government would be interested in such an innovative and unique project. This, I think, reveals the government’s approach to the agedcare industry in Australia. I will continue to stand up for my constituents in this place until the aged-care crisis is understood and acted upon by the government and the minister. As this will be my last speech before the May budget, I would like to take the opportunity to remind the MAIN COMMITTEE government of its obligation to address the need to raise pensions for the elderly and the disabled. Australian Electoral Commission Standing Committee on Electoral Matters heard dramatic information from the refreshing new head of the Australian Electoral Commission, Mr Killesteyn. His evidence was not about economic matters; it was about the democratic deficit in Australia. There are 1.2 million Australians not enrolled to vote. This is after all the years of activities of the previous government which, in my view, were deliberately designed to minimise the number of people on the electoral roll. The electoral participation rate at the last election stood at 92.3 per cent of the Australian population, and I repeat: 1.2 million Australians were not enrolled. This is after herculean efforts by the Electoral Commission at the last election, spending $30 million on advertising to enrol 200,000 Australians. We only got the number of people enrolled to 13.6 million after that vast expenditure of money, which financially affected the AEC’s ability to operate and do its normal tasks. Yesterday the committee asked Mr Killesteyn about a whole different methodology for the AEC’s operations. How people could, with an electronic process for changing their address, without further cost to the Australian taxpayer, be able to get themselves on the electoral roll. All of us as parliamentarians know that there is a process that continually takes people off the roll, but we make it so difficult for our constituents, ordinary Australians, to get back on the roll. We really have to do something about this, and any democrat, whether they are in the opposition or the government, should be interested in this. It would take 300,000 extra people to be enrolled in Australia to get us back to 92.3 per cent, the participation rate we had at the last election. We have to enrol 300,000 people by 2010, and it took the AEC $30 million of advertising to get 200,000 people. What balance is this meant to reflect? All through the last few years the previous government talked about the integrity of the electoral roll. Let me go through some of the figures that were revealed at the electoral matters committee hearing yesterday so members can understand the almost bogus nature of this issue. There were about 17,000 apparent multiple votes at the 2001 election, for instance. For 15,000 of those, or 88 per cent, there was an indication from responses that no further action was required. There were 920 people who the AEC got no responses from-letters were undelivered or people were not able to be found. There were 896 examples of multiple voting. People like Mr Pyne, the member for Sturt, have railed about the integrity of the electoral roll at previous elections. Of those 896 multiple votes, 739, or 82 per cent, were elderly people who, completely by a matter of confusion, innocently or because of poor comprehension, voted twice, at a mobile polling booth and then on the day. We know the kinds of circumstances where this can happen without any kind of malevolence by elderly voters. That was 82 per cent of cases of multiple voting. So there were only 138 cases referred to the AFP, of which five were accepted for investigation. So we have 13.6 million Australians and only five proven cases of electoral fraud, which the DPP decided not to follow up. But we have 1.2 million Australians unenrolled. What does this say about the kind of balance that we have in this debate? It is a complete imbalance and the Electoral Commission, with its new Electoral Commissioner, will hopefully do the will of this new government and get more Australians on the electoral roll, increase MAIN COMMITTEE",233,Adjournment
278,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (12.34 Pm),"Yesterday at a public hearing the Jointdemocracy in this country and not focus solely on a few bodgie votes-five at the 2001 election. This is a pattern, by the way, and I have been pointing out that this pattern has been happening for years. Between 1990 and 2009, there were only 72 proven cases of electoral fraud. There were six electoral events and 72 million votes-one per million. When we have such a good electoral system, why are we focusing on disenfranchising Australians and, at the same time, allowing hundreds of thousands of our people to be disenfranchised? I hope the new Electoral Commission gets good advice from the electoral matters committee so that we go and enrol people, we stop taking people off the roll and we particularly stop forcing young people and provisional voters to lose their democratic rights at election time. It is a scandal and it has got to stop. (Time expired) Transport grated transport system around this country. At the moment, and this is the way it has stood for such a long period of time, we have various forms of government-whether they be local councils, state governments or the federal government-doing their own hotchpotch deals from one place to another and things are not being integrated very well. Let me elaborate on that. I would like to start off with railway stations, and particularly railway stations in New South Wales. We see a great need for secure parking spots. The state of New South Wales is running into debt as a result of poor attendance on the trains. When you ask people why they do not catch the trains in New South Wales, they tell you that it is because they are dirty, they are covered in graffiti, they do not run on time, their services are irregular and they are quite often cancelled with no notice whatsoever. My answer to all of this is that we need to make parking at railway stations available to everybody. This should be done by private enterprise rather than by the government. The government in New South Wales are saying that they are broke, they have no money, they have spent all the taxpayers’ money and they have nothing left to improve services. I say to them that they can make some money from selling the spaces above the railway stations to shopping centres. They could sell off these spaces to the 7-Eleven, Woolworths and Magic stores, or any number of other stores. Car parks at railway stations could provide facilities for people to get fuel for their motor vehicles and, as a result, the car parks would be secure and well lit. If you have children, the first thing you think of when you get off a train is that you need a clean, safe toilet that they can go to. You also need somewhere that you can pick up a loaf of bread, a pint of milk or maybe a newspaper. These facilities could be made available at stations. You also need clean, safe and secure parking areas, and so you would need something like a boom gate, a security officer and the area to be well lit. All of this could be achieved if these areas were sold off to private enterprise and if the railway system in New South Wales were privatised. I would like to see an integrated approach to transport right across the board. Another aspect that I would like to pick up on is 40 kilometre an hour speed zones around schools in New South Wales. Quite often, there are three or six lanes across the front entrances of those schools located near a main road. It is absolutely ridiculous that the entrances to these schools are located near the main road. In these areas fences with sound barriers MAIN COMMITTEE",235,Adjournment
279,Mr Farmer (Macarthur) (12.39 Pm),"TodayI rise to speak on the need for an inteshould be put up to prevent not only noise from entering the schools but also kids from kicking balls onto the road, which they might chase and run the risk of being hit by a car. When cars have to drop down to 40 kilometres an hour in these areas, the traffic is slowed down dramatically. The school on Narellan Road in my electorate is a classic example. The school is one kilometre from the main road, yet it has a 40 kilometre an hour speed zone. There are other smaller roads and cul-de-sacs from which the school could be entered so that children could be picked up and dropped off. Instead, traffic is inconvenienced. It has to slow down to a ridiculous pace, and this creates an absolute nightmare every single morning and afternoon. I understand that we need safety measures in some areas where schools have only one entrance, but I am asking for some common sense to prevail in this instance. I am asking for an integrated approach to transport where we look at not only the pedestrians but also the drivers, the buses, the trains and the parking at major facilities such as airports, schools and hospitals which we need to get to and from. We need to integrate these services much better. I am calling on the federal government to talk to its state counterparts so that we can get some dialogue going on all of this. Alcopops Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (12.44 pm)-It is important for every member of parliament to put on the public record their position regarding our responsibility to give a very strong message to all communities across this country that we do not accept the pattern of binge drinking-a new sign of alcoholic dependence, particularly amongst our young people-that has emerged in this nation. The decision by the Liberal-National coalition and Senator Fielding not to support the legislation on alcohol that would see an impost on this drug of addiction that is so attractive in the form of alcopops and so affordable will cause huge harm and put our young people at risk. I stand as the member for Newcastle, a city that has the second highest number of alcohol related assaults in the state of New South Wales, following on the heels of Wilcannia. That is how severe the problem is in my electorate. We have been assisted by this government. We have been assisted through the $53 million program that is in place. Newcastle City Council put in an excellent submission and received $250,000 to address this serious issue. I cannot believe that anyone would play politics with such an important message. I also stand as the mother of two young adult daughters. Normal life experiences and observations would say to us that we have a responsibility to do all we can to undo the harm that is happening in our communities. For many years I watched my daughters’ friends choose what was so well marketed and so available-alcopops. It is still occurring. My very good friends and neighbours, at the end of last year, hosted a party after their daughter’s year 10 formal and were removing from other parents four-packs of alcopops. The parents were saying, ‘Oh, I’ll leave this with you.’ The hosts’ response was, ‘There won’t be any alcohol consumed by these 16-year-old girls tonight.’ It is such a pervasive thing in our culture now. I am not going into all of the different political arguments put forward in this debate. This was a chance to give a strong message, a united, bipartisan message, to the people of Australia that we care sufficiently about our youth to take any measure we can to protect them. There is no acceptance by the public that this government is being duplicitous by just trying to raise MAIN COMMITTEE revenue and not address the problem. With the COAG agreement of $872 million worth of funding and a prevention agenda looking at alcohol, tobacco and obesity, these problems will be tackled in earnest. But the cultural problem that we all face is such a huge moral issue that I think the public will be very disappointed at the actions of those who opposed the alcopops legislation. I cannot say enough about the risky situations that young girls face. Having been a school principal, I have seen kids given a four-pack for their birthday at 12, at 13. I have counselled young girls who have been put in situations where they were at risk of sexual abuse, physical abuse and harm to themselves. I have counselled young boys who have been the victims of violence at the end of alcohol binge drinking by young people. I am absolutely disappointed and I say democracy has let down the people of Australia. It has definitely let down the young people in my electorate. I am very concerned as well, as the chair of the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, at that revenue now missing in the budget. This is not the time to play with a budget. The Audit Office’s role is important and I do not ever want to see it compromisedthat is, the role of the National Audit Office and the Auditor-General-and I guess every member will stand up and say what has been compromised by this decision in the budget. But I want to see us always accountable for what we do here. But the accountability the public will be looking at now is the fact that we have let them down and we have seriously let down our youth of Australia by not passing the legislation. Economy Dunkley Electorate: Transport urge the Rudd government, in its search for savings, not to squib out of its responsibility to provide a pension increase for Australia’s pensioners. My party’s former leader, Brendan Nelson, and the Liberal-National Party have been very active in emphasising the need for a pension increase, and I urge the Rudd government to do the right thing and to provide that increase in the upcoming budget. I also think there is a serious need to examine the plight of self-funded retirees. There is a lot of talk in these circles, in this building and by government representatives about urging banks to pass official cuts to interest rates announced by the Reserve Bank on to mortgage holders and the like, but there is also a need for the government to pass on those interest rate cuts more quickly by adjusting the deeming rate for self-funded retirees. If interest rate reductions are something that needs to be passed on quickly by banks, the government should act more decisively in passing on those very same interest rate reductions-and the impact on investments and on income streams-to self-funded retirees by a more rapid and responsive adjustment to deeming rates. The question of frozen assets facing many self-funded retirees still haunts many people in my community as they plan to access, say, the capital or the nest egg that they had invested for home improvements or for other requirements such as the payment of rates, which can be a very substantial impost on people and well outside their regular income stream. Self-funded retirees need to be taken into account. From the jobs forums I have conducted in Dunkley, I hear the small business community are being done over by the banks. They have lines of credit that they may have secured on MAIN COMMITTEE",236,Adjournment
280,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (12.49 Pm),"In my last opportunity before the May budget, Ireasonable terms on which they might not have exercised the overdraft that is available to them but, because of that, the banks are saying, ‘Give it back. Give back those financing facilities.’ They are made to give back the very thing that gives comfort to very anxious small businesses and self-employed and independent contractors. Those people do not become unemployed-they just do not have enough work. They need to have the comfort of these resources, which they were provided with and had planned for, under the terms and conditions which the banks offered them. They do not need to have some big bank heavy them into surrendering those attractive financing facilities and then tell them that they are unilaterally going to re-rate the risk of their business and have them pay one to 1.4 per cent more for small business financing. That is not what should be happening at the moment. With all the support that is being provided to the banking sector we deserve much better, much more thoughtful behaviour by banks towards those who are very exposed and very anxious at this time. In the few minutes that are left I want to touch on some ongoing and compelling transport issues in the Dunkley community. I have spoken countless times about the need for the Frankston bypass and the bottleneck that has been created at the end of the Frankston Freeway with the opening at EastLink. Everybody could see this coming except VicRoads and the state Labor government, but now they are coming around. We need to get on with that process. The EES hearings are underway, panel submissions are being discussed and considered. The bandicoot has been considered. I am a friend of the bandicoot, and we have the area covered if a new colony of bandicoots can be established. The former government have invested in it. Let’s get on with it. If you want to add something to the project, add a public transport connection. Extend the Frankston rail line, electrify it down to Baxter, a perfect place for a park-and-ride facility to interconnect pavement or freeway based transport with rail based public transport and other bus opportunities. It is something that should happen. But, as if that frustration is not enough, we then have the sound barriers. So loud is the noise that people are hearing from the EastLink extra traffic on the Frankston Freeway, and so difficult is an opportunity for good sleep, that the noise must be affecting people at VicRoads. They cannot hear the cries of the local residents who want something done about the noise nuisance and the noise pollution in their neighbourhoods. We can put money into faux hotels as public art along freeways-that is terrific and we all get a giggle out of it-but let’s pick up one of those artworks and park it on its side near the homes of these communities that would just like a decent night’s sleep. It cannot be that hard. Finally, if you thought it could not get any worse-I did not think it could but it has-we now have the P-turn proposition for Frankston where, to turn right off McMahons Road onto Cranbourne Road, you actually have to turn left. We are pretty good at hook turns in our city of Melbourne, but having a hook turn on steroids in Frankston is no answer to a serious traffic problem. The exit to Clarendon Street has then been closed to force people to drive down the back streets-Lawrey Street, Allenby Street and Melvin Street-onto Birdwood Street to get from Cranbourne Road to the medical clinics in Clarendon Street. Who thought of this idea? Who possibly thought of the traffic congestion in local streets? (Time expired) Alcopops Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.54 pm)-by leave-In rising to speak again in this debate I would first like to compliment the member for Newcastle on her fine contribution to the deMAIN COMMITTEE bate, raising the issue of alcopops and the enormous impact that the failure by the Senate to pass that legislation will have. I know that Newcastle is an electorate where there have been a number of problems with young people binge drinking, and that has created enormous issues in the electorate. The member for Newcastle has been out there fighting to see that programs are introduced in the electorate to ensure that this phenomenon is addressed. It is an issue that is having an enormous impact on young people throughout Australia. I must say that I am very disappointed that the opposition failed to support the government’s legislation when the AMA is supporting it and every leading health authority in the area is saying that this issue is of such great importance. Binge drinking is an issue that has the potential to basically wipe out a generation of young people. To think that the opposition would not pass this measure and would not seriously consider the enormous impact that alcopops are having! Alcopops are the vehicle for introducing young people, and particularly young girls, to alcohol. Any member of this House can visit areas in their electorate where young people congregate, and they will see young people drinking alcopops. They will see the effect that they have on young people. And, if they were to track the lives of some of those young people who have developed a dependency on alcohol through the introduction of alcopops, they would then have to live with the consequence of not supporting this legislation. Mr Billson interjectingcommented on the seriousness of the approach. If it was not a measure that was worth supporting, why did all leading health experts support the legislation? Why did theyMr Billson interjectinggreat latitude by the chair. He should remember that. that both sides of the parliament should support? Why was it that the opposition chose to ignore the voices of those health experts who see the long-term impact that alcohol has in our hospitals and who can see on a daily basis that the impact that alcohol has on young people is much greater than that of illicit drugs? People on the other side of this House, the opposition, will argue until they are blue in the face against supplying illicit drugs, with a particular emphasis on young people. I would say to them: this is a drug that they have an ability to control. This is a drug that has far greater impact on the lives of young people. Because the opposition have failed to support this legislation, they have failed the young people of Australia, and the consequences will become apparent. I ask them to go back, think about it and make a decision to support the legislation. (Time expired) today. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 12.59 pm MAIN COMMITTEE",238,Adjournment

288,Mr Griffin,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:ABC Learning Centres (Question No. 630) Mr Robert asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 10 March 2009: Is the Government willing to continue to fund certain former ABC Learning Centres during the purchaser take-over period, even if this transition extends beyond the funding cut-off of 31 March 2009. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Since the Member lodged his question I have made an announcement on this issue. Since ABC Learning’s insolvency late last year the Australian Government has had the interests of parents, their children and ABC Learning employees front and centre. The Government’s approach throughout has been to seek an orderly, logical process for working through the problem with the primary focus on continuity of care for the children involved. In December 2009 we supported the appointment of Court Appointed Receivers PPB Corporate Recovery, whose task has been to run a process aimed at selling the 241 non-Defence centres that were judged to be unviable under the ABC business model. We have funded the losses incurred by those centres and the Receivership costs, so that families can maintain existing child care arrangements while the process runs its course. The Court Appointed Receivers have a big job on their hands. No one has ever previously tried to sell 241 ‘unviable’ childcare centres. PPB has made good progress and contracts are already being exchanged for 65 centres. However, the complexity of the Court Appointed Receivership is reflected in the fact that they are dealing with over 180 bidders whose bids relate to leases held by over 100 landlords. Against this background, PPB has asked the Government to continue to support the receivership for a short, one-off additional period. PPB’s request has been agreed and the Government will make the relevant application to the NSW Supreme Court. The Government has also agreed to continue to fund the Court Appointed Receivership for a period of a further 6 weeks, on a once only basis, until 15 May 2009. Costs incurred by the Commonwealth during the receivership of ABC have been lower than was originally projected based on ABC’s records. We have therefore agreed that underspends accrued on the process to date may be drawn upon to fund the continuation of the Court Appointed Receivership for the 6 week period. No additional tax payer funds will be needed to support centres as part of the ABC insolvency. PPB has advised that they will announce the outcome for each centre by 15 April 2009. This is expected to leave sufficient time for the sale process to be completed on or before 15 May 2009.",243,Questions In Writing
