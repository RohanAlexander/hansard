The federal unfair dismissal under comparable state unfair dismissal legislation only applies to employees of conschemes. However, the interaction of federal stitutional corporations who are covered by a unfair dismissal laws with other Commonwealth, state or territory laws would largely remain unaffected. An example of this might be the anti-discrimination laws in the various state jurisdictions. It is estimated that the number of employees covered by the expanded system will increase from approximately 3.9 million to around 6.8 million. So it is a pretty significant piece of legislation that this government seeks to pass. More Time for Business, the 1997 government response to the 1996 Small Business Deregulation Task Force, identified business and community concerns that termination of employment provisions were an employment disincentive for small business. The government’s report found that these provisions have a disproportionate and detrimental impact on small business in terms of human resource administration procedures, representation at commission hearings and lost business and commercial opportunities while defending claims. This is something that has come through very strongly in the meetings that I have had with members of the Ryan Small Business Advisory Committee. This might be an appropriate time for me to inform the House of one significant commercial entity in the electorate of Ryan. The managing director of that business has taken the initiative and time to write to me, only a couple of days ago, on this very point. He sent me a fax, in which he gave me some information about his business and commented upon the themes and topics that this bill addresses. I would like to put this company, Pillow Talk, on the record. It is a family business which employs approximately small and medium sized businesses employ 220 people. The company has warehouses in more of our fellow Australians. I would like the suburbs of Darra and Sumner Park in my to think that everybody in this House, and in electorate.

The first point that unified national system, he did not want it I wish to take issue with is his claim that this now and he did not want it in this way. It was bill, if passed, will involve the Australian a distinctly Augustinian approach, I thought: people in substantial extra costs.

If business is unaware of what the The second point made by the member for true jurisdictional situation is, how much Barton that I would like to take up was a more is that likely to be the case with ordirecognition of the desirability of giving the nary workers, the people who are bringing federal tribunal the ability to dismiss matters these applications? It will be a great boon to without merit without requiring the attenbusiness and a great boon to workers if they dance on the tribunal of the respondents.

The second is by deals with unfair dismissal claims. referral. The third is by what I have previThe third and most important point that I ously called legislative encroachment. The take up is the commitment that the member member for Barton was most anxious that we for Barton repeatedly made in his speech to a should proceed to a more unified national more unified national system.

Thursday, 15 May 2003 ----Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd manufacturers and suppliers of approximately 70 per cent of the complementary medicines in Australia, had their manufacturing licence suspended for six months. The Therapeutic Goods Administration, the TGA, made that decision due to serious quality and safety breaches in the manufacture of therapeutic goods and ordered an urgent recall initially of over 200 products and now, at last count, of over 1,500 products manufactured and supplied in Australia by Pan. While everyone was busy checking the newspapers, checking the vitamins in their pantries and rushing to the shops demanding a refund, I believe not enough thought was given-nor immediate help offered-to health food store owners, who had to cope with the harsh fallout from the recall. A number of small business owners in my electorate of Lowe were left to cope with the tidal wave of customer complaints without warning and without adequate advice from wholesalers and government. A week into the crisis, I was contacted by Mrs Josie Civitarese from Five Dock. Mrs Civitarese owns the Healthland Nutrition Centre, a health food shop in Leichhardt Marketown, and is a victim of this failure. Through no fault of her own, Mrs Civitarese-the sole owner of her store for 20 years-along with many other health food small business owners and employees, was left to cope with abusive demands from customers while being forced to remove almost two-thirds of her stock from the shelves. While no-one doubts the need to remove any potentially dangerous items from the shelves as soon as possible, it is outrageous that Mrs Civitarese and other retailers had little or no warning of the recall and little or no information about their rights and responsibilities or the rights of the angry customers they would have to deal with. Shop owners should not have been left to compete with every member of the public for information about the biggest recall of health products in Australian history. While I support the measures in the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002, which were debated in the House yesterday and are designed to clarify the definition of a therapeutic good and to create new offences for advertisers breaching the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code, a number of serious issues arising from the Pan recall have not been satisfactorily addressed. Under the Howard government, we have seen problems in the operation of the regulatory system with respect to Pan grow over a long period of time. It raises serious questions about the nature of the regulation of the industry. In this area and in so many other areas under the Howard government, we have seen a movement towards increased selfregulation and self-assessment. The government does not understand that real people end up paying too high a price for this regulatory indolence. This is not good enough, and the cheap political attack on the Premier of New South Wales by the Minister for Small Business and Tourism typified the Howard government’s inadequate response. Mrs Civitarese and all my constituents who have suffered during this crisis through no fault of their own deserve a lot better.

300,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley) Took The Chair At 9.40 A.m.,,137,Statements By Members
301,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (9.40 A.m.),"On 28 April 2003, Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd, theBudget 2003-04 budget that was brought down on Tuesday night and, in particular, to congratulate the government on another excellent piece of economic management. It is all about protecting, securing and building Australia’s future and it takes responsible action now to protect Australia’s economy. We have had many unexpected things happen, such as the Bali atrocity; war in Iraq; an unstable world economic environment; one of the worse droughts on record, which particular affected all of my electorate of Eden-Monaro; and the January bushfires in the Snowy Mountains, on the Monaro and further north around Michelago, not to mention the area to the west of the ACT. As a result of good economic management, my constituents can look forward to modest income tax cuts from 1 July this year. The debate that has gone on about the level of the tax cuts is interesting. For the Labor Party, it seems that asking somebody to spend something extra is very different from getting money back. Remember that last year in the budget we proposed to increase the PBS by $1. Simon Crean was outraged about this; this $1 was potentially the end of the world for many people! He said: We know one million pensioners and concession card holders will pay the maximum of $52 extra per year and 300,000 Australians are in families who will pay the maximum $190 extra. But this week, when we give $4-four times the dollar that he was on about last year-back to the people, he says: The $4, where’s the $4 going to go? I mean, that’s what you give a busker when you go into the mall and see them performing. That is absolute hypocrisy, typical political reaction and real waffle. You say one thing when you are asked to pay something extra, and you say something totally different when you get something back, even when it is four times the amount. It is incredible hypocrisy. Not only have we had that good economic management; we have also been able to continue to pay off more and more of the Labor debt. The confirmation of Defence headquarters EIS project in my electorate between Queanbeyan and Bungendore is certainly good news, and that project is coming along extremely well. Also confirmed in the budget is the completion of the Naval Ammunitioning Facility at Twofold Bay, Eden, and the $2 million towards Queanbeyan’s bypass, which we announced earlier on. So there are some very good things there for the electorate of Eden-Monaro. Throsby Electorate: Wollongong Hospital MRI Facilities Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (9.46 a.m.)-I rise on this occasion to express my concerns, and those of the people of the Illawarra region, about the failure of the federal Minister for Health and Ageing to issue a much needed Medicare licence for an MRI machine to our regional central hospital, Wollongong Hospital. The situation has become more pressing with the hospital recently opening a stroke unit, which has treated over 100 patients to date with great success. Wollongong Hospital is one of the 12 principal referral facilities in New South Wales, currently providing high-level neurological and oncology services. It is also being upgraded to teaching hospital status. The New South Wales government has recently expended large sums of money to refurbish the hospital and, as part of the hospital upgrade, has provided for an MRI facility and has indicated its willingness to provide the machine. MAIN COMMITTEE",137,Statements By Members
302,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro) (9.43 a.m.)-TodayI would like to say a few words about theThere is no doubt that the Illawarra is underserviced in terms of access to MRI services and that has, in fact, been identified as a priority by the state government. It is an appalling situation to think that current patients in this major hospital who require an MRI scan either are forced to travel, often by ambulance, to another public MRI facility outside the region or are referred to a private facility, and again often are transported there by ambulance. The costs are considerable for my constituents: the minimum cost being a gap fee of over $70, and access to an unlicensed local MRI private machine can see constituents paying $500 or more. I recently wrote to the health minister urging the government to give serious consideration to the needs of the Illawarra region for a licence for the machine at Wollongong Hospital. I find the minister’s reply totally unsatisfactory. She says: The Commonwealth Government regulates the conditions under which MRI services attract Medicare rebates, however, it does not regulate or restrict the establishment of MRI units in public hospitals. I think that is a self-evident truth. The point of my submission on behalf of my constituents was to say that the state government would provide the machine and the facility. I was asking the federal government to provide a licence so that in using the facility at the hospital my constituents could access the Medicare rebate. In effect, the federal government is denying my constituents access to services that are so desperately needed and doing so under the pretence that it is a state and not a federal issue. I believe the minister is playing party politics and that we are being denied because it is a traditional Labor area. (Time expired)) Williams, Sir Sydney and Resources) (9.49 a.m.)-At two o’clock today at St Monica’s Cathedral in Cairns, the Catholic Bishop of Cairns, James Foley, will be holding a requiem mass in honour and commemoration of one of Cairns’s greatest citizens and one of our greatest sons, Sir Sydney Williams. The mass will be followed tomorrow by a private burial in Sir Sydney’s home town of Yungaburra on the Atherton Tablelands. Sir Sydney was born in Yungaburra in 1920. He had a very difficult childhood in that he lost his father at the age of nine and his mother nine months later, so he was reared by other relatives. He was educated initially at Yungaburra State School. He then went to St Augustines College in Cairns and later went on to Mount Carmel College in Charters Towers. He married his wife, Joy, in 1940. He served in World War II in the Middle East with the 7th Australian Division, and in 1942 fought against Japanese forces in Papua New Guinea. He was commanding officer of the Far North Queensland Regiment, our 51st Battalion, retiring in 1957. Sir Sydney’s achievements are many. It is impossible to be able to relate them all in the short time that I have, but he was a pioneer of our aviation industry and our bush pilot airways. He was known as one of the fathers of our tourism industry, having developed the Cape York Wilderness Lodge-later known as Pajinka-the Albatross Hotel in Weipa and Lizard Island Lodge. In 1966, when the young Prince Charles was at Timbertop in Victoria, Sir Sydney entertained Prince Charles at his home in Cairns. Sir Sydney was very active in the business community and had many other notable activities. He was Deputy Chairman of the Australian Tourist Commission, a board member of the Cairns Port Authority, Director of the Reef Trust Casino, Director of the Queensland Film Commission, Chair of CRC Barrier Reef Research, Director of CRC Sustainable Tourism and was on the Board of Trustees of the World Wildlife Fund, to name a few. His greatest legacies are his founding of the Far North QueenMAIN COMMITTEE",138,Statements By Members

He was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1977, was knighted in 1983 and received the Centenary Medal this year. Sadly, Sir Sydney Williams passed away on Sunday at the Cairns Base Hospital at the age of 83. He is survived by his wife, Lady Joy Williams; their four sons, John, Brian, Peter and David; 11 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. There is no doubt about it: Sir Sydney has left a lasting legacy in Cairns and will be forever remembered. (Time expired) Melbourne Ports Electorate: Memorial Events ourful nature of my electorate and indeed modern Australia. I was so pleased with my dear friends former member for Albert Park, Bunna Walsh, and Perce White, both deserving recipients of the Centenary for organising the third revival of ANZAC Day in Port Melbourne. It brought together the new residents of Beacon Cove and the older residents of Port Melbourne. It is an astonishing ANZAC Day memorial on the beach at Port Melbourne, from where the ships left in the First World War and the Second World War to take the Australian Imperial Force overseas in both of those conflicts. We marked the occasion at the cairn, from where the troops marched off onto the ships. Last ANZAC Day, we heard an extraordinary speech by Flight Lieutenant Catherine Templeton, a young, extremely capable woman reservist who works full time at Toyota. She served with the Australian forces in Bali and is a great credit to our country. She worked in media on the front with one of the Australian battalions while she took six months to be with the full-time forces. The second event in my electorate that I want to pay particular attention to occurred on 9 May. Hundreds and hundreds of Russian veterans of the Second World War celebrated the 58th Anniversary of the Victory over Fascism. My good friend Mike Suss represented me as the speaker. I particularly want to pay tribute to the president, Meir Khazanov, and his wonderful veterans Mayer Gurevich and Ios Tepper, all of whom fought in the Second World War-Ios all the way from Stalingrad to the Battle of the Oder. I am very pleased that I was able to organise for hundreds of these veterans to have their stories translated into English. They will be placed in the National Archives and various libraries. I particularly want to thank the Liberman, Gandel and Pratt families for their generosity in sponsoring the translations of these Soviet veterans’ great stories. It is also a credit to Australia that we have been able to absorb these people so wonderfully over the last 25 years. The third event that I want to mention is another function in my electorate that I had great joy in participating in, and that was the induction to the Melbourne Hebrew congregation of Rabbi David Rubinfeld, who was inducted by probably Australia’s most senior rabbi, Rabbi Chaim Gutnick. I want to pay tribute particularly to the president of the synagogue, Leon Yaffe, for the fantastic ceremony. I wish Rabbi Rubinfeld hatzlocha. I wish the Melbourne Hebrew Congregation Toorak Shule continuing success with their new rabbi. Again, Rabbi Rubinfeld is a great Australian. After coming from Brooklyn, he never imagined that he would end up as rabbi, but he said it was ‘orchestrated by the conductor in heaven’. I, like others attending services, think it is wonderful to hear him singing the great Sabbath hymn MAIN COMMITTEE",139,Statements By Members
304,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (9.52 A.m.),"Three events underline the exciting and colAdon Alon to the tune of On the road to Gundagai. It is a wonderful Jewish/Australian amalgam. Hinkler Electorate: Bundaberg Call Centre Leichhardt at the passing of Sir Sidney Williams. He was a friend of mine, a great North Queenslander and a true pioneer of regional aviation. But today I would like to talk about the opening of Australia’s fourth Salmat call centre in Bundaberg, which happened just over a week ago. Around 120 call centre employees are handling general sales, billing and new connection inquiries for Telstra, with an economic spin-off of an estimated $3 million into the Bundaberg economy. The opening of the call centre ushers in a new era for our ‘Rum City’, with service industries lining up alongside agriculture and manufacturing as viable and valued members of our local economy. It proves that Bundaberg and like regional centres have the ability, assets and attributes to compete with Australia’s burgeoning services sector. The property and business services sector is one of the fastest growing sectors in Australia, with an average annual growth rate of 7.5 per cent between the censuses of 1996 and 2001. The traditional manufacturing and agricultural sectors, by comparison, grew only 2.5 and 2.9 per cent respectively in that same time frame. Bundaberg now has a firm grasp on the dynamics of the teleservice industry, and there is no reason that other regional population centres should not do likewise. Advances in telecommunications technology, infrastructure, the Internet and broadband mean that almost any regional hub can share in the growth of Australia’s service sector. Companies can establish state-of-the-art facilities in regions and tap into reasonably priced real estate, affordable housing and an enthusiastic work force. The sector also offers flexible employment to significant sections of the community, such as students, mothers working part-time and single parents. I am proud to say that such attractions are what drew Salmat to Bundaberg. This was confirmed by joint managing director Phil Salter, who commented on the low staff drop-out rate compared with larger centres. Apparently only two people out of the 120 who were trained for the Bundaberg call centre dropped out before the opening day of business-a remarkably low figure compared with that of the capital cities. The call centre’s impact on local employment is already being felt. Bundaberg’s dole queue fell by 180 job seekers last month, down six per cent on the corresponding time last year. The call centre has begun operations, and I would like to congratulate Telstra and Salmat for their faith in Bundaberg. I wish them well. Amongst those who deserve special mention are Brett Riley, representing Don Pinel, Regional Managing Director of Telstra Country Wide in Queensland; Phil Salter and Peter Mattick, Salmat joint managing directors; Gary Hermann, national sales manager for Telstra; and, of course, Chris Hayes and his enthusiastic 120 employees, who are most welcome in Bundaberg. der 275A, the time for members’ statements has concluded.

305,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (9.56 A.m.),I add my condolences to those of the member for,141,Murray Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002
306,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley),"Order! In accordance with standing orThat this bill be now read a second time. 2002 amends the Murray-Darling Basin Act of 1993 to give effect to an agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria on new arrangements for sharing water made available to the River Murray catchment. The Murray-Darling Basin covers one million square kilometres and comprises about 14 per cent of Australia’s continental land mass. It extends across four states and includes Australia’s three longest rivers-the Darling, the Murray and the Murrumbidgee. The basin incorporates 75 per cent of Australia’s irrigation and supports 40 per cent of Australia’s agricultural production. The health of the basin is critical to the Australian economy and the prosperity of the regional communities that depend on it. I see my colleague the member for Wills on the speakers list for this bill, and I am sure he will have a little more to say about the environmental issues. The Murray-Darling Basin Agreement was made in June 1992 between the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and replaced the River Murray Waters Agreement. The state of Queensland became a party to the agreement in 1996. The agreement concerns the management of the basin’s land, water and environmental resources. In short, this bill gives effect to the Murray-Darling Basin Amending Agreement. The amending agreement was agreed to by the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council in October 2001 and was signed by the Prime Minister and the premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in June 2002. The amending agreement makes important changes to the regime for sharing water in the River Murray catchment above Hume Dam and is subject to parliamentary approval in all relevant jurisdictions. The amending agreement removes references to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority and the associated Snowy Mountains Agreement. This is required in the wake of the corporatisation of the Snowy scheme which occurred on 28 June 2002, following repeal of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act of 1949 and its replacement with the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Act of 1997. The amending agreement also requires the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to determine the respective allocations to New South Wales and Victoria from increased water flows according to an environmental strategy developed by the commission. It, one, protects Victoria’s and South Australia’s rights to water from the River Murray; two, enables the transfer of water savings and purchases to environmental entitlements for the Snowy River and the River Murray; and, three, establishes additional water accounting, notification, consultation and modelling mechanisms that will be the responsibility of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. The basis of the amending agreement is a deal between the Commonwealth and the governments of New South Wales and Victoria to allocate an additional 70 gigalitres per annum in environmental flows for the River Murray. The deal is also designed to deliver improved environmental outcomes for rivers in the Kosciuszko National Park. The New South Wales and Victorian Labor governments have agreed to a staged return of 28 per cent of average natural flows to the Snowy River. To do this, these two Labor governments have committed $300 million to return 21 per cent of original flows to the Snowy over 10 years. A key element of the arrangement is the absence of adverse consequences for irrigators’ water entitlements, South Australia’s water security, water quality or existing environmental flows. The MAIN COMMITTEE",141,Murray Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002
307,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (9.59 A.m.),"The Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Billamending agreement has been the subject of extensive consultation and agreement and is supported by the New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian Labor governments. Federal Labor also lends its support to this bill. Basin Amendment Bill 2002. As you may know, my electorate of Barker takes in a large part of the lower Murray, right through to the Murray mouth near Goolwa on the Fleurieu Peninsula. In fact, my electorate starts at Swan Reach and goes downstream from there. Between us, the Speaker-the member for Wakefield-and I represent the entire Murray River region in South Australia. The Murray River is an important watercourse not only throughout my electorate but also throughout the rest of South Australia. During dry conditions, such as those experienced recently, the River Murray is used for up to 90 per cent of South Australia’s drinking water and irrigation. Not only that, the River Murray in my electorate is home to a fantastic tourism industry, which covers houseboats, river cruise boats and floating hotels right through to campers, who may waterski and participate in other water sports on the river. It is an industry which currently is doing well, but it does rely on the health of the Murray to survive. For this reason, I would like to provide my support for the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002. It has very significant features intended to help the plight of the River Murray, both environmentally and economically, which I believe will bring great benefits to the entire region. It is interesting that only last week I was part of a Liberal Party Regional and Rural Council three-day tour of the Murray River in South Australia. Included on that tour was the Leader of the Opposition, Rob Kerin; the shadow minister for primary resources, the Hon. Caroline Schaefer; the Hon. David Ridgway; the Hon. John Dawkins; Ivan Venning, who represents a state electorate that covers part of the Murray River electorate that I represent; and quite a few other MPs and party officials. They took the time to go out to the Murray mouth, where there is presently some dredging going on to try and keep it open. Frankly, I was shocked. It had been some time since I had been to the Murray mouth, and I remember it as long as 30 years ago, when I used to go fishing there with my father and friends. The water level at the Murray mouth, by my estimation, is about 15 metres lower than it was 30 years ago when we used to go fishing. So it is no wonder that it is virtually impossible to keep the Murray mouth open the way we are trying to now. It is a shame because not only is it having a huge effect on the tourist industry but also there is a significant long-term fishing industry-several generations of families had been sustainably fishing the Murray mouth in the Coorong area. One only has to look at the whole Coorong, which is part of a Ramsar agreement, to see that we have got huge problems because we are not getting the so-called environmental flows coming down the Murray River which can then replenish the Coorong and keep the Murray mouth open. I believe I have a possible solution to what is happening with the Coorong. The Murray mouth is situated at the top of the Coorong and is replenished by the flows of the Murray River, which can come over the barrages there, but of course that has not happened for some 18 months. Tides could be used to replenish the water of the Coorong down at the lower reaches, possibly around the Salt Creek area or the Forty-Two Mile Creek area. In fact, before we came on the scene the water used to come inland at Salt Creek. The Coorong salinity content is quite a bit stronger than sea water now. Obviously it is very stale because it has not had any replenishment. Of course it is actually much lower than sea MAIN COMMITTEE",142,Murray Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002
308,Mr Secker (Barker) (10.03 A.m.),"I rise today to add my support to the Murray-Darlinglevel now. By some fairly simple-I would have thought-engineering possibilities, we could have sea water coming in with the tides to the lower reaches of the Coorong, which could then act as a natural pump at the top area of the Coorong and near the Murray mouth. Unfortunately, trying to keep the mouth open probably affects at best only the top 10 per cent of the Coorong, because there is simply not enough water coming in. But if we were able to have quite large amounts of sea water providing a natural equilibrium for the CoorongI think we could go a long way towards saving the Coorong from becoming a dying resourceremembering, as I said, that it is part of a world Ramsar agreement, because it is such an important part of our ecological base. I certainly do have the pleasure of representing the Coorong, and it is a resource we need to protect. In contrast, it is interesting to note that, whilst the Liberal Party organised a three-day tour of the Murray River, the response of the Premier, Mike Rann, was to drive down to the Murray mouth, get his picture taken and put out a press release saying he was trying to do something. It is all very well to be a media personality-I think even by his own standards he would call himself a media tart-but it was noted by the locals that he basically flew in to the Murray mouth and flew out. He did not notify the locals and he did not talk to the locals as we did. We spoke with community groups in Goolwa, which is the town nearest to the Murray mouth, and we spoke with irrigators at Langhorne Creek, who produce some of the best red wines in the world. They are fearful that they will not have any water supplies to irrigate their grapes in future. This is a relatively new scheme, introduced under a state Liberal government in the mid-1990s. Under the guarantee of water allocations that the previous Premier of South Australia Tom Playford ensured for South Australia, everybody thought that they would have no problems with the water supply. Unfortunately, because of the drought-and I am not blaming any government for that, of course-South Australians do have some serious concerns that their guaranteed allocation will actually be reduced. That could have a fundamental effect on irrigation along the Murray River, especially in my electorate of Barker. It is very important that we acknowledge that the irrigators in Langhorne Creek, for example, have made quite amazing efficiency gains in quite a few areas with the irrigation they use. In some cases, they are only using up to a quarter of the water that they had planned to use some five or six years ago when they put the scheme in. We should acknowledge the Langhorne Creek irrigators for the good work that they are doing there. It has the effect of producing beautiful fruit wine which some of us can enjoy. This bill seeks to amend the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement, a schedule to the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1993. The purpose of the agreement is to promote and coordinate effective planning and management for the equitable, efficient and sustainable use of the water, land and environmental resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. The effect of the amendments contained in the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill is to make new arrangements for sharing between New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, with the water being made available in the River Murray catchment above the Hume Dam by the Snowy scheme. The amendments will hopefully also protect South Australia’s water rights in the event that New South Wales fails to ensure either the release of increased environmental flows to the Snowy River or the required annual releases from the Snowy scheme to the River Murray. This will ensure that the annual environmental flows are met. Unfortunately, they are not being met now. MAIN COMMITTEE There is no doubt that the health of the River Murray has suffered and is suffering as a result of all the water redirections. That is not to say that they were not necessary; that is merely a factual statement. In particular, in the Fleurieu, Murray, Mallee and Riverland regions of my electorate-regions through which the Murray River flows-there has been a noticeable decline in the quality of the water, and the higher water temperatures and lower oxygen content of the river have also adversely affected various inhabitants of the River Murray in those regions. For these reasons, it is very important that every decision made with regard to the Murray-Darling Basin is carefully considered, discussed and debated, because we are talking about the most important watercourse in South Australia, and the system is obviously the most important watercourse in Australia. What happens upstream is of great concern to the people in my electorate and to all South Australians. It is really important that South Australians and all Australians recognise the impact that they themselves have on the river system. We must look at ways in which they can improve the plight of the river as well. In my electorate of Barker, farmers and other interested parties are willing to do so. However, they cannot do it alone. Unfortunately, I have to say that the state Labor government in South Australia has been irresponsible in not already bringing in water restrictions in Adelaide. It is very hard for us to argue with other states which have water restrictions; the water is going past them and we then say to them, ‘Well, we haven’t got water restrictions in South Australia, including in Adelaide.’ I think it is only reasonable that we all share the burden. The South Australian government is talking about bringing in water restrictions now but, frankly, they should have been in place for the last six months. We have had the worse drought in Australia’s history. Anyone with any ability to discern and look at what is happening can see what a huge effect that has had on the Murray-Darling system. The situation in the lower Murray at the moment is that farmers are willing to improve their irrigation practices to help the Murray, but they are being hampered by a penny-pinching South Australian Labor government which are wasting time and money on administrative activities instead of helping the farmers get on with the job of fixing the problems on the ground. I am pretty upset about this, because we have done a lot of work in consulting with the local community. We had a plan with the previous Liberal government which was based on processes in place. Under the national action plan the federal and state governments would contribute 40 per cent each and the local farmers the remaining 20 per cent. Even though that was still going to cost the farmers a lot of money without any real economic benefit to them, it was something that they were prepared to do. They understood that they had to do something about the problems of the area that they were irrigating. In the lower Murray region we have a group of farmers and the local irrigation action group who have recognised that changes must be made to ensure more efficient water usage and, in turn, to ensure a healthier Murray. There is no disputing that fact. What we also have is a group of farmers who are feeling pushed into a corner by the state environment minister, John Hill, who is trying to railroad them into doing the necessary work with inadequate supportboth financial and logistical-from the state government. The simple basis of what the state government has done to change the plan between the federal government, the state government and the local farmers is cost shift $10 million from the state government onto the local farmers, which they simply cannot afford. Instead of the local farmers-about 200 peopleproviding about $8 million, which was still a large sum of money, they are now being told that MAIN COMMITTEE they have to supply $18 million, enabling the state government to make a saving of $10 million. Unfortunately, I do not think the state Labor minister, John Hill, actually understands what his department is putting to him. I really do not think he understands what is happening. The federal government has implemented a national action plan as a result of the Prime Minister’s initiative to provide $1.4 billion over seven years. That is to be done nationally across 21 priority regions-the lower Murray region, which I am talking about, is one-to motivate and enable regional communities to prevent, stabilise and reverse trends in salinity, particularly dry land salinity, and to improve water quality. Under that national action plan, the federal government is encouraging local communities to get together with their regional planning groups and assist the needs of their regions and then make submissions to both the state and federal governments for assistance with funding of these projects. Up until now, this has worked well; we have seen community driven projects improving the situation right through the Murray-Darling Basin. For example, the Loxton Irrigation Scheme has worked very well under the system of 40 per cent federal, 40 per cent state, 20 per cent local farmers. It has worked well up until now, until this situation with the lower Murray irrigators. Frankly, it is appalling. Instead of the state government assessing the submission by the community and discussing funding options in conjunction with the community, we have an environment minister writing letters dictating to the farming community exactly what will be done and telling them how much they will pay for it, without negotiating with the community at all. This is not what the national action plan is about. The national action plan is about the community telling governments what they need, not governments telling communities and farmers what they have to do. This is appalling. When the process is followed correctly, the system works really well; but it is certainly not in this situation. As I said, the lower Murray irrigators have already stated that they are prepared to implement changes, but the state government is not playing its part. The government takes the issue of the Murray-Darling basin very seriously, just as the Murray-Darling Basin Commission takes it seriously. I would like to think, despite what I am seeing at the South Australian state government level, that the state government takes this issue very seriously as well. The Murray-Darling Basin and the rivers within it are vital to the surrounding areas: they provide wealth and they provide a way of adding value to the local communities. Further, the environmental ecosystems of the rivers are home to communities that rely on them for their survival and they are greatly affected by any decisions made in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin. The amendments we are discussing today are not exempt from this. It is very important that the health of the rivers in the Murray-Darling Basin is considered, for the survival of these ecosystems and communities. As I have previously stated, in my seat of Barker there are many towns and businesses that rely on the health of the river for tourism and various farming related activities. That does not even take into consideration the state, which relies heavily upon the Murray for its drinking water. Were the Murray to get much worse, these businesses and local communities would suffer. For example, in my electorate I have one of the most celebrated and awarded-at both a state and national level-houseboat operators: Unforgettable Houseboats. Unforgettable Houseboats, based at Mannum, has the best boats on the river-in fact, I had the pleasure of staying on one last week. It is part of a growing fleet of luxury houseboats that MAIN COMMITTEE cruise the Murray River, from Goolwa to the Victorian border, and I take this opportunity to officially congratulate the managing director, Mike Coory, and his team on their amazing success. However, the fact is that the river may not be so kind to this business as the tourists and the tourism awards are. Just last year they had a problem with a customer who putted along the river, as you do in a houseboat, up to Swan Reach and they were told they could go no further. From my personal experience, I can tell you that I have been to every part of the Murray River that you can on a houseboat-in fact, I have been up the Darling a few times as well-and they do have a problem. I totally support the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002 because it helps in some way to ensure that we protect the Murray-Darling Basin. I commend the bill to the House. Bill 2002 amends the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1993 to give effect to an agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria on new arrangements for sharing water made available to the River Murray catchment. It gives effect to the Murray-Darling Basin Amending Agreement, which was agreed by the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council in October 2001 and signed by the Prime Minister and premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in June 2002. What that agreement does is remove references to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority in the associated Snowy Mountains Agreement. It requires the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to determine the respective allocations to New South Wales and Victoria for increased water flows, according to an environmental strategy developed by the commission. It protects Victoria’s and South Australia’s rights to water from the River Murray if New South Wales fails to ensure the release of environmental entitlements to the Snowy River or the annual release from the Snowy River to the River Murray. It enables the transfer of water savings and purchases to environmental entitlements for the Snowy River and River Murray and it establishes additional water accounting, notification, consultation and modelling mechanisms that will be the responsibility of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. That amending agreement has been the subject of extensive consultation and agreement. It has high-level support from the New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian governments, and federal Labor supports it. I want to make some remarks following on from the comments that the member for Barker made; unfortunately he is not here to hear my response. The truth is that in the year 2003, the International Year of Freshwater, we are experiencing one of the most severe droughts on record and many of Australia’s river systems, and this river system in particular, are in poor and declining health. We need to use the year 2003-this International Year of Freshwater-to devote much more attention to the health of our river systems. I said at the start of the year that it needed to be a key new year’s resolution for the Howard government and for us all to secure more water for the Murray-Darling Basin. The Murray River is presently on life support. Its mouth is being kept open by continuous dredging. It would not be open if it were not for that dredging. Scientists have been telling us that, if we do not take action now, within 20 years Adelaide’s water will be undrinkable for two days out of five. They tell us that the rivers of the Murray-Darling Basin have a moderate chance of survival if we can deliver an additional 1,500 gigalitres of water to them and even less chance if we do not. What the federal government needs to do, in consultation and partnership with MAIN COMMITTEE",143,Murray Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002
309,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (10.24 A.m.),"The Murray-Darling Basin Amendmentthe states, is deliver a long-term plan which will support the provision of 1,500 gigalitres of extra water for the Murray-Darling Basin over the course of the next 10 years. We need to act to secure and restore the health of our river systems by guaranteeing water flows to ensure basic river health, providing flexibility of water allocation that recognises that natural flows vary seasonally and over time, and clarifying water property rights and the responsibilities which go with those rights. Governments can find solutions, and the bill before the House demonstrates that very clearly. The once mighty Snowy River had become a trickle. Together, the New South Wales and Victorian governments have started putting water back into the Snowy to ensure that it will flow again. In the International Year of Freshwater, we need a national water policy. Our task is to find water for our farmers and irrigators, environmental flows for our stressed rivers and sustainable supplies for our cities and urban industries. Last year’s National Land and Water Resources Audit found that 84 of Australia’s surface water management areas were either close to being overused or overused compared with their sustainable flow regimes. Many river basins in New South Wales have a greater than 100 per cent water diversion as a percentage of a sustainable flow regime. There are too many nutrients in 43 river basins, water is excessively turbid in parts of 41 basins and water is too saline in 24 basins. Many of Victoria’s basins have all three problems. The Year of the Outback-last year-was a disaster for the outback. We need to make sure that this year, the International Year of Freshwater, is a year of progress for our stressed river systems. Frequently, we get comments-almost asides-from the Prime Minister saying that he is very concerned about salinity, that he is very concerned about water quality and that he is very concerned about the state of the Murray-Darling Basin. In fact, I was astonished the week before last when Simon Crean and I visited the mouth of the Murray River. We discovered it to be in a very poor state indeed. It was only about a foot deep and about a cricket pitch wide; it was in an appalling state. We released a policy there which indicated that a Labor government would provide some 450 gigalitres of additional water for the Murray River during the first term of a federal Labor government. The Australian saw fit to print not a word of this. The Australian, which has been running a campaign about the Murray-Darling Basin, claims to be concerned about these issues. It saw fit to run not a word about what a national Labor government would provide to save the Murray River over the course of the next three years. But, a day or two later, the Australian’s rural writer, Asa Walquist, reported: John Howard has promised to focus on salinity, water rights and land clearing in a bid to make the environment a key part of the government’s third-term policy agenda. He wrote: ... the Prime Minister said “we need to get more money flowing” to tackle salinity, some kind of national understanding on water rights” and “more progress on tree clearing”. “They are the three things that I have really set as objectives this year ...” Rhetoric, words-there is no action to back it up. It was completely unsubstantiated, yet the Australian saw fit to run this as if it were some major new development. Indeed, this was followed up in the budget just a couple of days ago with the Prime Minister announcing that there would be no new money for the Murray-Darling Basin, no money to address land clearing and no new money to address salinity. Indeed, on the salinity front, we learnt that the govMAIN COMMITTEE ernment had failed to spend some $38 million-money which it had promised in the budget last year it would spend-and it had cut a further $25 million from the forward estimates for this year’s National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality. So at a time when the government is reducing its commitment to salinity, reducing its commitment to tackling water quality and reducing its commitment to save the Murray River, the Australian sees fit to report that this is a key part of the government’s policy agenda for the third term. It is not merely the comments made in the Australian recently by the Prime Minister that show him to be a man of rhetoric rather than of action. If we go back to November 2002, he told CEDA: There are few issues more important to our nation than water reform. In a press release on 1 November 2001, the Prime Minister said: When I spoke at the Press Club in August, I nominated water quality as one of the great challenges that Australian Governments must face up to. At the Press Club on 1 August 2001, he said: In a dry continent like our own ... there is no more pressing issue than tackling water quality and salinity issues. Governments must come to grips with issues such as river health and efficiency of river irrigation system. On 10 October 2000, he said: I think we all want to recognise that this is a long-term national challenge. If you’re really talking about leaving a better Australia for our children you do have to do something about the salinity problem. If we go back to the 1998 Liberal Party environmental election platform, it was stated: The Coalition has set itself the goal of reversing the decline of native vegetation by mid-2001. That has not happened. If we look at the state of the environment report, it is clear that land clearing continues apace. Similarly, back in 1996, they said: We will work to achieve the long term objective of ensuring that, for the first time since european settlement, the rate of vegetation establishment will exceed the rate of vegetation clearance. Again, there has been no progress towards that commitment. As a result: more salinity, reduced river quality and threats and damage to our biodiversity. Regrettably, despite the fact that the Prime Minister has claimed that water is a third-term priority agenda, there is no new initiative to save the Murray River, and we have seen that the government’s flagship program, the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality, has been substantially cut. Indeed, after seven years of a Howard government there has been little progress on the whole of the COAG water reform agenda. Back in 1994 the federal Labor government established, through COAG, a process of water reform which it said would have, amongst other things, the objective of providing environmental flows and restoring the health of our river system. In fact, what has happened since then is that we have been going around in circles and we have water quality continuing to deteriorate. There are problems with algal blooms, fish species are dying and being reduced in number and there are problems for the river red gums. Some very serious data is emerging which is suggesting that along the Murray many of the river red gums are dying and will die over the course of the next few years. MAIN COMMITTEE Yet the budget this year shows no new funding for these priorities and, indeed, over the course of the six-year period, it shows a cut of $287 million to the Prime Minister’s original commitment to the national action plan. Little wonder that the National Farmers Federation said, in its response to the budget, that the government’s response to salinity has been totally inadequate. On budget night, the head of the National Farmers Federation, Peter Corish, said: It is now 2½ years since the Federal and State government committed $1.4 billion to the NAP and the rate at which money is being spent on the ground is unacceptably low. It is time for the Prime Minister to take personal control of this excellent initiative to ensure that the funds get where they are needed as a matter of urgency. Those views were shared by Don Henry from the Australian Conservation Foundation, who said: The Prime Minister had promised that salinity, tree clearing and water were priorities for the next 12 months, but this budget contains no additional commitments. Instead, we are seeing cuts and little progress in these critical areas. The National Farmers Federation is right; if the Prime Minister is serious about salinity, he needs to take personal responsibility for the national action plan and take those ministers who are presently responsible, David Kemp and Warren Truss, off the case because they have failed. They should be taken off the field for their inability to deliver environmental spending and their inability to deliver the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. As I said before, the science on these issues is clear. The Wentworth Group tells us that the Murray needs an extra 450 gigalitres of water in environmental flows to keep the mouth open. It further needs an additional 1,500 gigalitres to give it a moderate chance of restoration to a healthy river system. Federal Labor has committed to action in restoring 450 gigalitres of environmental flows within its first term to keep the Murray mouth open and delivering 1,500 gigalitres in environmental flows over the course of 10 years to restore the health of the river system. This government is moving in slow motion to protect the Murray-Darling Basin. It has a political strategy for dealing with this problem but not a genuine strategy for dealing with it. The political strategy is to say, ‘Yes, the Murray-Darling is in a bad way; the states must fix it.’ We heard the member for Barker speaking before me on exactly the same theme-blame the states. Here we have a failure of national leadership, and simply a political strategy for addressing the problem, not a genuine strategy for restoring the health of the Murray River. The COAG water reform process was started by Labor in 1994. It has languished; it has gone around in circles. We have seen this in subsequent meetings of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, at a time when the State of the Environment Report tells us that increasing pressures to extract surface and ground water for human use are leading to the continuing deterioration of the health of inland waters; that the amount of water extracted for irrigation from 1985 to 1997 increased by 76 per cent; that the increase in salinity in the Murray-Darling Basin is causing water quality decline and land degradation; and that, of 12,000 gigalitres flowing into the Murray-Darling system in the average year, 10,000 gigalitres are used for irrigation and not returned, which has seen a dramatic change in the ecology of the Murray-Darling Basin. At a time when we know all those things, we still get calls for delay and inaction. MAIN COMMITTEE There was more of this at the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council meeting on Friday. We hear that, when the ministers met in Toowoomba, there were calls for a delay on a final decision. If we go back to March or April last year in Corowa, the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council committed itself to setting a target for environmental flows to restore the health of the Murray River by October this year. We now find that that timetable is being shifted. We have people saying, ‘There’s not enough consultation; we haven’t had enough time to address this problem.’ That is not good enough. People have known about the declining state of the Murray-Darling Basin for years-indeed, for decades. The 1972 cabinet papers were released recently, and I recall that in that year the first Australian environment minister, a Liberal environment minister, brought to the cabinet some papers concerning the health of the Murray River. People were concerned about this 30 years ago, so it is not good enough to now say that we need some more consultation and that we need some more time. Delay will only make matters worse; delay will only cause the problems arising from the decline in the health of the system to get worse. I do not support the calls for delay. I believe we need to get action from the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council. A federal Labor government would be committed to saving the Murray River, our greatest river, by increasing the environmental flows-not only by restoring 450 gigalitres within our first term, not only by delivering 1,500 gigalitres within 10 years to restore the health of the river, but also by taking action to prevent the climate change that reduces the amount of water that flows into the system in the first place. We would ratify the Kyoto protocol as the first step to an effective global response to climate change. We really do have a serious situation here. The Murray River is becoming choked with exotic species and algal blooms, native fish are dying, the magnificent river red gums on our floodplains are dying of thirst because no floodwaters nourish them and dryland salinity now threatens to affect around six million hectares of the Murray-Darling Basin by 2050. We are simply taking too much water out of the Murray, and the only way it can survive is for us to put more water back in. That is what Labor will do as a priority. We will deliver these things in the first term of a Crean Labor government. There is no doubt that this is a substantial challenge, there is no doubt that this is not easy for those irrigators and farmers who have been the principal users of this water, but I believe we can achieve that target of 1,500 gigalitres over the course of 10 years. You need to understand that that involves putting back about 20 per cent of what we take out now. Over a 10year period, that represents a two per cent change each year. So, viewed as a productivity target, I believe it is achievable without impacting on our agricultural productivity. Indeed, if we fail to act, that will impact on our agricultural productivity. I believe it can be done over the course of the next 10 years. It is an ambitious target and it requires national leadership, but Labor is prepared to provide that leadership. The government is going around in circles, unwilling to make any of the hard decisions. It has put this decision on the backburner, as it has put on the backburner so many decisions needed to protect our environment, allowing some of us to live in a fool’s paradise thinking that we can go on trashing the river system in the way that we have been over the course of the past 15 years. If we do not recognise that, it will have very serious consequences-for South Australia in particular. MAIN COMMITTEE I hope that the member for Barker and other government members from South Australia put more pressure on the Howard government to show national leadership and to take the action needed to protect the Murray River by doing the sorts of things that were done to protect the Snowy River and by doing some of those hard yards covered by the New South Wales and Victorian governments that are set out in the legislation before us. I hope those South Australian Liberal members put some genuine pressure on the Howard government; otherwise we will find that the Murray River will continue to decline. Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002. This bill comes in the context of a series of questions we raised about a national water strategy and the challenges facing all of those Australians involved in the consumption and use of water, whether it is for industrial, agricultural or domestic use. Let me start by giving an overview. When you look at Australia’s annual consumption of water, approximately 70 per cent of that water is consumed in the rural areas of Australia. So, of the 100 per cent of water which is consumed for human related purposes, 70 per cent is in the rural area. This bill deals with rural and agricultural uses of the water which comes from tributaries to the heart of Australia’s water management system: the Murray-Darling Basin. In addition to addressing the use of the 70 per cent of water, we also have to address the 30 per cent of urban water, and I want to turn my mind briefly to that before considering the ramifications of the bill. Thirty per cent of Australia’s water is consumed in the urban environment-a combination of commercial, parkland and domestic-and we find that there have been very poor developments in terms of understanding and managing that water. I have a clear belief that Australia needs-and I have argued this repeatedly-a national water policy. It needs a national water policy because the states have largely failed to carry out their responsibilities. It is not about transferring power to the Commonwealth but about the Commonwealth establishing a framework which would bind the states together and bring them to work to a common purpose. A central element of that national water policy concerns the fact that annually we consume over three trillion litres of water through the ocean outfall process. In my own electorate of Flinders, the Gunnamatta outfall at Boags Rocks distributes each day 420 million litres of secondary treated sewage, less than 100 metres off the beach-153 billion litres of water each year. There are three consequences of that. Firstly, there is a local environmental catastrophe; secondly, there are health risks; thirdly, there is a plain economic waste that goes on here. In a country that is short of water, we are taking one of these critical resources, failing to treat it properly and throwing it away. We are literally letting it run out to sea. I believe we need a national water policy, and I believe that a critical element in that national water policy is a national ocean outfall strategy. The essence of the national ocean outfall strategy is to work towards the cessation of ocean outfall as an acceptable practice across Australia’s 142 ocean outfalls by the year 2025. What we are discussing here is a generational objective of ending ocean outfall and using that water constructively-and to achieve that by the year 2025 across Australia. There are already a great number of groups that are working towards that objective. I think it is a fine objective, and it is one to which I am committed. It has to be considered in three stages, because in order to achieve this we have to make progress on consumption, on treatment and on reuse. Firstly, in terms of consumption, we have to achieve a situation where domestic consumption drops dramatically. If you think of MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Murray Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002
310,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (10.44 A.m.),"I am delighted to rise to speak in support of thethe uses of domestic water, effectively there are four in any household: gardening, showering, toilets, and washing for laundry and dishes. Approximately 50 per cent of that water can be saved by using recycled water for gardening and for toilets. Those are areas where you do not need water of absolute rainwater quality. By using and recycling our water for those purposes in the domestic sphere, we would be able to reduce consumption by 50 per cent. So that is the first thing: we should be working towards far more sustainable domestic environments. That must be linked, of course, with the industrial. The second stage is in treatment. The eastern treatment plant in Melbourne, which is at Carrum Downs, produces the vast bulk of the water that flows out of the pipe at Boags Rocks, Gunnamatta Beach. Of the 420 million litres of water which flow out there, approximately 370 to 380 million litres daily come from the eastern treatment plant. It produces about 42 per cent of Melbourne’s waste water. So here is an opportunity for a treatment plant to work to high standards. There are proposals for its upgrade, and that is a good thing. Yet what we see is a very narrow and shallow approach, because, despite the opportunity here, they are only working in increments of three years-not 10 or 20 years or a generation. As a consequence, the potential for upgrading the water is great and the reality is low. To a large extent, our local farmers have said no to possibilities for reusing water, because the quality of water coming out of the eastern treatment plant does not even meet the level necessary for the use of recycled water in market gardens and farms. The second stage concerns the upgrade of the treatment plant at Carrum Downs and plants throughout Australia, but it is a long-term strategic investment. The third stage is to encourage reuse. If you achieve the water quality levels then you can reuse water for significant industrial and agricultural purposes. Taken together, these comprise the elements of a national ocean outfall policy and the urban component of a national water policy. The second element of a national water policy relates to rural use, and this bill addresses rural use. Essentially, the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002 is about the Commonwealth and state governments working together in cooperative partnerships that further prosperity for the Murray-Darling’s people and environment, and redress some of the environmental damage which has occurred through human use over the last 150 years. It follows the Commonwealth’s allocation of $75 million to allow for annual water savings of up to 70 gigalitres. It also helps to move this water and allows for greater protection of the lower Murray area. In essence, the bill provides for the environment, protects local communities and industries, and legislates to encourage outcomes which will help people along the full flow of riparian use. I want to discuss the importance of the bill and then its provisions. The essence of this bill is that environmental flows will be increased in the Murray region. The bill legislates for this in such a way that more water will reach downstream users. In particular, this is important for communities and users within South Australia and important for the health of the river. It has both a productive economic outcome and a positive environmental outcome. The bill implements the Snowy Water Inquiry Outcomes Implementation Deed, signed on 3 June 2002 by the New South Wales, Victorian and Commonwealth governments, which is an example of cooperative environmental management between the Commonwealth and the states. The Snowy Mountains scheme has diverted nearly all the water from the Snowy River above the confluence with the Mowamba River. This bill restores a significant amount of the natural MAIN COMMITTEE flow to the Snowy Mountains rivers. Once fully implemented, it is expected that the bill will increase the flow of the Snowy River to 21 per cent of its annual natural flow. A further stage of implementation will occur on the 10th anniversary of the implementation of the agreement, which will restore up to 28 per cent of the natural annual flows. So here is an example of decade-long, generational thinking. In addition, the amendments will work towards achieving the environmental objectives of the heads of government agreement. A series of effects will flow so that the four particular goals will be implemented. Firstly, it will help to improve the river water temperatures for natural species by increasing the flow, which, in turn, should allow for a slight decrease in the water temperature. Secondly, there is the objective of better channel maintenance and sediment removal. Again, if you remove sediment, a greater flow allows for greater fish life development. Thirdly, there are improved dispersion opportunities for species that need to travel up and down the river. In essence, with a greater flow of water, the capacity for those species which are in some way migratory to live, to move, to breathe-to carry out all of those elements which are necessary for them to thrive-is present in greater measure. Finally, it has a very simple effect: it enhances the natural beauty of both the river and the surrounding regions by providing more water, which has an impact not only on the greenery but also on water levels. So the bill is important in all of those simple objectives. I want to finish by examining briefly the core provisions of the bill. The amended clause 132 of the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement Bill provides that the allocation of water from the Snowy scheme will be determined by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. So it gives power to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. In addition, the new schedule G sets out the water provision requirements for Snowy Hydro Ltd. Item 20 sets out the guidelines for the release that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission will be able to make and ensures smooth progress of the changes. Firstly, it states that the ministerial council must formulate a strategy for the implementation of the increased flows; so there is a process of recognising the rights of the different users and the timings for the environmental flows. Secondly, it provides that the strategy must promote native biodiversity and encourage the health of the river systems themselves. Thirdly, it also works towards a guarantee that environmental benefits will result from the strategy. This bill works towards that end by committing significant resources to the sustainability of the Murray-Darling’s future. Ultimately, the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill is one part of the approach to dealing with Australia’s water resources. I have argued that, in dealing with the 70 per cent of water which exists within the rural sphere and is consumed for rural purposes, it plays an important role. But at a national level, in order to bring together the common interests and needs of people across all of the states, we need to work towards a national water policy-a water policy where the Commonwealth helps coordinate a framework. I think the states have failed to act as users with a common set of interests and have succumbed to the problem of the prisoner’s dilemma where, in pursuing their own interests, they damage the common interest of all. As a consequence of that, the Commonwealth needs to play that role so that we have a national water policy which deals with the rural needs and a national ocean outfall strategy which deals with the urban needs. MAIN COMMITTEE I think this bill is an important step forward. There is still much to be done. I commend the bill to the House and I am delighted to support the amendments in the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill. speaking to the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002, it is one bill that I hope I do not run dry on. I am a bit bemused and a bit concerned: in listening to the speech of the member for Flinders, I was told that more water would be flowing into the Murray as a result of this agreement. I thought, ‘I don’t really think that’s what’s going to happen.’ Later in the speech we were told that more water would be flowing into the Snowy rather than the Murray. The central problem with the Murray is that it has had water from the Snowy diverted to it over more than 35 years so that we could run the Snowy hydro scheme. The extra water that has been available in the Murray-Darling Basin has been taken from or stolen from the Snowy. So even though there is a release factor, there will not be a great increase of water into the Murray. In fact, it has now been agreed that 21 per cent of natural flow should be achieved in the Snowy. That is what this bill is attesting to. Over time, there have been very different approaches taken to this matter. Historically, in the greatest engineering project Australia has ever undertaken, it was determined to divert the full flow of the Murray and to use that water for two purposes, one being to provide electricity through hydro-electricity. As Deputy Speaker Adams would know, only Tasmania equals the Snowy project with respect to not only reliance upon water but also efficient use of water in producing electricity. Across the Tasman, New Zealand is a great example of being heavily dependent on hydro-electricity. For the last two years it has been subject to severe drought and it now has significant problems in providing enough electricity to its people. New Zealand has adopted a range of measures to try to save water so that it can engender that. It is a bit puzzling and a bit bemusing for the member for Flinders to argue that the Murray is going to be better off in terms of flow, when water that would have gone to the Murray is in fact going to be redirected back to the Snowy. When the initial investigations in regard to this were undertaken, the proposal of Robert Webster-the former National Party minister in New South Wales who headed up the group that looked into natural flows in the Snowy-was that 15 per cent of original flow should be provided, at a cost of about $195 million. Of course, there were other pressures at play in the New South Wales and the Victorian governmentsparticularly the Victorian government, because of the nature of the election and the fact that there was an Independent strongly pushing for 28 per cent of flow. As in all good politics, we ended up with a compromise. This bill will put about 21 per cent of flow back into the Snowy. That will have a series of effects for the Snowy itself. It will not ever get back to 100 per cent of flow, but that 21 per cent of natural flow will have an effect on all of the species that are in the Murray. Again, I cannot really work this out, but the member for Flinders indicated that it would have an effect on the ‘nature’ species. I cannot work out whether it would have an effect on the unnatural species-I do not think there are any there-and I would expect and hope that all of those species in the Snowy were natural. Some are native to the area, and others are not. But I think what he was driving at was that, if you look at the manner in which the micro-organisms are available to fish life and to other life within that stream, the changeover time has meant that there has been a decrease in micro-organisms within the Snowy and that the natural fish life that had predated on them had not been able to do as well as it otherwise MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Murray Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002
311,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (10.58 A.m.),"I was just saying to the deputy whip that, inmight. Returning the river to 21 per cent of natural flow will have a series of effects. Those effects will be to increase the diversity of the micro-organisms that are available to be predated upon and therefore will help our native fish species, and that can be assisted in terms of how that 21 per cent is released. I want to compliment the CSIRO, and also the scientific bodies from New South Wales and Victoria, on the work that they have done in creating the foundations for water management within the Snowy and the Murray-Darling Basin. That is evident in the quite excellent piece of work that was done as a backgrounder on this by the library and in the work that Bill McCormack did. It is one of the best pieces of work that I have read, and the science involved here is extremely strong. They point out that it is not simply a matter of reintroducing water into the Snowy and pumping it out on a regular basis. One might expect that that is what they would be up for. However, what they have taken into account is the fact that, if you actually were to do that and simply have a regular amount of water going back into the river day after day, week after week, there would be an advantage to introduced fish species rather than native fish species. What is proposed here, in terms of the 21 per cent, is to follow a cyclical approach and to look at what seasonal use of water there has historically been in the Snowy and how that can best be added to. There is an erratic but scientifically based method for pouring water back into the Murray. In the period running through September and October, when there is natural snow melt off the mountains and an increased volume of water running into the Snowy River, water would be released at higher volumes into the river to take account of what happens with the snow melt. Periods of flooding would also be involved. The Snowy, for 35 years or so, has not enjoyed the natural flooding that it used to. Part of this process is to ensure that there is flooding. One of the things that are evident, based on the experience of the Snowy over those 35 years, is that the river itself has dramatically changed. There is a vastly increased amount of sedimentation. If you look at the river bed, you see that its conformation is completely different because of the rise in sedimentation. The flow lines in the river have been changed as well, so the reintroduction of water has to be in conformity with those changes in trying to bring the river to something like what it was in the first instance. There are always winners and losers. The winners in terms of the environmenttake an intervention? his description, whether he has actually been there and seen the sedimentation and the other things he has just described. there, but what I have been able to do is read-as I have just indicated-the background material from the library. It is well written, it is graphic and I imagine that reading it is the second-best thing to being there. I have not seen that sedimentation, but the picture presented is full enough and graphic enough for me to get some idea of it. MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Murray Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002

316,Mr Hatton,"In reply to the member for Wentworth, the answer is no. I have not beenBecause of the changes that have happened over time, trying to put the river back to some semblance of what it was is extremely important. The winners and losers we find here indicate a fundamental part of the problem we have not just with the Snowy but with the Murray-Darling Basin all up. The questions of water rights and how those water rights are allocated are much more complex than the simple question of the river itself having water taken from it to be used in other ways because we as a species have intervened. We have intervened for good purposes, to provide not only electricity but also a greater flow of water for use in the Murray-Darling Basin, which provides an enormous percentage of Australia’s natural product. Taking away water from the Murray-Darling Basin has an effect on existing users, but there is a bigger picture as well. South Australians of both stamps have violently reacted to the idea. Both Liberal and Labor governments have put forward very strong arguments in this process. Five state governments are involved in the Murray-Darling, with two key governments being those of Victoria and New South Wales-because they have the largest use and the largest farming activity associated with use of the water from there-and the South Australians being right at the end of the system. They are utterly dependent on the flow through the Murray-Darling system, and we have already seen significant problems in terms of sedimentation and build-up and the closing of the Murray. It was my happy duty to be part of a task force of our caucus rural and regional development committee-under the leadership of you, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams-which recently spent two days in South Australia. We did not go to the mouth of the Murray, but the Leader of the Opposition went to the mouth of the Murray and saw for himself the problems with sedimentation and closure. He and our shadow minister for the environment, Kelvin Thomson, the member for Wills, have pledged that Labor will save the Murray, that Labor will commit itself to putting back into the Murray-Darling system 450 gigalitres of water to ensure not just environmental flows but environmental flows which are directed towards ensuring the lifeblood of southern South Australia and the lifeblood of South Australia’s productive regions. The complexity of the situation was well addressed in the briefings we had from the CSIRO, covering questions such as land use, water rights and the changes that there have been in water use patterns over time. This is particularly so in the lower reaches of the Murray, where the South Australian wine producers in the Speaker’s electorate of Wakefield have been increasingly effective in being able to use water more sparingly in the whole of the South Australian region and to push, because of the impress of a lack of water, to be a lot more efficient in the way they use that precious resource. It has not meant that there has been a great deal extra available, just that people have used it more efficiently. The great problem we have-this doubled-headed problem, almost of Hydra proportionsin the Murray-Darling system is that, as we move to try to address problems with salinity and to achieve a more efficient use of water, we come up against the question of how to allocate water rights. From a historical perspective: there are areas around Deniliquin about which a long-term study was done by the CSIRO, and the CSIRO found that it would have been delinquent of the government to allow an extension of farming into areas dependent on water from the Murray, because of problems with salinity and with the availability of water over time. In the natural course of things, the CSIRO’s judgments were put aside. The then government went ahead, those areas were opened up and they became dependent upon water from MAIN COMMITTEE the Murray. There was an efflorescence of farming activity, but that has now hit significantly hard times because they are under pressure from a lack of useful and available water. There is a situation in which people have existing rights to water, and that will need to be sorted out, in sorting out the whole question of what happens in the Murray-Darling. There are problems right at the top of the system. At the Condamine, there have been arguments in terms of the rice farmers and the people producing cotton-that their use of water is inefficient, that they are depriving people lower down of the utility of that water and that they need to be constrained in what they do. Again, in a task force visit by our committee led by the deputy speaker, the member for Lyons, we had a look at the problems up there. We also looked at the solutions that have been suggested for the Lockyer Valley and for the Darling Downs. We know the government has been tardy in responding to the people in the Lockyer Valley. They have joined with the Lord Mayor of Brisbane in saying that one-third of the waste water from Brisbane could be used in the Lockyer Valley to grow Australia’s vegetables. That could be used if the Queensland government put in the $200 million that they would have to put in in the short term to build a new treatment facility to have waste water exit into Moreton Bay. That could be used to provide treated waste water to the Lockyer Valley, because they are drought ridden and water deprived. Even with the rights they have, the capacity is not there. The levels of ground water have decreased so much that they are under real pressure. To make the whole system work properly you need, in the initial assumption, about another $400 million to go 600 metres up a cliff face to get up to the plateau of the Darling Downs. We flew over the Downs, visited properties on the Downs and met with the local farmers. We found that in farm after farm where they had put one or two half-a-million-dollar dams on a property there was virtually no water at all. They have massive problems with existing and available ground water. With those farmers on the Darling Downs who are willing to put their money in with the money that the state government has pledged and that the local council would put up-and the Commonwealth, if it comes to the party-you could have the Darling Downs area revivified. The more efficient use of waste water, which would be useful not only here but Australia-wide, would mean that water could be saved, put back into the Darling at its very top and then flow down to the Murray. The one significant and great problem with that is that as you get into the lower reaches of the Darling, before you get to the Murray, the water spreads-there is a plain where a lot of it is soaked up. The CSIRO have a question about increasing flows into the Condamine and the Darling and whether the water flow would get to the Murray at all and therefore whether it would be useful there and useful in South Australia. The farmers in the Darling Downs, those on farms running down the Darling and the farmers who are dependent upon the Murray, the Murray-Darling systems and the Murrumbidgee for their livelihoods will be affected by how they use water and by the changed nature of use that is evident in this bill. This is the start of the process, not the finish of it. The major problems that we face need to be addressed. Everyone in Commonwealth government knows how difficult it is to get the state governments to agree on major problems. Everyone with experience would know how difficult it is to get state governments to agree on transport matters and road building, for instance. There is always a question of the desire of governments to cost shift and to argue that one level of government should be doing it rather than others. MAIN COMMITTEE When dealing with the questions of water rights, the effect of salinity and how to best use the available waters-in terms of not only providing environmental flows but the chief uses we have as a species to ensure the livelihood of our people and of our industries that are dependent upon water-you cannot walk away from the fact that we do not solve the problems purely by increasing the efficiency of our water use. One of the difficulties is that if you increase the efficiency with which you use water, and you do not then cap that use, you do not return any more water to the system. In fact, it has been proven by the farmers and by CSIRO that increased levels of efficiency, with no mechanism to say you cannot take more water out, can lead to a much more significant problem. Efficiency levels are now up to 65 to 80 per cent, so you have flows of 40 per cent or so going back down into the ground water and then finding their way back into the Murray. If you only get more efficient use of water and allow it all to be used, you will not be getting that 40 per cent flowing back down through the ground water and eventually back into the Murray system. This bill is the end of a long process in terms of providing 21 per cent of environmental flows to the Snowy, but it is also an indicator of just how far we have to go to deal with the problems of the whole Murray-Darling Basin. The basis of that has to be cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth, but the really hard questions need to be dealt with-not only questions of availability and efficiency but also questions such as the ownership of water and water rights. Wales National Party minister who was appointed as commissioner of the Snowy water inquiry, in his final report of 23 October 1998 into the question of the Snowy corporatisation legislation that had been proposed in 1993 and the impact of that upon the Snowy River system and the Murray-Darling Basin system, submitted five significant points. They were: significant environmental gain for the river systems must be achieved; significant reduction in water wastage in irrigation areas must be addressed; the cost impact on agriculture must be minimal because of its significant economic contribution to the community, apart from the economic cost to the potential growth of industry; the impact on the hydroelectricity generator must be manageable; and the capital cost for the government must be reasonable in terms of returned benefits to the environment and the community. As indicated by the member for Blaxland, a number of options were examined in that report. The commissioner adopted the view, finally, that the stream flow into the Snowy River should, if his report were to be adopted, be a 15 per cent increase in its average flow, at an estimated cost of $194 million. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be aware-as other honourable members will be aware-that the relevant average natural flow for the new Snowy River proposals has been a matter of great contention. I seem to recall that Mr Craig Ingram, the member for Gippsland East in the Victorian parliament, won his seat on a campaign based on a 28 per cent flow. Others have suggested different proposals. The member for Wills, in his address a little bit earlier today, suggested a figure which, if I recall it correctly, was 1,500 gigalitres, an increase over 10 years involving something like a two per cent change in the parameters for the Murray system itself. He says that that will give rise to difficulties for farmers in adjusting to those changes. Without doubt that is the case. I think the proposals that he has made are too dramatic. He says that it can be done through national leadership, which the government has not been showing on this issue. He says that, otherwise, we will be trashing the inland river system. I MAIN COMMITTEE",156,Murray Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002
317,Mr King (Wentworth) (11.18 A.m.),"The Hon. Robert Webster, the former New Southsuggest that, if the proposal put forward by the member for Wills were adopted, we would be trashing the livelihood of many of those who depend upon water as the basis for their agriculture and prosperity. But I do not want to dwell too much on the final outcomes as proposed in this legislation, because I want to suggest that they are correct, that they are an important advance in improving the environmental profile of inland Australia with respect to water and that water reform issues are being addressed in a way that this legislation does very well. I want to take a slightly different tack because, unlike the member for Farrer’s, my electorate does not immediately adjoin the Murray-Darling. My interest in this matter goes back to the time that I was chair of the Australian Heritage Commission and conducted a number of reports into the natural heritage issues arising out of the flow of the Murray-Darling Basin system-not only in the Murray itself but also in the Darling. It is interesting to note that almost halfway across the continent, where the Darling River itself commences its flow, there is an extraordinary water catchment system, which-whilst it does not necessarily mirror that of the Snowy Mountains, because of the volume that comes through from the Snowy-is an example of the last remaining natural catchment system in the Murray-Darling Basin. It suggests that, if nature were allowed to take its own course in relation to our river systems in Australia, there would be good outcomes not only for the environment but also for those who take their livelihood from the land. Let me remind members of the House of the words of Henry Lawson, the famous Australian poet, who wrote about the Paroo River in a wonderful poem, as follows: It was a week from Christmas-time, As near as I remember, And half a year since, in the rear, We’d left the Darling Timber. The track was hot and more than drear; The day dragged out for ever; But now we knew that we were near Our Camp-the Paroo River. He goes on to speak about how they walked up and tried to find the Paroo River: With blighted eyes and blistered feet, With stomachs out of order, Half-mad with flies and dust and heat We’d crossed the Queensland Border. The great thing about this wonderful poem-written by one of our famous Australian poets, who is buried in my electorate-is that he was suggesting that the Paroo River system was in some ways the dead heart of Australia, in that nothing ever happened there and that no water would ever flow into the Murray-Darling system from there. But in fact he was wrong. Shortly afterwards in the Bulletin, in a very controversial poem written by his rival Banjo Paterson, this came out. I want to emphasise this, because I want to bring us back to the topic which I think inspired the report of the Hon. Robert Webster that I began my address with and which I think is at the heart of the government’s reform program in relation to water issues in MAIN COMMITTEE this country and which is therefore to be commended. This is what Banjo Paterson had to say about one aspect-the unreal aspect, if I can put it that way-of the Lawson poem, part of which I just read. He said: And no doubt you’re better suited drinking lemon-squash in town. Yet, perchance, if you should journey down the very track you went In a month or two at furthest you would wonder what it meant, Where the sunbaked earth was gasping like a creature in its pain You would find the grasses waving like a field of summer grain, And the miles of thirsty gutters blocked with sand and choked with mud, You would find them mighty rivers with a turbid, sweeping floodand so on. For those who have not had the privilege of seeing the Paroo River system, which is the last natural, untouched water catchment system flowing into the Murray-Darling Basin system, it is a wonderful place to visit. Do not take it from me: take it from Lawson, take it from Paterson and go and look for yourself. It is a fantastic and an inspirational place for any Australian, no matter where you come from and no matter where you were born. That has to be contrasted with what has happened in this respect in the Snowy Mountains. This legislation seeks to undo or to tweak the effect of the Snowy Mountains scheme, which has had such a long-running impact upon the flows of the Murray River and, indeed, upon the Snowy itself. As I said, it has become a critical electoral issue. People have lost seats in the state parliament of Victoria on this very question. I do not know if anybody in the federal parliament has been affected in that way. The federal government, showing leadershipas it has done on so many environmental issues, contrary to the suggestions of the member for Wills-has taken up the challenge of doing something about the Snowy River, of putting life back into that important river system, which, before these reforms take place, has only one per cent of its previous flow, and repairing the environmental damage resulting from the Snowy scheme. I am not suggesting that the Snowy scheme was in error in some way or another; I am suggesting that now, in the 21st century, we really do need to address the environmental impact of that extraordinary scheme. And we need to take a lesson from it when we do try to address the major water issues facing this country. People like Mr Pratt of Melbourne, Mr Alan Jones of Sydney and others understand that one of the biggest issues facing this country is water reform. I am pleased to say that this legislation puts 21 per cent of the flow back into the Snowy system. It does have a negative impact-we have to face that-upon aspects of the Murray system and it does affect irrigators, but that means that we ought to be looking at new and creative ways of retrieving the water that is lost through irrigation. Mr Pratt has suggested the use of PVC pipes so that evaporation does not take away a lot of the water as it comes out of the system and flows onto the fields intended to be irrigated in that fashion. In other parts of the world such as Israel, people have adopted a different water reticulation system, with PVC pipes buried about one metre under the ground. Maybe that is something that Australia ought to consider as another way of solving the problem of limited water resources that we and other dry countries such as Israel face. Another suggestion has been the recovery of water by reprocessing it and putting it back in through the system. But that means MAIN COMMITTEE looking at the whole question of fertilisers and whether they are having a negative impact upon water quality. Those are big issues which I will not go into now, but I do flag them because it seems to me that they are very important. Let me conclude by commending the minister on the water reform program that has been adopted through this legislation and by commending the leadership shown by the Commonwealth in working with New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in reaching agreement. It has not been easy. Let me also commend the Commonwealth and others who have cooperated with the Commonwealth on the leadership shown in relation to water salinity, irrigated agriculture and other initiatives contained in the national water reform framework. I commend the legislation to the House. the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002 reflects one of a series of intergovernmental agreements that facilitate the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. The new corporate body will oversee one of the nation’s greatest achievements-the Snowy Mountains scheme. I suggest to the House this morning that this scheme was the result of the vision shown by the then Labor government, led by Ben Chifley; a government that identified a significant opportunity for this nation and acted on it. It was nation-building at its best. It was not only a vision about a major infrastructure project; it was also a decision that helped to dramatically change the face of Australia in terms of the multicultural make-up of Australia. This project, more than any other project, brought to Australia a range of people from different countries-Yugoslavs, Finns, Italians, Greeks and so on. They made a longlasting contribution not only to the success of the Snowy Mountains scheme; they went out from this scheme with their skills and contributed to infrastructure development on a broader scale around the states and territories of Australia. I compliment the then Labor government of Ben Chifleyway? Snowy scheme occur when the work force in those areas was unionised or not? tion force was a highly unionised work force. The construction was facilitated by not only a highly skilled and unionised work force but also a management that understood the requirement to work with the unions and the work force rather than embrace a confrontationist approach to industrial relations like that of the Howard government. It is also interesting to note that, in historical terms, the ability of management working with the work force to actually deliver was very much strengthened by a very strong, independent Industrial Relations Commission, not a toothless tiger; a commission that was able to facilitate at a state level more than a national level the capacity to get the parties to sit around a table and work out their differences in a meaningful, constructive way. Even on the industrial relations front, the current minister for workplace relations could learn a lot from studying its industrial relations framework, which included on the employer’s side a number of MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Murray Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002

323,Mr Martin Ferguson,"As the member appreciates, the Snowy Mountains construcpeople who went on to hold very senior positions in management in Australia, such as Mr George Polites and Mr Brian Oakes and, alternatively, others on the union side. It was not about developing union leadership; it was about giving people from overseas a great opportunity to come to a new country and to give them and their families the opportunity of building Australia into the nation it is. Having said that, I compliment the member for Wentworth on his taking up the opportunity reinforced by a change in House procedures yesterday that allows people to engage in such an interchange in the Main Committee. I know that he and I, as members of the Procedures Committee, would encourage other members to take this opportunity for interventions. In that context, may I say that the decision to build the scheme was also about investing in our future and demonstrating leadership-something that the previous speaker, Mr King, spoke of. The Snowy Mountains Scheme continues to be vitally important to our national economy. It continues to provide environmentally friendly energy, using clean, renewable water-which is very much a part of the debate for Australia in the 21st century. It is interesting to note that approximately three per cent of the total power requirements of mainland eastern Australia is regularly provided by the scheme. Because of its capacity to produce much more than it does, it can very quickly, as we all appreciate, overcome any power shortages that may arise. The only inhibitor, unfortunately, to increased production is the all-important issue of the availability of water. After the water is used on a number of occasions to operate the turbines that create the electricity, it is sent down the Murray and Murrumbidgee river valleys for irrigation. As a result of this action, Australia is the winner yet again because production from the Murray-Darling Basin has grown to $7.5 billion per year. But I lament the fact that insufficient volumes of water are being set aside for what I regard as just as important as the economic achievements: our need to maintain the environmental flow of these all-important rivers. The end result is that forests are dying, habitats are being destroyed, salinity is increasing, and the Murray-Darling mouth would be closed without dredging. The truth is that the Murray-Darling mouth at the moment is only about as wide as the length of a cricket pitch. We as a community have got a lot to answer for. It is for that reason that we now require a bit of leadership to help us repair the damage that we have done to this great nation. This great country has gone backwards in terms of its environmental quality because of man-inflicted damage. It is therefore important for us to intervene. It is not a decision that we can put off; it is a decision that we have to confront across the political barriers as a matter of urgency. We have to intervene as a parliament at the national level and take the states with us. I think it is also fair to say that some criticism ought to be offered to some of our state governments with respect to their inability or unwillingness-as is the case on some occasions with the New South Wales government, irrespective of who is in government-to front up to the debate about the water system. All too often we say that we love trees-that is an easy decision-rather than front up to the real, hard issues, such as the water flows and the impact they have on our river systems in Australia. I simply say that, yes, we have had the tree debate and there will be some ongoing skirmishes on that front. We have come a long way, but let us front up to the real priority at the moment. The real priority in Australia is the debate about water and salinity. The Australian Conservation Foundation, for example, acknowledges that that is the main priority, as does any perMAIN COMMITTEE son who understands the nature of the environmental debate in the 21st century. Unless we acknowledge that, we will be the losers not only on the environmental front but also on the economic front. The Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002 correctly reflects agreement between the relevant states and the Commonwealth, and that agreement is about facilitating the successful corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. I therefore commend the bill to the House. However, I am also going to raise very serious questions about the tardiness of the current government with respect to this challenge. This bill represents the government’s belated attempt to recognise the crisis facing the Murray-Darling river system. That cannot pass without comment. The system is in crisis; the system is dying. As usual, the government have refused to recognise the issue, even when it reached crisis point. The usual course adopted by the government has been to establish a review, fund a feasibility study-that reminds me of the inland railway-have another feasibility study, and tell everyone who will listen that they are doing everything they can about finding the solution. That is just like the announcement-I suppose it is best described as the reannouncement-in recent days of funding for a feasibility study of the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline. Rather than accepting that the Commonwealth should meet the Victorian government in making a contribution-the Victorian government has put its money up-what do we get from the Commonwealth? Yet another media release this week reannouncing a feasibility study that has been announced on a number of occasions in media releases previously. No wonder the Australian electors get sick and tired of politicians playing games and reannouncing decisions that they have made on a number of occasions. I suppose in some ways that reminds me of the transport portfolio budget announcements of this week. They were already in answers to the questions that I had placed on notice over a range of months to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. There were no new announcements, just an ongoing commitment of money that was already dedicated to the upgrade of our road system in Australia. This is the modus operandi that the Howard government have refined and refined well. Instead of initiating policy for the betterment of the nation, they initiate policy for the political gains that they want to pursue. We all accept that this bill is the response the government have initiated for the crisis in the Murray-Darling system after many years of ignoring the impending disaster. They are complicit in stalling any meaningful solutions. Once again, the government are demonstrating that they are all talk and no action. But we all know that shifting the blame to the states does not solve anything. It may pacify some constituents in a few marginal government seats, but it will not save the Murray-Darling system. Those same constituents in those seats will be the end losers in this game if we do not front up to the hard decisions. As I have stated, this reaction is unfortunately entirely consistent with the government’s approach to all the hard issues confronting Australia. For example, according to the government everyone and everything but the Commonwealth government is at fault for the socioeconomic disadvantage experienced by a region such as the Wide Bay Burnett region in Queensland. Money is thrown at this region in the same way as it is thrown at a variety of other regions, especially where there is a marginal coalition seat-and, more predominantly, a National Party seat-at risk. Giving money to mates to increase their income and reinforce their political support, such as in the ethanol industry, is not the long-term solution to the problems and challenges that confront Australia. The Wide Bay Burnett region continues to MAIN COMMITTEE have an unemployment rate of more than 15 per cent, which is higher than any other region in the nation. Any evaluation of the performance of the programs and the funding thrown into this region would clearly demonstrate how ineffective the programs are. I think it is about time that we accepted-and this is a message for the Deputy Prime Minister, Leader of the National Party and Minister for Transport and Regional Services-that National Party porkbarrelling does not do anything for the long-term capacity of regions to solve their problems at a local level. This takes me to the announcement of the regional partnerships program in the budget on Tuesday, when the government had an opportunity to fix up their regional difficulties. Unfortunately, they have not. In the past, they have not and I contend that in the future they will not. They will not be honest with the Australian community about what is contained in the budget with respect to those issues, which are intimately related to the use of water, because regional programs impact on the economic performance of regions. WhatI find in the examination of the budget papers when it comes to how we develop these regions-one component of which is an adequate supply of water such as from the Murray-Darling system-is a decision by the Howard government to rip out $17 million from the regional programs for this year and next year. The government are ripping $100 million out of regional programs in the next three years. I wonder why they did not tell regional Australia this on Tuesday night, but I suppose it is part and parcel of the Howard government modus operandi: tell them as little as you can and, if you have to tell them anything, tell them a few lies to get away with what you want to achieve in terms of political objectives; don’t worry about the nation’s best interests; lie on the way through if it suits your political agenda; perpetrate those lies; and then reward those who carried out those lying activities by appointing them to high-paying jobs, such as Paris-as has recently occurred with Mr Reith, who was famous for his Telecard activities. Yesterday, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services was asked to comment on the benefits in the budget to regional Australians. He certainly did not talk about water, because they did very little. Nor did he talk about his so-called new flagship-new regional programs. He knows, if he is to be honest, that he has ripped the heart out of regional programs and he has tried to hoodwink the Australian public into believing that he is representing them in this parliament. He knows that his regional programs have failed in the past, and he is now overseeing the financial death of these programs. This is, unfortunately, very similar to the process that we are having to deal with in respect of the Murray-Darling system. In the minister’s second reading speech on this bill, the government have finally recognised that there is a need to provide some water to the Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers for environmental flow. They have indicated that they will dedicate up to 70 gigalitres annually for environmental flow. I suppose it is a start, but it is inadequate. It is clear that everyone accepts that this river system needs much more than this. As the shadow minister for sustainability and the environment has already outlined in this debate, a federal Labor government will deliver 450 gigalitres in its first term. The Wentworth Group of eminent scientists, some of whom I have sat down with and had a discussion about these matters, called for 1,500 gigalitres of environmental flow-something that the opposition, the federal Labor Party, fully supports and is committed to provide within 10 years of coming into government. These scientists have clearly indicated that 1,500 gigalitres is the minimum amount required to have any chance of returning health to the MAIN COMMITTEE Murray-Darling system, to do something on the environmental front and to also protect our economic future. But to achieve that and to support the independent voice, the Wentworth Group, we need leadership and vision at a Commonwealth government level-two things that the current government lacks. I believe the government has tried to paper over its inadequacy and lack of vision by throwing out a few dollars and trying to con the Australian public into believing that it is in the process of developing a solution. Everyone knows and everything indicates that the long term solution will never arrive if the government of the day is the government that has to make those decisions. What has been achieved to date has actually been imposed on the Howard government by the state governments of New South Wales and Victoria, by economic pressure, by environmental pressure and by community pressure. Without the foresight and vision of the recently re-elected Premier of Victoria, Steve Bracks, and the recently re-elected Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, the Snowy River would never have had the long-term solution now in train. The people of Victoria and New South Wales have demonstrated what they think: they have voted according to their desire to have this river system repaired. They have resoundingly endorsed the actions of the state governments at a series of state elections. It is in our hands. We are required to act on the need to do something about this system. If only we had some leadership from the Commonwealth government, we might see the mighty Murray restored to health. But to do that they would have to cooperate at a Commonwealth and state level, rather than throwing stones at one another. I think it is fair to say that there is competition, irrespective of who is in government, between New South Wales and Victoria on an ongoing basis. That is the nature of the state system in Australia. The fact that two premiers-albeit Labor premiers-are able to front up to their responsibilities across borders is a statement about our capacity to do it if we are prepared to put our shoulder to the wheel. What we now require is the Commonwealth to not only pass this piece of legislation, with the support of the opposition, but also lend weight to the bigger challenge of how we go on to make the huge decisions that enable us to finally go a long way in repairing the damage to this water system. I think the Australian community-not just the people living along the Murray-Darling system but, more importantly, the Australian community as a nation-appreciates that a healthy Murray River would be able to provide for the users of its water far into the future. By improving the river system, what we are doing is protecting our economic future and ensuring that we have a capacity to enlarge the economic cake and create greater prosperity in the future. I would say today that we have to come to the point at which we accept that putting money into repairing the system is not a cost to government or to the Australian community but, more importantly, is an investment by us in our future and in the future of the generations that pass us-just as our own grandparents built the great infrastructure that we currently avail ourselves of. I say in conclusion that the people of South Australia correctly look forward to being able to have a glass of water whenever they need it. Our future generations deserve more from the current government than it is willing to give. The Murray-Darling system deserves more than the half-baked commitment currently on the table. Solutions to the environmental challenges facing our nation will be realised only through good policy, strong leadership and vision. It is a requirement for all of us to lend weight to this objective. WhilstI commend the bill to the MAIN COMMITTEE House, when it comes to the real hard decisions on the requirement to invest in our future, to actually do something to repair the damage to the river system, the current government just has not got it. It does not understand the challenge and it is all too difficult, because it actually requires leadership rather than political pork-barrelling. Ms LEY (Farrer) (11.50 a.m.)-I am pleased to be able to speak today on the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002 and in doing so recognise the critical importance of the Murray-Darling system both to Australia’s agricultural production and to the constituents in my electorate of Farrer. This bill amends the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1993 in order to give effect to the Murray-Darling Basin Amending Agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The amending agreement makes new arrangements for sharing water made available in the River Murray catchment above Hume Dam by the Snowy scheme. Its purpose is to promote and coordinate effective planning and management for the equitable, efficient and sustainable use of the water, land and environmental resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. The amending agreement adds a new schedule G to the agreement to make arrangements for the sharing between New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia of water made available in the catchment above Hume Dam by the Snowy scheme. It also enables the transfer of water savings and purchases to environmental entitlements for the Snowy and Murray rivers and makes reductions in the respective states’ long-term Murray-Darling Basin diversion caps. In addition, the amending agreement requires the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council to develop environmental objectives and a strategy for environmental water that will be made available to the river Murray as a result of the Snowy Water Inquiry and requires the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to manage this environmental water in accordance with the strategy. The decision initiated by the Victorian state member for East Gippsland to restore flows to the Snowy River has not generally impressed the farmers of western New South Wales, particularly those who rely on irrigated agriculture for their livelihood. They see this decision as taking water from a stressed catchment, the Murray, and returning it to an unstressed catchment, the Snowy, essentially because of an emotional attachment to the romance of the Man from Snowy River legend. In view of the reliance of many small towns on irrigated agriculture, the small businesses and the workers in those businesses were also unhappy with this decision. Premier Carr’s dramatic opening of the aqueduct in the Snowy Mountains last year and the attendant media hype of ‘the Snowy flows again’ while western New South Wales stood on the threshold of possibly the worse drought in living memory and faced its lowest water allocations ever was simply appalling. The flow that was released on this occasion was not of a quantity that could have made any difference to anyone’s water allocations, but the symbolism was awful. Secure access to resources is the No. 1 issue facing Australian farmers, and it is a source of constant frustration to me that we as a federal government have one hand tied behind our backs because of the control over water that state governments have. As Deputy Prime Minister Anderson noted at a water conference in Wagga recently: The state government has created an island of hydraulic despotism within our free economy. As members of the broader community, NSW farmers can make investments and know that no-one can take MAIN COMMITTEE them away without just compensation. As irrigators though, they are entirely subject to the decrees of the modern pharaohs in the DLWC. I have had and continue to have many approaches from individuals, private irrigation cooperatives and trusts, large irrigation companies, New South Wales farmers, irrigated councils, representatives and others, who are all unhappy about the water rules under which they are forced to carry on their businesses. I wish I could help these constituents more. Generally, I find the local state government water authorities easy to deal with and helpful. Some partnerships at local level work quite well. Undoubtedly a lot of the present unhappiness relates to the drought, and no-one can make it rain, but this does not mean that I agree with New South Wales government policy on water. I simply do not. There is no clearer example of the city-country divide than that which exists between the people of coastal New South Wales and the people west of the Blue Mountains. People on the coast, and some of the mainstream media, look at it like this: New South Wales water is overallocated; farmers are used to using more than they should, than they have any right to use; people along the Murray are growing rice when they should be growing grapes; all that flood irrigation is wasteful and it is filling up the river with salt. These are the facts. The cap on water extractions from the Murray-Darling in 1995 has limited uncontrolled extractions. Queensland do not have a very good record of following the cap, because they think they have to catch up. Irrigators in New South Wales are not entitled to a volume of water but a share of the available water, so in a dry year irrigators are not sucking the river dry; they are in fact getting only 8 to 10 per cent of what they would get in a normal year. It takes the same amount of water to grow a paddock of lucerne as it does to grow a paddock of rice. New varieties of rice yield more and use up to a third less water than existing varieties. Rice cannot be grown everywhere and it cannot be grown where the soil is too porous. Rice provides a very valuable export income for the country. If everyone started growing grapes, who is to say that the market for grapes would stay strong? It is not particularly strong at the moment. It would also mean that all irrigators along the river would be using water at the same time, leading to huge demands over summer. If winter crops such as wheat, canola and other cereals gave way to higher value summer crops such as horticulture and vegetables, there would be an enormous demand on the river in summer when summer crops are being watered and less demand in winter. Ideally, along the length of the river, there needs to be a balance. Flood irrigation can be wasteful, but not if it is done properly. If farms are set up with laser levelling and proper water delivery and recycling so that water is only on the crop for a short, optimum time, it is surprisingly efficient. Farms are conforming to complex land and water management plans and are required, in the interests of good land management, to be efficient. Clearly it is in their interests financially as well. Irrigation does not fill up the river with salt. If farms are not well set up, effluent and runoff can flow into the river, adding to salt loads. The watertable in the irrigated areas that I represent is well under control. It is dryland salinity that is the problem, and it is not related to irrigation. I am constantly trying to present the facts and correct the record somewhat towards irrigated agriculture. Unfortunately, misunderstandings persist. YetI know that city dwellers are not really anti-farming. Their generosity towards us during the drought has given me great respect for them, and their support of farming families is something that those families are MAIN COMMITTEE truly thankful for. If only we could persuade the New South Wales Labor government to spend a bit more on investing in the future of agriculture. The federal government will pay New South Wales $255 million in national competition policy payments next year. There is no evidence that New South Wales will spend any of this on compensating farmers whose property rights are being taken away. Given that the reform of water was one of the principal national competition policy initiatives, this is a clear breach of the spirit and intent of the agreement between the Commonwealth and the states. I welcomed the Deputy Prime Minister’s remarks when he said, ‘If we have to, we will revise the competition policy system to require the states to recognise the legitimate water property rights of farmers and their communities.’ This bill deals with the mechanisms we need to introduce the environmental flows to the Snowy and the Murray that were agreed to at the Murray-Darling Ministerial Council. In the bill, I note that the strategy ‘must not have significant adverse impact upon the security entitlements to water’. I really welcome and appreciate that. The savings that we need to make to gain these increased environmental flows are savings from efficiency gains. They are not to be sliced from the allocations of irrigators. I wish to make some remarks about the Living Murray initiative currently being carried out by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. This process involves the MDBC consulting with rural communities about the level of environmental flow increases in the system: 350 gigalitres, 750 gigalitres and 1,500 gigalitres. It is not the case that we have to pick one of these amounts and increase flows accordingly; rather, they are reference points only. I know that our environment minister, during a visit to the Deniliquin area last year, was able to allay the fears of many in the irrigation community, and his balanced, sensible approach is much appreciated by all of us. In fact, one of the principles underpinning much of the government’s approach to the environment and in other areas is that we will not launch into prescriptive policies which are not in the interests of the local community and not supported by local people. A series of meetings about the Living Murray has just concluded in certain towns along the river. Meetings were held in Albury, Corowa, Finley, Deniliquin, Barham and Tooleybuc in my electorate. Later meetings in Balranald and Jerilderie on the Murrumbidgee River have only just concluded. I attended three of these meetings. Their purpose was for the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to acquaint residents with details of the proposal and to receive community feedback. They were left in no doubt as to how the community actually feels about all of this. Attendances at some of these meetings were huge. In Finley, the town practically shut down as hundreds of people tried to squeeze into a room, forcing a last-minute change of venue. It was not just irrigators; it was the small businesses in the town, dependent on farming for their livelihood. They are so concerned about this process that they closed their shops for two to three hours to come along and have their say. Similarly, at Deniliquin and Barham, there was standing room only. On behalf of the constituents I represent in these areas, I wish to report their feelings to parliament and also express my hope that the community engagement process of this Living Murray initiative will enter into a dialogue with them that answers their concerns. Remember, farmers are the best environmentalists because they have to live with their mistakes-and pay for them. A great many farmers I know work long and hard, producing limited income from over-capitalised assets, in large part for the satisfaction of managing the land well and passing MAIN COMMITTEE the farm on to the next generation. They are not in it for the short-term gain. My constituents feel that the scientific process that is looking at river health, largely from laboratories in Canberra, is leaving them right out of the loop. As one person said to me, it might help if they came and talked to the locals. People who have lived along the Murray all their lives say various things about its state of health. But I have never heard any of them say that it is dying-a condition that many Australians seem to accept as gospel truth. I have been told that native fish populations are quite healthy. Carp are a problem but their numbers are lower than they have been for some time. Environmental flows will not necessarily address carp numbers-a significant cause of declining river health-although a pest reduction program will. I know that the CSIRO is involved in a ‘daughterless gene for carp’ program. Environmental flows in the Barmah Forest wetlands sustain these world-class wetlands, but they have greatly increased carp numbers. WhatI am trying to say is that there is an inexact science happening here, or there may very well be. As part of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry inquiry into the future water supplies of Australia, the committee interviewed the Executive Director of Land and Water Australia in December last year. I put a question to the executive director about environmental flows on behalf of the people of my electorate, and I asked: generally, with environmental flows, do you feel comfortable with the science that exists? The answer was: ‘No, in short.’ I asked: what can we do about it? The answer was: We have found it to be quite lacking on practical measurement of what has happened on the ground. As I said, it is strong on modelling, conceptual frameworks, prediction and so on. However, there is not enough solid work on going out and measuring what has actually happened when extra water has been put down the river for environmental purposes. All around the world, the methodologies for doing that are thin and there is not much evidence in the literature. There was a world conference on it in Johannesburg only a few months ago which Australia attended. No-one talked about the work they are doing. The work in the Murray-Darling Basin is as advanced as anywhere else, which was quite sobering for us to realise. We went there expecting to learn from other experiences and could not find anything practical to go on. Everyone else was still in the realm of theory and modelling. In response to a further question that I asked, Mr Campbell said: It is a fact that there are not too many areas around the world where communities and governments are actually doing itthat is, increasing environmental flowsSecondly, there are the methodologies. What measurement techniques do you use? How robust are they? Have they been peer reviewed? The science is pretty thin as well. The communities that I represent are not convinced that the science is exact. They are being asked to make major changes to return more water to the river. There will be a huge cost. The financial cost may be spread among country and city people-it is only fair that it should be. Of course, if it comes down to compensation, everyone should pay. But there is no doubt that, dollars aside, if economic activity is lost, these communities are threatened. People do not want money to put in their pocket so that they can go and sit on a beach. They want the footy club to have enough players, not just for the firsts but for the thirds as well. They want their hospitals and their local doctor and their preschools and TAFEs to be sound. They want govMAIN COMMITTEE ernment services, libraries, tourism, and parks and gardens. In short, they want their towns to thrive. We have just heard the opposition spokesman on the environment advocate the Labor Party’s policy, which it seems to me is to close down most of the towns along the New South Wales Murray. Make no mistake: that is exactly where we will be heading if we make a decision to return 1,500 gigalitres of environmental flows. Thankfully, this government and this agriculture and environment minister are not so cavalier, and we are considering the issues carefully. I welcome the decision from the last ministerial council meeting to consult further with local communities, to study a detailed proposal later this year and to take the time necessary to reach this important decision. I am pleased that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission has listened to and heard the message to consult more with the community. This has not happened sufficiently to date. I simply repeat: the locals have much to offer. They are experts in their own right because they understand the river-they have lived with it all of their lives. It might be an idea for the shadow minister for the environment to make some visits to other areas of the Murray, along with the opposition leader, rather than wade into the mouth and make extravagant statements about putting the equivalent of the Murray Irrigation’s entire allocation back as an environmental flow. Just getting that in perspective, that is 2,500 land-holders, 1,600 farm businesses and eight towns, not to mention the regional multiplier effect of four or five. Opposition members speaking about this bill have talked about algae. That is there because of the drought. They have talked about the dying red gums. Trees everywhere are dying because of the drought-just have a look around you. The environmental floods in the Barmah/Millawa forest are in fact making our red gums in that area extremely healthy. The Murray mouth is being dredged, and a lot is being made of the fact that tidal sand is moving back into the mouth. It is a fairly natural condition, and there is not enough water flowing out to counter that effect. I point out to members opposite that those who want to restore the Murray to its original condition would find that in a year such as this, in the drought that we are experiencing, the Murray would stop flowing at Swan Hill, and there would be absolutely zip running out of the Murray mouth. Members opposite mention that this is a bill about the Murray-Darling crisis. I should point out that it is not; it is a bill about returning flows to the Snowy River. Many of us are taking the opportunity to talk about the Murray-Darling issues. I really do invite members opposite to visit parts of my electorate to have a look and make a good study of irrigated agriculture and the activities that do so much to enhance Australia’s wealth-to really take time to consider what would happen if we stop those activities. The Labor Party policy is now advocating shutting down regional towns. The living Murray issue, in conclusion, is the biggest issue facing my electorate, and we will all be watching it closely. I would like to say that we recognise that a great Australian icon flows through our area, and it matters just as much to us as it did to Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson. It is just as important to us as it is to this House and to the rest of Australia. gives effect to the agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria regarding flows from the Murray-Darling Basin back into the Snowy system. It is also, as has been outlined, an opportunity for us to discuss issues about the Murray-Darling Basin and MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Murray Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002
324,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (12.07 P.m.),"The Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002flows along the Murray. This is appropriate because diversion of flows from that system to the Snowy will of course have an effect on both systems, and we must balance the outcomes. The effect of this amendment bill will be to ensure the new arrangements for the sharing of water made available in the River Murray catchment above the Hume Dam by the Snowy scheme. It is interesting that, when we talk about the Snowy, we are talking about one of the iconic engineering schemes of Australian history. Whilst everybody lauds and is still in awe of and excited about what was achieved by the Snowy scheme, one also queries whether, in a modern context and given a full environmental study, what was achieved would be possible. I do not mention that to be churlish or to indicate that that is a reason we should be in any way overly critical of the Snowy scheme, because of course what flowed at a very important time in Australia’s development-especially in the post-Second World War period-was the Snowy’s contribution to economic development. A number of generations since we had this economic development, it is appropriate that we now share that economic growth in a way that ensures that we can look at environmental matters and try to not only maintain the environment but do it in a sustainable way. Attempts are being made under the aegis of this bill to ensure that there is a return to much better health for the Snowy scheme, and it is made possible at this point in Australia’s development because we are able to devote resources to it. OftenI think people see environmental and economic outcomes as being in conflict. The honourable member for Farrer, who spoke before me, made some comments about the opposition’s position and its proposals for the health of the Murray scheme, which I intend to touch upon later on. She quite rightly talked of her concern about the effect it might have on towns and cities along the river. But I would say to her that the way in which we are going to achieve sustainable solutions to these problems is to acknowledge that we have to have a sustainable economic situation. If, in fact, we are talking about sharing the load in achieving these outcomes, the load should be shared by the people who are directly affected in the region that we are talking about, along with the people who I represent in this place-people in a metropolitan area. I think that that is appropriate. What she is not acknowledging is that the work that has been done on proposals to put more environmental flows back into the Murray has been done in the context of balancing these objectives. We would not be gaining all that much if, in improving the health of the Murray River, we did not acknowledge the importance of the local economies along the river. I want to talk a little bit more about the effects of the agreement that leads to the necessity for this piece of legislation at the Commonwealth level. The effects that have occurred in the Snowy river system are well documented. Obviously when flows decrease, we see things that are very characteristic. The biodiversity of the system is put under great pressure. There are instances of reduced occurrences in the Snowy scheme of platypi and native fish species. There are weed infestations that characteristically come in tandem with the reduced flows, especially the types of weed infestations that we see along the banks and in the riparian zones. There is a need for us to acknowledge that the natural seasonal effects that we see in river systems are lost. One outcome that is included in the agreement that leads to this piece of legislation talks about improving the temperature along the system, maintaining the flows and channels, restoring the types of corridors that are required for migratory species and improving the ability of native fish species to spawn et cetera. It also talked about the aesthetic value of trying to improve and return the Snowy system to what it was. These are the types of things that MAIN COMMITTEE have intangible benefits to local communities that depend upon a river system, whether it be the Murray or the Snowy, so we have to balance these things out. As has been said, this is an opportunity to talk about one of the greatest environmental challenges to confront Australia-that is, the health of the Murray-Darling system. It can be seen especially by the lack of flow at the mouth and by the level of salinity in the river by the time it reaches South Australia. It is also one of the great challenges to confront us as people who put in place public policy in an Australian context, because the federal system has resulted in impediments. I do not think the founding fathers-and we always use the word ‘fathers’ directly; as I have mentioned before, we may have had better outcomes if women had been involved at the time of Federation, but that is an argument for another debateunderstood the difficulties that would arise out of the arrangements that were made at the time of Federation when we had a river system such as the Murray-Darling that starts in Queensland and flows through New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. In the early 1990s, we attempted to remedy that through the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement between the Victorian, New South Wales and South Australian governments and the Commonwealth. We put in place an administrative mechanism that could look at issues to do with the Murray-Darling and attempt to start the rehabilitation required. Later down the track, Queensland came to the party and also signed up to the agreement. I think administration is a very important feature, and we continue to see the requirement for complementary legislation in the different administrations involved. A little over 10 years down the track since these types of arrangements commenced, it is appropriate to look back to see whether the types of outcomes that we might have envisaged at the start have been achieved. To a certain extent, the health of the system indicates that there is a need for a great deal more work. I think the government should recognise that Labor’s announced policies are a genuine attempt to try to, one, make sure that all the stakeholders involved understand that a Commonwealth government of a Labor persuasion sees that it has a role; and, two, make sure that the responsibility is put in an Australian context. Again, I wish to stress that this problem requires a shared responsibility. We will not achieve the outcomes required if we say that this is just a regional problem that needs to be solved directly by those who at the moment use the resource of the river system or are in the region of the river system. I have had the pleasure of visiting a number of places along the Murray, especially with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage. The economic importance to the communities along the river cannot be understated, and that is a consideration that has to be factored in. I think any work done on improving the health of the Murray system will always have to take that into account. The opposition have quite clearly indicated what we would do if in government. For instance, we would restore 450 gigalitres of environmental flow in that first year and move towards delivering what has been assessed by the Wentworth Group, amongst others, as 1,500 gigalitres within 10 years to restore the health of the river. These things are achievable. They are achievable if we marry the types of technological advances we have seen in agriculture, engineering and the like. We need to make sure not only that these flows can be achieved by better use of the water in the system as a resource but that this can be done in a sustainable way. The direct importance of this piece of legislaMAIN COMMITTEE tion is that it acknowledges that, with the diversion of flow from the Murray to the Snowy system, we have to take into account the health of both of those systems. Obviously, if you take a flow out of one and put it into another, it is going to have an effect on both. We need to have the type of investment that has been discussed in this agreement between the state governments and the Commonwealth-investment in the types of engineering works that will be required to make the savings of water use that can be achieved and that can then be allocated to environmental flows. Of course, the great challenge of all environmental concerns is that we make good use of newer technologies to achieve an environmental outcome in an economically efficient way. If we do not marry the economic and environmental objectives it is doubtful that anything will be achieved by the attempts that are made. The opposition, of course, have said that in saving the Murray River it is important not only to achieve the type of environmental flows that have already been discussed but also to respond and be involved in climate change. We have said all along that the Kyoto protocol holds out a solution and that Australia should sign and ratify immediately so that we can get on with the work that will see amelioration of the effects of climate change. If we do not take actions immediately, the types of environmental disasters that we see along the Murray system will continue. I acknowledge that a phenomenon like algal bloom is made worse by the present drought conditions and that it has occurred at times of better rainfall. That has to be acknowledged. The declining number of native fish is of concern. Along the plains of this system are great areas of trees, such as river red gums, that are under stress. The increase in the amount of salinity in the Murray-Darling Basin is of grave concern. This happens not only in the lower reaches of the system but also in a number of the areas higher up along the Darling. At the end of the day, one of the great challenges that confronts South Australia, is of course, its dependency upon the Murray system for its water supply. That is of grave concern because of the health of the Murray is getting to such a stage that, no matter what newer technologies might occur for the salvaging of potable water, given the condition the Murray is in that will not be achievable; the Murray will be useless as a drinking resource for Adelaide. Some of the estimations that have been made by various studies indicate that perhaps within 20 years Adelaide’s water will be undrinkable for two days out of five. For a community the size of Adelaide, this is of grave concern. There have been many engineering solutions that have been discussed. Some discussions have taken place on the Murray system and the indications are that in some parts, for some of the tributaries, we might have to acknowledge that the problem of salinity in those streams cannot be resolved. We should acknowledge that these systems have basically become drains. We have to see them in the context that they are gathering waste water rather than gathering a resource that can be returned for agricultural or other purposes. These are the great challenges that confront governments both at the state and the Commonwealth level. It requires leadership by governments, and this is why we believe that it is important that the present government is involved in the necessary measures. The Commonwealth government has a national responsibility to show leadership and to ensure that the Murray-Darling system is saved. Labor has committed to that and acknowledges that that type of leadership is essential. I am pleased that Simon Crean, as the parliamentary leader, acknowledges that this issue is one of the most important issues confronting Australia. MAIN COMMITTEE I think it becomes an iconic issue in the context of Australia’s ability to make sure that with environmental concerns we are delivering systems that are sustainable. It would be no use if we devoted a whole host of resources that might at a point in time restore to a certain degree the health of the Murray system if we did not put in place measures to ensure that that is sustainable. Again, it is in that context that I stress that those who criticise the Labor position on the basis that they believe it will have an effect on local communities and cause them to close down do not acknowledge that there is a requirement that environmental measures such as this have to be sustainable both environmentally and economically. That is the type of public policy that is necessary. I am pleased this legislation is before us, because it is very important, particularly for the Snowy system. As I said, it returns the dividend we have seen from the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme over the last 50-odd years. That is important. As economic benefit has flowed from what is a world renowned engineering project it is appropriate now, a couple of generations later, that we find resources to address the environmental degradation that was a natural consequence of a scheme like the Snowy. Those communities along the Snowy will benefit from the increased environmental flow, and it will lead them to greater health and prosperity. In turn, they can make a contribution when we confront the challenges on the other side of the divide in the Murray-Darling system. Those are the types of things that require a national effort. Therefore, a contribution should be made not only by people in those regions that are directly affected but also by people in the metropolitan areas who see these things as important. I am pleased to rise in support of this amendment bill. fact only three minutes until the adjournment debate-but I rise to discuss the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002. Very briefly, the original Murray-Darling Basin Agreement was made on 24 June 1992-not long after I came to this place-and was confirmed by the Commonwealth and the states of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The purpose of this bill is to update the agreement and to make new arrangements for the sharing of this valuable resource of water and a certain section of the Murray River. As well, the amending agreement includes provisions for the management of environmental flows in the river Murray. The objective is: ... to promote and co-ordinate effective planning and management for the equitable efficient and sustainable use of the water, land and environmental resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. Water is without doubt this country’s most valuable natural resource. To say Australian primary industries rely on this product to survive is quite plainly an understatement. With the exceptional drought that has plagued and continues to plague much of our country, there needs to be real security and sustainability over our future water supply. I am pleased to say that farmers, small businesses and local governments in my electorate of Maranoa-which I might say encompasses some 40 per cent of the Queensland land mass-are actively working to sustain water resources. These farm families, businesses and local governments want a future where water is available to irrigate their crops, to sustain property in numbers and to ensure their viability and future livelihood. Local governments particularly want to make sure that they have sustainability and security over water, because without water you cannot encourage future regional development into your community. Future regional development and MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Murray Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002
325,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (12.27 P.m.),"I know there is very limited time left-in the development of new industries in regional and rural Australia will rely on the availability of water. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd terday’s debate in the House of Representatives with respect to the Pan Pharmaceuticals issue and to once again raise some points made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing in her contribution to the debate, following consideration of issues within the Hansard. I will speak very briefly to a number of these points. The parliamentary secretary, in part of her response to a range of issues raised by me, mentioned: It was only following the third audit of Pan Pharmaceuticals that the magnitude and extent of the problems with the company’s products and processing started to become apparentThat is interesting because there was no third audit of Pan. There was, in fact, a second audit, which went over a longer period, but there was no third audit. That comes on the advice of the TGA. Again, the parliamentary secretary should check her facts. There are issues such as the question I raised with respect to an article in the Medical Journal of Australia, regarding a product that had been in circulation and tested. It was found that eight out of 10 products did not meet the basic conditions of ingredients that were advertised on the product. The parliamentary secretary in response to that made a number of points, which particularly ended with: The fact that there was a lower quantity of isoflavones in the products than specified on the label posed no safety risk at all. If you go to the comments that she made, effectively she is saying that, because there was not a public health and safety issue on this occasion, the concern about quality means nothing; the fact that less than one per cent of the advertised amount was within the medicine does not matter, and it is not a TGA responsibility. That is ridiculous. I refer the House to the web site for the Office of Complementary Medicines, which the parliamentary secretary is responsible for, regarding the reforms that this government introduced. One of the key points is: The current high level of quality, health and safety will be maintained through increased post-market vigilance. It is not just about health and safety; it is also about quality. One of the key issues in this area is ensuring that is the case. To suggest that, because it was not an issue of health and safety with respect to those medicines, it was not an issue for the TGA to be concerned about is patently ridiculous and an incredible claim for the parliamentary secretary to make. If the TGA agrees with that then, frankly, I am appalled. Going to that issue, a point made in relation to a particular drug was that Pan was the manufacturer but it was one of 11 manufacturers approved to produce the product. Again, once it was identified that there was a problem, the TGA should have taken action to identify MAIN COMMITTEE",175,Murray Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002

327,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (12.30 P.m.),"I rise today to raise some ongoing issues from yeswho was responsible, which manufacturer was involved, and then examined it. We know from what has been said by the parliamentary secretary, the minister and the TGA, and from what has been recorded publicly, that this is a company that had form. Difficulties had been raised over a number of years. That those difficulties had been raised, that an article was published in a respected journal outlining a clear breach and problems with the ingredients included in herbal medicine produced by that company, and that, given the company’s record, it was not properly investigated by the TGA is absolutely unbeliveable. To try and fob it off on the basis that it is a quality issue and is not important goes against what the TGA and the Office of Complementary Medicines say they do in this area. Frankly, it is incredible. There are a range of other issues that come out of the discussions by the parliamentary secretary. I addressed a number of them yesterday and I will be addressing a number of them in future. The point here is that we are dealing with a situation where, regardless of what is being said, there are more and more issues coming out on a regular basis. This government have not done their job in this area. We are finding more incidences of that on a daily basis, even in situations where, time and again, attempts by the opposition to gain information about what has occurred are being frustrated by the parliamentary secretary’s office either not providing information to us about things like membership and role of the expert committee they have set up or, on from that, in terms of frustrating our attempts through the Parliamentary Library to gain information that is available within the TGA which will address some of these key concerns. Frankly, what is happening in this area is a joke. There is a lot more to come, and we will certainly be chasing it down every rabbit hole we have to. (Time expired) Roads: Funding road that runs from the Pacific Highway just north of Raymond Terrace through Limeburners Creek, Booral, Stroud, Stroud Road, Craven, Stratford, Gloucester and areas beyond Taree in the electorate of Lyne. It winds through the local government areas of Port Stephens, Great Lakes, Gloucester and Taree. From the outset, let me state clearly for the record that the Bucketts Way is a New South Wales regional road. Regional roads are the sole responsibility of the state government. The Bucketts Way is a road which suffers from a general lack of funding by the New South Wales Labor government. The Bucketts Way task force committee identified main road 90 as needing some $64 million spent on it to bring it up to an acceptable safety standard. Yet the New South Wales Labor government has only provided a miserly $6 million over the past three years. I am disappointed that there is no indication of any further funding from the New South Wales Labor government. They have simply washed their hands of the matter and they have ignored the people that travel and live along the Bucketts Way. On6 November 2001, after a long community campaign, the Prime Minister, John Howard, came to the electorate of Paterson and announced a funding package of $20 million over four years for the Bucketts Way to help alleviate the neglect of a Bob Carr Labor government. With the handing down of the federal budget on 13 May, I was pleased to see the Howard government deliver on its promise. This year’s budget saw the allocation of funding of $20 million for this road, which will be $3.5 million starting this year, 2003-04. We will all be relieved to see an enormous amount of work done on the Bucketts Way in the next financial year, but this commitment from the Commonwealth does not negate the state government’s MAIN COMMITTEE",176,Adjournment
328,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (12.35 P.m.),"The Bucketts Way, main road 90, is a notoriousresponsibility on this road. I demand that the New South Wales state government at least match the Commonwealth funding to the Bucketts Way and stop selling the people along the Buckets Way short by neglecting their responsibilities. The allocation of $3.5 million worth of work along the Bucketts Way in 2003-04 will be directed to work in the Great Lakes local government area and will involve the sealing of 7.2 kilometres of road, estimated at $210,000; replacing the Cromarty Creek Bridge, estimated at $230,000; project services relating to the replacement of Cromarty Bridge, estimated at $8,000; rehabilitation of 700 metres of road through Davies Cutting, estimated at $290,000; rehabilitation of three kilometres of road from Wards River, estimated at $900,000; rehabilitation of one kilometre of road up to Lamans Creek in Stroud, estimated at $300,000; rehabilitation of 1.1 kilometres of road to Dog Trap Creek, estimated at $450,000; rehabilitation of 1.6 kilometres of road north of Stroud Road, estimated at $480,000; rehabilitation of one kilometre of road along the south approach to Cromarty Creek Bridge, $320,000; rehabilitation of 800 metres of road to join Cromarty Creek Bridge at Double Creek Crossing approaches, estimated at $210,000; and, rehabilitation of 9.2 kilometres of the Bucketts Way, estimated at $100,000. I am also pleased to see the budget deliver on national funding in 2003-04 of $45 million for black spot road programs, over $302 million for the Roads to Recovery program and $462.7 million in untied local government road grants. The Commonwealth government has now spent over $1.8 million in black spot funding on the Bucketts Way. This has included realigning the road 1.2 kilometres north of Dungog Road, Stroud, at a cost of $120,000; installing a guard fence, removing trees and reducing the speed limit on the junction of Merewether Lane, Gloucester, at a cost of $240,000; installing a guard fence, widening and sealing shoulders at the junction of Ribbons Road, Stroud, at a cost of $450,000; removing roadside hazards and enhancing the clear zones at the junction of Church Street, Gloucester, at a cost of $300,000; widening paving, improving horizontal and vertical alignments at Spring Creek Road, Spring Creek, at a cost of $250,000; installing guard fence and enhancing clear zones at Broad Gull Bridge, Stratford, $250,000; and, in my colleague the member for Lyne’s part of the Bucketts Way, installing guard fence and enhancing clear zones at the Krambach turn-off, Krambach, at a cost of $200,000. I will be working with Gloucester, Great Lakes and Port Stephens councils over the next 12 months to see what areas are eligible for further black spot funding. It is abundantly clear that the Commonwealth is committed to providing a safer roads system despite the New South Wales government’s blatant disregard for its responsibilities. I would like to record my sincere appreciation to Mayor Barry Ryan and general manager Norm McLeod of Gloucester Council, and Mayor John Chadban and general manager Keith O’Leary of Great Lakes Council for their support. I also thank my federal colleagues the Prime Minister, John Howard, and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson, for their intervention and personal support of the Bucketts Way upgrade project. Medicare: Bulk-billing about to befall nearly 27,000 households in my electorate. Twenty-seven thousand households-over 60 per cent of all households in the Greenway electorate-will be adversely affected by this government’s decision to destroy Medicare and wipe out bulk-billing. At preMAIN COMMITTEE",177,Adjournment
329,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (12.40 P.m.),"I rise today to speak about a disaster that issent, over 94 per cent of doctors in Greenway bulk-bill. This is an outstanding rate. Across all of Western Sydney the figures are universally above 90 per cent, except in Lindsay and Macarthur, both of which have just recently fallen to 89 per cent. I hope the member for Lindsay is concerned about this, and I call upon her to campaign so that we can retain bulk-billing in our area. Western Sydney is a leader in bulk-billing rates. This move against bulk-billing will disproportionately affect our region. It is a move against the people of Western Sydney. Over 94 per cent of Greenway’s doctors bulk-bill, and this government wants to destroy that for over 60 per cent of the people. At present, the average out-of-pocket cost for doctors in the Greenway electorate who do not bulk-bill is $16.65, which means that the average up-front cost to go to visit these doctors is $41.70. This represents a 20 per cent increase over the past two years. Already it is becoming more expensive for ordinary working families in my area to see a doctor. If the government takes away bulk-billing, the costs imposed on the people of Greenway will be astronomical. In some areas where bulk-billing rates are already below 30 per cent, this new policy will have only a minimal impact, but in Greenway we are looking at a fullblown disaster of massive proportions. Overnight we will go from a situation where 94 per cent of all services are bulk billed to nothing. Sure, pensioners and health care cardholders will continue to be bulk-billed, but everyone else will lose everything. Once the payments start, they only get bigger. The government cannot and will not guarantee price control. The Prime Minister believes that doctors should be able to charge whatever they like for a consultation. He said so during the 1987 election, and he is saying it again now. The President of the AMA-the doctors’ union-claims that the only effect this policy will have is to increase costs to the patients. So now the government wants 27,000 households in the Greenway electorate to fork out a copayment, which at the moment averages nearly $17 in Greenway for the doctors who do not bulk bill. This is a copayment that the AMA, the Doctors Reform Society, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the inventor of Medicare, the National Centre for Health Evaluation and everybody else, including the minister herself, have all admitted will rise over time with no possible way to stop it. Throw your Medicare card out the window and reach for your credit card, because prices are only going to go up. No ifs, no buts. The opening bid is $17 and the auction starts now-and there is no end in sight. There are over 135,000 people living in the Greenway electorate, and this policy affects 60 per cent of them-over 80,000 individuals. If each of these individuals visits the doctor only once during the year, at $17, that is over $1.3 million the families of Greenway have to find to look after their health. Obviously it works out at a much higher rate than that because, while some people only go the doctor once a year, many more of them need to go a lot more frequently. The actual dollar amount that the families of Greenway are facing is impossible to work out. AllI know is that it is far more than it has to be and far more than it has a right to be. This is the highest-taxing government in Australia’s history, and now ordinary working families will have to pay three times for their health. First there is the Medicare levy, then there is the private health insurance that this government has forced people to take out and now there will be a co-payment every time they visit the doctor. Medicare is universal. That is what makes it MAIN COMMITTEE the envy of the world. Why are we paying for that in every other way? The government is fond of saying, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’ Our Prime Minister has said that Medicare is ‘a miserable, cruel fraud’ and ‘a total and complete failure’. He has said all along that he would ‘pull Medicare apart’. The only miserable, cruel fraud is the Liberal Party and this Prime Minister, who promises to govern for all of us. He has not and he will not. Information Technology Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12.45 p.m.)-Next Tuesday, I will be giving the Australia Address at the Microsoft Government Leaders Summit, and I will be reiterating our government’s success in getting government online. There have been substantial savings and efficiencies from getting government online. However, I believe that government online is just the beginning of the journey for our government departments and agencies. We must master the delivery of services online and make it worthwhile for our constituents to deal with us online. How is this for an ultimate vision-which I really love-voter online? My vision of voter online goes beyond government savings and referendums on every political issues. It deals with customer satisfaction in dealing with government from our citizens’ perspective. With voter online, individuals can do their business with government online at 10 p.m., after the kids are in bed, using forms already containing information previously provided to government such as a child’s name and date of birth. The total lack of integration and sharing of static personal information across all government agencies is one of my favourite gripes. Given the extraordinary popularity of the television show Big Brother, I suspect that the modern generation is willing to trade some privacy concerns for convenience of access. But that said, the technology is available to ensure privacy and to track unauthorised access by public servants to records. They are regularly audited, so privacy concerns are not something we need to worry about. Voters should be able to opt into a system that allows them to be supported by the efficiencies in today’s IT platforms that our government departments-and this government, in particular-have spent millions of tax dollars installing. In fact, in this budget we have seen another $300 million given to Centrelink to get its back-end systems up to date so that it can start delivering online to Centrelink customers. No longer will mum and the three kids have to get on a bus and go down to the Medicare office to make a claim for a doctor’s visit-and once one kid gets cranky, forget about doing anything else; that is your one outing for the day before you want to get the kids home and into bed. Now we can actually make the claim at the doctor’s rooms. If we are at the council library, while the kids are playing we can do our accounts and taxation bookkeeping at that level. Imagine never having to line up for anything unless it is for a service such as a photograph or a fingerprint? Imagine your Medicare claims being made at the point of delivery, at the doctor’s rooms? What about your family tax payments being available on a spreadsheet in your own home for you to calculate your own financial progress throughout the year? Imagine registering your car when you take it in to be serviced? Imagine the legal fees you can save by filling out your own legal forms and filing them with the courts yourself over the Net? Imagine a builder being able to lodge all development applications with the local council online and no longer having to spend hours going to the council each week to physically sign documents as a licensed builder? MAIN COMMITTEE For Australia, this future is within our reach by what we have already done in strategic investment by government in back-end computer systems. Again, Tuesday’s budget made that commitment to Centrelink and also committed $9 million to health to assist doctors in adopting HIC online. It is a very innovative and attractive way of doing business. Imagine a future where your family payment for having a fully immunised child at 18 months is paid directly into your account-that, when you saw a doctor for each immunisation, that was done automatically and you did not have to go into Centrelink and fill out a form. Backed up by the National Immunisation Register, the government will have all that information and can just pay you the money. That would be a terrific investment for people in Greenway who, by and large, are young, IT-literate couples who often both work out of necessity and who leave home at 7 a.m. and return at 7 p.m. Doing that seven days a week is not conducive to a family life when people are raising children. With this type of package, they could easily replace that scenario with a work-from-home scenario: one parent could work from home on Mondays and Fridays and the other parent could work from home on Tuesday and Thursday. Suddenly, that work/family balance could take on a whole new perspective. You can look at bundling these government services and delivering them in kiosks similar to the way in which banks have outsourced to the ATMs, the shopfronts, the convenience stores, to various agencies and, I believe, to utilities such as our electricity company. In fact, a very modest income. That would give direct access to these types of government services. This government is progressive and is using modern technologies to deliver services to our voters. (Time expired) Roads: Funding government’s sabotaging of the Calder Highway in its characteristically mean-spirited budget of this week. I ask this simple question on behalf of the people that I represent: how about a fair go for the people of Bendigo and central Victoria. Bendigo and central Victoria are being victimised again by the Howard government over the Calder Highway. This highway should be receiving a full 50 per cent of its duplication costs from the federal government. Canberra has dumped the Calder Highway, and now it refuses to fund it. This is despite the fact that it was the Howard government which created the system of Roads of National Importance for the election of 1996 and which declared the Calder a RONI in 1996, meaning that it would be jointly funded fifty-fifty by the Commonwealth and the state governments. The Bracks Labor government is meeting its obligation to pay its 50 per cent of the costs. It put $70 million into the state budget last year to undertake the next stage of the upgrade, which is the Kyneton to Faraday section. The Howard government has refused to match it. The Bracks government again committed $70 million for the Calder in its budget of 2003, but again the Howard government refused to match the state’s funds. We now have the disgusting situation in Bendigo and central Victoria of the federal government disowning the Calder and refusing to fund it. In fact, it leaves it stranded. So we have another disgusting situation where the state government has been forced by Canberra to go it alone and fund part of the next section of the upgrade from its own funds. MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Adjournment
330,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (12.50 P.m.),"I rise to protest once again about the HowardSo what is the Calder today? It is a Road of National Importance that the national government disowns. In the post budget media release from transport minister Anderson, the Calder did not even rate a mention. There was not one reference to the Calder. It is completely off their radar screens. This coalition Treasurer and transport minister bring a new dimension to the terms ‘vicious’ and ‘deceitful’. While the state government commendably has set 2006 as the completion date for the upgrade, the federal government refused to finish it and has set no completion date. For the Howard government, it is a road with a start but no end. It rejects the state government’s 2006 completion date, but it has no alternative finishing year. How vicious can this government get? Under the timetable of the former Kennett government of Victoria, the Calder should have been on the way to completion right now. The former Kennett government of Victoria set 2002-03 as its completion date for the Calder upgrade. They never told Bendigo this, and I only learned it officially from the transport minister’s answer to a question I put on notice last year about highway funding. Mr Anderson’s answer showed that the original Calder finishing date was 2002-03. What happened, of course, is that the Kennett government and the Howard government went slow on the Calder, and they left a huge chunk unfinished by the time the Bracks government came into office in 1999. How perverse the Commonwealth government is. It agreed to a 2002-03 completion date under the Liberal Kennett government, failed to fulfil it, and now it rejects the 2006 completion date of the Bracks government. So where has the Calder’s federal money gone? It has gone into other ‘RONI-come-lately’ highways. The Howard government declared the Geelong Road a RONI in 1999-three years after it declared the Calder a RONI. While the Calder remains stalled at Kyneton, the federal government has already completed the Geelong Road upgrade-in the same year as it planned originally to complete the Calder. The Howard government declared the Pakenham Bypass in Victoria a RONI in 1998. It plans to complete it in 2006-07. The Howard government will complete the Pakenham Bypass years before the Calder gets within cooee of completion. It is funding the Pakenham Bypass in this budget, but it is not funding the Calder. There are many RONIs in Australia, but the Calder Highway has the distinction of being the only RONI where the federal government has stopped paying and simply walked away. It is also the only RONI that the Howard government will never finish. The government is in fact now scrapping the whole RONI funding system and replacing it with its AusLink system-at a time when there are still 43 kilometres of the Calder Highway remaining to be completed. Let me say briefly that the Calder cause is poorly served by some of its self-appointed spokesmen-and I refer to the Calder Highway Improvement Committee, an oxymoron if ever there was one. This organisation consistently plays pussyfoot with the Howard government. They show their Tory allegiances when they absurdly try to shift the blame for the sabotaging of the Calder onto the Bracks government. The only thing the so-called Calder Highway Improvement Committee tries to improve is the tarnished image of the Howard government, and they cannot even do that properly. A few months ago this mob of amateurs panicked. They suddenly claimed they were putting pressure on the federal government by organising a talkfest of politicians, including the federal transport minister. They said they would hold a meeting tomorrow-that is, not before the federal budget but three days after it. They even claimed the meeting would give the federal transport minister a forum to announce the MAIN COMMITTEE budget funding for the Calder. The would be meeting was just a farce. It never happened and it will not happenMr Anderson just ignored them-nor did the much touted budget funding for the Calder materialise. (Time expired) New South Wales: Carr Government the New South Wales parliament with members of the Shoalhaven Business Forum. We had been invited by the state member for Kiama, Matt Brown, part of whose electorate overlaps mine. I went along on the basis that there might be some bipartisan attempt at working for the benefit of the region. Instead, we were confronted with what could only be described as a fullblown political tirade against the federal government. It was disappointing for us in the group to have to sit through what seemed a poor attempt at a debate on Medicare. What was further apparent was that the debate had nothing to do with what the New South Wales government could do about the question; rather it was for the express purpose of attacking the federal government in whose jurisdiction Medicare is. That much was made quite clear to me in the comments by the people I was with. Perhaps the member for Kiama was trying to big-note himself for my benefit. The debate was in response to an urgency motion put by the state member for Kiama, using the Medicare issue as a vehicle to force the funding deal on hospitals. I have to reinforce the comments of my colleague, the member for Ku-ring-gai, when he said in reply: In his last few contributions to this debate, the honourable member for Kiama gave the game away. This is classic Labor-driven by polls, not by what is right. The honourable member spent most of his time referring to the opinion poll on the front page of the Australian. I have news for the honourable member for Kiama and for the Government: the public wants this parliament to concentrate on State issues, not Federal issues. What they are doing is thumping the drums to get the appalling performance of the leader of the federal opposition off the front pages. It is a classic, diversionary tactic designed to instil fear and loathing from a position that lacks substance. We have seen how the Carr government has benefited from increased tax receipts since it came to power, yet has failed to invest adequately in addressing the obvious shortcomings of state health services that are so apparent in New South Wales. To his credit, the member for Ku-ring-gai then moved to amend the motion by omitting all words after ‘House’ and inserting: ... calls upon the State Government to put an end to its cynical cutbacks to surgery at the State’s public hospitals and to constructively resolve the Federal Government’s proposed new Commonwealth-States Health Agreement to ensure better funding for public hospitals across New South Wales. In other words, to match the federal government’s extra funding. Last year, a debate ensued on the relevance of state governments. Is state parliament an anachronism we can ill afford? After this very transparent political attempt at a debate on federal issue, I must ask the question yet again. It would seem that, if the member for Kiama can indulge in blatant politicking whilst the state government has all its other problems to confront then perhaps we should look at the relevance of this tier of government to the modern needs of our nation. As for the member of Kiama, it is perhaps of some relief to discover that his electorate is so devoid of local issues that he can turn his indulgence to federal matters. Perhaps it is an indication of where his future career interests lie and, as such, we can expect more forays into MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Actew In The Act Is Looking At A Very Low Cost Box That You Can Insert Even Into A Home On
331,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (12.55 P.m.),"Just last week I had the opportunity of travelling tofederal matters as he attempts to expand his political horizons. If he is genuine about wanting to meet the interests of his electorate, he might turn his attention to putting the Berry bypass back on the agenda or perhaps getting access for the disabled to the Kiama Railway Station. Perhaps he could turn his attention to the eyesore he has encouraged with the construction of an elevated roadway along Bombo Beach or provide some truthful answers to the Menangle bridge debacle. Even more recently, he attacked the federal government’s alleged response to exceptional circumstances drought relief funding, when it was his government that dragged its heels. He cynically delayed the process of the application to just before the state election, when it could have been expedited as early as December last year. All this is from a member who was caught out setting up a public relations stunt with local police just before the last state election that failed miserably and so publicly. Who can forget the headlines in the local newspaper, the Kiama Independent? As a PR stunt, it certainly got the coverage, but for all the wrong reasons-a fact that I am sure was not lost on his seniors within the Labor Party. But apparently he has not learnt his lesson, as this urgency motion suggests. Cheap, exploitive tactics, such as I witnessed last week, are symptoms of a government that has grown far too big for its own boots. What was Graham Richardson’s oft quoted and infamous description of the Labor Party-‘Whatever it takes’. Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m. MAIN COMMITTEE The following answers to questions were circulated: Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs: Program Funding (Question No. 715) Ms Burke asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Are there any programs administered by the Minister’s Department that provide, or have provided, funding to local government authorities in (a) 1996-97, (b) 1997-98, (c) 1998-99, (d) 1999-2000, (e) 2000-2001 and (f) 2001-2002. (2) If so, for each program for each of the years that funding was granted to local government authorities, (a) what was the level of funding provided to each local government authority, (b) what was the purpose for which the grant was made and (c) in which federal electoral division or divisions does this local government authority fall. (3) Have any concerns been raised with the Minister’s office or the Minister’s Department from (a) local government authorities or (b) other organisations regarding cost shifting onto local government in regard to any programs administered by the Minister’s Department; if so, (a) to what program or programs did the concern relate and (b) were any investigations undertaken by the Minister’s Department in relation to these concerns; if not, why not; if so, what were the findings of these investigations. (1) Local Governments are eligible to apply for Living in Harmony (LIH) and Community Settlement Services Scheme (CSSS) funding. Funding was provided under these programs in the following years: Year LIH CSSS 1996-97 No No 1997-98 No No 1998-99 No No 1999-00 No No 2000-01 No Yes* 2001-02 Yes Yes *The CSSS funding year commences on 1 October and finishes on 30 September of each year. CSSS funding to the Local Government authority commenced on 1 October 2000. (2) Living in Harmony Grants (a) LIH grants in 2001-02 were made to the following Local Governments: 1) Canterbury City Council, $25,000 2) City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, $25,000 3) Launceston City Council, $25,000 4) Nambucca Shire Council, $19,543 5) Shire of Roebourne, $13,375 (b) The overall aim of the Living in Harmony community grants program is to develop projects that promote harmony between people and groups from different cultural, and religious or social backgrounds in the local community; and build on positive values held by many people in the community.",183,Actew In The Act Is Looking At A Very Low Cost Box That You Can Insert Even Into A Home On
332,Mr Hardgrave,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(c) 1) Watson 2) Kalgoorlie 3) Bass 4) Cowper 5) Kalgoorlie Community Settlement Services Scheme Grants (a) CSSS grants were awarded to the Ipswich City Council for the following amounts for the following periods: 2000 $20,000 2001 $20,000 2002 $30,000 (b) The purpose of funding was to allow the Council to identify gaps in current services to newly arrived and emerging migrant communities within the Ipswich area and assist those communities to identify ways of addressing their needs, and facilitate greater coordination and cooperation in delivery of services. (c) Ipswich City Council falls into the federal electoral division of Oxley. (3) The LIH and CSSS grants are competitive application based schemes to which local government authorities have the opportunity to apply in the same way as non-profit community based organisations. The issue of cost shifting is not relevant in this context. Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Question No. 1436) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 11 February 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1114 (Hansard, 4 February 2003, page 153) concerning the appointment of Mrs Virginia Chadwick to the Board of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and as Chief Executive Officer of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, what is the itemised nature of the remuneration package which ranges from $170,000 to $286,000 paid to Mrs Chadwick. (2) Is it Government policy that, where a former Senator or Member is entitled to hold a parliamentary pension, or a spouse or partner is in receipt of a pension, or holds an office of profit under the Crown, the pension may be reduced depending on the remuneration received for the holding of such office; if so, why is this policy position not applied to former State and Territory members of Parliament who receive parliamentary pensions. (1) Public information is available in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority Annual Report for 2001 – 2002. (2) Arrangements governing State and Territory parliamentary superannuation schemes are matters for the relevant jurisdiction.

Ministerial Speeches: Translation into Arabic and Bahasa Indonesian (Question No. 1791) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice on 27 March 2003: (1) Who authorised the use of DIMIA resources for the dissemination on 3 March of partisan material on Iraq to Arabic and other ethnic organisations and on what basis was it decided to do so. (2) In deciding to conduct the mail out at taxpayers’ expense what liaison, if any, was there with the Prime Minister’s office and with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. (3) On what basis was it determined that the Prime Minister’s speech needed to be translated into Arabic and into Bahasa Indonesian, and not into any other languages. (4) Was a Translating and Interpreting Service (TIS) contractor used to prepare the Arabic translation; if so, did this contravene the TIS business rules, which state that translations are not to be prepared for other Government agencies; if not, who was the translation prepared by, and how was this person selected. (5) Who was responsible for checking the translation before it was sent out by the Minister and why were they unable to establish that the translation was unreadable. (6) How many organisations and individuals were sent the faulty translation and how and by whom were they selected. (7) How many of those organisations and media outlets who received the translation do not have Arabic speaking staff or mainly use another community language. (8) What was the total cost of the exercise, involving 2 separate mail outs of the original and the corrected translation, including translation costs, printing costs, staff time for its dispatch and postal costs. (9) Who met these costs and under what Appropriation item were they incurred. (1) I authorised that the speech be distributed by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) on the basis that an explanation of the government’s Iraq policy should be widely disseminated among Arabic speaking and Muslim communities in Australia. No partisan material on Iraq was disseminated to Arabic or other ethnic organisations. (2) The Prime Minister’s Office sought assistance with the mail out. Normal liaison took place between relevant Departments and Ministers’ Offices. (3) Translation into Arabic reflected the fact that Iraq is a Middle Eastern, Arabic speaking country. Translation into Indonesian reflected the fact that Indonesia has the world’s largest Muslim population and is one of Australia’s nearest neighbours. (4) The translation was arranged by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. (5) The original translation was verified as correct by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but was corrupted during electronic transmission between Departments. (6) The corrupted translation was sent to 119 individuals and organisations. The organisations were selected by DIMIA. The mailing list was designed to be inclusive rather than exclusive. (7) My Department does not hold details on the languages spoken by staff within the organisations on the mailing list. Some organisations from Muslim communities not identified as native Arabicspeakers were included in the mail out because of the centrality of Arabic to the Muslim religion. It is understood many Muslims regard the language itself as part of the revelation, and that study of",198,Questions On Notice
