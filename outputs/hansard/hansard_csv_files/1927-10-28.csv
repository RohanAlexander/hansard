Groom) Took The Chair At 11 A.m., And Read Prayers. 1924,1 Asked The Prime Minister Whether It Was A Fact That Australian Insurance Companies Were Charging Excessive Premiums By Basing The Expectation Of Life In Australia On English Tables, And Whether The Commonwealth Government Would Introduce An Insurance Law To Compel Life Insurance Companies To Adapt Their Premiums To Tbe Actual Mortality Statistics Of Australia. To This The Prime Minister Replied That When The Royal Commission On National Insurance Had Completed Its Inquiries, The Govern","ment would consider its policy on the whole matter of iusurance. As the National Insurance Commission has now completed its inquiry, and iu view of the complexities of legislation of this character, and the many allegations of roguery and malpractice in relation to the formation of "" wild-cat"" insurance companies, will the Government cause legislative action to be expedited by the appointment of a select committee to conduct exhaustive * investigations into the whole subject of ordinary insurance? Is it not a fact that the Constitution vests in the Commonwealth Parliament complete power to legislate on this subject? insurance is being investigated by the Attorney-General's Department, with a view to the preparation of suitable legismay be obtained. lation.

16,Mr Nelson (Northern Territory).,"On the 26th October, the Minister having received the information I sought, replied as follow:On the 20th October, the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) referred to a telegram he had received stating that sleeper getters connected with the railway construction work in North Australia were employing a large number of aboriginals in getting sleepers. The honourable member asked whether immediate action would be taken with a view to preventing the exploitation of aboriginal labour on Government contracts in the Northern Territory. From inquiries I have made'it appears that in connection with the railway construction work in North Australia contracts have been let for the supply of sleepers, and tliat the contractors aro employing a certain number ofaboriginals to assist in securing the sleepers. The employment of aboriginals is controlled by the Aboriginals Ordinance which provides that no person shall employ an aboriginal unless he has been granted a licence to do so by the Protector of Aboriginals of tlie district in which he is residing. The aboriginal is a free agent who may leave his employment if dissatisfied. The railway construction camp is under the supervision of a Protector of Aboriginals whose duty it is to see that the aborigines are not exploited. With regard to the general question of employing aborigines in connection with the work of supplying sleepers, it is considered desirable that they sliould be given remunerative employment so long as they are not defrauded or exploited. In view of the conditions under which aborigines may be employed in North Australia and of the fact that the railway construction camp is under the supervision of a Protector of Aboriginals, I cannot see how the aborigines employed on the work of getting sleepers can be exploited. It is unfortunate been wrongly advised. In my question I appealed to him to stop the exploitation of aboriginal labour, while white Australians were being compelled to accept relief Judge Beeby, at great expense to the taxpayers of Australia-and pense, I may remark-recently the Northern Territory with a view to determining classes of labour iu various there. After personal experience of the local conditions, and after hearing the evidence submitted, by the representative wealth Railways Commissioner, he came to the conclusion that the base rate for Darwin should be 2s. 6d. an hour, and, in the locality to which my question referred, 2s. S^d. an hour. It is well-known for many centuries the north of Australia 3lr Nelson. was populated by a dense crowd of aborigines, and that there are still many there. Notwithstanding that fact, no attempt has been made by the aborigines themselves to develop that huge tract of country. Consequently we' took the land over from them, no doubt proceeding on the assumption, not that the people were intended for the land, but that the land was intended for the people, and that, as the natives had not used it , we had a right to do so. to help them. their exploitation is not justified, even under present conditions. It is claimed that the Government is serious in its endeavour to establish a white population in the f a r flung spaces of Northern Australia. What encouragemeut is the Government giving to settlers to open up that country, when it asks them to compete with what may be accurately described as slave labour? As my argument is developed I shall prove that slave labour exists, and that the Minister has been ill advised. He admitted the existence of the condition of affairs of which I complained in my question. I shall again quote from his replyFrom inquiries I have made, it appears that, in connection with the railway construction work in North Australia, contracts have been let for the supply of sleepers, and the conthat the Minister has tractors are employing a certain number of aborigines to assist in securing the sleepers. member object to the black man being employed ? work, from the administration. a justifiable exnot be exploited.

Among the many duties i m posed upon h i m are the following: To exercise a general supervision and care over all matters affecting the welfare of the aboriginals, and to protect them against immorality, injustice, imposition, and fraud. The Minister tells us that they can start work when they like and finish when they l i k e ; but section 52 of the ordinance, in conjunction with other sections, clearly shows where they actually stand. It must be understood that they work under an agreement which is signed by the Protector of Aborigines. Section 52 statesAn aboriginal or half-caste who neglects or refuses to obey any order lawfully given under this ordinance shall be guilty of an offence against this ordinance. I shall show later that very strict conditions are imposed on the natives. further rebuttal of the Minister's statement, let me quote section 261. Any person residing within any town district,"" and desiring to employ any aboriginal within any town district, shall, in addition to obtaining a licence to employ aboriginals, enter into an agreement with the aboriginal in the prescribed form: Provided that if the Chief Protector is of the opinion that the employment is of a temporary nature, and is not likely to exceed one month in duration, he may dispense with the agreement. 2. A copy of the agreement shall be lodged with the Chief Protector, who may at any time investigate any complaint as to any alleged breach of the agreement by the employer or the aboriginal. That binds the aboriginal definitely to the work, and, if he disobeys, the Chief Protector has the necessary machinery at his disposal to deal with h i m . statesAny employer or aboriginal, who is guilty of a breach of an agreement made in pursuance of the last preceding section, shall be guilty of an offence against this ordinance. Penalty: In the case of an employer, twenty pounds; and in the case of an aboriginal, forfeiture of wages and cancellation or suspension of permit to enter the town district. The native not only loses his wages, which I shall show are returned to the emmoney in the trust fund? ployer, but he is even debarred the right of going to the town-district, which may which inquired into the administration of have been his birthplace. In other words, the Northern Territory investigated, he is banished. Yet the Minister stated among other things, the trust f u n d of the in his reply to my question that the native aborigines. Evidence was produced and was a free agent. I say that the native is embodied in the commission's' findings, bound hand and foot. definite statement that the natives are not Protector of Aborigines had sold t q the exploited condones the present system, which I shall show is one of wholesale exploitation of native labour. It is regrettable that the Minister or his advisers did not make themselves conversant w it h the actual conditions. From the regulations under this ordinance I have given a f a i r l y concise idea of the alleged freedom of the natives. Referring to applications for licences to employ aboriginals in a country district, the regulation prescribes the following for m of application :To the Protector of Aboriginals at I (We) of occupation do hereby make application for a licence to employ male or female aboriginals. I (We) undertake to pay wages at the rate of os. per week, and provide food, clothing, and tobacco for the aboriginals. InI (We) employ permanently, as specified on the back hereof, and food, clothing, and tobacco to all other aboriginals employed temporarily, and, if requested in writing by the Protector, to pay to the Protector a proportion of such wages, to be held in trust for the aboriginals, such proportion to be not less than 10s. every month. I (We) undertakeTo observe the provisions of tlie ordinance and regulations in regard to the employment of aboriginals: and especiallyTo keep a record of any native labour employed, nature of employment, and wages paid.

I (We) enclose herewith the fee of Ten shillings (10s.) for this licence. Signature of applicant. It w ill be noticed that the wages are stated at 5s. a week, and that from that sum 2s. is deducted and placed in a trust f u n d for the aborigines.

In many cases the native is employed at some distance from the centre at which the trust fund is administered, and when he leaves his employment and goes ""bush,"" the money in the trust fund in his name is returned to his employer. The Minister has alleged that the natives are free labourers. Let me draw his attention to Form5 of the regulations, which reads:Form of Agreement With Aboriginal or Half-easte.

Yet the Minister says that he is not being exploited. to "" go bush."" the inducement is there.

The Standing Order limiting the time of the speeches of members has been approved by the House, and is so framed as to prevent auy individual member from unduly taking up the time of the House.

I have listened carefully for evidence supporting the statement, but have not heard any. The .honourable member has said, not once, but on several occasions, that he represents the natives of the Northern Territory, and intends to safeguard their interests. I resent his imputation that I am Minister for a black Australia, aud throw the insult back in his teeth. I am as much concerned as lie is in safeguarding the interests of both our aboriginal and our white 'population. I have heard the honourable member say that he believes I agree with him that the Australian aboriginal should receive the benefits to which he has a right. The honourable member has said that it is impossible to develop Northern Australia without the help of the black man. several times, and I can give quotations from Hansard to prove that not only he. but other honourable members on that side of the House, have made that statement. the honourable member entitled, in the face of my denial, to repeat his statement, and to say the proof of it is contained in Hansard without producing that proof? incorrectly represented anything which the honourable member has said, the honourable member will be entitled, at the conclusion of the Minister's speech, to make a personal explanation. denies any statement that I have attributed to him, I accept his denial. If I have misrepresented anything that he or any one else on the other side of the House, has said, I am prepared to withdraw the statement. I have said that the North of Australia can only be developed, with the assistance of our Australian natives, and members know in their own hearts that that is the only way in which it can be done. The underlying reason for this motion is not a desire to prevent the exploitation of the aborigines. These charges of exploitation are made by the very people in the north who have been exploiting the Northern Territory for years.

The aborigines, in some cases, are getting sleepers themselves, without working for anybody, and are selling those sleepers to persons who have contracts. The aborigines have the right to do that. who are being employed by the sleeper getters, and these natives are. being exploited. The Minister should stick to the facts. facts. The honourable member gave no instances of exploitation. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) recently advocated the formation of a native State where the aborigines would be segreand he also knows the conditions under gated. I say that if you want to destroy our aborigines in the North, the best thing to do is to put them into a State of their own; they will then annihilate each other. It is altogether wrong to say that the white sleeper contractors are exploiting the natives. Those who are objecting to the present procedure have themselves the opportunity to cut sleepers. The Government has had the greatest difficulty in obtaining sleepers, and if the gentlemen whom the honourable member represents are prepared to supply sleepers, we will buy them and use them on the railways. Those who make the charge of exploitation have never done anything to help the natives in the North; but they would prevent, as they have often done in the past, the natives from getting a job The honourable of any kind. Certain portions of the native labour agreement have been read. It is provided in that agreement that no person shall employ an aboriginal or half-caste unless he has obtained a licence on the prescribed form. Before granting such a licence, the Protector of Aborigines must be satisfied that the applicant is a fit and proper person to employ aborigines. If the honourable member for the Northern Territory can give me one case in which the Protector of Aborigines in any part of the North has not carried out the provisions of the act, I undertake to see that that officer is removed from his position. The rate of pay which the honourable member mentioned is that provided for natives working on stations and farm lands. I do not say that any particular government was responsible for fixing that rate. It has prevailed under several governments.

Queensland the blacks may be working under au award, but that aAvard is not equal to the awards provided for white men. I freely admit that the aboriginal is not yet up to the white man's standard, and is therefore not entitled to receive the same remuneration. I listened very carefully to the remarks of both the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) and the Minister( Mr Marr). The latter failed utterly to answer any of the charges which were made. He simulated intense indignation, and stressed the desirability of uplifting the Australian aborignal. I have not been to the Northern Territory, but I have had an opportunity to read the telegram that has been received by tbe honourable member who represents that particular portion of our continent. It contains the specific charge that on the Katherine to Daly Waters railway, the aborigines are being extensively exploited. This is how the wire readsSleeper getters employing large number aborigines getting sleepers; many instances on task work. Intense exploitation of aborigines on government contracts where white labour only should be employed. At present unemployment is rife. Relief work is being started. I take that to refer to relief work for the whites who are unemployed. The telegram proceedsNumbers of workers strongly resent aborigines being exploited on government work, while they have to seek relief work. Get Minister insist white labour getting sleepers. That charge is clear and definite; but it has not been answered by the Minister. Prom my reading of the ordinance I should say that a contractor is allowed to pay as low as 5s. a week, from which he may deduct 2s. a week which has to be paid into a trust fund. The Minister has not supplied us with information which would indicate that any other wages are paid. We talk about the necessity to develop the Northern Territory; yet by the action of the Government the whites are being driven out of employment there. There is no desire on our part to deny to the blacks the right to live in the Territory or any other part of Australia; but we shall not civilize them by paying them 5s. a week, and supplying them with a little tobacco.

If the Minister had a satisfactory answer he should have cleared up the matter long ago. He has inferred that the aborigines go into the forests, cut sleepers, and sell them to the government contractors. That is not so. Their relations are embodied in the agreement, under which the contractor pays them 5s. a week for the work which they do.",19,Exploitation Of Aboriginal Labour Formalmotion Of Adjournment

He has carefully drawn a red herring across the trail. This is a most serious matter. A similar problem at one time confronted us in Queensland. The argument was ; used then that it was necessary to civilize the Kanaka and make him a better individual. Boiled down, it was found to be a case of enabling certain individuals lo make huge profits. The nation then determined that the Kanaka would be better off in his own country. own country. Australia is open to attack through the Northern Territory, and that we should not be able to offer a successful resistance own position is a fairly difficult one. if the blacks were permitted to remain there practically in their native state. The policy has been to encourage white people to develop that territory; but when the bone and sinew of the southern states have accepted the invitation to go there, they have found themselves replaced in their employment by the unfortunate blacks, who are paid a wage of os. a week, from which 2s. is deducted stances that 2s. reverts to the employer. comes sick, and is unable to cut as many sleepers as the contractor considers he should supply, that is regarded as a .breach of contract, and the amount which has been withheld from his wages goes into the pocket of the contractor. That is a. shameful practice. stntment is entirely contrary to fact. member for Bass( Mr Jackson) has endorsed the statement that frequently the 2s. a. week is returned to the employer. There is not the slightest doubt, also, that that assertion was proved to be correct by the royal commission which investigated the matter. The contractor who is unscrupulous enough to employ black labour in preference to white, will embrace every opportunity to compel the aboriginal to break his agreement, and thus swell his no grounds for own banking account. I cannot understand the Ministry sanctioning it. It is not in the best interests of either the blacks or the unfortunate whites who have migrated to the Northern Territory. Only a plucky man, who has a big heart and a strong physique, will go to those wild places, and endeavour to wring from them a living for his wife and children. Whatever honourable members opposite may decide to do, the charges that have been levelled at the Government by tbe honourable member for the Northern Territory will ring throughout Australia, aud at no distant date the exploitation of the unfortunate aboriginal may cease, and a better day dawn for him. preciate the difficulty in which honourable members of the Opposition find themselves. able members opposite are between two fires. On the humanitarian side they are seized of the necessity to do something to advance the welfare of the aborigines; whilst on the other side, pressure is being put upon them by the unions in the Northern Territory to prevent the aboriginal from earning a living. I wish that 1 could be clear in my mind that they intend to see that the black man shall be given a fair deal. This debate has furnished another reason for embarking upon the inquiry which I suggested a week or two ago. I congratulate the honourable member for the Northern Territory on the step that he has taken in having brought this matter before the House, because I am not convinced that there are not serious grounds for complaint. The time has arrived to have clearly defined the employment of white and black labour in the Northern Territory.

I was impressed with the attitude of the Minister( Mr Marr), who, in replying to the charges made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory, delivered one of the most vigorous speeches he has ever made in this Chamber. It appeared to me, however, that he was endeavouring to evade the main issue, and when his bluff was called by two very pertinent interjections, he wilted very badly. He did not attempt to reply to many of the charges made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. The question we have to answer is whether the natives of the Northern Territory are being exploited in the manner suggested. It has been said that those engaged in sleeper getting are paid 5sa week, 2s. of which is paid into a trust fund until a contract is completed. is carried out to the satisfaction convinced that tlie poor unfortunate aborigines are not paid the 2s. of their own money which has been retained.

Is not the payment of 3s. a week exploitation? it is not. membei"" for the Northern Territory did not say that the payment of that amount was attributable tp the action of the sleeper-getters. what opinion the Minister holds on this matter; but he is now faced with the fact that these poor unfortunate human, beings are being paid only 3s. a week. The position is infinitely worse when we realize that the sleepers are being used on government railway contracts. The honourable member for Bass referred to the construction of the North-South railway; but I should like to know if the Government expects that work to be done by aborigines who are to be paid only 3s. a week? The honourable member also referred to the natives as men of fine stature but with a child's mind. That is the material the exploiters are always seeking. , should not blame me. not accuse the honourable member of favouring such a system. The Minister said that natives are engaged on menial work; but I can conceive of no occupation in the Northern Territory or anywhere else that is not worth more than 3s. a week. The Minister also stated that the Northern Territory can be developed only with the assistance of native labour. That is a point that I am not prepared to affirm or dispute; but if colored labour Eveni f the work is essential to its development, the natives should be permitted to work of the contractor I am under the conditions enjoyed by white men. employed under such conditions. efficient or slow workers are provided for in our Arbitration Court awards, .and the Government should see that these men are paid a reasonable rate even if their work is not up to standard of that of the white man.

This is a national work, as the security of Australia depends largely upon the extent to which the Northern Territory is settled. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to develop the Northern Territory, but it should not depend upon the assistance of aborigines who are paid only 3s. a week, The Minister referred to the industrial conditions at Darwin and to the demands made by the workers' there.

Those who bave invested money in the Northern Territory, and who are employing labour, bave done so with the sole intention of making profits, and not with the idea of developing the country. If the white workers there are sufficiently well organized to demand wages and conditions which the employers think unreasonable, the employers should get out of the Territory. pastoralists in the Northern Territory who are holding huge tracts of country say that they cannot carry on profitably because of the ruling labour conditions. That is a stupid argument, because they are not forced to remain. If they cannot pay their workmen decent wages, the country is better without them. Africa in order to obtain cheap labour. return to Northern Australia to-morrow if they could be sure of a similar supply of cheap labour there. Queensland there is one white man to twenty aborigines. to hear the Minister say that while it was a fair thing that the aborigines should enjoy some of the good things of life, they were given the opportunity to do so on a wage of 3s. a week. The Minister's attitude indicated that he approved of the payment of that wage. does not approve of the prevailing conditions, why did he attempt so vigorously to justify them ? wrong. sult of this debate will be that the people of Australia will indicate, in an unmistakable way, their desire to have these objectionable conditions remedied. Something has been said about the attitude of former Commonwealth Labour Governments on this matter, but I point out that . until the Northern Territory had direct representation in this Parliament, governments, as well as honourable members generally, had very little information about the conditions that existed there. Since the honourable member for the Northern Territory has been a member of this Parliament he has been able on many occasions to inform us of evils there that required remedies, and I trust that he will Some continue to bring under our notice direct information of conditions which should not be allowed to prevail. Honourable members should consider this matter in the spirit in which it has been introduced. I trust that we shall do all in our power to treat our aborigines generously as well as justly. We should do so, for the good name of our country. Minister for Home and Territories altogether failed to make an effective reply to the charges of the honourable member for the Northern Territory. He started to speak at an express rate, and I do not know for how long he would have mainone station in tained the speed if the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning) had not made an injudicious remark. A fact that emerges quite clearly from this discussion is that government by ordinance is quite unsatisfactory. The illustration of the bicycle transaction which the honourable member for the Northern Territory gave is proof positive on that point. The more closely settled our outback areas become the more clearly are we able to observe the failure of control by ordinance. I was in New Guinea recently, and had brought home to me there how unsatisfactory some of our existin/j administrative methods are I had the opportunity of perusing the report of a conference that was held there some time ago. AlthoughI understood that the Minister for Home and Territories would table a copy of the report as soon as it was available, I took the precaution to make a few extracts from it. I propose to quote these, for they concern cases which may well be compared with those which the honourable member for the Northern Territory has mentioned to-day, though his deal with Australian aborigines, while mine concern the natives of",23,Exploitation Of Aboriginal Labour Formalmotion Of Adjournment

125,Mr Hill,"On Thursday, 27th Octo( Mr Coleman) asked me the following questions:Isi t a fact, that owing to the failure of the central administration of the War Service Homes Commission to authorize the employment of additional staff, the employees of the New South Wales branch are being overworked? In addition to much overtime, are the employees compelled to take work home to enable them to overtake arrears, for which they receive no remuneration ? Has the Commonwealth Medical Officer for New South South Wales made a report to the Chief Medical Officer of the Commonwealth on these speeding-up methods, directing attention to several break-downs which are attributed to this cause? W ill the Minister for Works and Railways ask the Public Service Board to conduct an inquiry into the working conditions of this department? I now have pleasure in f u r n is h in g the f o l l o w in g replies to the questions:1. No. There was a very large increase of applications in May, June, July, August, and September, and requests from applicants for additional advances following the 1927 amendment of the War Service Homes Aet. was only a temporary phase, and after inquiries, it was decided that extra staff was not necessary. with in the order of priority, and no officer is required to complete more than a fair day's work, the hours of duty being from 9 a.m. to 4.45 p.m., with one hour for lunch, and 9 a.m. until noon on Saturdays. Having regard to the hours of duty in business houses and industries generally, it is not considered that those in the commission are unduly long. 2. During the year 49 officers worked an average of 44 hours overtime each-a n average per officer of 44 hours per month. Officers receiving over £450 per annum are not entitled to overtime. No officer has been asked to take work home. It has been found that several officers have acted in this way, the reason being that the matters so dealt with were somewhat difficult, and they preferred to handle them in the quietude of their homes. This has only happened in the case of several senior officers. 3. Not that I am aware of. I should also say that speeding-up methods have not been adopted in the New South Wales branch, and this may be gauged from the fact that the administrative costs of the New South Wales branch are greater in proportion than those of the Queensland branch. been examined by the Commonwealth Medical Officer at the request of the commission. In one case the illness was neurasthenia, and before its onset the officer stated that he had not properly recovered from influenza and was excessively worried over certain private matters. In two cases the illness was debility; in another furunculosis, and in the other hyperpriesis and nerve fatigue. sidered that official duties were responsible for these illnesses. 4. No. The officers employed are granted eighteen days' recreation leave each year and only in-seven cases will 1927 leave not be taken this year. The leave in these latter instances should be disposed of early in 1928.

Yesterday the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) asked me the following questions:1. What is the reason for charging motor registration and licence fees in the Federal Territory similar to those prevailing in the States, when there is sueh a vast difference between the area of the Territory as compared with that of any State? 2. W ill he review these rates with a view to making substantial reductions? I have now received the following information from the commission:1 and 2. The charges in respect to motor registration in the Federal Capital Territory are ou a similar basis to those in force in New South Wales, but are £1 per vehicle less. It is uot considered that "" area"" affords a satisfactory basis of comparison. It is considered that motorists in the Federal Capital Territory enjoy facilities equal to those in the various States, and that they, therefore, suffer no hardship which would justify making any further reduction in fees, particularly as the number of motorists in the Territory is considerably less than in any State. The cost of providing services in the Federal Capital Territory is at least as great as in the States, and the roads more than favourably compare with those in many parts of Australia where motorists are required to pay liigher fees.",28,Payments To States

153,Mr Lacey (Grey) [2.39],"The subcame to an agreement, afterwards termed the Bruce-Gunn agreement, which provided for the construction of a railway known as the north-south line, to connect Port Augusta and Alice SpringsIt also provided for the project now before the House. The Railways Acceptance Bill passed through this chamber with very little discussion. After the Minister for Works and Railways had made his second-reading speech, I followed him, and the matter was further debated by the honourable member for Swan( Mr open negotiations with the South AusGregory), the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates), the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green), the honourable member for Angas( Mr Parsons), and the honourable member for Boothby reading was carried on the voices, and the bill went through the committee stage without discussion, the third reading being agreed to immediately. Thus the project received the unanimous support of the House. Since it accepted the agreement in the first instance, one can only assume that it is now prepared to carry it out. Therefore, the measure should receive a speedy passage. During the previous discussion at least one honourable member mentioned that it might be necessary to inquire into the third-rail I consider that the South Australian project. No third-rail section of considerable length is to be found in any part of Australia. ment set out where the line was to start and end, and other matters relating to the productivity of the country to be served were agreed upon. It was then necessary to refer the proposal to the Public Works Committee, of which I have the honour to be a member. The committee pays careful attention to all matters placed before it; but because of the technical in this particular case, special attention the committee report, I voted for an amendment submitted by the honourable member for Swan, who was then a member of the committeeThat amendment provided that the 5 ft. 3 iu. gauge from Salisbury to Red Hill should be continued as far as Port Pirie, a break of gauge station established there and the 4 ft. 8^ in. gauge constructed from that point to Port Augusta. that time. I considered that it would be Mr Lacey. possible to do something to bring about the unification of the gauges. When this railway project was being investigated by the Public Works Committee, the branch lines from Hamley Bridge to Balaklava and thence to Port Wakefield, and from Brinkworth to Snowtown and thence to Wallaroo were of 3 f t . 6 in. gauge. Those lines have now been converted to the 5 f t . 3 in. gauge. When the honourable member for Swan. framed his amendment his idea, no doubt, was to tralian Government with a view to converting the railway from RedH ill to Port Pirie and the two branch lines to the 4 f t . Si in. gauge. By that means the railways on the western side of South The second Australia would have been of uniform gauge. It is, however, too late to open up negotiations with a view to doing away with the third-rail project, because the South Australian railways which Were of the 3 f t . 6^-in. gauge have beeu converted to the 5 f t . 3-in. gauge, and, if the 4 f t . S^-in. gauge went through from Salisbury to RedH ill alone it would mean a break of gauge at every junction on the RedH ill to Port Augusta line. That, of course, would not be in the interests of South Australia. Government has not been fair to the Commonwealth Government so far as the The agreeconversion of gauges is concerned. In 1921 the Prime Minister and State Premiers conferred respecting the unification of our railway gauges. The following resolution was arrived atThe Commonwealth and the Premiers of the States agree to appoint a Railway Commission and affirm that the Ministers for Railways of New South Wales, Victoria and the Commonwealth shall select the two members problems that arose of the commission who are to be appointed from outside. Tho Commonwealth and the States agree to abide by the decision of this was given to it. When tribunal. The Commonwealth to bear onewas completing its fifth of the total cost, and four-fifths to be borne by the five States concerned on a per capita basis. The commission was appointed, and in November, 1921, its report was considered at a conference of Premiers with the Prime Minister in Melbourne, when it was resolvedThat the adoption of a uniform gauge is At in the opinion of tliis conference essential to the development and safety of the Commonwealth. That the commission's recommendation of a 4 f t . 8*-in. gauge is accepted. The",34,Portaugusta To Redhil L Railway Bill Second Reading

That steps shall be at once taken by the Premiers of all States to consult their Governments with regard to the said agreement and the financial obligations of the parties thereunder, and that the conclusions arrived at shall be communicated to and considered at a further conference in January. 1922. That further conference* was held in Melbourne, but no decision was arrived at. considering the conversion of a section of its railways from 3 f t . 6 in. to 5 f t . 3 in., should have adopted the 4 f t . 8-J-in. gauge, and then there would have been no necessity for a third rail as is proposed under the bill. I voted for the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan, not because I feared that there would be any element of danger in the adoption of the third rail principle. I do not think that any member of the Public Works Committee who took part in the inquiry considered the third rail to be unsafe. dence in favour of the third rail overweighed that in opposition to it. I shall refrain from quoting the evidence of Commonwealth ofncials, because it may be said that their opinions would be biased. I shall quote first the evidence of Mr Webb, the Chief Railways Commissioner of South Australia. little biased? newspaper report published the other day showed that he had a distinct bias the other way, so that I shall be safe in quoting his evidence. He saidI was associated with a Colorado railway in the TJnited Sates of America for twenty years, and I know that we had no difficulty with mixed gauges in that system. They proved to be entirely practical and safe, and presented no complications. Denver City, which is a larger railway centre than any city in Australia, has mixed gauges. Wo found it practicable to do all our railway work with mixed gauges there. Mr Webb was dealing, not with the thirdrail principle, but with four rails on one permanent way. He also stated that some of the carriages of a train were of different gauges, and yet no accidents occurred. His evidence continuedWith 80 lb. rails on this section we get an average speed of 26 miles an hour. This speed could be increased with larger locomotives. There would be no necessity to limi t the speed on the third rail. There are 21 station stopping places between Adelaide and RedH ill . The third rail would offer no complications in station yards. When we first discussed the third-rail proposal between RedH ill and Adelaide, we thought it might be necessary, in order to avoid complications, to run around certain stations, but we are now in a position to say positively that there w ill be no additional risk and no mechanical difficulties by running through the stations. . . . In Colorado we had a large mileage of two mixed South Australia, when gauges, and over a small mileage we worked even three gauges on one set of sleepers, namely, 2 f t . , 3 f t . , and 4 f t . Sii n . lines. In some cases we had three gauges in station yards. They were al l worked without additional risk, but necessarily they were more expensive to maintain. I regard the third rail as an expedient to meet such problems as we have ih Australia, but every case should be considered on its merits. I should have no hesitation in recommending the third rail in certain circumstances, because I know from experience that it does not mean additional risk. Mr JamesM c G u i r e , SouthA u s t r a l i a n R a i l w a y s Commissioner, gave the f o l l o w in g evidenceThe eviThe additional cost of maintenance of a mixed gauge line would not be great. With the third r a i l in operation there would be no difficulty with the interlocking gear, or any additional risk of derailment. Whether a third rail is used or not, it is always easy to derail a train deliberately. There is nothing in connection with the third rail which would tend to cause more derailments. There is no more danger of sand d r if t with a third r a i l than there is now where the guard rail'is used. be a We have many miles of guard rail in South Australia, and sometimes it is within two inches of main rail. We have experienced no special trouble from sand drifts because of the existence of the guard rail. It is all a matter maintenance. We have had two or three nasty smashes because of debris falling off trains and causing derailments. I have known of a bag of chaff causing a derailment. That risk would not be greater with a third rail. In my opinion the third rail would neither increase nor decrease the danger of derailment. A t any time material falling from a truck constitutes a risk. I am satisfied that the risk is not increased by the third rail. that is placed adjacent to another rail, generally at a curve,for the purpose of making the flange of the wheels take the proper course.

When the honourable the Minister was introducing this bill, he pointed out the very many advantages that would accrue from the building of this line, but as there seems to be some opposition to the proposal at the present time, I shall enumerate some of the benefits as pointed out to the commission(1) It would reduce by about 70 miles tbe length of the journey between Adelaide and Port Augusta, and the time occupied from eleven and a half hours to six and a half hours. (2) It would permit of passengers and loading being conveyed direct from Adelaide to Kalgoorlie, obviating the delay and expense at present incurred in transhipment at Terowie and Port Augusta. (3) l t would curtail by eight and a half to nine and a half hours the time at present occupied in the train journev from Adelaide to Perth. (4) It would enable live-stock from the trans-Australian railway to be conveyed from point of loading to market in the same vehicles. (5) It would permit of live stock being conway, because the passengers have bought ducted from Port Augusta to Dry Creek in ten to twelve hours. elapse between the arrival of live-stock at Port Augusta and time of arrival at Dry Creek. (0) It would provide a line ou which on each train 85 per cent, more loading could be carried from. Port Augusta, and 54 per cent, to Port Augusta. (7) It would accelerate the mail service to and from Western Australia; the outward English mail would leave Melbourne and Adelaide later, and the inward English mail would be delivered in Adelaide on Fridays instead of Saturdays, and would arrive iu sufficient time in Melbourne to euable delivery to be effected on tlie first round on Saturday morning instead of Monday. (8) It would be sufficiently revenue producing to at once pay working expenses, and a considerable portion, if not the whole, of the interest. (9) It would permit of the quotation of a through rate to Adelaide for live-stock from the trans-Australian and the railway to Alice Springs, instead of being compelled to adopt the South Australian rate for portion of tlie distance. The last point raised, that of the m in i mum rates, is a burning question at the present time. the commission was that it would increase the revenue of the trans-Australian railway by approximately £35,000, due to the stimulation of through traffic. World The obvious remedy, of tourists, who have travelled over the trans-Australian railway, always speak eulogistically of the journey between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. Only recently I did the trip myself, and coming back, I met a much-travelled gentleman with whom I discussed the subject of railway facilities. I said that I considered the trans-Australian train was the best in the Commonwealth. He replied that it was not only the best in the Commonwealth, but was, in his opinion, the best in the world. I should also like to mention something that happened on the same trip. We arrived at Port Augusta on Sunday morning. A bus runs from Port Augusta to Adelaide every morning, and, notwithstanding the fact that the passengers had through tickets from Perth to Adelaide, some of them got off at Port Augusta, and went by bus to Adelaide. number of people who do the same thing. tickets through to Adelaide, but it is At present 25 hours a poor advertisement for our rail ways. While passengers are waiting at Port Augustaf or transhipment, it would be possible, during those two and a half hours, to get right down past RedH ill . The construction of this line would "" boost"" the railway to such tin extent that the revenue would increase greatly, because of the advertisement given to the system, and the increased facilities afforded to the public. Those who have advocated the construction of this line have never claimed that it would lead to the development of the country through which it would pass. They have based their advocacy on other grounds. But I maintain that it w ill have an effect upon the development of the country which it w ill traverse. On the 19th October last, the Adelaide Advertiser published what was allegedly an interview with Mr W. A. Webb, Commissioner of Railwaysi n that State. Immediately it was brought to my notice I submitted to the Prime Another reason given to Minister a question relating to it , and received a satisfactory reply.

It readsThe Railways Commissioner ( Mr W. A .

Among his objections are the following:Such construction would not develop one additional acre of land, and would be a needless duplication of existing rail facilities. The present business interchanged at Port Augusta, both passenger and freight, is so small there cannot be found any business or economic reason for the expenditure of the money required. It would take a very large volume of freight traffic to j u s t i fy the neces28 miles. The line would take the wheat from sary expenditure, and the following statement, showing total tonnage, east and west, through Port Augusta, shows the total absence of any reason for the new construction:1920-21 192122 1922-23 192324 1924-25 1925-26 1926-27 Some time ago, Mr ""Webb, as I have already mentioned, gave evidence before the Commonwealth Public Works Committee. Only the other day I heard an honourable member of this House say that Mr Webb had not given his approval to the building of this railway. Here is his sworn evidence on the point: My approval was sought concerning the sheep, and a greater number of people general terms of the agreement, butnot speciwill be settled on the land. Giving evifically as to its details. Generally speaking, dence at Port Pirie a representative of it meets with my approval, although I do not think that South Australia w ill gain very shipping interests said that wheat was much from it .

The users of the Commonwealth railway will gain very much by this concession. Further on he statedThe proposed line may take some live stock with the necessity to cart wheat up to a revenue, and, perhaps, a little passenger busidistance of 22 miles, they will engage ih"" ness from tlie State railway system.

According to the newspaper report, he Mr R. J. Davidson was as follows:condemned the railway; yet in his evidence before the committee he approved between Mr Lacey. of its construction, and said that no difficulties would arise because of it. One cannot escape the conclusion that he has been misreported by the press. His sworn evidence is the best guide that we could have in coming to a decision on this matter. I claim that the facilities which will be provided will have a tendency to promote closer settlement along the portion of the route that is in South Australia. Mr Coffey, of Lake View, a large landholder and a most prosperous farmer in that district, in evidence before the Public Works Committee, saidThe distance from RedH ill to Wallaroo is 56 miles, and from RedH ill to Port Piriei t is at least half the distance between Port Pirie and Wallaroo, to Port Pirie as the shipping port.

It is well known that the nearer you are to a. port the better is the price you obtain for your produce. In addition to that advantage, the extra facilities will-induce settlers to plant wheat instead of to graze sidings were placed in the most convenient places. Honourable members can appreciate the fact that if farmers are faced The The of the best wheat-growing centres iu South Australia. The evidence given by There is a good number of settlers on land' the 3-chain road and the coast. For the last 40 years we have had to cart our produce to Port Pirie, in some instances a distance of 18 or 20 miles. The roads are fairly good. My place is in Wandearah West, 18 miles from Port Pirie. I am on the 3-chain road near Butler's Bridge, and about 10 miles from the surveyed route. I would cart my produce to the railway. At present it takes me two days to go to Port Pirie and return. I could do a trip a day to the railway line. A t a later stage, he saidThere is a good deal of settlement further out south and south-west of my place. All those people are interested in this proposal. Farmers from the Hundred of Mundoora would cart to the line. I should like honourable members to note particularly the following quotation from the evidence of the same gentleman:We would use tlie railway in preference to motor lorries for the cartage of our produce. About 100,000 bags of wheat were produced here last year, as well as a fair number of cattle and sheep. Is tliere any district in Australia whose production equals that but which does not possess greater facilities for sending produce to market than haulage over 22 miles of road? The same witness also statedI t costs me from Is. to Is. 2d. a bag to cart farmer I would say that if I were 12 miles my wheat to Port Pirie.

This w ill be only the second failure that has been experienced by the district. That takes us as f a r as Port Pirie, up to which the 5 f t . 3 in . gauge w ill be constructed. On the other side of Port Pirie, where the gauge w ill be 4 f t . 8$ in., the country for the first 26 to 30 miles consists of good wheat-growing land. The portion of the country to be served by the proposed railway is in the Hundred of Baroota. I am f u l l y conversant with the country along the proposed route, as I live in the locality, and have been over it on many occasions. Mr. H ill a m, who lives 18 miles north of Port Germein, which is 18 miles by road from Port Pirie, and 26 miles by rail , in giving evidence before the Public ""Works Committee saidWheat is carted 18 miles to Port Germein from the north and east, and from the south for a distance of about 7 miles. As a practical from Port Germein, and if there were a railway siding within 4 miles, I would send my wheat over the line.

162,Mr Scullin,Has it a good rain,40,Portaugusta To Redhil L Railway Bill Second Reading
163,Mr Lacey,"Yes. It is one of therecently that a technical difficulty is likely to prevent the construction of the line. If that is the case it is not due to the terms of the agreement entered into between the Premier of South Australia and the Prime Minister. The clause in the schedule of the Railway Agreement Act of 1926 relating to the construction of this line reads{d) In approving and consenting to the said railway from Port Augusta to Red Hill the State may if it thinks fit provide that sueh approval and consent sliall lapse and be of no effect if the construction of that railway is not commenced by the Commonwealth within a period to be specified by the Premier of tlie State not being less than three years from the date of such approval and consent. If construction is started within three years. South Australia can raise no objection. If there is any technical difficulty it is not due to the terms of the agreement to which 1 have referred, and which the South Australian Parliament ratified shortly after it had been adopted, by this Parliament. proposed route . is, in my opinion, not altogether the best that could be obtained. I have always been of the opinion that on approaching Port Pirie the railway should extend a Httle to . the westward, and thus avoid dividing many agricultural farms in the locality. I do not stress the point to the extent of holding up the bill now, but merely mention it, so that the Minister may give the matter consideration. The Public Works Committee, as I have already said, obtained, valuable evidence from Mr Wilkin, who is an expert on the third-rail system. The members of the committee regard Mr Wilkin as an authority who can give the Commonwealth valuable ndvice. A paragraph in the report of the committee on this phase of the project readsDuring the progress of its investigations, the committee took evidence from Mr Charles Wilkin, formerly Interlocking Engineer in the New South Wales Railway Department, and examined models submitted by him for dealing with break of gauge between 4 f t . Si in. and 5 f t . 3-in. railway tracks. Tlie committee was much impressed with the system described, and recommends that careful cpnsideration be given to this scheme before deciding on the system of points and crossings to be adopted. I bring that under the notice of the Minister in the hope that his department will confer with Mr Wilkin, who, since Mr Laoey. he has retired from the service, has given the third-rail system very close attention. The Works and Railways Department should also negotiate with tbe Western Australian Government and endeavour to facilitate the conversion of the gauge of the railway from Perth to Kalgoorlie to that of the East-West line. TJhder an agreement, which has since lapsed, that work should have been undertaken on the completion of the East-West railway. Nothing, however, has been done, and the passengers travelling from Perth to the East, and vice versa, incur considerable inconvenience owing to the break of gauge at Kalgoorlie. I also direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that although second class sleeping accommodation is provided on the East-West line tralian section, too. modation is not provided between AdeThe laide and Melbourne. There should not be any hostility between the Commonwealth and State railway authorities in this matter. The conditions throughout such a long journey should be uniform. I trust the Minister for Works and Railways will negotiate with the Victorian *Railways Commissioners with a view to second class sleeping accommodation being provided between Adelaide and Melbourne. This convenience is provided on the Commonwealth railways between Kalgoorlie ancl Port Augusta, but not between Quorn and Oodnadatta. From time to time money is voted for ballasting the East-West line, and each year a. small section is completed; but. as the line will eventually be ballasted for its full length, it seems false economy to do the work in sections. When the work is completed trains will be able io travel faster, and with the added facilities provided in this bill it may then be necessary to run a train each day instead of three trains a week as at present. taken fewer stations would be required and the housing accommodation on the plains would be greatly improved. important phase of the question, and one which I have not time to deal with .now.

Immediate attention should be given to the laying of a third rail from Adelaide to Bed Hill, as provided for in this bill, and that work could be started very soon. Tb> labour position in South Australia is at present very acute, and if any relief can be given in the direction suggested a large number of deserving men in South Australia will benefit. I trust this proposal will be discussed on its merits, and that the Minister will give serious consideration to the points I have raised. consider it obligatory upon me to commence my speech on this important proposal at this juncture, as the honourable member for Grey( Mr Lacey) has, unwittingly, I think, done an injustice to an important officer in the South Australian Public Service. I refer to the Chief Commissioner of Bailways in that State( Mr Webb), who, I submit, was not asked by the Labour Government in South Australia to make a report, and, to put it bluntly, was not allowed to do so. Mr Webb was not asked by the South Australian Labour Government to report upon tbe proposal which has now become the subject of an agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments. of it. he do so. He was not asked to express his opinion upon it. I have a document of six pages from which I shall quote to establish my assertion. I do not know whether an instance of this kind has ever before occurred in South Australia or elsewhere. I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. Leave granted; debate adjourned.
