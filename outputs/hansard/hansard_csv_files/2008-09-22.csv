Over the two days, more than 3,000 spectators watched five matches involving 250 young football players. The event took place at EFTel Oval, the home of the Perth Demons football club, and involved players ranging from the under-12 to under-17 level. As a director of junior development for Perth Football Club, I was particularly pleased to attend and be involved in the awards presentation. The quality of the games played over the weekend was exceptional and it was good to see such close competition between the teams. The last game of the weekend was between Victoria Park and South Perth under-17s and was decided by a point. This year’s final series included teams from Redcliffe, Thornlie, Queens Park and Maddington. Professor Matthew Tonts of the University of Western Australia argues that sport has a vital role to play in generating social capital and building local communities. This was clearly demonstrated by the events of the weekend, where local families from all sections of the community came together to generate a carnival atmosphere. Junior sports in my electorate in WA were ignored for eight years by the state Labor government, and many clubs need help to continue the growth of community oriented sports. Today the Rudd government announced yet another review by an independent expert panel that will spend months preparing its sports funding review. I do not see one member of the panel from grassroots junior sport, which I feel will mean that nothing will be achieved to meet the real needs of junior sport. Junior sport is much too important to the fabric of this nation to send to a committee. Braddon Electorate: Sports spring in the air, I am reminded of all the sports that were going on in my electorate during the winter. I mention in particular soccer, netball and basketball-and I am still an administrator of my basketball club. There are also Aussie rules football leagues and associations, hockey and all the myriad school sports. I want to thank all those that have been involved in the administration of these sports. I want to thank the sponsors, without whom a lot of these could not take place, as well as the parents and families of those that participated. I thank them for their support. There are also a huge number of volunteers and officials who help put these sports on the road and who help to contribute to a much healthier society. I now look forward to the summer and particularly, in my beautiful region of Tassie, surflifesaving, swimming, athletics, equestrian events, cricket and softball, just to name a few. We look forward to this summer sporting period. As part of that, I would like to congratulate this government, which is soon to introduce the local sporting champions program, which is designed to help young people get to nationally recognised events and will help with their health and recreation future.

This highway is the main arterial route between Brisbane and Darwin and it goes right through the Surat coal basin. We have seen unprecedented development in this resource area. Of course, the resources and the development of these resources are very important because of the revenue and the export income that they bring to this nation. But that process and that development have been slowed down because of the failure of the government to bring forward funding, as the coalition had promised prior to the last federal election. I learnt only in the last few days that the Queensland Department of Main Roads has decided to reduce the speed limit on the section of the Warrego Highway west of Dulacca to 80 kilometres an hour. Previously this was up to 110 kilometres an hour. That is clearly an indication of the deterioration of this road that has occurred with the development of this coal seam and methane gas industry and the resulting increase in traffic. I am calling on this federal government. The minister must act because, if he does not, he is going to slow down the development of this coal seam and methane gas industry and the coal industry development. It is going to impact on our economy and it is going to impact on exports-and if there is one thing we need in this financial crisis it is to ensure that we have infrastructure spending in Australia. (Time expired) International Day of Peace Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (6.43 pm)-In September 2001 the United Nations General Assembly declared that the International Day of Peace should be observed annually on 21 September, as a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence. The UN Secretary-General has noted that observance of this day would provide a pause for reflection by the international community on the threats and challenges we face, and relieve those involved in violent conflict of the daily burden of fear. During my time with the United Nations, one of the things that disgusted me most was witnessing the use of cluster bombs-bombs that open in midair, dropping hundreds of smaller bombs. Many of these bombs do not explode on impact but remain in trees and on land as a deadly legacy, killing and maiming civilians, including children, years into the future. The government’s continued strong support for the international treaty to ban cluster bombs, which I understand will be ready for signing by the end of the year, will be an important contribution to reducing global violence. I note that my predecessor in the electorate of Fremantle, Dr Carmen Lawrence, moved a motion on 11 September 2006 recognising the International Day of Peace. In her speech, Dr Lawrence quoted former US President Dwight Eisenhower, and I think it is worth reiterating those words today: Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. The world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Statements By Members

I implore the Rudd Labor government to do something for the pensioners of my electorate. This Labor government insists that it is deeply sympathetic and deeply empathetic, but it will not do anything until another review, another summit or another committee concludes its inquiries. The Howard government had a proud track record of delivering constantly for the pensioners of Australia. We know that single pensioners are $72.80 per week better off as a result of the Howard government’s policies. In particular, we know that when Kevin Rudd went the last election he claimed that, if elected, he would bring down grocery prices and petrol prices. But, in reality, these have increased significantly. They have skyrocketed while this Labor government remains paralysed and says that its way forward is to simply keep watching what is going on. It is not good enough. The coalition has a concrete proposal. We ask the Labor Party to move beyond the spin and the rhetoric and get behind the coalition’s proposal to increase by $30 the single pensioner payment. We know the government can afford it. They are sitting on a $22 billion surplus. So it is time that the Labor government did something to help those Australians who deserve support-those 10,000 or so in my electorate who are looking for support.

While he did not live in my electorate, the member for Maranoa, Bruce Scott, wishes to be associated with these words spoken in his honour. Sadly, Terry Parer died on Saturday, 20 September. He was the much loved husband of Jenny, who used to be a Delahunty, a famous chemist family in Brisbane. Terry Parer was a chemist in the town of St George for many, many years. Terry was the father of six children, the youngest being Mark, then Bernard, Sophie, Simon, Phillip and Margie. Terry was a great inspiration for me growing up in a family without a dad. He was, as I said, a chemist in the town but was also a great worker for the community. He was a great worker in the Catholic Church. Many of Terry’s kids were in the same classes at school as some of my family. He also inspired me to take up running at a young age, because he took up marathon running at a very old age.

As usual, my electorate is the desirable tourist destination for thousands of Victorians and thousands of people from interstate and overseas. The front area from Brighton to Port Melbourne now resembles the best of international seasides around the world; I would compare it with Venice Beach in California. With the establishment of the promenade, we have a wonderful area which will be an extra attraction for the people of Victoria. I want to particularly congratulate the brilliant artists and people from the artistic sections of the Port Phillip Council for the extraordinary scale presentation of the planets. There was a 350-kilogram ball at the lighthouse and, all the way from Port Melbourne, there was a walk to Neptune or Pluto, with a representation in a few kilograms. I want to congratulate the Port Phillip Council, the artists and everyone involved in the splendid opening of the promenade and the artistic presentation of the planets. Solar Energy Coomera Youth Community Centre in the electorate of Fadden, which is the fastest-growing electorate in the nation. She asked me a very pertinent question with respect to her centre and, indeed, the other centres in the area. The question was: why aren’t we eligible for the solar energy conversion funding that is available for schools? I did some research and you can imagine my surprise when the answer from the government was simply: ‘We didn’t consider youth centres.’ Despite the rhetoric, the Rudd government has fallen down on what should be a vital part of Australia’s alternative energy strategy. Since elected, the Rudd government has scrapped the solar panel rebate for households earning over $100,000. In the House, Minister Garrett explained that the rebate program was ‘overheating’. Perhaps that is a code word for: ‘Far too many people wanted it for a consciousness about the environment and we thought, “Well, we can’t possibly have that.”’ The bottom line for the Rudd government is that far too many indeed want to have the rebate. We should encourage them. We should provide the money for youth centres in the area to allow them to make use of alternative energies. If the government truly believes that alternative energy could be part of the government’s strategy to reduce carbon emissions, it should look to expand the number of people and organisations that can take advantage of such schemes.

WhilstI was at the bowling club they showed me the work they have undertaken to ensure that all of the water which falls on the greens, the buildings and the car park is collected and then reused by the club. The work that has been carried out is very, very extensive. Indeed, it is a credit to the board of management of the Hope Valley Bowling and Community Club because, unlike too many others in the community who spend an incredible amount of time talking about the need to conserve water and reuse rainwater, this is a club that have actually done what needs to be done. They did it with the assistance of the federal government and a grant for $47,000 or $48,000, which certainly helped. The local council, the Tea Tree Gully Council, equally assisted. What is incredible about this project is that no water will leave the premises-and it is a fairly large site. This gives the club the ability to collect up to 170,000 litres of water at any one time. Obviously, as they use it, they will replenish it with water that they collect. It is a credit to them and it is a model that I believe other organisations ought to be following.

Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (6.55 pm)-Crosswalk attendants-we see them every day but they are invisible. They guarantee the safety of our children but we fail to see them beyond stopping for an anonymous flag. They safeguard our children every day but we do not really see them at all. What drives these people to this onerous task? They choose-and it is not just a choice but a commitment-to contribute their time to ensure the safety of Australian children. In return for a low wage, they turn up every day to make sure our children are safe. They launder their uniforms and use their own cars to get to work. It is 40 degrees in the shade and they are working. It is freezing cold and pouring with rain but still they are working. They are among the many heroes in our society, but how do we thank them? Do we cheer their contribution to society? No. We hit them with punitive taxes. Senior citizens-and that is what most of them are-who put up their hand to aid the society they helped create just get a kick in the teeth. For such charitable acts, we penalise these people already left on a pension which even the Prime Minister says he could not live on. We are putting the boot into these people who simply want to help. They are just an example of the utter contempt with which the government treats our senior citizens. With the baby boomers entering retirement, we have a huge pool of skills, but instead of tapping it the government seeks only to tap its income. What is the incentive to contribute when the small amount you earn results in a reduction in an already insufficient pension? Retirees who simply want to help are penalised. They must pay for the privilege of contributing MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Statements By Members

184,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"Order! It being 6.55 pm, in accordance withto society. Something has gone very wrong when we as a nation tell our senior citizens that we do not want their help, that we want to stick them out back till their time comes. There should be no penalty for wanting to contribute to society. There should be no penalty for being an older Australian. But the sad fact is, under the current government, being an older Australian marks you out for abuse at the hands of the state. With a pension that no-one could realistically expect to live on, with benefits that are steadily being eroded, our senior citizens are truly hurting. Next year, even those who had the foresight and capacity to plan for their retirement will feel the wrath of an uncaring government. Superannuation payments will be treated as income for the first time, meaning that many self-funded retirees will miss out on basic benefits such as subsidised medicine. I am not talking about ultrawealthy seniors of the sort who move in the Prime Minister’s circle. These are everyday people who are just getting by. They get a pittance from the country they helped to build, they get hit for expenses they have been told were covered and, when they have the temerity to try to contribute further to society, they are forced to hand over the petty sums they earn. This is not government; it is highway robbery. We must ask ourselves who in society is most deserving. Can anyone say that the elderly do not warrant our respect and gratitude? Why then does the government seek to penalise them for simply getting old? Rather than forcing people who have already made decades of contribution to the wealth of this country do full-time work, perhaps we should be looking at a variety of solutions to help those mostly older Australians to remain active and engaged in the workforce without expecting them to work full time. But this requires a caring and sensible approach. The challenge I lay down to this government is to understand the dedication and commitment of these Australians and make the necessary changes to enable them to continue making a valuable contribution to our society without being unfairly financially penalised. Is this government up to such a challenge? My constituents and I sincerely hope so. I urge all members to support this motion to deliver some justice to those who created the great society we all live in today. Ms HALL (Shortland) (6.59 pm)-I must say that I have never heard such hypocrisy in my entire life. The member for Tangney stands up, wrings his hands and makes the statements that he has just made, and yet he was in a government that was in power in Australia from 1996 to 2007 and that sat on its hands and did absolutely nothing. When during that time did he stand up and make a speech like this for the pensioners of his area? And he does not even stay to listen to the whole of the debate; he is leaving. Most members who move a private member’s motion will stay to hear what contributions are made by the other members. Like the opposition’s proposal to lift the rate of the single age pension, this motion ignores carers, people on the disability support pension and widows of veterans. All of these pensions are subject to taper rates. Once again, the member is selectively choosing what to discuss. He must have had some sort of brain explosion the other day when a constituent came to see him and raised this issue. Prior to that, it seems to me that he was totally unaware of it. We on this side of the House are aware of these types of issues. We were aware of them when the opposition was in government. They are not something new. There are now 732,000 DSP recipients, 133,000 carer payment recipients, 35,000 wife and widow pensioners, 120,000 DVA service pensioners and 96,000 DVA partners. Where were these mentioned in the member for Tangney’s contribution to the debate? Increasing the taper rate will mean that more people will get access to concessions such as the utility allowance, MAIN COMMITTEE the telephone allowance and pensioner transport and other concessions. However, increasing the taper rate for age pensioners will only discriminate against those groups of people that I have already mentioned as they miss out on these concessions. That shows the very narrow focus of the member for Tangney. Does the opposition think that carers, DSP recipients and widows are doing it less tough than age pensioners? Do they think that it is easy for them? Do they think that they should be ignored? We on this side do not believe in discriminating against people who are on the same sorts of benefits. But the member for Tangney had a constituent come to see him and for the first time in his life he decided that he would stand up for the pensioners in his area-in a way that he did not when he was in government. Like the proposal to lift the single age pension, this is badly thought through. The Liberals had 12 long years to fix the pensions system, including by increasing the taper rate on all pensions, but they did nothing. Twelve long years of sitting on their hands, and all of a sudden they have discovered that pensioners are doing it hard. My mum is a pensioner, and I know that she does it hard. I know that her friends do it hard. It is not something that I have discovered just recently. That is why we are conducting a review to make sure that all pensioners, not just the ones those on the other side seek to favour, have their pensions looked at properly. It is motions such as this that prove why it is necessary to fix the pensions system at the grassroots. It is imperative that you do not approach it in an ad hoc way. The government is determined to do this to make sure that nobody misses out. Hundreds of submissions are being made to the government’s review about how the system should be improved. Those views need to be given the attention that they deserve. When the review is complete, the government will act swiftly to fix the pensions system-unlike the previous government, which sat on their hands for 12 long years. As you well know, Acting Deputy Speaker Kelvin Thomson, this ad hoc approach, this political grandstanding, is not an answer for pensioners in Australia. We need a real solution and the Rudd government will deliver that. (Time expired) bringing forward this motion. I think the member for Shortland was a little misguided as to the intent of this motion, because my understanding is that it is a motion to lift the amount that an age pensioner can earn from productive employment to an amount equivalent to the senior Australians tax offset before applying a penalty that reduces the age pension-that is what this is about. The argument about single pensions is probably for another day, but I will have something to say about that if time permits. SoI defend the member for Tangney’s proposition. The coalition has proved that it is prepared to take a leading role in addressing the grave concerns many Australians have about the adequacy of the age pension. We as a party are aware of the hardships being faced by some of these men and women. I am sure the member for Tangney is well acquainted with those problems-he probably was before he was elected to this place, and he certainly has been since. These are the men and women who fought to make Australia the great country that it is, only to be let down badly by the Rudd government, which is fixated on having talkfests instead of initiating immediate financial relief for pensioners and self-funded retirees. We have to look at this in the context of the steeply rising cost of living that has been evident since the Rudd government took office. This motion makes a lot of sense, and such a policy would be a step toward greater equality for pensioners, who often seem to be an afterMAIN COMMITTEE",170,Private Members Business
185,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (7.05 Pm),"At the outset, I thank the member for Tangney forthought for the current government. Australians are now living longer than they ever have before, with an average age now of 82 years. Our quality of life is also better than it ever has been before, and people can expect to have a very good quality of life at 70 and beyond, which is something that we had not seen in past generations. Anyone who read today’s Australian would have seen the story of Joseph Ciampa. I do not know Mr Ciampa, but I am in awe of him because the article said that at the age of 91 he is about to receive his first PhD. He is now planning to complete a masters in philosophy. This well highlights the fact that we have some very great minds and very great skills out there that go underutilised because we seem to put some kind of limit on the useful contribution people can make as they get older. Mr Ciampa is living proof that getting older does not mean you cannot be productive and make a contribution. The late American publisher Katharine Graham had the right idea when she said, ‘No-one can avoid ageing, but ageing productively is something else.’ Many senior citizens of this country-and the member for Tangney highlighted those people who man crosswalks, for example-deserve the opportunity to be productive for as long as they want and for as long as they are physically and mentally able. They do not want handouts; they just want a fair go. They most certainly do not want to be discouraged from contributing to society and their local communities for fear of having their pension cut because they have earnt a little extra income in the productive workforce. There is a significant economic equation to the motion. The Labor government has spoken previously on boosting Australia’s productive capacity, while the shortage of skilled labourers is Australia has been well documented. The Rudd government’s May budget stated: The ultimate test of economic reforms is in their effect on the well-being of the Australian people. A more efficient economy, with high levels of productivity and participation, provides the means to deliver higher incomes and a more equitable society. So supporting seniors who want to remain in the workforce on a part-time basis provides an opportunity to increase economic efficiency with higher levels of productivity and participation by seniors, which also provides them with a far better sense of contribution and a far better quality of life. We know that people who are fully engaged are less likely to have illness. It seems to keep people well. The skills and abilities of seniors should be valued and utilised while at the same time helping them to live a little more independently. The coalition will continue to examine ways to provide the best possible assistance to those who are amongst the most vulnerable in our society. This motion, along with the coalition’s decision to increase the single age pension, is part of the first steps to help those who are vulnerable. at Riverview for their community festival on Sunday, doing a mobile office, the age pensioners and the disability support pensioners who came to me talked about the stunts of the new opposition leader, and they are aware that this motion is simply a stunt. If this was Liberal Party policy we would have seen it at least once in the last 12 years. I would like to see the private member’s bill that the member put up. But 16,070 pensioners in my electorate are being ignored by this motion. It is a fact: there are 1,144 carers, 7,491 people on disability support pensions and 7,435 pensioner couples who would probably be ignored by this sort of motion. MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Private Members Business
186,Mr Neumann (Blair) (7.10 Pm),"This motion is a stunt-pure and simple. When I wasIt is interesting that we see this new-found compassion from those opposite after 11 years. Where was the fair go in the workforce? Where was the fair go for pensioners during that time? We have not seen it. In fact, pensioners are much better off under this government. We understand the financial pressures that working families have, we understand the pressures that carers have and we understand the pressures that pensioners have. We understand and we are committed to helping seniors to meet the ever rising cost of living that was bequeathed to us on 24 November last year. We have done more in the last nine months than we saw for years under the coalition. We have given the $500 bonus as the previous government did but we have increased the utilities allowance to $500 and paid it in quarterly instalments. They could give only a measly $107. We have made sure seniors card holders can access travel concession on public transport anywhere in Australia. We have delivered on so many of our commitments, including extending the utilities allowance to many people, including disability support pensioners. These are modest measures, we accept, but they do help pensioners with cost-of-living pressures and they are a start. I can assure the constituents in my electorate that I understand where they are coming from because I grew up in a home which was a battling home as well. I can assure you that I am committed to their long-term financial security, as are so many people on this side of the chamber. The inquiry that we have set up by Harmer and by Henry will go a long way to a root and branch amelioration of the problems we faced in the tax system and in the pension system for so long. That inquiry will be responded to by the government and will be reported back by February next year. Getting the priorities right is crucial for the government. It is crucial that we get everything right. It is not the adhockery that we saw for so many years. It is important that the people in my electorate understand that the government is committed to assisting them and providing for financial security. It really distresses me to see the sort of motion we have seen tonight. It really is disingenuous for them to get up here after so many years sitting on the government benches and think that all of a sudden they can do this sort of thing and think that the people of Australia will accept that this is a fair dinkum approach. They could have done so much for so long but they did not provide the long-term support, certainty and security that pensioners need. The bonuses were a help but they were not factored in year after year. They were done with election commitments in mind and they were done with the election facing the government. They were all a matter of getting through the political cycle, and that is what it is about. It is not about improving the pension system; it is not about improving long-term security for people; it is about providing for a political fix. That is what this is about. All pensioners in my electorate are doing it tough and they know they are. We have seen the rising cost of living. That has been happening for some time. It is interesting that when it comes to pensions it was Labor governments that made such a difference-the Curtin government, the Chifley government, the Whitlam government. A former federal member for my electorate, Bill Hayden, did so much for the pensioners of this country when he was social security minister. It has been Labor governments that have shown a commitment to those in need, whereas coalition governments have ignored those who have been battling for so long. You can go through one after another: the widows pension that was brought in under the Curtin government, child endowment, extensions for supporting parents MAIN COMMITTEE during the Whitlam government, wife allowances, mothers benefit. It has been Labor governments which have done all this. Coalition governments have ignored the needs of my electorate in terms of infrastructure and pensioners and their entitlements, and I condemn the member for Tangney what he has done. pensioners and I thank the member for Tangney for bringing forward this motion. In its first 10 months, the Rudd government has ignored senior Australians and, as in so many other areas of government, it has been all talk and no action. But talk offers little solace to single age pensioners, who are doing it extremely tough at the moment. They are doing it so tough that the Prime Minister and most of his frontbench have said that they could not survive on $281 a week, yet they have done nothing. They have said, ‘You hang on for another 12 months while we finish an inquiry.’ Single age pensioners, including over 6,000 in my electorate of Goldstein, who currently receive just $281 a week are facing increasing cost-of-living pressuresfood, petrol, often rent or rates, and it goes on. That is why the coalition is advocating a $30 a week increase to single age pensioners by introducing legislation titled Urgent Relief for Single Age Pensioners Bill 2008 into the Senate to allow this increase to happen. This immediate additional payment will be for recipients of the single age pension, recipients of the widow B pension and recipients of the single age service pension. It is a test for Labor parliamentary members to show where they stand on the dignity of so many senior Australians. We are giving members of the Labor government the opportunity to put their money where their mouths are. Since coming to office, Mr Rudd has announced some 170 reports, reviews, committees and commissions. Pensioners will now have to wait for yet another one before Mr Rudd takes any action. Australia’s single age pensioners need this increase and they need it now, not in a year’s time. Despite Mr Rudd’s claims that the government assisted older Australian in the budget by paying a one-off bonus, it must be remembered, despite the rhetoric of the previous speaker, that this was the bonus that Mr Rudd was planning to scrap before succumbing to pressure from both the coalition and pension groups. It is troubling to think of what position senior Australians would find themselves in today if Mr Rudd had had his way and the bonus had been scrapped. In government, the coalition-again, despite the nonsense spoken by the previous member-were able due to strong economic management to pay a dividend to improve the financial position of pensioners. This was after paying off Labor’s $96 billion of debt. We increased pensions at two per cent a year above the rate of inflation. We introduced the utilities allowance to assist pensioners with the cost of utilities bills such as gas and electricity. We introduced the non-taxable $500 bonus payment annually. We introduced a 30 per cent private health insurance rebate to ease the financial pressures on pensioners, which Labor voted against. Labor’s proposed changes to the Medicare levy surcharge threshold will further hurt pensioners by forcing up premiums for private health insurance-so much for compassion. We also legislated that the age pension be set to at least 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings or increased by the CPI, whichever is greater. As a result, the maximum single rate pension is now $72.80 a fortnight higher than it would have been otherwise. Partnered pensioners are now better off by $122.60 every fortnight than they would have been under Labor’s ad hoc approach to increasing pensions.

187,Mr Robb (Goldstein) (7.15 Pm),"I rise to speak on the current plight facing Australia’stion, we increased the amount of age pension a part-time pensioner receives above the income test free area by reducing the pension income test withdrawal rate from 50c in the dollar to 40c and we halved the assets test taper rate from $3 to $1.50 per fortnight for each $1,000 of assets above the allowable asset limits-a whole host of things which improved the lot of Australia’s seniors. Instead of offering token sympathy, Mr Rudd must start offering solutions and delivering on them now. There is no reason why the government could not take some immediate action while continuing with their longer term review. In its first budget, the Rudd government, backed by a $21 billion surplus inherited from the coalition, delivered increased taxes and spending and even a politically motivated slush fund, but failed to deliver for pensioners. Something must be done, they are a group who have done so much to build our country and we owe them a great deal. motion tonight. It is interesting that about a month ago in this chamber I presented a petition about pensions and a whole range of issues around them. A number of the members have mentioned tonight that we hear every day about the concerns raised by pensioners, and for us to debate about this tonight across this chamber is certainly of interest. I think the member for Tangney is well intentioned in his motion but what some of the speakers, certainly on the opposition side, have spoken about tonight does not really get to the heart of what I understand his motion to be. As speakers on this side of the chamber have stated, unfortunately a lot of it is misinformed. A lot of the concern about what this motion is about and what pensioners can and cannot do is not explained. About two weeks ago there was a whole lot of media coverage around some statements that I made and there was certainly a move by the opposition and others to drive a wedge by saying that I somehow was going against the statements of my own government or Prime Minister. I am here tonight to say that is just not true. If you look at the statements that I made they were very similar to the statements that we are making here tonight about the need to understand and consider pensioners generally. This particular motion is a very important one when we are talking about those who have the ability to earn further income, particularly those who have got to the stage of being able to retire, take on a pension at 65 and continue to work. The problem is that I do not believe that it goes far enough. Again, my statements of only a couple of weeks ago that led people to suggest that there was some dissension within our government were essentially what we are saying on both sides of this chamber tonight. There is not enough information for us right now to make any definitive statements about what we should or should not do with pensioners. Even in the debate tonight people are coming up with different understandings about this motion and the concerns that pensioners have. I want to speak about a particular pensioner in my electorate who is certainly of a senior age but still has the capacity to work. In South-East Queensland and Queensland generally we have a major skill shortage. There are many people who have appropriate and professional skills and who are able to re-enter the workforce but many of those have come to me and said: ‘The rules around pensions are really tough. We can’t earn more money simply because of the rules.’ MAIN COMMITTEE",175,Private Members Business

189,Opposition Members Interjecting,"something that we all understand as members but, unfortunately, it was the previous government that did not change the rules. That is something that I am bringing forward tonight-my understanding of where we need to go. The concerns raised in the media two weeks ago and my petition of four weeks ago were essentially saying that we need to make some decisions very quickly about how we are going to resolve this. It does not mean that we are looking at one-off payments, the $30 increase. I think we all understand that economically and financially it is just not the right way to go. We must understand what we need to do to better service pensions. We have announced the Harmer review, the Henry review and ways of looking at the overall taxation system and how payments can be made not only to pensioners but also to other people in need in our society. That review has to go ahead. I know that the new Leader of the Opposition is talking about his own review. Understandably, he wants to be able to come up with some definitive statements as well about what we need to do for pensioners, but the reality is, as a government, we have committed to making some change. We have committed to understanding more about the overall pension and taxation system. No decisions can be made until we really understand the money that comes in and the money that needs to go out in payments. The constituent I mentioned previously came to me and said he was willing to work, to come back into the workforce, but the incentives were not there. We do need to recognise that. We need to understand how much we might be seen to be advantaging certain people who can work over people who are taking benefit in other forms of payments who may be able to do some work or none at all. It is simply about understanding our overall position. In summary, I commend the member for Tangney for bringing this to our attention. I think there probably needs to be a lot more thought go into what this motion is all about. What we are saying on this side of the House is: stand by our review and please support us in it. The review will certainly tell us a lot about the system of taxation, the excise and all the other payments that come into our funds and how we then redistribute those. Pensions are certainly right at the core of our support for those people in our community. expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Human Trafficking Debate resumed, on motion by Ms Rea: That the House: (1) notes that: (a) the insidious act of human trafficking is the second largest criminal activity in the world, and certainly the fastest growing; and (b) the Australian government is committed to a ‘whole of government’ approach to tackling human trafficking; and (2) recognises that the Australian government, through its Asia Regional Trafficking in Persons aid project and contribution to UNICEF’s work, continues to play an active role in strengthening the key institutions responsible for identifying and addressing human trafficking; MAIN COMMITTEE",176,Private Members Business

191,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Kj Thomson),"Order! The allotted for this debate has(3) acknowledges the role of the non-government organisations (NGOs), their unique expertise and the assistance they provide to trafficked persons; (4) recognises that the Australian government continues to work with AusAID, NGOs and foreign governments to ensure that the crime of human trafficking is continually brought to light, and that all members and senators continue to raise awareness of this international human rights violation; and (5) applauds the government’s establishment of a National Round Table on People Trafficking as a measure to involve all interested stakeholders in the fight against this despicable crime. Ms REA (Bonner) (7.25 pm)-All of us in this House have come with great enthusiasm to represent our local electorates and to make very important decisions both on a local and a national level. Indeed, the debate we have just witnessed regarding the issue of age pensions certainly highlights the matters of national significance that we discuss. But I do not believe there is any issue that is more important for us as elected members of this parliament and as citizens of this country to discuss, debate and move to eradicate than that of human trafficking. We cannot call ourselves a civilised society when human beings are traded as if they are simply goods or chattels. None of us can celebrate our freedom when we live in a world where human beings are exploited and are held in bondage and slavery. Unfortunately, this is not a minor issue. In fact, human trafficking is the second largest criminal activity in the world, next to drug dealing. It is something that we all as individuals and as people who have some responsibility and influence must talk about-and we must encourage every campaign at every level to eradicate this very insidious crime. The US State Department estimates that every year around 600,000 to 800,000 people are trafficked across international borders-a staggering figure. What is even more staggering is that it is estimated that there are millions of people-around two to four million more people-trafficked within their own countries. Of course, what is most frightening about those statistics is that there are more people who are victims of human trafficking today than there were at the height of the African slave trade. This is a startling acknowledgement of how far we believe we have progressed but, on what is a very basic, essential human right, we still have a long way to go. Of course there are many reasons why people are victims of human trafficking: force, fraud and coercion are all very insidious methods that see many people taken against their will, exploited and forced into situations over which they have no control. We know that it is often women and children who are the greatest victims of this. In moving this motion, I want to encourage the government to continue its campaign to be involved in ending this terrible crime. I am so pleased that the Minister for Home Affairs has established the National Roundtable on People Trafficking. This matter is of such importance and significance that we need everybody around the table working together to eradicate this crime. We need more than just one government or one entity to be able to resolve this situation. The roundtable brings together all of the key voices in this country who have long had the knowledge, the expertise and, indeed, the compassion and concern to campaign against this crime. Members include three ministers, many of the NGOs, service providers, victims of crime organisations, religious bodies, unions and employer groups. It has brought together all those people who can contribute so much. We also have a strategy to end trafficking. As a country we have developed a strategy to combat it which includes comprehensive antitrafficking laws, specialised teams in the AFP, MAIN COMMITTEE enhanced visa arrangements for potentially trafficked persons, a victim’s support program, funding for the Institute of Criminology, and so many more initiatives. We also have to acknowledge that as individuals we also have some responsibility. I urge all Australians to avoid using those products which are on our shelves as a result of child slavery and human trafficking. We know that there are areas such as coffee production and chocolate production where slave labour is used, and I encourage all Australians to check out the fair labelling website to end this crime. (Time expired) forward this private member’s business motion here this evening. It should be a part of the role of every member of parliament to be very actively involved in this bipartisan effort to ensure that people are protected. In my case, I raise the issue of child trafficking. Child trafficking is one of the gravest forms of child abuse in the world today. Over 1.2 million children are trafficked each year and it primarily happens in poor countries. Many of these children are from our Asia-Pacific region. There are factors like the lack of laws against trafficking or like domestic violence, which make children more at risk of trafficking. Girls are especially at risk because in many cultures they often have a lower status than young boys. Children are trafficked because-and make no mistake about it-there is a demand for their labour or a demand for their bodies. It is wealthy countries that are at times the greatest perpetrators of these crimes. Wealthy countries are part of the problem as their citizens provide demand for the trafficked children. For example, Australians have been identified as sex tourists in 25 countries. Places like Bali and East Timor are emerging as easy targets for those who would exploit children for their own gratification. There are many issues surrounding the trafficking of children. Currently I have a young intern working with me doing a project on birth registration. It is a fact that if we could assist countries in developing models and proposals and bringing forward ways in which children could be registered at birth then it would be far less likely that they would be able to be trafficked with nobody knowing where they had been sent. What we have is the most dire and disgraceful situation where you have children trafficked out of places like Cambodia, Thailand and Burma into other countries where they are put into the sex industry or into other slave labour industries-but primarily in the sex industrywhere they then become victims of HIV-AIDS. Instead of being treated and assisted, these children are then thrown out on the street because they can no longer earn their people traffickers money because of their possible HIV-AIDS infection. They are then treated like criminals. They are treated as illegal immigrants in that country where they have been violated and taken without their parents’ consent, most of the time. Most of the time parents in poor countries believe that they are giving their child an opportunity. They are given some story by the trafficker that they will put the child in domestic service or they will teach them how to be employed, and they will be able to send money home to their families. Sometimes these very poor village people are tricked into providing their children as victims in horrendous crimes against humanity. Sometimes we see these children physically abused and physically violated and maimed, such as having limbs removed or having acid thrown into their faces. We have all seen shocking programs on children who have had acid thrown into their faces so that, by begging on the corners of streets or on church steps, they can earn money for these violators of people. The tourist feels sorry for the child and hands over money. MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Private Members Business
192,Mrs Hull (Riverina) (7.30 Pm),"I congratulate the member for Bonner for bringingThis is a crime against humanity, a crime that needs to be stopped, and one very important factor will be to see impoverished nations being able to put in place registration of children for birth. That would be a major step forward to protecting these children. If their existence were known it may be just that little bit more difficult to traffic these children. I applaud all of those NGOs who work tirelessly on the ground-UNICEF, World Vision. All of these NGOs work in the most difficult of scenarios. I am aware that in Indonesia we have some great workers in UNICEF who have been able to implement the beginnings of registration of children for birth, and that will make an enormous difference. I again congratulate the member for Bonner. This is an issue that we should all be involved in. (Time expired) Ms NEAL (Robertson) (7.36 pm)-I rise to support the motion by the member for Bonner and also join in congratulating her in taking up this very important initiative. Human trafficking is the sanitised term for slavery. In the modern world often women and children are bought or stolen into slavery. The type of trafficking that has the greatest visibility is the trafficking of women for the purposes of prostitution. There are also incidences of trafficking for forced labour, for domestic servitude and, most offensively in my mind, for the removal of organs. This obviously is a demand of the Western world. The scope of the problem is difficult to measure due to the nature of the crime. These people, largely women, are in positions of powerlessness, often having crossed borders illegally, and there is great difficulty with, firstly, detection and then successful prosecution due to the clandestine nature of the operations and, often, links with underground criminal activity. The level of human trafficking is therefore uncertain, but the US Department of State estimates that in 2006 between 600,000 and 800,000 people were trafficked world wide. The greatest concern for us in the Australian parliament is that this is not just happening in some remote part of the world; this is happening here in Australia. The estimates of the number of Australians involved vary between 100 and 1,000. Obviously because of the nature of the crime, it is difficult to be certain. But there certainly are many women and children-and, in some cases, men-who are affected by human trafficking. In Australia there have been 117 investigations into human trafficking since January 2004 and only four convictions. In fact, of these four convictions, three are under appeal. At this stage I wish to acknowledge the Erina Community Baptist Church from my home on the Central Coast, part of the Catalyst Social Justice Committee, for raising this issue with me earlier in the year. Their concern for those suffering in these circumstances is recognised and applauded. I also wish to acknowledge the contribution to this issue of ACRATH, the Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans, who visited me last week. The Rudd government takes the crime of human trafficking extremely seriously. The two areas that I believe need particular attention are, firstly, improving the success of prosecutions for trafficking; and, secondly, the transformation of the visa system for those who are trafficked, from a largely criminal investigation basis to a more humanitarian basis. Presently, Australia’s efforts to combat trafficking in persons are focused on prevention, detection and investigation, criminal prosecution, and victim support and rehabilitation. The government has a $38.3 million anti people-trafficking strategy which provides for a range of measures, including additional trafficking prosecutions and training; the victim support program in its third phase, with victim witnesses returning to Australia to assist with prosecutions, organised through the Office for Women; two additional senior migration officer MAIN COMMITTEE compliance (trafficking) positions in the Asian region; and research into trafficking trends in our region at the moment to try to ascertain the scope of the problem. The government has established a National Roundtable on People Trafficking comprising government, anti-people-trafficking NGOs, service providers and victims of crime support organisations, as well as the legal, employer and union sectors. The government values the views of stakeholders and has conducted a review of the people-trafficking visa framework, which includes discussions with a range of non-government organisations. The outcomes are currently being considered. This is an important issue. I take great heart in the bipartisan approach in the Main Committee today. I feel that, with the enthusiasm and support from all sectors of the parliament and the community, we can make great strides. I look forward to working with everyone to achieve that. motion that is before us today on the insidious act of human trafficking in Australia. Indeed, human trafficking does occur within Australia. It is something all of us need to be aware of and to be ready to take action on in the most bipartisan fashion. I have spoken recently in the House on sex slavery and the trafficking of people in Australia. At that time we were awaiting a High Court decision. There have only been four successful trafficking prosecutions in the last eight years. There is a real sense that we need to examine and constantly re-examine the adequacy of the laws in relation to people trafficking and whether the laws are working or not. While I cannot comment specifically on the outcome of that case, because it is subject to appeal, with only four trafficking prosecutions in eight years we need to do more in this place to strengthen the laws in Australia and ensure that people who are engaging in this insidious activity are captured. RecentlyI was lobbied by groups in my electorate. The Baulkham Hills Baptist Church, which forms part of the Catalyst group, and the Starfish Ministries from St Paul’s Anglican Church at Castle Hill are very committed, caring and compassionate people. They have committed themselves to ensuring that we do the best we can in this country to look after the innocent victims of this terrible industry and ensure that we afford them all the compassion we can give them from the government. I want to congratulate decision makers in the current government for the establishment of the national roundtable-I think it is a fine initiative-and in the previous government for action on eradicating trafficking. Important action was taken. In 2004 the Australian government’s action plan to eradicate trafficking comprised a number of positive measures, including the appointment of a Federal Police task force, participation in the Bali regional process that combated trafficking and revision of the protection measures for victims. While this was a positive move forward, I am pleased to see the national roundtable. I think there is more that we can all do in this place to see more achieved. One of the major concerns I have raised previously is that, with the immigration system at the moment, we treat victims of trafficking in this country as people who are only useful to us in the form of witnesses against the perpetrators of these acts. We need to take a more compassionate approach with people who are victims of such horrific crime. There is room for change in the immigration system to cater for people who are victims of horrendous acts such as people trafficking and sex slavery. I recommend we look at that as part of this national MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Private Members Business
193,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (7.40 Pm),"I rise to commend the member for Bonner for her fineroundtable review. Immigration is one intricately linked area that will require improvement if we are to do something positive. Poverty is one of the major drivers of trafficking and exploitation of human beings. We have a role to play in our region. If you look at the statistics, the Asia-Pacific region has 79 per cent of the forced labour slavery problems in the world. Between 13 million and 27 million people, depending on the estimates, are trapped in slavery in the world. The International Labour Organisation says that a conservative estimate is about 12.3 million people. The other NGOs that work in this field say it could be as high as 27 million. Indeed, in Australia today there are 100 people in such circumstances at any given time, and that is if you take the conservative estimates. Some people suggest that it could be up to 1,000 people trapped in slavery within our own country, within our own borders. That is why I welcome the motion by the member for Bonner. I commend any government that seeks to take further action to ensure that we eradicate this practice. All members here would be familiar with the movie Amazing Grace. We can take inspiration from legislators in previous parliaments who worked for generations to achieve freedom from slavery. That can inspire us all as modern-day legislators to continue that work and to work in a bipartisan fashion to achieve better outcomes for the unfortunate victims trapped in this horrific industry. Indeed, I feel we can make some big improvements as part of this government’s process, especially in the areas of immigration and the adequacy of the law in prosecuting perpetrators of these acts. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (7.45 pm)-WhilstI am happy to add my voice to that of the honourable member for Bonner-and I commend her for bringing this motion before the House-I cannot say that I am happy to talk about what I consider to be the most heinous of crimes; that is, human trafficking. As the motion notes, it is the second largest criminal activity globallyand that speaks volumes. The very name and the very idea are repulsive. It goes against the grain of the moral fibre of humanity. Can you imagine people plotting and planning to traffic people? That is what they do. That is their job. That is how they make money. If we lived in another country, it could be our sister or our brother. It is not just women; it happens to girls and boys, men and women, our neighbours. It is in our neighbourhood and in the broader Asia-Pacific region-not solely there but the figures are high there. Can you imagine the sort of people who traffic? They are people without a conscience, people without what I call a moral compass. I have had the misfortune to come face-to-face with a few traffickers in my time and in my work. They were in our neighbourhood, up on the borders, and also, unfortunately, in Australia. As the honourable member before me said, there are at least 100 people at any given time in Australia who are trafficked. Yes, trafficking happens and some of them end up in Australia. The fact that they get here is a cause of concern for all of us-that they still get here with the systems we have in place. I have met quite a lot of women and some young boys who have been trafficked. They were primarily overseas, but some were here. The fact is that if people end up here due to human trafficking then we as a nation, as communities and as governments have an obligation to treat them with the greatest of care and the greatest of respect, and that goes also to our visa system-and I know that is an evolving area. I know that when we give visas it is generally to people who will be witnesses to help effect prosecutions. That is very important, but we also MAIN COMMITTEE have to give visas for care, protection and compassion. I know that that is one of the issues on the agenda with regard to trafficking and the roundtable. We have to be really clear about the definition of ‘trafficking’. In practice, when we are dealing with trafficking, it can become confused with smuggling. Sometimes we tend to mix them up. It is important that we keep focus. Smuggling leads to trafficking; you cannot really have the trafficking without it. However, smuggling can happen for other purposes. The definition is this: ‘Trafficking in persons’ shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs; So it is quite a broad definition. That definition comes from the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. We have to be mindful of that broad definition when we are thinking of it and not confuse it with prostitution and other things. I would like to commend the government for the roundtable that has been convened and commend the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon. Bob Debus, for his work in that area. I take the approach that this is something that requires absolute bipartisan, multipartisan, support to make sure that we respond in the appropriate ways and respond to the criminality of thisbecause it is a crime-as well as to the human dimension, where we have to provide that care and protection. I would like to say thank you to the honourable member for Bonner for bringing it to our attention. (Time expired) tion to the House and for raising the issue of human trafficking once again in this place, as it continues to be a matter of great shame to the international community. The inability of the international community to come to terms with this is a comprehensive failure of modern governments. I would like to touch on the issue of trafficking in children in particular. I have spoken on this matter before in this place and I participated in the UN convention on the rights of women, in Beijing in 1995, where the matter just raised by the member for Riverina, the registration of children, was hotly debated, with a commitment to try and do more to make sure that was achieved. Nineteen ninety-five was a long time ago and we still have not achieved it. More particularly, I speak as leader of the delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union and as the permanent delegate in the last parliament. I led a delegation to Cambodia early last year; the member for Riverina was part of that. I was once again confronted-we were all confronted-by this terrible trade in children. In Cambodia we met a young woman who had been picked up by the aid agency Caritas and who had been sold into prostitution, into a brothel, when she was still in preschool. At the age of 19 she had full-blown HIV-AIDS and was tossed out into the street with no support, no medication and inadequate food-nothing at all. If it had not been for Caritas, no doubt she would have continued living on the streets and would have died on the streets. It was Caritas that picked her up, and thank God that there are MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Private Members Business
194,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (7.50 Pm),"I thank the member for Bonner for bringing this moagencies like Caritas who do this incredible work. But I felt that somebody should have to pay. Why can’t we work together in regions and as parliaments, as international partners, to try and put laws into place that stamp out these practices, that prosecute brothel owners who take children into this terrible trade? After that I wrote to all 142-odd members of the IPU, who met in Bali shortly after that visit to Cambodia. I did so with the full support of the member for Riverina, the current Speaker of the House of Representatives and Senator Marshall in the Senate, who were also part of the delegation. I received about 20 responses from members of countries represented at the IPU meeting in Bali. We talked about what we could do. I spoke also at a UNICEF meeting in Bali and, after I spoke, I had quite a reaction from the African women and from the women of South America, who were deeply distressed at the number of children who are simply disappearing in South America. It is really a shocking situation. They felt the need to come together on a regional basis to try and get some cross-border policies, similar to the ones that we negotiated when we were in government-and I am pleased now to see the Rudd government continuing this-to make sure we have a regional approach to this so that we can strengthen laws and we can prosecute. I felt ashamed, after talking to some of our federal policemen in Bali, that so many Australian people are the ones who are demanding these children to satisfy their own strange tastes. That is why there is a continuation of this trade-because the demand is there. The demand is coming from people that you and I probably bump into every day. That is very disturbing. We should be very worried about it. We should be very worried about it in this parliament and we should be very worried about it as part of an international community. More must be done to stop it. It simply has to be stopped. As the member for Bonner said, there is nothing worse than this trafficking. We thought that we had stamped it out 140 years ago. We did not; it is worse than ever. The fact that it involves so many children is a matter of great shame to each of us as members of the international community, and we should be able to do something about it. I would like to say a lot more on this subject but time does not permit. UNICEF and many other United Nations agencies and non-government agencies have worked for decades to prevent abuse and to offer support to the abused. Our resolve to strengthen laws and law enforcement is essential to further and to give effect to these efforts. (Time expired) member for Bonner and I commend her for the initiative. I also thank the member for Pearce for her contribution. As someone married to someone who has worked in child protection for 19 years-and I will celebrate my 13th wedding anniversary tomorrow-I understand her passion in speaking out against these horrible things. Child exploitation and slavery are things that we all should be concerned about. Human trafficking is today’s slavery. Traffickers use violence, threats and abuse to force people to work against their will and they use people as commodities for another’s gain. Typically, victims are forced into prostitution, domestic service, forced marriage or even forced manual labour. More than half of all people trafficked are children who are forced into manual labour, trained as soldiers or-I am sad to say-sexually exploited. MAIN COMMITTEE",183,Private Members Business
195,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (7.55 Pm),"I rise to support the motion put forward by theHuman trafficking denies people their basic human rights and is a sickening crime that represents the absolute worse of humanity. As Abraham Lincoln said way back in 1864: I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I cannot remember when I did not so think and feel. That sounds like a logical thing to say now, but we have to understand the context in which it was said in 1864. It was something that ultimately led to Abraham Lincoln being assassinated. We need more people of courage to speak against this horrendous crime, people like Abraham Lincoln and William Wilberforce. We need our modern-day versions. Thankfully, we have organisations like the Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans organisation. I met with representatives from ACRATH here in parliament last week. While as a child it was quite a harrowing experience to be in a room alone with two nuns, I found this to be a wonderful experience. It was great to see their commitment to such a wonderful cause. I admire them for their courage and for what they are trying to do. ACRATH is only a small part of the global struggle to eliminate human trafficking in Australia, the Asia-Pacific and internationally. ACRATH’s cause involves protecting victims of trafficking; amending the visa structure for trafficked persons-protecting the victim, basically; making community education accessible to trafficked people; improving community education for the wider community; and advocating better training for prosecutors and the judiciary. The Rudd government is committed to eliminating people trafficking at home and abroad. We realise that to do this we need to take up the fight on a number of fronts: prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution and victim support. Australia has ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. We are also party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. Australia has tough laws in place to deter traffickers, a victim support program, enhanced visa arrangements for potentially trafficked persons and specialised investigation units in the Australian Federal Police. These measures are helping to keep people trafficking in Australia relatively low. The Australian Federal Police have undertaken 150 investigations into trafficking allegations since 2004. This has led to 34 charges, including eight convictions, with 14 still before the courts. However, people trafficking is still growing in some parts of Europe and South Asia. That is why Australia needs to work with our neighbours and non-government human rights agencies to help fight people trafficking. That is also why the Minister for Home Affairs convened the first National Roundtable on People Trafficking in June this year. The roundtable brought together non-government organisations, victims-of-crime organisations, religious groups, community legal centres, unions and government agencies. As a result, a working group was established to develop guidelines for NGOs dealing with trafficking victims. Through AusAID, the Rudd government is also delivering a $21 million program to help combat people trafficking in Asia. AusAID is working with countries like Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia, Burma and Vietnam to reduce the number of human-trafficking victims, help the recovery of victims and prevent the exploitation of children. I particularly commend the efforts of some of the Thai representatives I met recently. Many people would be shocked to know that, more than 200 years after Lincoln and Wilberforce first led the cause against MAIN COMMITTEE slavery, human trafficking and human exploitation are still happening throughout the world. This is totally unacceptable and should not be ignored. I thank the member for Bonner for bringing this matter before the House and acknowledge her efforts to uphold the cause of the oppressed. It is obviously up to us and governments around the world to do more. (Time expired) has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Credit Cards Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Bruce Scott: That the House: (1) calls on the Federal Government to amend finance legislation so as to prevent credit providers from sending unsolicited letters offering an increased credit limit to credit card holders; and (2) notes the amended legislation would stipulate that, for a credit card limit to be increased, the card holder must make the first approach to the credit provider. outstanding on credit cards in Australia was some $44.4 billion. That is about twice the federal budget surplus. I know that credit cards are now a way of life. The Reserve Bank of Australia estimates that there are some 14.1 million credit card accounts across the nation and almost a million young people between the ages of 18 and 24 own a credit card. So it is important that at this time of uncertainty in the global financial market all Australians, young and old, are confident in their ability to deal responsibly and sensibly with money and debt. I believe it is also a responsibility of Australia’s banks to provide the best knowledge and support to their customers so that they are adequately equipped to make solid financial decisions. Yet at the moment it is quite common for banks, large and small, to send letters to their customers with unsolicited offers to increase their credit card limits. All one must simply do is complete the form accompanying the letter and return it to the bank. Not much effort is involved on the part of the customer. He or she simply lets the bank dictate his or her credit limit. The customer then finds that he or she has an increased limit-sometimes substantially increased, despite the customer having been happy, most likely, with their previous limit. In fact, there is anecdotal evidence that people will take out a second credit card simply to pay off the balance on their first card without reducing any debt. This is fiscally and socially irresponsible. This is how people find themselves with uncontrollable debt. I call on the federal and state governments to amend financial legislation so that the only way a credit card limit can be increased is by the customer approaching his or her financial institution-not the other way around. The current global financial crisis is a lesson to all that lending to a person unable to adequately repay their debt can have disastrous and far-reaching consequences. Better education is needed for borrowers. A more honest and fair approach is required by our financial institutions. With the current global financial crisis, it is imperative that we ensure Australians are adequately equipped to spend wisely and deal with debt. The former Liberal-National coalition government understood the importance of financial responsibility. Not only did we pay off the previous government’s $96 billion debt but we also handed the current Labor government a $20 billion budget surplus and provided Australians MAIN COMMITTEE",184,Private Members Business

197,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (8.01 Pm),"At the end of April this year, the total balancewith a secure, robust economy; one in which they could have faith and confidence. In 2005 we established the Financial Literacy Foundation to give Australians easy access to important financial information and advice. Last year the foundation released its report on the financial literacy of Australians. Whilst it is reassuring to see that Australian consumers consider themselves to be confident in their ability to deal with credit card debt, some of the report statistics were rather alarming. Twenty per cent said that they do not regularly pay off the balance owing on their credit cards, 13 per cent said that they make the minimum repayment on their credit card balance and 17 per cent said that they were not comfortable with their level of debt. Supporting my motion is the alarming statistic that 21 per cent said that they will use debt to buy things that they cannot afford. One in five Australians are buying items that they cannot afford, yet our banks regularly send them letters offering to increase their credit card limit. This is simply not financially responsible and we must ensure that we do everything in our power to ensure Australians do not fall into a cycle of debt. I commend the motion to the House. fore the House on the scandalous conduct of some of the financial institutions that are tempting members of the public, often those with the most limited capacity to service debt, to accept offers of increased credit at interest rates that are, I am sure, the highest in the financial market. This is a big issue. It is an issue as big as the debt that people accumulate. It is as big as the volume of money that is wasted on extraordinarily high interest rates and as big as the assets that can be lost through default. It is as big as the hole that unaffordable debt can leave in a person’s life. The Reserve Bank of Australia observes that the ratio of household interest payments to disposable income has skyrocketed in the few years since 2003. For decades the interest payments ratio has been in the vicinity of six to eight per cent of disposable income. Since 2003-in the last five years-this has skyrocketed to between 12 and 14 per cent. The limits of credit card accounts without an interest-free period have increased from $15 billion in 1995 to $50 billion in 2002 and to $110 billion this year. Outstanding balances on credit and charge cards have doubled in the last six years from $22 billion to $44 billion. Interest charged on credits cards has, for a number of years, been in the vicinity of eight to 10 per cent more than the standard variable rate. People are currently paying 19½ per cent instead of 9½ per cent. Financial institutions and loan sharks continue to issue credit cards without regard to people’s capacity to pay, offering quick but very expensive cash availability, costing many people the proverbial arm and a leg for the convenience of accepting offers of readily available cash, right there and then. This is an issue that seriously affects many Australians of all walks of life and in most income brackets, but of course it has the greatest potential to devastate those with the most limited means of servicing and paying off debt. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs heard last year of the failure of self-regulation within the financial industry to impede irresponsible lending practices that continue today-whether it is the practice of targeting elderly persons who have equity in their own homes and offering them credit cards to transfer equity into very expensive debt, or the practice of targeting others on limited or fixed incomes who do not even have the asset base to cover financial diffiMAIN COMMITTEE",186,Unicef Estimates That Around 1 2 Million Children Are Trafficked Worldwide Every Year
198,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (8.05 Pm),"I too rise to give support to the motion beculties should they arise. This particular section of the finance industry is geared to maximising financial returns through debt servicing and even penalties for breaches of conditions, maximising their return on the back of unscrupulous manipulation and exploitation of those who just cannot say no. This issue has been around for a long time. Parliaments around Australia know of this issue and the difficulties that unsolicited credit offers can cause for many of our fellow Australians. The traditional question always needs to be addressed. Within Australia we have distinctions between the jurisdiction of the states and the territories on the one hand and the Commonwealth on the other. Recent banking issues raised within my electorate office pointed to the fact that mortgage lending by the banks and credit unions is a Commonwealth matter but loan sharks and similar businesses were a matter of state consumer protection legislation. This distinction was seen a few years ago when the Australian Capital Territory passed the Fair Trading Legislation Amendment Bill designed specifically to meet the needs of the financially vulnerable in the ACT community. A coordinated and comprehensive approach to financial institution practice is needed within Australia. Having state laws regulating financial businesses operating products within state boundaries simply does not make sense. That is why this Rudd Labor government has had its green paper on financial services and credit reform in circulation with a view to doing what is identified in its title: ‘Improving, simplifying and standardising financial services and credit regulation’. The purpose of this paper is to consult stakeholders about a range of financial services and credit reform initiatives, including consideration of the most appropriate regulation of a range of remaining credit products such as credit cards, personal loans and microlending. These issues, from key initiatives included on the COAG reform agenda and the outcomes of the paper consultation process, are due to be put to COAG in the very near future. I would like to congratulate the government for moving on this issue. I look forward to learning of the outcomes of the government’s consultations in support of the little players, the vulnerable and those who need every bit of help they can get when dealing with the more unscrupulous within the finance industry. The Commonwealth should now look to what we can do. There may be those who simply blame those consumers who sign the form for bringing financial difficulties upon themselves, or those who do not do the homework or exercise the self-discipline to refrain from accepting an offer to triple their available credit. (Time expired) and colleague from Queensland the member for Maranoa because I know that the people of Ryan would be very warmly supportive of the spirit of his fine motion. I want to specify on the record for the people of Ryan that the motion is about amending legislation to prevent credit providers from sending unsolicited letters offering an increased limit to credit card holders and to note that amended legislation would stipulate that, for a credit card limit to increase, the cardholder must make the first approach to the credit provider. Let me say very strongly that, as someone who believes in free enterprise and the place of businesses in our system, I appreciate and respect the role of banks in our community. They are an important part of our economic architecture.

199,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (8.11 Pm),"I am very pleased to support the motion by my friendbanks. Governments must have a role in consumer protection. This extends to protecting consumers from over-enthusiastic bankers. My father used to say to me, ‘Son, neither a borrower nor a lender be.’ Maybe this has some merit but, of course, in our modern system people need credit and banks are one source of that credit. Banks are very profitable in this country. They are global businesses as well. They rest very much on the mums and dads in our communities all over the country. They rest very much on their profit from ordinary people-from people starting businesses to young couples who might have just got married and are looking to buy a car or a home. So banks have a very strong place in our society. A tool through which young people and all kinds of consumers are to exercise some economic freedom is credit cards. Credit cards are very much a part of our lifestyle. Many of us would almost say that they are an indispensable tool but, at the end of the day, this piece of plastic is potentially very dangerous to people who do not fully understand and appreciate its power. I call on the federal government and on all legislators across this country, particularly here in the House of Representatives, to take a very considered view of this motion. It will protect people who might be vulnerable or somewhat exposed to the heavy hand of some banks and bankers who might try to take advantage of certain consumers. I have received many letters from various banks seeking me to be their client and from the bank I do business with to increase the limit on my credit card. Very wisely, I declined to do so. I thank my beautiful and lovely wife who in particular says to me, ‘Michael, be careful of banks.’ She is a very wise and lovely person and makes sure that I fully understand how banks might be trying to take advantage of me as a consumer because I do not take much notice of financial matters. I want to point out to the people of Ryan that the banks in this country are certainly doing very well and enjoying great profits. That is why I remind the banks that, in the spirit of good business practice and their important role in our society, they should appreciate the position that they have versus the position of consumers who might not be as aware of the relationship between the two stakeholders. I want to draw the parliament’s attention to the profit of the Commonwealth Bank. The net profit after tax on a statutory basis increased seven per cent to $4,791 million and on a cash basis by five per cent to $4,733 million. In the short time left to me, I will point out that the Westpac bank in its press release on 1 May 2008 announced cash earnings of $1,839 million for the six months ending 31 March 2008, up 10 per cent. After including significant items, the net profit after tax was up 34 per cent to $2,202 million for the six months. So they are two successful banks. I congratulate them on their profits but also remind them very strongly that they would not survive without the hard working Australians who bank with them and therefore that they should take care of their customers. Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (8.16 pm)-I rise tonight to support the essence of the motion proposed by the member for Maranoa. However, I would like to point out that at the moment consumer credit law does lie with the states and territories. This is one of a number of financial consumer issues that the federal government can work with the states to reform. I am pleased to see that the Rudd government is doing just this. The motion before us tonight brings attention to unscrupulous marketing tactics that encourage people to increase credit limits on their credit cards. More and more Australians are MAIN COMMITTEE opting to purchase basic goods on credit. This is coupled with an increasing number of outlets providing credit card facilities. For example, you can even use your credit card at McDonald’s. With an average of 2.2 credit cards per Australian, providers of credit cards need to behave in an ethical way that does not trap the most vulnerable people into unserviceable debt. Reserve Bank statistics reveal that, over a one-year period, the national credit card debt has blown out, with the average credit card debt being $3,200 per card. This compares with the average debt of $2,000 per card less than two years ago. We have seen a significant increase in debt per card. This rise in credit debt is concerning, especially if it translates into more consumers unable to service their debt. In a survey conducted in 2007 by Veda Advantage, 75 per cent of those surveyed reported that they were worried about their ability to make their debt repayments over the next 12 months. Alarmingly, over 16 per cent of people in financial difficulty are using large portions of their income to meet debt payments and one per cent are unsure of how they are going to make their next payment. The anxiety of credit stress causes significant suffering and can often lead to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and insomnia. Not only does financial strain take its toll on individuals, it is also a contributing factor to many family breakdowns. That is why I am pleased that the member for Ryan has been consulting with his wife to make sure that they deal with their financial situation in a responsible manner. The motion before the chamber today refers specifically to the need to prevent credit card providers from sending unsolicited letters offering an increase in credit. Essentially the practice results in tempting consumers with more credit even if they have not requested it. This practice has been raised by constituents in my electorate of Kingston on numerous occasions. I have heard many stories of my constituents who have been annoyed, frustrated and at times even caught by this practice. In particular, it has been brought to my attention that these unsolicited letters offering an increase seem to be sent only when customers pay interest on their credit card debt. One constituent reported to me the following scenario. For many years this constituent always paid in full each month the amount owing on their credit card. During this time they never received a letter offering them a credit increase. These letters only came when my constituent was unable to pay the full amount and was charged interest by the bank on their purchases. This scenario did not occur once but was a regular pattern: a letter offering more credit was sent only when interest was charged and not during the periods of time when full repayments were made. This type of practice is appalling to me. Not only are credit card providers trying to entice people to obtain more credit but it also seems that they encourage this when credit cardholders are unable to pay off their full repayments. I support the concept in this motion proposed by the member for Maranoa that it should be up to the consumer to initiate a request of a credit card limit to be increased. This would ensure that consumers are in control of their financial destiny. As I highlighted in my opening remarks, the responsibilities for consumer credit law do lie with the states and territories. However, I do recognise that the Rudd Labor government is very keen to work with the states and territories to reform this area of legislation. Therefore, I urge all states and territories to look at this piece of legislation and to act accordingly. Ms LEY (Farrer) (8.21 pm)-I appreciate the opportunity to speak in the House today on unsolicited offers to increase credit card limits. For many of us credit cards are a necessary MAIN COMMITTEE evil, but for some, as we have heard so eloquently from the earlier speakers, they are an absolute noose around one’s neck. We have all heard from constituents that have been completely caught in a credit card trap where they simply move from credit card to credit card, taking advantage of lowor no-interest upfront fee periods and then moving to another card or having two or three credit cards going at the same time, all of which adds up to circumstances where it is completely impossible to repay the balance. In many cases, if they have got equity in their home they will capitalise that interest and payments from the credit card into a home loan, and that is considerably adding to the current home loan affordability crisis. I would like to remind the House of what I see as a worrying bubble in consumption spending, and certainly much of it is fuelled by credit card debt. If we look at the level of household debt as a percentage of income, we see that in 1988 it stood at 30 per cent but now it averages 160 per cent. On an economy-wide scale, as we have seen, this leaves us open to economic shocks. On the level of household income, it leaves us open to enormous household income shocks to have an increase in personal debt going from an average of 30 per cent of your income to 160 per cent. We all know that consumption patterns have changed quite remarkably in the last generation. As I said, I am worried about the bubble of credit card fuelled debt that is a feature of our lives today. SoI am very supportive of this motion. Unsolicited credit card limit increase offers are often just too good to be true. Companies use words like ‘Congratulations, your increase is pre-approved’, ‘Get a little more out of every day with a credit limit increase’, ‘This is not something to be missed’ et cetera. But consumer advocates and policymakers are concerned about unsolicited credit card limit increase offer marketing strategies and the likelihood that they will lead to more consumer debt, particularly for low-income and otherwise vulnerable consumers. The Consumer Action Law Centre says that there should be no doubt that banks and credit providers use psychological manipulation to create an environment where certain customers are convinced, often against their better interests, to accept an unsolicited credit card limit increase offer. Creditors are supposed to check a customer’s capacity to repay any extra debt. The increased credit offers get around this by putting in small print: ‘I confirm that if I utilise the new credit limit that is available on my card, I can repay my increased minimum monthly payment of $X as required by lender Y credit card terms and conditions without substantial hardship.’ It is a tiny little line of tiny print at the bottom of the page! We know that people open these letters when they are at their most vulnerable. They may have two credit cards maxed out. They may have a store card which has some fantastic rate of interest. They may have an interest-free period that is just running out with Harvey Norman. All of these may be combining and this may seem like an offer that they simply cannot resist. When they should be going to a financial counsellor and saying, ‘Let’s get this sorted out and get into control again,’ they are in fact just taking these offers of extra debt. I do not want this to be a bank-bashing exercise. It has been quite accurately pointed out that the banks run responsible account management practices, but I think they have let their credit card arms get out of hand and I think they need pulling back into line. I do not think it is something unreasonable for the banks to do. I know they probably feel quite defensive after the motion here tonight, but I urge them not to feel defensive but to take action and recognise that, from a consumer’s point of view, enough is enough. The Banking and Financial Services Ombudsman found that lenders who do not appropriately investigate the borrower’s capacity MAIN COMMITTEE to pay can be liable for maladministration, but I have never heard of any instances of that, so I do not know that the ombudsman’s office is working effectively in that case. I would like to think it could. Twenty-one letters were analysed by Deakin University Business School researchers in a study of this subject, including one from GE Money which offered a borrower a 39 per cent increase on an existing $10,250 credit card limit, with the opening words ‘I have some great news’. There is no great news in this subject whatsoever, and I urge support of the motion. (Time expired) Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (8.26 pm)-The Rudd Labor government is committed to taking the pressure off family budgets and tackling the problem of spiralling consumer debt with long-term, considered policy. The action proposed by the member for Maranoa to deal with the potential danger of unsolicited credit is in itself neither a solution to the debt burden and other financial problems that many families are already trying to cope with nor a complete protection against the accumulation of further unwise debt. In fact, in the current circumstances one might observe that there is likely to be considerably less appetite for personal credit and less capacity to extend such credit as a result of the present global financial turmoil. Indeed, considering the fact that it was under the Howard government that personal debt exploded to its existing levels, one might say that that particular ship has sailed. I would also note that consumer credit law is currently a responsibility of the state and territory governments. Nevertheless, through the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, the Rudd government has taken the initiative of developing a system of national regulation of consumer credit, to be administered by the Commonwealth. When this occurs, the Commonwealth will be in a position to better monitor the operative framework of consumer protections. Cooperative national regulation of consumer credit, led by the Commonwealth, will provide a consistent regime that addresses the gaps and conflicts that currently exist. The new scheme will introduce licensing, conduct, advice and disclosure requirements that meet the needs of consumers and businesses alike and that will ensure that consumers are better protected in their dealings with credit products and credit providers, including brokers and advisers. We need to address the reasons that people turn to credit they cannot afford and accept credit they have not sought. Common sense tells us that the two main reasons for this are, first and foremost, that people are overwhelmed by financial pressures and, second, a lack of appreciation of the risks and costs involved in taking on debt, especially credit card debt. In those terms, constraining the ability of credit providers to offer increased credit limits may in the end be less effective than increasing the financial literacy of Australians. There are some great programs and information services available to the public. One task of government is to ensure that the financial planning information that is available reaches those who need it through effective financial education, in formal schooling, through government service providers such as Centrelink and through adequate support to non-government service providers such as community legal centres. In my electorate I know that the Fremantle Community Legal Centre receives a steady stream of people who use its financial counselling service. From my time as the solicitor in charge of the Bunbury Community Legal CentreI have seen first hand the desperate financial situations that people can find themselves in and the value therefore of proper financial counMAIN COMMITTEE selling. I look forward to the report of the COAG Business Regulation and Competition Working Group which is due next month and looks at the regulation and provision of financial counselling. I say in conclusion that the action proposed in the motion before us today is presently a matter for state and territory governments, with their jurisdiction over consumer credit laws. Nevertheless, it is true that, through COAG and through a range of other measures, this government is committed to tackling the full scope of the reforms needed to protect consumers and to make our financial system more transparent and safely regulated in the interests of Australian families. The issue of unsolicited credit offerings will be considered as part of this process. expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Debate resumed from 15 September. That grievances be noted. Local Food Industry of concern not only to my constituency but to the whole country-and that is concerns for farmers and food producers and the importance of food security in our country. I think it is fair to say that many Australians-many of us, in fact-take for granted access to an abundance of fresh food. Agriculture has long been the cornerstone of our nation, so we have never really questioned our farmers’ ability to produce the fresh food that we all have access to. Indeed, such is the abundance of food production in Australia that much of it is exported to other countries. I think it is quite concerning that many Australian children today do not comprehend where milk comes from, for example, or indeed the grain to bake their bread and provide their breakfast cereal. Many young people are unable to identify a variety of fresh vegetables. Therefore, it is vital for us as elected members of this place to ensure that everyone understands the importance of local food production and the value of farming beyond the mere monetary considerations, because this is an issue of national security and national safety. Times have changed. Many Australian farmers have been battling drought, some for over a decade, and irrigators increasingly battle future water allocations and availability. Those broadacre farmers who have been lucky enough to receive reliable rainfall struggle with the flow-on effects of an industry going through immense change, including cost pressures-as do those who faced drought, which was an added difficulty for them to cope with. Aside from marketing changes and the vagaries of international trade and global markets, one of the largest and most alarming hurdles confronting Australian growers today-our primary food producers, indeed-are sharply rising costs. These are the costs of farm inputs such as chemicals, fertilisers and fuel. All of these are necessities in optimal food production and they have all risen sharply in price.

202,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (8.30 Pm),"It is a great privilege to be able to raise some mattersAustralian people deserve access to local, clean, quality and, dare I say it, affordable produce, but never has the quality and safety of Australian food production been more topical, given recent events in China. However, Australian consumer choice is threatened and it does not help when people do not understand where their produce comes from or how important local food production is. It is not until we lose something, quite often, that we realise how valuable it is. To destroy and lose local farm production would be catastrophic and extremely difficult to reverse in the short term. I think that at no time in our history have we seen a greater demonstration of this than when we had the sustained droughts through north and central New South Wales when I first came into this place in 1993. We saw the flow-on impact to small country towns and communities, and that impact was very dramatic. Some of those businesses that were lost were never re-established, as was the case for many farms. There is now more at stake for our nation’s farmers than ever before, for with higher input costs this season a crop failure would be catastrophic. When you look at the cost of the inputs and the amount of money that farmers might have had to have borrowed to plant the season’s crop, it would be a failure of major proportions. We hope that is not the case. I think we need to be doing a rain dance in this place to make sure that our farmers across the country get good finishing rains this season. costs and how they have gone up, a local fertiliser distributor provided me with the most recent figures on some of the key input costs for growers. Nitrogen, or urea as it is commonly known, which is a crucial fertiliser and in Australian soils is absolutely essential, has risen from $519 a tonne in March 2007 to $598 a tonne this year, with prices expected to hover around $1,146 a tonne in March 2009. Similarly, nitrogen phosphate, or DAP as it is commonly known, went from $594 a tonne in March 2007 to $1,236 a tonne in March of this year. It is anticipated to rise to $1,696 a tonne by March 2009. Potassium, or muriate of potash, is currently $736 a tonne. That is $272 a tonne more than in the year before but an astonishing $491 a tonne less than the predicted March 2009 price. Price rises are not limited to fertiliser. Chemical costs have also risen sharply. Figures supplied by a Landmark store in my electorate illustrate that glyphosate, a weedkiller, doubled in price over the year. The price for 450 active glyphosate in March last year was $4.75 a litre and rose to $6.25 litres in August. It reached $10 a litre in January this year and peaked at $13.50 a couple of months ago. It can be purchased now for $12.50 a litre. I am sure that those figures will not be lost on you, Deputy Speaker Schultz. After years of drought and in some cases low market prices, farm profit margins cannot take further hammerings. Return rates are slim. Sometimes they are as little as 3.5 per cent or below. Farming has become a bigger gamble than ever. For example, a Pearce farmer made their 2009 estimated cash flow calculations available to me. Based on a 5,000 hectare wheat belt cropping and wool property, my constituent calculated a $40.84 profit per hectare, or $204,200 per annum. This number is, however, without the other farm expenses, including personal costs, taxation and repayments, as well as capital purchases. Assuming the season is MAIN COMMITTEE",193,Grievance Debate

206,Mrs Moylan,"Good. We hope that your good luck continues. To illustrate the inputgood, keeping their debt repayments to a minimum, the farm is expected to lose $36.06 a hectare. That is right: it will have a loss, and the loss equates to about $180,300 for the coming year. While this is only one example, the constant high farm input costs, increasing farm financial risk, is taking its toll. I am told that primary producers need between an eight and a 10 per cent return on capital to remain sustainable, so 3.5 to 3.7 just does not cut it. To get over the stumbling blocks, some farmers have indicated that they plan to decrease animal and plant stocks and make cuts to employees and delay yet again the improvement of soils for sustainable farming into the future. These are not really very satisfactory solutions; they are not solutions in the long run for an industry which feeds our country. Nevertheless, farmers are can-do people and Australian producers have become some of the most efficient in the world. Long ago, government subsidies, still large and prevalent in the competing economies of North America and Europe, ceased to be available to the Australian farmer. While some may be of the view that if it is not a profitable enterprise then get out, I do not share that view. Being able to produce food is essential to Australia’s food security and in ensuring that Australian consumers have access to locally produced, high-quality, uncontaminated food. It is well worth examining some of the ways that government can provide policy that assists farmers through difficult times and assists with the continuity of food supply, because it is considered a matter of national priority. Just talking to some farmers in Pearce, it is clear that they do have some constructive ideas on how government can help the agricultural sector. These include-and it is not an inclusive list but just to give some ideas because I am out of time-that the government support alternative or natural phosphate products or fertiliser subsidies; that they implement multiperil crop insurance; and that they accelerate machinery depreciation schedules and make it a flat rate across the board, encouraging greater farmer investment in new machinery. Our farming community contracts will be heavily reliant on imports which will be deeply concerning both in terms of national security and in terms of all Australians having the option to buy quality, reliable produce. (Time expired) BHP Billiton Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (8.40 pm)-My grievance tonight is to focus on the importance of knowledge and research to Newcastle and the nation. The key to my grievance are some of the activities of BHP Billiton that are not endearing it to the people of Newcastle, in particular continued job losses at the BHP Billiton Technology Centre at Shortland. BeforeI reflect upon these job cuts, I want to impart to the House some industrial history. BHP, the big Australian, as it used to be known, commissioned its first steelworks in Newcastle in 1915. It established the Port Waratah Stevedoring Company in 1923. In 1932, it purchased the Lambton colliery near Newcastle. In 1957, it opened its central research laboratories in Newcastle. In 1980, when the Newcastle BHP steelworks were at its peak, it employed 11,500 people. BHP was part of the very fabric of our community and played a huge role in shaping our institutions, culture and economic development. Under the Hawke government, the need for BHP to restructure and modernise was recognised with the 1983 Button steel plan-a $100 million plan that gave bounties to BHP on the production of certain products for five years, gave anti-dumping measures and the promise of productivity improvements and wage restraint from the unions in return for an undertaking to MAIN COMMITTEE keep its three steel plants running, invest in modernisation and protect jobs. The outcome for Newcastle after a specific allocation of $42 million from the government was that the Newcastle steel plant, a plant built in 1912 that produced 1½ million tonnes a year, was closed in 1999 and written off at a cost of $220 million to BHP and a human cost of ongoing hardship for many of the workers of the BHP Newcastle steelworks. The world does change and industry does come and go, but by 1999, when the BHP steelworks closed its doors, its workforce was down to about 2,000 people. When the plant closed, BHP workers walked out with dignity, celebrating with pride the contribution they had made to steel making in Australia. But there was sadness too. Indeed, depression and suicide were a notable legacy of the BHP closure for some time-one less documented perhaps than the $220 million asset write-down to the BHP. Certainly parts of BHP’s operations and infrastructure lived on in Newcastle under different guises. OneSteel, which was split from BHP in 2000, continued and continues downstream with the tube making and wire milling operations-albeit with a much reduced workforce. Indeed, early this year, OneSteel announced that it was closing the former BHP bar mill at Mayfield, with a net loss of about 180 jobs. This was in addition to the 240 jobs lost just before Christmas last year when OneSteel closed its pipe and tube plant. Job losses are always regrettable, but I am amongst the first to acknowledge OneSteel’s industrial and stock market success. When OneSteel was spun off out of BHP, its resources and capital were less than optimum-actually they were appalling. Under the leadership of Geoff Plummer, the Newcastle plant prospered and OneSteel went on to become one of Australia’s most successful companies-a tribute to management, staff and workers who made that possible. When the OneSteel job losses were announced, I did speak with Geoff Plummer and told him of my desire to gain more high-end, smart jobs for Newcastle. Having seen too often plant suffering from lack of investment and jobs walk out of town as a result, I stressed to him the importance of the high-end jobs to embedding and sustaining opportunity in Newcastle. With an average weekly income of $825 in the Hunter region, it is the clever, high-tech jobs that can sustain our long-term growth and prosperity. Another part of BHP’s operations which did continue in Newcastle was its technology centre at Shortland. This centre undertakes research and development on minerals and is part of vital work being undertaken by scientists in institutions all around the nation. Part of my grievance tonight is BHP Billiton’s decision to axe, firstly, 16 contract employees at the Shortland technology centre last month. This decision was announced just hours after BHP announced a record $17.8 billion profit. This is an enormous profit that titillated even the most hardened industry and economic commentators. To put it into perspective, the Commonwealth’s budget surplus this year was $21.7 billion; BHP’s profit was 17.8 billion. Certainly, it came as a shock to us in Newcastle to hear of job losses straight after such a big profit announcement, but things got worse. After a meeting with senior executives from BHP Billiton the week after these job losses were announced it was clear that the future of the remaining 137 workers at the centre was far from assured. I thank Liz McNamara and Bert Nacken from BHP Billiton for responding to my concern and coming, at my request, if not demand, to Canberra to meet with me and to discuss the realignment of their research activities-code for ‘most of the job losses will be in Newcastle’. MAIN COMMITTEE Last week BHP Billiton announced that almost 80 of the permanent scientists at the BHP Technology Centre would lose their jobs in Newcastle, with more losses possible in the next few weeks. BHP have advised that their coal and minerals research projects will now be based in Perth and that other research positions will be redeployed to the Americas. They are, after all, an international company, but I hold grave fears that the Shortland Technology Centre will actually be closed, given that the jobs that do remain at this stage are in marketing and other areas at the lower end of the technology scale. I have made it clear to BHP Billiton that we understand the importance of its contribution to the economy of our region. Newcastle people are currently building the NCIG coal loader, in which BHP is a major partner. We are also involved in the decontamination of the former BHP steelworks site, probably the largest and most complex industrial decontamination activity ever to be undertaken in Australia. BHP Billiton is also the owner of several coal mines in the Hunter Valley. It is the people of Newcastle and the Hunter who dig up that coal, transport it by train to the port of Newcastle and load it onto the ships that deliver it around the world to fuel the global economy. So we do understand the importance of BHP Billiton to our regional economy and we are proud of our contribution, but we do not want to do just the grunt work in Newcastle and we are tired of seeing centres owned by BHP Billiton suffer from a lack of investment and vision, close down and strip Newcastle of further economic opportunity. We are always happy to do the heavy lifting. After all, that is our history-we have done that for 100 years for BHP Billiton. But we want some of the high-end research jobs as well. A 50-year track record in metallurgy and minerals research should leave behind a better legacy for the people of Newcastle and the Hunter than scientific and environmental black holes. I call on BHP Billiton to show leadership in energy research and to rethink how it can best align its research activities with the work being undertaken around clean energy in Newcastle. The Australian government’s approach to encouraging clean energy research and development is a collaborative one that actively seeks industry partnerships with research. I would like to see BHP Billiton using its existing research centre and partnering with the outstanding energy research effort being undertaken in Newcastle. The CSIRO energy flagship in Newcastle is soon to become the national headquarters for the National Solar Institute. It is looking for industry partners to trial solar thermal projects that reduce energy consumption and increase energy efficiency, particularly by big industrial energy users such as steelmakers and electricity generators. Newcastle has a proposal before the government for the establishment of a clean energy innovation centre that would be a centre for information, advice and collaboration for SMEs working on clean energy technologies. BHP Billiton could consider getting involved in just such an innovation centre. It would be an excellent addition to Newcastle and BHP Billiton’s efforts to fight climate change. The government also announced last week a $100 million global institute to speed up the development of carbon capture and storage technology to reduce carbon emissions from blast furnaces and coal-fired power stations. The institute will aim to accelerate carbon capture technology by facilitating demonstration projects and identifying and supporting necessary research. CSIRO and the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies are leading research into CCS and the global institute is an excellent Rudd government initiative to help push this research further and faster. Much of that research has been carried out at the MAIN COMMITTEE Newcastle CSIRO energy flagship and at the University of Newcastle clean energy centre, a part of the CO2CRC. This is in addition to the previously announced National Low Emissions Coal Initiative, a $500 million program to accelerate the development and deployment of technologies that will reduce emissions from coal use. So there are tremendous opportunities for collaboration between governments and industry in clean energy research. It is an opportune time for BHP Billiton to invest in the future of the planet and realign its research efforts to the very concentrated activity being undertaken in Newcastle, the place where it all began for them. We would be more than happy to explore mutual benefits-after all, we have history. The BHP Technology Centre is actually located in a research precinct near the University of Newcastle, which, as I said, conducts excellent research into energy use and efficiency. It is also located two kilometres west of the CSIRO energy flagship-the national flagship. Come on, BHP Billiton. Get with the clean energy program and find a way to make the 100-year investment in Newcastle work to put it at the cutting edge in leading the climate change solutions. I look forward to meeting with Megan Clark from BHP Billiton in the near future to discuss research efforts that could benefit Newcastle, the nation and BHP Billiton. Graffiti graffiti and the fact that this like other antisocial behaviours is in fact everyone’s problem. I am sure all members of this parliament are used to having people come to our offices, ring us up or email us to talk about problem issues that are important to them but by any stretch of the imagination could never be considered to be a federal matter. One of the issues that consistently gets brought to my door is the issue of graffiti. There are some particularly bad problems out there. Rather than just look upon this problem as being a local government or a state government problem, I have always taken this issue on board. My staff are well and truly used to dealing with graffiti, referring that on to the appropriate place to get the problem fixed. This evening I would like to talk a little bit about some of the things that I think work in Cowan and things in Western Australia that I think are about to work a whole lot better now that there has been a change of government over there at the state level. I see my position as the member for Cowan as not only a great responsibility, a welcome responsibility, but also an opportunity to show leadership within the community. I think that too often in schools children and teachers are used to seeing the local member of parliament show up with the flag or say a few words or maybe make a gift presentation at graduation, and that is often where it ends. I have certainly welcomed the opportunities that I have been given and that I have sought to go to schools and talk in some detail about community matters and the strength of community. One of the messages that I like to give to young people and students, whether primary or secondary, is that there is a way to make your mark on the world and the positive way to do it is not by leaving a tag on a wall or burnt rubber on the road but rather by creating or building something good. Often the attitudes that children take into their adult lives come from the examples that their parents have set them. WhatI ask of the children and the young people in these schools that I go to is to stand up and be counted. I tell them that they have great opportunities in their future. I say to them that no matter what the socioeconomics are of the suburb of the school that I am at, any one of them could one day be Prime Minister of this great MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Grievance Debate
207,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (8.50 Pm),"My grievance relates to the ongoing challenge ofcountry. To make a point, this is really all about taking the opportunities of working to achieve one’s goals. To that end and to make these young people feel that they are a stronger part of the community, I have asked them in all of these schools whether they would join my team, which I call the Cowan Community Watch, or the junior version, and work with my office to get things done. I say to them, ‘If you are out there and you see things that are broken in the community, that are marked, that need to be fixed-that are unsafe or whatever-you tell my office and we will work to get them fixed.’ It does not matter whether it is a local government or a state government matter, we will fight for that in any case. That has been well embraced. I have only been to about a quarter of these schools so far and I have got almost 100. While my Cowan Community Watch exists at a senior level and a junior level, I would like to raise some things that have come out of this exercise so far. I have received reports regarding a number of parks in the electorate with graffiti. I have visited most of these locations myself. I observed a number of examples of the most foul and explicit graffiti undertaken in one of these parks done by, as I later found out, year 9 girls who were having a factional dispute, you might say, in their school. I will not name the school, but I went to the principal about it and he got right onto it. The problem has been sorted out. The councils, I understand, are about to clean it up or have already cleaned it up. So that was a great success. I would also like to pay tribute to some of the people who have specifically contributed. Mr Dylan Gardiner of Alexander Heights reported something in the vicinity of 65 graffiti tags within a 50-metre area of Mirrabooka Avenue in Alexander Heights. The officials of the city of Wanneroo got right onto that as soon as we reported it. Often people feel disempowered when they make these types of reports. A person rings the council, or does this or that and then finds that nothing ever seems to happen. We need to encourage people to report and keep reporting. Even if they do not join my team, I will take any reports they have. We follow up the matter and keep going back and forward until the job gets done or until we understand there has been a final result. This is about trying to encourage people to keep reporting to make the community stronger and to make it harder for the bad guys out there to make their mark. I am trying to avoid everyone else feeling they have to give up. In Ballajura, Mrs Margaret Ryan, a well-known activist and a person who really cares, reported some local kids who were marking graffiti or acting suspiciously on a building site. We worked with the city of Swan and the local high school to deal with that. In Landsdale, young Teah Arrowsmith also reported graffiti, which was cleaned up by the city of Wanneroo shortly thereafter. In Koondoola, students from the Waddington Primary School-Muka Jasanovska, Steven Nguyen and Tabitha-reported broken glass, graffiti and broken basketball rings in the local park. These are outstanding efforts from people who have risen to the occasion and have stepped forward to make a difference in the community. I say ‘well done’ to these young people-and we are talking about kids who are about 10 or 11 years old. They have embraced the message, they believe in a stronger community and that is a great step forward for the future. Up in Carramar, Mrs Joanne Wroblewski reported to my office graffiti and damage to a local park. It was not near houses, but we were able to work to get that sorted out and to make the area a bit better protected as well. MAIN COMMITTEE This is just one part of the big picture to try and work against graffiti in the long term. BeforeI sum up I will just move quickly through the state government’s action. As I mentioned, there has been a change of state government in Western Australia. I certainly welcome the return of the Graffiti Taskforce in Western Australia, where state government forces will join with local government to make sure that graffiti is dealt with quickly. This will also be backed up by forcing graffiti criminals-these vandals-to clean up their own mess, which I welcome. I also welcome greater fines for the sale of spray paints to minors. There will be harsher penalties in general and also a renewed focus on tackling graffiti on public transport. Obviously, it is great to start out with changes to laws and law enforcement. That is very important but, at the same time, so is a community attitude of ‘I will not take it any more’and obviously I am not advocating vigilantism. I am saying that it is about people caring enough to make the call and engage with my office. It is working. We have over 150 members at the junior and senior levels, and it is working very well. I think people feel that they are being taken seriously whereas possibly before they were not. The three pillars of success, in my view, in the future will be better laws and law enforcement, better community strength by people wanting to be counted to make society better, and, ultimately, better parenting. That is what it comes down to in the end. As I am sure everyone has said in the past, more parents should look in the mirror and ask: do I want my kids to turn out exactly like me? AmI the best person I can be? That is what it comes down to in the end. Corio Electorate: Tourism ence visitors to Australia during the year ended 30 June 2008. ABS statistics indicate that the national conference market is worth $7 billion in direct expenditure, contributing 0.7 per cent to GDP, while employing some 85,000 people. In terms of location and proximity, there is perhaps no better place in Australia than Geelong at which to host conferences and conventions. Positioned less than 1½ hours flying time from Adelaide, Hobart, Brisbane and Sydney, Geelong is located right in the heart of Australian eastern seaboard activity. To get you there, there is an array of transportation choices. By air you can travel direct to Avalon, Geelong’s own airport, from Brisbane or Sydney. The drive from Tullamarine airport is just over an hour. That airport, as one of Australia’s main international gateways, provides extensive links to the Australian domestic network and beyond. Once you arrive in Geelong, some of the nation’s greatest tourism assets and picturesque vistas await. Positioned on the shores of scenic Corio Bay, Geelong is the gateway to both the Bellarine Peninsula and the Otways and all the fantastic tourist attractions that those areas enjoy-the Great Ocean Road; the Otway National Park, incorporating the award-winning Otway Flyover; many great wineries and restaurants; and, of course, the beaches, including the world-famous Bells Beach. Closer to Geelong you will find major golf courses, great shopping and opportunities to go sailing on Australia’s most beautiful north-facing bay and at the end of the day some fantastic restaurants at which to have a meal and plenty of hotels in which you will get a good night’s rest. These are just some of the reasons that Geelong has already been the site for numerous conferences and corporate events. Currently in the Geelong region there are many smallto medium-sized venues that can cater to the needs of equivalent sized conferences.

208,Mr Marles (Corio) (9.00 Pm),"There were 184,000 international convention or confergreat economic benefit to the region. In the financial year 2007-08, conferences in the region attracted just under 19,000 delegates who stayed an average of 3.7 nights each. These visits provided an economic benefit of $56.5 billion to the regional economy, a figure which was, in itself, a substantial 15 per cent or $7.3 million increase on the previous financial year. However, these figures represent the tip of the iceberg as they are only reflective of conferences that are organised through Geelong Otway Tourism’s business unit. There are many venues that take bookings directly and the revenue their activities generate is unquantifiable. However, what is clearly indicated in the data is that the Geelong region has a well-established basis for conferences’ success. With a further 25 conferences confirmed through Geelong Otway Tourism and another 10 currently under consideration, equating to a forecast of $40.6 million in regional revenue, we have evidence that suggests the assets and resources of the region, whether natural or otherwise, are combining to make Geelong an attractive proposition for the conference market. What must now be considered are ways to build upon this existing success. In my former role at the ACTU, at one stage I was tasked with organising what is a major event on the ACTU calendar, the ACTU congress. The equation on that event is simple-three days and 1,000 participants-although, as I was to discover, the answer was not so easy to find. Having had a successful congress in Wollongong in the year 2000, we were keen to have another regional centre as the host for the 2003 conference, thinking that it would both aid the conference by keeping delegates in a more confined area and provide a more tangible economic benefit to whichever region could accommodate us. As a local resident, my first inquiries were made through the various Geelong venues that are available, hoping I would be able to find a financially competitive option. This was a great opportunity to showcase Geelong’s many attributes but to my dismay I was to discover that value for money would not be the issue; rather, there were no venues large enough or with adequate floor plans to meet our requirements. Subsequent searches across other regional centres returned similar results and ultimately the 2003 congress was held in Melbourne. This was an opportunity lost. Had Geelong had sufficient resources to accommodate the ACTU’s congress requirements, the potential windfall to the local economy would have been huge. Research indicates that conference delegates spend an average of $300 per night, compared to $112 per night for all visitors. When you equate those figures with a three-day conference of 1,000 delegates, as was the case with the ACTU congress, you discover the potential revenue lost as a result of having inadequate facilities was in the vicinity of $1 million. The indicators are clear. Geelong has what continues to prove an attractive site in which to host conferences and conventions, but to maintain the momentum and increase the appeal the region must seek to cater to larger conferences, for therein lies tremendous economic and employment potential. It is for these reasons that I am tonight adding my voice to those who are currently in support of establishing a large-scale conference venue in central Geelong which will cater for in excess of 1,000 patrons in classroom-style seating. Existing plans developed by the City of Greater Geelong have centred on the design of a facility able to cater for between 1,250 and 1,500 seated delegates, which will also provide for an exhibition space of between 3,000 and 4,000 square metres. Moreover, this tri-level design allows for multiple plenary areas and break-out rooms. It is formulated with future expansion space incorporated and includes provisions for ancillary facilities such as parking, a 200-plus MAIN COMMITTEE bed hotel, retail and associated services. While blueprints for a final proposal have not yet been generated, I feel that the principles displayed in the building design process to date are sound and cater for the major attributes needed by this type of facility. Financial forecasting conducted by council and based on existing plans provides further indications of the potential benefits the creation of this facility could entail. Preliminary data suggests that in the first 20 years of operation the facility would generate direct revenue of approximately $356 million, while Geelong’s businesses and services also stand to benefit, with analysis concluding that for the same 20-year period the wider community would reap in net terms approximately $423 million. Combined, this would mean a forecast $779 million in extra revenue coming into the region. The existing design would also facilitate the creation of 617 direct jobs in initial construction and in the ongoing maintenance and staffing of the facility, with a further 715 indirect jobs created in the wider community through increased consumption and tourist expenditure. Furthermore, the facility could provide a focal point for local businesses and education facilities to conduct their own activities like graduation ceremonies and meetings. By providing an enhanced ability to forecast large influxes of people into the region, there would be increased opportunities for tourism sector expansion through the provision of such activities as preand post-conference delegate holidays and day trips. Clearly there are benefits that can be drawn from the creation of a large convention centre in the heart of Geelong, be they financial, social or cultural. It is my opinion that the processes undertaken by the council to date in seeking to further this project have been consultative and considered. They have engaged relevant stakeholders and sought their input. But two of the largest issues that will still need to be overcome throughout the planning process are those of location and financing. On the issue of location, the council’s existing planning processes identified 10 potential sites. In choosing those sites, council officers in direct discussion with Geelong Otway Tourism, Tourism Victoria and the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment created a selection matrix factoring in issues of ownership, topography, strategic positioning, traffic and access, acoustics, urban design and planning. The end result was the formulation of three preferred sites, all centred on the inner Western Wedge and Cunningham Pier precincts. I firmly believe that in the ultimate decision-making process of choosing the most appropriate site for this facility it is incumbent on our city to make greatest use of its natural assets. To my mind, one of the most important assets available to us in Geelong is Corio Bay. It is a bay with so many positive natural attributes, from its protected and placid waters to its northern aspect and scenic vistas, and it is further enhanced by the excellent facilities that are now either established or under construction along the Eastern Beach area. What better image could we offer those seeking conference facilities than a site that takes in all of the beauty and charm of Corio Bay? What better image to leave with those who visit our region? Corio Bay should be a central element in the site selection process from here on in. Financially, the figures I previously outlined should serve as an inducement to any potential investors. With the facility forecast to reap $356 million in direct revenue over its first 20 years of operation, there is a clear enticement for private sector involvement, and I think this should be encouraged. As the federal member for Corio, I will continue to lobby governments for funds that will benefit the future prosperity of the Geelong region, but I also feel it is imMAIN COMMITTEE portant that Geelong not become government dependent. The great cities of the world have developed their own prosperity and investment and I think that Geelong, as an actor on both the national and world stages, should be seeking to do the same. We need to be actively pursuing every private sector option that is possible for the building of a convention centre. I look forward to working with the council and other relevant stakeholders over the coming months to see this important project come to fruition and for Geelong to further stake its claim as the conference centre of Australia. Flinders Electorate: Human Security cause grievance in relation to human security in the electorate of Flinders. I will start if I may at a railway crossing I attended on Saturday. It was the Bungower Road railway crossing in Somerville. We were in the presence of Gwen Bates. Gwen Bates is the mother of Kay Stanley, who, sadly, was killed at another railway crossing along this particular line-the Frankston to Stony Point line. When she approached the railway crossing, she was unable to see the flashing lights in the sunlight and there were no boom gates. Gwen Bates is not able to revisit the site of the loss of her daughter so a group of perhaps 40 to 50 people visited the Bungower Road site. The reason we visited it is that it is also, in an urban area, a railway crossing that has no boom gates. It is also the site where, sadly, a local resident, Geoff Young, was lost in the not too distant past. There are still no boom gates at the Bungower Road crossing, nor are there boom gates to be found at the Baxter-Tooradin Road, Reid Parade, Urquhart Court, Park Lane, Disney Street or the HMAS Cerberus main entrance. This is an urban area that has seven railway crossings with no boom gates. These are, sadly, just two examples of which I am personally aware, having visited the site where Geoff Young was lost-and I pay respects to his family-and having spent much time with Gwen Bates who has embarked upon a very simple campaign since the loss of her daughter, Kay. She wants to see every urban railway crossing in Victoria have boom gates and then ultimately see every railway crossing, urban or rural, have boom gates. An accident is an all too frequent occurrence and as Gwen has said, ‘In this day and age, in the 21st century, if you can find $16 million for a Cezanne painting, surely you can find money to cover all of the railway crossings in the state.’ It is I think a fair ordering of priorities. I think that represents something of profound importance. When you come into contact with somebody who months after the event is still convulsed by an uncontrollable grief, it causes all of us as legislators and as elected representatives to remind ourselves of the profound human duty we have in this chamber-in this place-to make sure that we deal with the critical and human security needs. Covering our crossings to make sure that there are no more tragedies like Geoff Young’s and to make sure that there are no more tragedies like Kay Stanley’s-who was, as Gwen Bates has reminded me on many occasions, carrying her grandchild-is something that we have to do. There is no question in my mind. This brings me to two other profoundly important human security needs within the electorate of Flinders. On Phillip Island the closure of Warley Hospital has led to the loss of critical care facilities. That is, sadly, something which has happened since the change of government. We had a $2½ million package and it was funding which was to go to the Warley Hospital to keep it open. That money was not matched by the incoming government. That was not expected. It was one of those areas where I had genuinely believed an offer by our side would MAIN COMMITTEE",200,Grievance Debate
209,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (9.10 Pm),"I want to speak this evening about three issues whichhave been matched by the other side. That sadly was not to be and my grievance with the minister has been made elsewhere. The result of that however is real and continuing. This week what we saw on the front of the Phillip Island paper was very clear. In the Phillip Island and San Remo Advertiser there were stories of residents who have come close to death, and it was revealed that medical staff on the island had witnessed an alarming scene, with nurses or critical care people literally having to fight, plead and beg Melbourne hospitals for a bed, given that there were no emergency facilities left on Phillip Island for a patient to receive the lifesaving medical attention they needed. This is the 21st century. This follows on from what I said about the railway lines. Of course the path of human progress means that there are always many gaps that we need to fill and our needs grow. I recognise this. But there are areas where we have gone backwards. The loss of a hospital, after the new government walked away from a package which had been agreed with the hospital previously, puts residents in rural Australia in real and present danger. This is not some political talk; this is the evidence of families who have faced risk and in many cases have had enormous hardship. I have met with families who since the loss of Warley Hospital have had to travel well and truly off the island, sometimes for an hour and a half, sometimes for two hours, in critical moments to find a bed. As a result, in a community with many elderly people, there is a great deal of uncertainty, a great deal of emotional hardship, and that personal security which was guaranteed by the presence of a hospital on the island has been lost. This is a grievance debate, and I grieve the loss of this hospital. I grieve the fact that neither the federal nor the state government in December 2007 and January 2008 were willing to take responsibility. We heard a lot about the blame game, but this was a classic example where neither the new federal government nor the state government were willing to take responsibility, and a hospital died. A community lost its history and an important part of its human security and future. The message is very simple: Phillip Island needs high-quality medical care. If the government will not resurrect the hospital, it must do everything to dramatically improve the quality of care and services to a level which, at the very least, equals that which was there previously. Concern for senior residents brings me to my third area, and that is in relation to another part of my electorate, the southern peninsula. This area-Rye, Rosebud, Dromana, Tootgarook, all of these towns-is home to perhaps the greatest concentration of seniors within Victoria. My electorate of Flinders is the demographically oldest electorate in Victoria. It has the highest proportion of seniors over the age of 60, with a heavy concentration in the beautiful area of the southern peninsula in particular. It is a natural retirees’ home. We have seen an increase over the last six months in the demand for food vouchers, and financial support has soared to unprecedented levels. This is a matter of deep human concern. I do not blame the current government for that. It is part of the challenges of the times, but I do say that we are responsible, on each of our watches, for that which we do to respond to new challenges which arise in our time, on our turf. The Vinnies Kitchen at Rosebud has served nearly 500 extra meals so far this year on top of its usual service. The Salvation Army is helping 200 struggling residents a month, many of whom are seniors, in particular pensioners who are struggling on what they have to make ends MAIN COMMITTEE meet. These are people who have served Australia, who have helped build Australia and who are suffering quite dramatically. The combination of low pensions, rising fuel prices-and fortunately we are seeing some amelioration on that front-increasing grocery costs and soaring housing costs has contributed to this problem. Against that background of new events in new circumstances under a new watch, we need to take steps which will help our most senior residents. That is why I respectfully but categorically say to the new federal government that it is time to reconsider the opposition to the $30 a week rise in the base pension rate for single pensioners. Each new generation and each new government has new challenges and new responsibilities. These new challenges to pensioners must be met. These are people who deserve better. I pray that they are supported. (Time expired) Blair Electorate: Dinmore Meatworks the electorate of Blair, which is one of the largest meat processing plants in Australia. Some 18,000 beasts are killed weekly across 11 shifts for the beef export market. The plant is run by Swift Australia Pty Ltd, which advertises itself as the industry leader. Swift Australia is a subsidiary company of JB Swift and Co., which is made up of 40,000 people with plants and offices on five continents. Its origins were in Brazil. It advertises itself as the global leader in the meat processing industry. It says on its website that it is Australia’s largest and most successful meatpacker and exporter and that it is proud of what it does to provide the world with the safest and the most reliable beef products on the market today. There are about 2,300 employees at Dinmore, including approximately 340 Chinese and 110 Brazilians and their dependents on 457 visas. Since November 2007, there have been repeated stand-downs. The workers there have lost more than three weeks of work. The standdowns started last year and also occurred in February, June and July 2008. In August 2008, the workers there were forced to take annual leave. The plight of these workers has been the subject of much consternation and media attention, including through my local daily newspaper, the Queensland Times, which says that that union condemns foreign labour. It has also reached the Courier Mail as well. The Courier Mail reported that they take local jobs, and so they do. Instead of cutting back the kill, which the company could do so that the workers could work full time, the company has stood down the workers. Working two, three or four days a week means that workers struggle to make ends meet. They struggle to pay their mortgages, feed their families and clothe their children. The company says that it cannot get enough cattle, but instead of keeping its workforce intact by cutting back on the kill, according to the workers whom I have met, its policy has caused a reduction in the number of Australian workers at the plant. These workers feel compelled to leave Dinmore meat works because they cannot get enough income to meet their household needs and so look for full-time work elsewhere. The workers tell me that the company, because it must pay its foreign workers a minimum salary level under the labour agreement for 457 visas whether they work or not, prefers to employ foreign workers on the shifts. Therefore the Brazilians and Chinese work on these shifts when Australian workers could do the jobs. The company says that it needs the 457 visa MAIN COMMITTEE",203,Grievance Debate
210,Mr Neumann (Blair) (9.20 Pm),"My grievance relates to the Dinmore meat works inholders because it cannot find Australian workers in sufficient numbers in the local areadespite the fact that Ipswich is the fastest growing area in South-East Queensland. The 457 visas are part of the Rudd government’s approach to meeting short-term shortages in skilled labour in industry. The 457 visa is not designed to replace Australian jobs. It is there to supplement, not displace. The labour agreement makes that very clear at paragraph 8.55; it makes that very plain. This is not to happen. Any suggestion that companies are doing this is a very great worry. It is simply wrong for the company to do this and it is unacceptable. It is unacceptable to the people in my electorate; it is unacceptable to the workforce at Dinmroe. Last Saturday, I met with Russell Carr, who is the general secretary of the AMIEU, the union organiser Ian McLaughlin, commonly known as Macca, and a group of workers to discuss this issue. They are very aggrieved about what is going on. They have had some discussions with management, but they have proved fruitless. The management says that they will get back to them from time to time, but they have not been able to get commitments from management to correct this. I had a meeting this morning with Chris Evans, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, and made very strong representations on behalf of the workers. They are my constituents and some of them also live in the federal electorate of Oxley. It is time to send the company a message, and I am pleased the minister has done so. He assures me that officials from the department will meet tomorrow in South-East Queensland with representatives of the company. I would urge the company to change its practice, to heed the representations of its workers and to listen to the departmental officials tomorrow. The Commonwealth has wide-ranging powers of sanction, including suspension of the processing of visa applications-which I would describe as the nuclear option. I am also happy to offer my electorate office at the Brassall Shopping Centre, which is a very busy shopping centre in my electorate in Ipswich, as a place where departmental officials can meet with workers who are too frightened to actually go public. If they wish to make complaints and discuss the issue with departmental officials, I am happy for them to meet in my office. I would invite the company to meet with me, though the parliamentary sitting has prevented me from arranging that. I have known the manager, John Berry, for many years. He is a good and decent man who is firm but fair. He is very community minded and it surprises me that John has been part of this. I think the pressure would have to have come from above. It is time to stop turning full-time Australian jobs into part-time jobs and outsourcing them to foreign workers. I am pleased that the minister has issued a press release today, and I will deal with that in a minute. Paragraph 8.33 of the labour agreement makes it plain that the company must satisfy the agreement in terms of its efforts to reduce its reliance on temporary overseas workers and it must report on its efforts, its experience and the outcome to the department. The workers tell me they see little evidence of a reduction in the use of 457 visas. Under paragraph 8.41 of the labour agreement, the company must ensure the primary visa applicants are skilled meatworkers. They tell me that the workers are variable in terms of their language skills and their skills and talents in boning, slicing and other activities at the meat works. This has an impact on occupational health and safety of course. So we have variable skilled workers and some Brazilians who have come over here, as I understand it, to learn about the meatworking industry. My advice from the workers is that these Brazilians do not want to work for the company MAIN COMMITTEE back in Brazil because of its labour hire practices. They come to Australia, learn the skills and the trade, take Australian jobs and then go back to Brazil. The minister has issued a warning today and he has issued a press release today. The minister has said that the Rudd government will not tolerate employers continuing to access foreign workers on temporary skilled migration 457 visas while denying local workers job opportunities. And he has issued a warning to the company. He makes it very plain that the subclass 457 visa scheme is a skilled migration program designed to assist employers who have skill shortages when local workers cannot be sourced. Departmental officials tomorrow, I am instructed, will ensure the company gets the message loud and clear that they are not to deny local workers employment opportunities in the circumstances. It must abide by the conditions of the meat industry labour agreement. It is a condition for access to meat industry labour agreements that Australian workers are not displaced or replaced by overseas temporary workers. Labour agreement holders such as Swift Australia must have a proper plan put in place to reduce their reliance on 457 visas. If they do not, they breach the conditions of the labour hire agreement. I would like the minister, if they are doing this, to throw the book at them. The Rudd government is committed to a strong, temporary skilled migration program, but we need to ensure that workers are not ripped off. We need to ensure integrity in the system. We need to ensure that people living in the Ipswich area who work in the meat industry are provided with full-time employment and training opportunities. We cannot have Australian workers’ jobs turned into part-time jobs and have that exacerbated by the recruitment of migrant workers. We need to train our skilled workers even better in boning, slicing and slaughtering. It was a great privilege for me to get my first job in life in the meat industry at Dinmore meat works. My father worked there, my uncle worked there and my three cousins worked there. I appreciate the fact that AMH, who was then the employer of choice, employed me in that regard, but I urge the company to do the right thing by the workers and their families and the people of Ipswich. I really hope that we see an improvement in the labour practices and I have faith that the minister will heed my representations. Debate adjourned.
