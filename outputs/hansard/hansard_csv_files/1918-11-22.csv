The Board has sent to me a letter, in which it says that it trusts that the Government may see its way clear to reconsider the matter, and continue the supply, as the reports are of the greatest use to the shipping community, and very extensively referred to. The Board's offices are situated on the wharf, and the reports are exhibited in a case outside, which has been specially made for the purpose. The Board is of opinion that the discontinuance of the reports will cause great inconvenience to shipping masters, shipping agents, and other persons who are in the habit of consulting them and the maps issued in connection with them. Can the Minister see his way to re-issue these valuable reports, which are evidently greatly appreciated hy the public ? the amount of money made available for the purpose.

I propose, if I am permitted, to make a statement on the subject of the Wheat Pool before the House rises to-day. In the meantime I may say that I am not sure there will be a Wheat Pool next year unless certain matters are cleared up. I do not propose to allow the Commonwealth Government to be embarrassed by these frequent attacks. Whilst seeking to help .the wheat fanners, Ministers seem to be treated as a band of bandits desirous of robbing them. As to whether there will be any wheat scrip in a Pool which is managed in some other way, I cannot say at this stage, but I am heartily sick and tired of the attacks made upon a Government which is endeavouring to discharge an important national function.

49,Mr Groom (Darling Downs,"Minispost meridiem, reckoned according to Greenwich standard time, until the issue of a protermination would lead to endless con-clamation by the Governor General that the war between His Majesty the King and the -German Emperor and between His Majesty the King and the Emperor of Austria, King -of Hungary, has ceased. That means that, at the conclusion of the -war, a proclamation would issue, and -thereupon the War Precautions Act and the regulations under it would, generally speaking, cease to operate. It is to meet the difficulties' arising put of that situasued. tion that this B ill is introduced. As the -end of the war has, to all appearances, now almost been reached, it has opened up -to the various Governments problems no less complex than those which arose when the great conflict began. The far-reaching nature of the operations of the war -necessitated the exercise of extraordinary -emergency powers, .the administrative in trusion on the part of the Government 'int o areas of finance, industry, product i o n , and distribution never before contemplated, and an interference with the rights of individuals and their freedom -of action of a character quite alien to the customs of our race. By the exercise of these"" extraordinary powers, there have been built up various governmental and semi-governmental national interest. The problems now before the Government involve the gradual restoration of the community to its normal peace conditions. -Government are to govern, as f a r as possible, without undue recourse to these extraordinary powers during the period of transition from war to peace, and to establish as speedily as possible normal conditions. But the sudden cessation of the --activities which have arisen in consequence effect between the measure and the desired -of the war could not be accomplished with, out danger to the community, financial ;and commercial loss of a serious character, and a grave disturbance of social and -economic conditions. It is quite impossible, therefore, to allow a sadden termination of various Acts and regulations in troduced to meet the conditions arising -out of the war. To do so would involve the community in chaos and disaster. Many of the war activities have become so interwoven in-the commercial and indust r i a l life of Australia that their sudden fusion. To secure the public safety and the defence of the Commonwealth, it became necessary here, as elsewhere, to enact the War Precautions Act, and to delegate to the Executive a very wide discretion in the making of regulations and orders. Under the authority of that Act, a large number of regulations and orders were isThe main body were framed for defence purposes only, and were supplementary to the powers exercised under the Defence Act. Others were closely allied, but were meant to safeguard national safety and well-being. These dealt w i th such matters as the control of aliens and enemy subjects, and the prevention of in ternal trouble and disaffection. Other regulations were passed in the exercise of that wider power of defence as interpreted by the H i g h Court in the case of Farey v. Burvett (21 C.L.R.), and were meant to safeguard the nation's economic and financial resources, both for local and Imperial purposes. Referring to the nature of the defence power under the Constitution, the Chief Justice( Sir Samuel Griffith) saidactivities in the I agree generally with Mr Mann's argument that the power to legislate with respect to defence extends to any law which may tend to the conservation or development of the resources of the Commonwealth so far as they can be directed to success in war, or may tend The aims and intentions of the to distress the enemy or diminish his resources, as, fbr instance, by the prohibition of trading with him or with persons associated with him. But this definition is not exhaustive. The control of finance or trade may be the most potent weapon of all. One test, however, must always be applied, namely : Can the measure in question conduce to the efficiency of the forces of the Empire, or is the connection of cause and efficiency so remote that the one cannot reasonably be regarded as affecting the other Applying this well established doctrine, the question is whether the Act and regulationthe validity of which is now called in question -ca n be regarded as substantial laws relating to defence; in other words, whether the provisions of the regulation can conduce to the more effectual prosecution of the war. ft is not necessary for the Court to point out theparticular way in which they can have that effect. But the Court may, I think, fake judicial notice of the fact that the past season's harvest was most abundant, and that vast quantities of wheat, far exceeding the possible consumption of the Commonwealth, are awaiting export; while, owing to the operations of war, the supply of freight is deficient. It is obvious that for economical, as well as other reasons, the export of the surplus to the United Kingdom or the Allied nations may be highly desirable for the more efficient prosecution of the war. It seems to follow that any law which may tend, with or without the aid of other measures, to encourage such export, may be conducive to the more efficient conduct of the war. Mr Justice Isaacs saidAsI read the Constitution, the Commonwealth, when charged with the duty of defending the Commonwealth and States, is armed as a self-governing portion of the British Dominion with the legislative power to do in relation to national defence all that Parliament, as the legislative organ of the nation, may deem advisable to enact, in relation to the defence of Australia as a component part of the Empire. A power which is commensurate with the peril it is designed to encounter, or as that peril may appear to the Parliament itself; and, if need be, it is a power to command, control, organize and regulate, for the purposes of guarding against the peril, the whole resources of the continent, living and inert, and the activities of every inhaEitant of the territory. The problem of national defence i's not confined to operations on the battle-field or the-3eck of a man-of-war; the factors enter into every phase of life, and embrace the co-operation of every individual with all that he possesses-hi s property, his energy, his life itself; and, in this supreme crisis we can no more sever the requirements and efforts of the civil population whose liberties and possessions are at stake from the movements of our soldiers and sailors, who are defending them, than we can cut away the root of a living tree and bid it still live and bear fruit deprived of the sustenance it needs. Each of the three classes of regulations to presents problems to be considered by the what date the warwill end. It Government with respect to the terminamay be that the Peace Conference tion of the lawful authority upon which will meet early and come they rest, and with respect to the policy to a decision. On the contrary, the disaspect as regards the date upon they should cease. At this stage, owing to can predict exactly what w ill happen, and the unsettled conditions existing, and the because of that we must have certainty impossibility which normal conditions will be restored larly in regard to the great financial in the community, it is impossible to fix operations that have been undertaken the date at which the particular exercised in each case can terminate.

In the Commonwealth we have passed a large number of Actsi n which that or similar terms are used. This commiteee in Great Britain reported as to the'date of the end of tlie warWe assume that the war will be ended by a treaty or treaties of peace. In order to arrive at a final conclusion of the treaty, various stages will probably be required, such as' agreements for armistices, cessation of hostilities thereunder, articles of peace, agreement of turms, signature of terms, ratification, exchangeor deposit of ratification. In our opinion, speaking of legislation generally, the war cannot be said to have ceased until peace is finally and irrevocably obtained, and that point of time cannot be earlier than the date wlften the treaty of peace is finally binding on the respective belligerents, and that is the date when ratifications are exchanged. means the extension of the Act for twelvemonths. say at this stage exactly o n quickly which cussions may be very prolonged.

We are asking, among other reasons, for an extension of the Act in order not to prejudice the continuance of these and other activities, involving vast financial considerations, until we ascertain the legal position in regard to them. The chairman of the Wool Committee advises that the Imperial Government has arranged to purchase the Australian wool clip for the period up till the termination of one complete wool season. after the close of the war. Hence the activities of the Central Wool .Committee must continue in operation for a considerable period after the close of the war. The Chief Prices Commissioner advises that the Commonwealth Government is committed in the matter of the export of butter and cheese for one season after the declaration of peace, namely, at least until the end of the year 1920. 'The Dairy Produce Pool Committee has been elected to office, under the War Precautions Regulations, until 30th June, 1920. I come now to another phase of this . question, to which I would draw special attention, and which I hope will not be lo3t sight of by honourable members when exercising their judgment with respect to this proposal. With regard to the moratorium, the Farmers Union has asked for an extension of the time for the War Precautions moratorium as applied to pastoral and agricultural interests. active service moratorium regulations, . dealing with certain mortgages, and sales, and purchases of land, postpone payments, by soldiers and their dependants in certain cases until six months after the duration of the war. What would be the effect on the commimity if , on the declaration of peace, the War Precautions Act and the regulations under it ceased to operate, with the result that many of these mortgages could be forthwith called upl known for four years that that would bet-he position at the end of the war? not know when the war was likely to end.

Each of the instances to which I havereferred indicates the necessity for someprolongation of the Act. The Government do not desire to extend its provisionsin order to initiate new matters of policy,, and the .power to make new regulations^ will be exercised only in case of national necessity. Though the operation of the Act be extended, it is the intention of the Government that immediate action shall be taken to consider and repeal regulations or orders no longer necessary, and to remove governmental control as soon-as possible in all cases where it is practicable or advisable to do so. Questions of policy affecting the industries concerned, as well as questions of law, are involved, and have to be considered. It may be necessary, in some cases in the future, to ask Parliament to extend existing activities and regulations beyond the period contemplated by this measure. In those cases> however, Parliament will be specially appealed to by the Government. There are also other Statutes of an emergency character deal-",27,Second Reading

Simpson, and Mr J. M . Campbell. The Attorney General for the time being will be the chairman of the Committee. In the United Kingdom advantage has also been taken of the assistance offered by members of the legal profession. As regards the regulations under the War Precautions Act dealing with defence matters, many will not need to be continued, or the powers under them exercised. As regards those relating to internment, no definite announcement can be made at present, as it is understood the question of the inbeneficially in the interests of Australia. ternment of civilians is one of those matters which will have to be settled at the Peace Conference The action of the Government with respect to this matter, and upon the question of enemy subjects generally, must be to a great extent guided by Imperial policy. As regards the censorship, the Government has no. desire to control this beyond what is absolutely necessary. Until at least peace is signed, some control in the national interest is essential. In the United Kingdom the discussion of peace terms is the subject of censorship. However, the censorship has already been relaxed -with respect to shipping and other matters, and the general policy will be to restore as speedily as possible the right, of expression of .public opinion and freedom of discussion. The regulations dealing with commercial and financial matters involve consideration as regards their operation, and their future extension, even beyond the term contemplated by this Act, has to be seriously considered. One or two instances might be mentioned. The control and management of the wool scheme has been created under the authority of the Meanwhile, to adWar Precautions Begulations for the purpose of carrying into effect the purchase by the Imperial Government of the Australian wool clip. The duties involved in(a) the display and handling and reconditioning of wool; ( I ) the appraisement of its value; (fi) scouring and repacking as necessary; (d) provisions for its storage until shipment; as and when space becomes available; and ( f ) financial arrangements involved. The activities of the Wool Committee include also the handling of sheepskins. The mere reference to this activity shows how impossible it is to contemplate its sudden termination. The purchase operates for a ful l wool year after the close, of the war, so that definite steps of necessity must be taken for the continuance of a scheme which is operating so As to dairy produce, under the War Precautions (Dairy Produce Pool) Regulations 1918, important duties are imposed upon the Committee constituted under the regulations. Its duty is, among other things(a) to provide, as far as possible, butter and cheese for consumption in the Commonwealth; (6) to make such arrangements as it deems necessary with regard to sales of butter and cheese to the Imperial Government and other sales for export; (c) to acquire for storage on such a basis and conditions as will, as far as possible, prevent any factory obtaining an advantage over any other factory, such butter and cheese as it deems necessary in order to meet any shortage that may occur within the Commonwealth ; (d) to hold the produce in cold stores; (e) to arrange for its safe custody -and insurance; (/) to use the butter and cheese in such manner as it deems fit, and to supply it during any period of shortage to those places and States wherein shortage is expected; (cj) to insure certain matters as regards prices. have already been made that will operate, probably, to 1920. The Committee also, with the approval of the Treasurer, make certain financial arrangements. I have already mentioned that the duration of these regulations is required for some time after the close of the present war. In addition, mention might be made of the regulations, concerning cornsacks, regulations concerning patents, and also regulations controlling prices. At the commencement of the present sittings of Parliament, the Government promised to put price fixing on a more satisfactory basis by introducing a Bill in substitution for the numerous regulations under the ""War Precautions Act, hy which price fixing is controlled at the prethe extension which is to make complete sent time. The termination of hostilities, and the prospects of an early peace, in the opinion of the Government, render this course unnecessary. It is not intended to dispense with the existing regulations immediately. Some time must elapse before trade and commerce can be restored to pre-war conditions. The position will, however, be carefully watched, and as opportunity offers the individual articles will be released from control. ment are not losing control. we. We say that as the conditions gradually come back to normal there will be a relaxation of the powers. It is not intended to extend the operations of the Price-fixing Department unless there appears to be grave cause to do so. At the same time, the Government wants the trading public to understand that, pending the return of normal conditions, they will not permit undue advantage to he taken of abnormal conditions existing, or that may arise, in the interim during the transition period before ""shipping and trade resume their usual channels. I have referred to a few of the commercial activities that need consideration, and obviously their sudden termination cannot be contemplated even by the i m mediate cessation of the war, so closely associated as they are with the commercial, industrial, and economic conditions of Australia. It is for reasons such as I have stated, that it is essential to extend the operation of the Act beyond the period prescribed by the present law. The Bill states in its preamble its purposes. It recites the fact thatWhereas the Act and regulations and orders thereunder continue in operation during the present state of war, and no longer, and whereas it may not be possible before the war has ceased to make complete provision for a return to the normal conditions of peace, 'and whereas the extension of the said Act and a l l regulations and orders made thereunder, in. the absence of such provision, would cause great public danger and inconvenience. The preamble points to the necessity for provision for a return to the normal conditions of peace, and recites the results likely to arrive in the absence of such extension"" great public danger and inconvenience."" . Clause2 provides that the period of extension is, as I have stated, for six months after the war and no * longer. The Bill also declares that all regulations and proclamations lawfully made pursuant to the principal Act shall, except in so far as they are amended or repealed, continue in operation for a similar period. There is also a proviso that any regulation or order or proclamation heretofore made orany provision therein contained operating by force of its terms for a longer period than six months after the termination of the war, shall remain in force, unless amended or repealed, during theperiod provided therein The effect of this clause will be to continue the existing regulations and to provide for the continued operation for a period longer than six months after the",28,Second Reading

It is presumed that the peace terms themselves will deal with the question of the treatment of enemy subjects; and ""this clause is inserted as a precautionary step to enable us to deal with oonditions which may arise out of the peace terms themselves or the conditions then existing.

Debate resumed from 21st November (vide page 8203), on motion by Mr WISEThat this B ill be now read a second time. seems to me strange that it should have been necessary for this Parliament to pass so many amendments of the original Defence Act. I believe that up to the present there have been ten amendments of that measure, and the Bill now under consideration is the twelfth of such amending Bills that have been introduced. The Government have gone so far as to have proposed two amendments of the Defence Act this year. It is more strange still that a further amendment of the Act parently the final flutter of the war is at an end, and the services of the Australian Imperial Force are no longer required in the field. If there is one thing which, more than another, honourable members on both sides desire, it is that every honour should be accorded to the men who took their lives and their courage in both hands, aiid went abroad to preserve the benefits of the freedom and liberty we enjoy in Australia and throughout the British Empire. I feel sure that honourable members are determined that the men who have gone overseas to fight for this country shall have justice done them.

I clo not care what position may have been held by "" stay-at-homes "" in Australia; they may have been wonderful organizers, but if they had been imbued with the true military spirit no chains would have prevented them from doing a soldier's' duty when such a duty required to be done.

135,Mr Page,"Why put it in the Bill-first, to say how glad I am, as one of the soldier members of this House, that the Government have at last seen fit to rectify one of the many grievances of the returned officers of the Australian Imperial Force. I am now referring to the proposed amendment of section 20 of the principal Act. Up to the present time returning officers of the Australian I m perial Force, upon joining the Reserve Forces, have been ranked junior to officers in our Citizen Forces-officer s who have never left Australia. The proposed amendment will do away with that anomaly, and give seniority to those who have actually fought in the defence of this country. Incidentally, it will abolish much of the discontent .that is felt towards the officers of our Citizen Forces who have remained at home. I have in my mind one specific case-that of a sergeant major who enlisted for service abroad, and who came back to Australia as a captain, with the military cross on his breast. penalty with their lives. Upon his return he was obliged to drop his rank and salute officers who had never left Australia. That was certainly not a proper thing. Biit under the amendment which is now proposed he will become senior to those officersa procedure that is obviously just. The only other suggested amendment with which I wish to deal is that which has been mentioned by the honourable proposal to insert the word "" murder "" in section 98 of the principal Act. In the first place, I believe that the soldiers of Australia, as a whole, wish to remain, ' even during the -time that they are wearing khaki, essentially citizens of the Commonwealth. Personally^ I am convinced that some of the sentences which have been imposed for military offences under the Army Act have been savage, and for< all the bigger crimes committed in the ArmyI desire to see civil trial subnot a case for the executioner so much as stituted for military court martial. In the battalion in which I had the honour to serve I know that men received really savage sentences-in some cases amounting to many years of imprisonment-for crimes that a civil magistrate would have laughed at, and possibly dismissed. In this connection, I recall one case especially-that of a corporal, who was sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment for striking his superior officer, although he did him no damage whatever, and did not even bruise him. Punishments of that character are altogether disproportionate to the magnitude of the offence committed. As the members of our Forces serve as citizens, and not as soldiers, it is high time that we had the right of a civil trial for any crime meriting a big punishment in the Army. In regard to murder, one has, iii many cases, to consider the circumstances under which it is committed. Upon two occasions which came under my personal, observation during my term of service abroad, men committed the crime of murder under great provocation. In both instances, while keyed up to a very high pitch of excitement, they were ridden down by military police with naked sabres. As a result, some of the military police subsequently paid the If the ringleaders in this crime had been caught they would undoubtedly have had to stand their trial for murder, and at a military court martial they would not have received the same consideration that would have been extended to them if they had been tried by a civil Court. It has also to be remembered that accused persons in the Army are not able to secure proper representation at their trial. Ninety-nine men out of 100 are not conversant with one-fifth of the provisions of the Army Act, and do not know how to defend them, selves. That is not just to the accused whose life is trembling in the balance.

But the Australian soldier, citizen soldier that he is, has not the liberty so long as he is 'in the Army that we enjoy. Despite fhe fact that the Australian has been charged with lack of discipline, he has fought secoricT io none in the war; and I fail to see the purpose of binding him down with further discipline. sonal observations have led me to the conclusion-just -that the soldier under the strictest discipline has proved the poorest man. It is for an obvious reason. his officers and non-commissioned have been wiped out, the man who has been accustomed to the severest discipline Jlfr. Corboy. finds himself practically useless with It out a leader. The situation in the Australian A r m y has always been of the honourable diametrically opposite. Our. soldiershave been accustomed to doing little odd jobs on their own, and when they have got into a tight corner, where the alternatives have been taking another man's' life or of his taking theirs, our Australian lads have known just how to go to work. They have required no officers. They require no extreme discipline to show them Immediately after he had left what to do. T am opposed to any f u r t h e r extension of the grip of militarism upon our soldier citizens. -Whil e I value the assurance given by the Government respecting the amendingThat is the type of crime clauses in this B ill , I still have many doubts. I recall that once I was assured by Mr George Turner-afterward s Sir George-that a certain paragraph inserted in a particular-Bill was intended, to conupon a court-martial. The vey that the salary of the Governor General would never be increased. The amount indicated at that time was £10,000 per possess, annum. I said, "" That is all very well, and I am naturally prepared to take your word for it ; b u t , "" I added, "" let us have it in black and white. Let us put into the enabling B ill one little word which w ill assure that the salary shall not be more already is strict than that sum."" I thereupon moved to English soldiers have told us omit the word "" less,"" and to insert in its stead the little word ""more."" An effort was made later to break that promise of Mr Turner, when Lord Hopetoun, our Imperial first Governor General, sought to secure £20,000 a year. It was that section in the Victorian State Statute which prevented the addition being granted. I am inclined to insist here also that we should' have everything in plain English, so that -there shall be no mistake, or change of purpose. Indeed., I feel inclinedto giveMy pernotice of my intention to move a new clause, based upon the Uode Napoleon.. as with a great many others It would be to the following effect:fighting Notwithstanding anything contained in this""When or any Aet, it shall be mandatory that all menand officers who have seen active serviee overofficers seas shall rank as senior in their respectiveranks to men and officers of the Eeserve Military Forces who have not seen active service overseas.",35,Defence Bill No 3 Second Reading

Let the matter be simply set out, so that the man in the street-ith e returned soldier himself shall clearly understand. Probably during the war I have had more conversations with "" returned soldiers than any other honourable member. asking many questions. The majority of these who have attended my office, and have told me their stories, have spoken well of General Birdwood. some of them. I have been acquainted with another point of view. ' I am given to understand that he actually desired that there should be power to inflict the death penalty on our Australian soldiers, just as in the case of the Continental Forces. We have just heard of an instance bearing upon that from the honourable member f b r Swan( Mr Corboy), who has just won his spurs in this Chamber, and whom I heartily compliment upon his maiden effort. HoiroiiAKLE MEMBEBS -'Hear, hear! the clause which seeks to include the death penalty in our Defence Act. It w ill be an infamy if it is embraced in the Statutes of a country like Australia, with its voluntary citizen soldiers. It would be bringing in one of the vilest things which has discredited the accursed German military system. Here we are, at a stage'when fighting has ceased, and peace has been virtually declared; and it is sought to provide for the infliction of the death penalty at this dying stage of the -Avar. I have had some experience of courts martial in this State. I could tell a good deal about the case of one unfortunate man, four of whose brothers had enlisted.. One of those lost his l if e on Gallipoli, and another in France. 'Still another has not yet recovered from his wounds, and one is missing. A court martial was held in the T h a t is intended case of this individual; and honourable members with legal training w ill agree, I think, that there is generally no appeal from a court martial, unless it be upon the presentation of new evidence. In this particular case, however, the Assistant Ministerf o r Defence at the time caused an inquiry to be held, which overrode the decision of the court martial. A t this second inquiry there was a certain Australian general-on e of those individuals who has never smelt gunpowder at the Front. I refer to GeneraLCuscaden, who ranks as superior to all our returned heroes, and whom even the heroic wearers I have cultivated the habit of of the Victoria Cross mu3t salute. I am referring to D r . Cuscaden, who remained in Australia, and, because he belonged to the Government House"" push "" got his Butf r o m advances unti l he held the rank of surgeon-general-althoug h he had never smelt gunpowder, unless it might have been when he let off a cracker in his own back yard. This man had the infernal audacity to say that the poor wretched person who was then being tried a second time, was fit to be put to work. He was sent for six months to.a lunatic asylum, under observation all the time. Where is he now? God knows. He had developed the most phenomenal voice I have ever heard. He spoke from my own platform with me on more than one occasion, but I could never permit him I shall vote against to address the crowd for more thau a few minutes, since he worked himself up to such a frenzy that he trembled from head to foot. Dr. Sewell, who has been concerned in the inquiry, told me later that he thought he might have misjudged this man's case. This individual afterwards went to Queensland. There is no doubt that he was mentally unhinged. In that State he spoke from the recruiting platform under another name, and, witli the aid of his truly phenomenal voice, he attracted great crowds. One other incident in his story is that he, a married man, found another gir l to marry him. His illness was such that he could not carry out the functions of a married man with his wife. One day this girl-wife found a letter from his first wife in Melbourne. There was trouble. He thrashed her. They both disappeared. Did she commit suicide?

I do not want to see the military system in Australia at all. If I can read past and coming events, I do not think Ave shall have militarism in Australia. Some time ago I was promised a return which would show particulars of those officers of the Australian Imperial Force who were receiving salaries of £500 and over-majors , colonels, and the rest of them. I have not yet secured that return. This brilliant General Cuscaden is one of them-thi s senior officer who has never smelt gunpowder.

Honourable members must have been impressed by the words of the latest accession to the 'House, the honourable member for Swan( Mr Corboy). I was sorry there was not a full House here to listen to the splendid speech of that young man. If the Government have received definite instructions from the Homeland to put this provision in the Bill, let us be told so. I honour the Government, through the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) for refusing to agree to the death penalty being enforced previously, even though it was recommended by General Birdwood. Honourable members who were in the chamber and heard the cheers with which the Acting Prime Minister's statement was received on that occasion will agree with me that, unless special instructions or orders have come from the Front to the Government -to do this thing, this is certainly a most inappropriate time to do it. If the majority in their wisdom decide to carry that provision, I shall suggest later on, as a way out of the difficulty, the insertion of a proviso at the end of the clause to the effect that, where punishment of that kind is awarded, any man or officer shall have the right ""of appeal to a civil Court. If that is done, I shall not be afraid of the result. If , however, the Government have determined to carry the clause as it stands, it will he my duty to divide the Committee on the question whether the right of appeal to a civil Court shall be allowed. That, if agreed to, will mean that every, man found guilty by a court martial under this heading will have the right of appeal, and the opportunity to prove to a civil Court that he is suffering from some nervous affection, such as shell shock, or one of the hundred-.ind-oneother troubles that in medical and surgical centres are now being traced, although only dimly, to the war. The people outside will certainly be pleased to know that every oflicer or soldier has the right of appeal, which every citizen outside has, to a Court higher than the first Court that has tried him. -This Bill affords another example of the very injurious practice of setting"" before members a mere series of amendments to existing legislation without putting before them the existing law to which it refers, so that they may clearly ascertain, ' without rumaging among past volumes of Statutes, what the law has been and the effect of the amendments upon it. I have referred to that injurious practice many times in the House, and have had promises from Ministers, going as far back as the beginning of Federation, to the effect that, whenever a Bill was introduced into this House involving amendments of existing Acts, members should have the convenience of seeing at a glance in what respect the existing law was being altered.

149,Mr Brtjce Smith (Parkes) [2.24].,"but tbe time bas arrived now when the Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr are of equal rank, the man who has been ""Wise) might promise that,' at all events in his Department, any further amendments of this kind will be so framed that members can -see at a glance what the law is that they are called upon to amend The honourable member who has just spoken had to look baok at the existing law to see in what respect the Act will be affected by one of the amendments put before us in this bald way. So far as the debate h'as gone, there are only two points on which the House differs from' the Minister. One is the inclusion of murder in the iurisdiction of courts martial, and the other is the principle of giving those who have had active service seniority over those who have never been to. the war. The Minister evidently thought at first that the provision in the Bill would effect his purpose, and that appeared to be the impression of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Corboy), whom. I desire to congratulate upon his maiden utterance. I had misgivings when I saw a young man of twenty-one taking the place of a man of seventy-one, with all the accumulated wisdom of his years. I may say now, as probably the oldest parliamentarian in the House, that I was delighted with the honourable member's utterance. The truth with regard to the matter of seniority appears to lie between the rather that in many cases where men are tried optimistic view of the honourable member for Swan and the pessimistic view of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney). I do not think the amendment as framed in the Bill will preserve to members of the active service Porces complete seniority over men who have not .been on active service, because it is quite possible that, for reasons upon their will-pow""er. The case mentioned which we cannot now speculate, some of those who have been on active service may not care, or may not think it desirable, to go into the Reserve. If they do not, my impression is that they will lose the benefit of their seniority. It would be well if the. Minister, in making this amendment of the law, would include a proviso by which the principle laid down in the Code Napoleon, quoted by the honourable member for Melbourne, would be ilfr. Bruce Smith. preserved, that in. all caseswhere, men on active service should enjoy seniority over the man who. is in the Reserve, or in any other branch of the Forces. That would satisfy the honourable member for Melbourne, and carry out .what the honourable member for Swan 'thought was carried out by the Bill. The other question is much more difficult. ""We know that courts martial have not, at present, jurisdiction over the crime of murder, and it is sought in the Bill to extend their jurisdiction to cases of that sort. I was shown a' case by the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister), in which it seemed that a manwas charged and tried for murder before a court martial, 'but on looking over the papers I see that the court had misgivings as to its. powers, and ultimately convicted the man of manslaughter,, awarding him a punishment which they thought fitted the case in its most serious aspects. There is a great difficulty about this question. ' I quite agree wibh the honourable member for Melbourne that we are not a% favourably disposed towards courts martial as we are towards civil trial. No doubt, trial by jury nowadays is very much abused, and often in the ramifications of society as we know it in a small community men tried before a jury escape justice when they ought not to do so. On the other hand, we all know by courts martial a military disciplinary harshness is exercised, and humane feeling seems to be al togetlier wanting. We know from experience that a great many men are so seriously affected mentally by the war that at times they absolutely lose all control of by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Corboy) was that of a young soldier who bore all these disturbing influences for 'a certain time, and then became so affected by them that he literally ran away. Medical knowledge would have informed the military court martial that tried him, that his state of mind could probably be accounted for by circumstances other than moral cowardice. Notwithstanding all the youth had suffered, he was taken out and deliberately shot for having done something which medical men would now say was the natural result of a tremendous psychological disturbance. My leaning is always towards civil trial, though I recognise it cannot he applied to military conditions without a complete revolution in method and judicial arrangement. I should be very willing to see some sort of t r i a l as the honourable member for Melbourne suggested carried out, but one has only to reflect on the ramifications of military discipline to recognise that two distinct types of mind and two types of jurisdiction and adjudication must be observed in civil and: military affairs. I understand from the Minister, who made the suggestion just now, that it was proposed ment of courts martial with jurisdiction over murder to cases outside the British {Empire. feasible proposal, because when a man is outside the British Possessions he is outside the availability of a British civil tribunal. I know the honourable member for Melbourne thinks that, as we have done very .well for four years, we ought"" to do very well now; but we hardly know how many cases there have been in which justice has suffered by reason of courts martial not having that power when they are outside B r it is h ' Possessions. I am quite with the honourable member, and I think that if our minds could be carefully examined misooscopically, I should be found to have as much humanity in me, although perhaps with a more cynical exterior, than the honourable, member himself. I always t r y to approach these questions in a judicial spirit; and I think if the Minister would l i m it the investment of courts martial with jurisdiction for murder to cases outside British Possessions where there are no civil tribunals available, it would be quite safe. We do not know in what respect courts martial may have been forced to f a i l in doing justice by their inability to deal with the questions of murder. Dr. MALONEY -Then let any such persons be sent back to Australia. tion of a olause to effect t h a t purpose would mean a great variety of amendments.. I think the honourable inember ought to be reasonable. a right to appeal to a civil Court. other question, and I am sufficiently in formed of the law to hesitate to take any steps as suggested. When a man knows a little df the law he is like a Scotchman 0 dancing the sworddance-ver y careful where he puts his feet. The labyrinth is so great, so complicated, and so vague, that one hesitates'to embark upon amendments that may be followed by hundreds more. The honourable member anticipates that we are going to have peace soon, and so do I ; and I ask the Ministert o . limi t the operation of this amendment to . l i m it this investto the time that our troops are outside British Possessions. There w ill then be no groat danger. That seems a W it h regard to the other question, I suggest to the Minister that he should take great care to see that the principle in the Code Napoleon, by which a man on active service has preference over a man not on active service, is carefully preserved; and that in any amendment of the law made, no loophole be l e f t in giving an advantage to those who have not been on active service over those who have really helped this country during the war. I want now to say a word or two about the Duntroon officers. It has no ""bearing upon these two particular amendments; but so far as I can learn there is no procedure by which a Duntroon officer can be promoted above the rank of major. I have been to Duntroon, and have taken some trouble to inquire into the modus operandi of that establishment.

We are asked in clause 2 of the B i ll to amend section 20 of the Act by striking out the wordsbut officers of the active Military Porces shall rank as senior in their respective ranks to offiwounds, and who cannot rise above the cers of tlie Reserve Military Forces. Section 20 of the Act statesThe seniority of officers in the Reserve MiliA man may rise from the ranks, through tary Forces sliall be as prescribed. . . . The definition of active Forces shows that it includes all parts of the Defence Foroe other than the Reserve Forces. I am in harmony with the honourable member for Swani n desiring to make provision for the men who have .been at the Front, but do the words "" active Military Forces'' mean those who have participated overseas in this war ? body in the Military Service, and that being so, it does not give preference to men who have been overseas. That is the point. It gives everybody who is regarded as being in the ' ' active'' Forces an equal opportunity to promotion,. I do not know whether the Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Wise) intends that to be so, but I can place no otlier interpretation upon the B ill read in conjunction with the interpretation section of the principal Act. The honourable member for Swan is quite right in his contention that we should give preference to those who have been fighting for us, but I am afraid that, with the B ill as it stands, those who have remained here in Australia will still have the right to hold choice positions in connection with the Defence Department I hope that when peace is signed, we may have a general disarmament of the nations, or, at least, a partial disarmament. That would, of coursej largely reduce our military requirements. If we have to continue our defence establishment, we should, in every instance, give preference to those who have risked their lives for our liberties. Preference should be given to all who have seen active service abroad, including those who have served ^ it h the expeditions to the islands. It has been stated that the cadets who go through Duntroon College are not permitted to rise above the rank' of major. If that is so, a wrong is being done to them which should be righted as soon as possible. There are abroad many men* w i th the rank of major, who, time and again, have led their battalion into the fight in the absence of their colonel on furlough, or because of sickness or rank of major, because only one lieutenant-colonel is appointed to each battalion. the various steps, to his majority, but he must then wait for an opening for promotion to a lieutenant-colonelcy, and these openings do not frequently occur, probably because there is not so much risk attaching to the holding of the higher positions. tion been issued regarding the Duntroon cadets? -' It includes everybut, if so, it is a wrong instruction. I looked into the matter of promotion some time ago, because I knew men who, for two years, have held the position of major, and have been qualified for promotion, but I learned that they were not promoted because there was no lieutenant-colonelcy vacant. If it is only on that] ground that tlie Duntroon cadets cannot rise higher than the rank of major, there is nothing to be said. ' In the past, provision has been made for the sending abroad of officers to gain experience.

Most of the amendments provided for in the B ill appear to be in the interests of those who are away at the Front. As to the proposal that courts martial shall have the power to inflict the death penaltyfor murder, I would point out that we have gone through four years of warfare without finding it necessary to give them that power, and it should nob be necessary to do so now that an armistice has been signed, and we are within reasonable distance of a peace.

175,Mr Charlton,"I hope that whenHouse will be very loath to sanction this proposal, and the Minister sliould consider before going into Committee whether it is absolutely necessary. W it h o u t it , the B ill could be easily passed this afternoon. But the statements of the houorable member for Swan( Mr Corboy), and of the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Bruce Smith) must make us very careful in this matter. Many soldiers are not responsible for 'their actions. In Sydney recently, I met a young fellow whom I knew, accompanied by his littl e daughter. In welcoming him back, I asked after his health, and he said, "" Today1 am fairly well, but at any moment I may temporarily lose control of myself. Theu1 do not know where I am, or what I am doing; and I have to bring my l it t l e gir l with me to keep me from gett i ng into harm. I am liable because of shell shock to lose my senses."" ilke these make the wisdom of the proposal of the Minister very doubtful. Surely we can leave this matter alone uutil our men return I trust that tlie proposal will not be insisted upon. Parliament has always held that the Australian soldier must be tried for a capital offence only in a judicial Court before a jury of. his peers. A"" court martial takes always a military view of offences. Its members are not trained to' sif t evidence, and although good and capable men, t h e i r . judgment is warped by a bias of which tliey'are not conscious. No court martial should have the right to deprive a man of his life. I am certain that many members opposite hold this view. A court martial should not have the righ t to take the life of a voluntary 'soldier because lie is supposed to have committed murder. I use the word "" supposed "" advisedly, because the man who is on trial for his life may not have beeu morally responsible for what he did. If moral responsibility for the crime could be proved, there might be some justification for the infliction of the death penalty, but it cannot be proved in the case of men suffering from shell shock. A court martial is not'a. fit court to t r y a man for his life. Apart from this proposal, the Bill seems designed to benefit our gallant men who have been fighting for the liberties df this country, Mr Charlton. the Minister wil l be prepared to accept amendments tending to make its purposes more clear, and to insure the giving of preference to those who have been on active service. did' not hear the remarks of the Assistant Ministerf o r Defence( Mr Wise), and I do not know whether he gave the Government's reasons for including the death penalty provision in this B ill , b u t it seems rather late in the day to ask for its introduction, seeing that during the past four years of war the Australian * authorities have refused to accede to the request of the British authorities, or whoever gives the power, to inflict the death penalty on Australian soldiers. It is a serious matter in these days to take away a man's life. It may be done unfairly, and"" in circumstances which do not Cases justify it . Johnson) I have not intervened so far, hut the discussion is . largely dealing with clauses. On the second reading of a B ill honourable members should not deal with clauses. They should be left for discussion in Committee, where they can be debated at f u l l length, and where honourable members can take steps to bring about any alterations they desirethere should be practically no second reading speeches on a skeleton measure of this description. However, the provision for permitting the punishment of death is a new one so f a r as we are concerned, and it is more serious now that for the first time in our history we have been brought face to face with circumstances whicb even medical authorities do not properly understand. I refer to the effect of shell shock on the nerves.. I saw a man get off . a train six months ago to all appearances an absolute cripple. He was bandaged, and was shaking as if he had palsy, yet quite recently he drove me along a country road. When I congratulated h i m upon his apparently fine recovery, he said that 'any sudden noise was likely to affect him. His statement proved true when the armourer! tank visited his town, for, although he knew that it was coming, he _ collapsed, and had to be carried to his and I am sure tliat * home as soon as it commenced firing blank",43,Defence Bill No 3 Second Reading

Punishment for crimes during the last fifty years has ""been considerably relaxed, yet crime has not increased, and, perhaps, in military circles it would not be amiss to revise the code of punishments, and make it f it better into the circumstances of the times . so long as discipline is not affected to any appreciable extent. I hope that the Government will advance solid reasons for the innovation which finds a place in the B ill before the House. Another portion of the measure deals with men who have won their spurs on the field, and risen to a rank which they did not hold before they lef t for the Front, having to drop back on their ret u r n to their previous rank, and piay junior to other men who could have gone to the Front, but did not do so. The fundamental idea upon which our Australian defence system has been built was that advancement in the Australian Military Forces should be by merit, and 1 hope . that the military authorities will adhere to that principle as closely as they can. not give men on their return the status which they have earned on the field, I hope that before it leaves the Committee stage we shall see that it does, and make this a settled principle so far as Australia ' is concerned nary cases in whioh officers have been turned clown since their return. it is not in keeping with the ideas attempted to -be put into legislation since I have been in this House, and I am sure that the House will not tolerate it if it can be avoided. men will get the treatment to which they are entitled, and that they will be given preference as far as possible. because he is a returned soldier a man should not be put in a billet for which he is not fitted; but where one applies for a position alongside another man who has not been to the Front, he should get the preference if he is just as fitted as the other man is to fill it . Men who have lef t Australia as non-commissioned officers, and risen to higher rank through their merit, patriotism, and soldierly qualities, should be honored as they have been His experience, shows what honored on the field, that is to say,' they should retain their rank, and be senior to men who have remained at home and earned the same rank. Any preference should be given to the soldier who has gone abroad, risked bis life for his country, and done his duty as' nobly as. our Australian men have done. should like some information in regard to the proposed amendment of section 76 of the principal Act. I have endeavoured, by searching through the Interpretation Act, to find out the exact meaning of the alteration. Johnson) I intimated a few moments ago that honourable members generally have been dealing, with the clauses of the B ill . That sort of discussion more properly belongs to the Committee stage, and not to a second-reading debate. I hope that honourable members will not discuss particular clauses, as two or three honourable members preceding the honourable member for Barrier have been doing. If this B ill does rather unfortunate in speaking late, if we are to be prohibited from dealing with the principles contained in the alterations, I cannot understand the position. second-reading debate is to allow of a discussion of the general principles con.tained in a B ill , and it is not customary at this stage to deal in detail with the clauses. If honourable members were permitted on the second-reading debate to If that is the case, pick out individual clauses for detailed discussion,there would be luinecessary repetition of the same debate when those clauses were reached in Committee. to endeavour to elicit from the Minister information in regard to these amendSimply ments which might obviate a good deal of discussion at a later stage. However, I shall wait u n t i l the Committee stage to deal with the clauses.

I think, that every honourable member will agree with the principle enunciated by the honourable member for Swau( Mr Corboy) that those who have gained their rank on active service should be allowed to retain it when they return, and have seniority over other officers who have seen no active service. There is also a proposed alteration in regard to the death penalty. Only the other day one of our leading officers, Brigadier-Oeneral Rosenthal, expressed regret that the death penalty does not apply in the Australian Army, and it would appear that the high officers are anxious to have that very extreme power in respect of members of our Porces. other honourable members who have expressed ' strong opposition to giving to military tribunals power to impose the death penalty. I believe that the civil authorities should be superior to the military autliority in all matters, and, as the honourable member for Swan pointed out, the soldier should at least have the right to appeal to the civil authorities from any penalty imposed by court martial. the proposed alterations can be dealt with in detail when the Bill reaches the Committee stage, I shall content myself now with merely expressing my opposition to the proposed extension of the death penalty and to the imposing of penalties upon soldiers without taking into consideration whether the-offence was committed intentionally or otherwise. my memory is correct, the Defence Bill, which was introduced while the Labour party was in power in 1911-13, contained the same provision in regard to the death penalty as is contained in the Bill now before tlie House, but the party at that time declined to entertain the proposal, and provision Was made for all sentences to be reviewed by the Executive. Now that the war is practically over, I think that the Ministry would be wise not to persist with this provision. assurance. While the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Bruce Smith) was speaking in regard to the inability of Duntroon cadets to rise beyond a certain rank, I interjected that the reason was that many of the cadets came from the industrial classes. In order that my remark may not be misunderstood, I wish to.explain that the original examination papers required the candidate to state the occupation of his parents, and. when the results were issued we found that no candidate whose parents followed an industrial occupation was included in the first .twenty-five. I think that later the examination paper was altered. Tha.t was my reason for saying, that some candidates have not been able to gain promotion because their parents belonged to I am in accordance with those .the industrial class. common with other honourable members who have spoken, I desire to say how pleased I was to listen to the remarks of the new soldier member ( Mr Corboy). He created a most favorable impression, and I am sure that he will prove to be a decided acquisition to the Chamber. It As is my privilege to have had something to do with courts martial. On a number of occasions I was in charge of prisoners who were standing their trial, and whilst, generally speaking, the men had an excellent opportunity of defending themselves against the allegations made against them, yet there were times when the soldier did not receive the consideration he should have had, because those who were trying him were suffering to a great extent, from the same complaint as afflicted the soldier when he committed the offence. Those who have had experience of modern warfare know that it is impossible for a man after enduring privation and shock, as many' of our men have done, to view matters in a calm and judicial manner. I think the Ministry will be wise in dropping this particular clause relating to punishments. it, because I do not think that .any court martial so constituted should have the power to determine whether or not the death penalty should be imposed upon any man in these circumstances. I have here the evidence taken at a court martial in connection with a charge of murder.",45,Defence Bill No 3 Second Reading

Provided that latter objects were fully attained, they feel that they would be in position to justify participation in Commonwealth financial liabilities as regards 1917-1918 crop. As regards finance, an arrangement would have to be made to obviate further accumulation of Australian sterling balances here by setting off payments for wheat against sums due by Commonwealth Government to British Government Departments. This characteristic arrangement would be, not commercial purchase, but general settlement of outstanding questions of control of wheat .and tonnage in joint' interests of Home and Commonwealth Governments In light of above, would you ascertain if Commonwealth Government would now be prepared to receive concrete proposal from us on lines indicated?.

Here information was given about the ships, but I propose to leave the figures as to the number of ships blank at this stage,* because I do not think that that in formation should even now be made public. tinued :They ask, inter alia, that we should release have pressed them back to making Btand, but to which I will not agree. Had long conversation with Chancellor yesterday, as a result of which he has promised to go into whole matter again. I am doing my best and believe ultimately I shall succeed. On the 3rd OctoberI received the following cable from the Prime Minister:Most secret. Re wheat. During discussion proposed sale surplus wheat Royal .Commission this morningThe authorities who purchase wheat for the British Government, I may mention, are known as the Royal Wheat Commission. As an administrative body they are charged with the function of purchasing and handling wheatI learn that their agent negotiating with you re certain details. 'As this is likely to lead to confusion, and will certainly embarrass me in negotiations with Commission, I trust you will telegraph me with your suggestions on such points as have been discussed between you and agent, refraining from any undertaking or agreement in respect these. Tell him matter is in my hands. As soon as I reach finality, which I certainly have not yet done, I will cable you. To that I replied on the 7th OctoberRe your cable, 3rd October, 1918, wheat. Russell and I have talked with agent British Commission re better stacking and preservation, with object of giving Commonwealth more control over States. Nothing has been or will be done to embarrass you, and you may rely that situation as to sale is exactly same as when you left Australia. [306] The object of that assurance was to show ' that what we had been discussing was not a fundamental of the sale of the wheat, but was designed to give the British authorities some guarantee that the Government which effected a sale with them would see to the preservation of the wheat after it had been sold. On the 7 th November, no further information having reached me, I sent the Prime Minister the followmg telegram:Following resolution passed by Australian Wheat Board begins':"" That a cablegram be sent to Mr Hughes that, in the opinion of the Board, an effort should be made to sell the wheat crop at a higher price than was previously authorized."" The Prime Minister's cable conThat was at the time when the armistice was about to be concluded, and the suggestion was-as we have seen in the press -that the price of wheat would rise. The of ships now remaining coast work. I Board, in the exercise of its trustee funcexclusive of in all, upon which they tions, therefore deemed it wise for me to in f o rm the Prime Minister of their views. On the l l t h NovemberI received the f o l lowing reply:Secret. Wheat. Re Board cable. Acting upon express approval of Wheat Board in their telegram, I placed wheat under offer to British Government at 38s. per quarter, and they accepted. The reason why sale has not been definitely made is because of certain conditions British Government wish to insert in contract, to which I take objection, and to certain conditions, including provision for half profits, that I desire inserted, to which tlie British Government say they cannot agree. I am seeing Chancellor to-morrow to try and get matter definitely settled. If Board is not willing take 38s., I will, of course, refrain from signing contract; but Board must take full responsibUity for this, and should be notified that it is quite hopeless to attempt secure higher price from British Government, and there is no other buyer. In my opinion, best thing we can do is sell wheat as arranged. There is no prospect of being able ship quantity available from coming harvest 1918-19 during next twelve months, to say nothing of present unsold surplus. If we can get rid of 1917-18 and balance of 1916-17 surplus, at 38s and wheat market is v favorable, we can, as far as shipping facilities permit, sell new wheat at then market rates, if British Government is prepared purchase present surplus, ancl give us right to sell new wheat in markets of world. Board should also be notified that, in my opinion, British Government, owing to bountiful harvest in England and large stocks already purchased in Australia, is anxious to avoid completing contract, and will welcome opportunity to break off negotiations. To that communication. I replied on 14th November as follows:Secret. Your telegram l l t h 'November. Wheat. Was astonished at its contents. When we exchanged cables early July about this matter, I succeeded in getting you the free hand you then asked to dispose of the product. On several occasions since I have asked you whether the matter has been settled, and you have not given me any indication that it was settled. As late as 9th September you say, in reply to my inquiry, "" I have not sold wheat, though I hope to do so. Suggested terms and conditions of British authorities quite impossible. standing for a fair deal, and hope to get it . "" This is also confirmed in your telegram to me of 3rd October. As to whether it is now prudent policy to sell wheat, in view of change in war situation, I am not finalizing in mV mind, but will confer with the. Board about it . In the meantime, I do not regard the wheat as sold, and hope you will do nothing t ill further advised. In reply I received a long telegram from the Prime Minister, dated 16th November, which readsSecret. Wheat. Either from mutilation or other cause, my telegram did not make position clear. I did not intend convey wheat was sold. It is not sold, although Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies contended that it is. PointI wished to emphasize was this-that I had agreed sell at 38s. quarter, subject other conditions sale being satisfactory, and .that, therefore, if British Government agreed these other conditions, there would be a contract. Conditions which I refused agree to included cession of on Australian coast or in Australian trade. This was subsequently reduced to sliips. I said I could not agree this condition. There were otlier conditions to which I took exception, and I asked for insertion of a new clause, providing for 38s. minimum price, and for half share of profits on transaction, account to be adjusted yearly. To this last condition Royal Wheat Commission was agreeable when I last conferred with them; but they have tliis day informed me in writin g fchat they canuot agree to it , and ask that contract shall not provide for it . The present position, therefore, is that wheat is not sold. -As to surrender of further ships, I am inclined to opinion tliat this w ill not now be insisted on. The point, therefore, for Wlieat Board and Government to consider is whether it is advisable to sell wheat upon terms as set out above. I have received this day a memorandum froin Chancellor, which, inter alia, covers the proposed sale of our wheat, and I feel quite sure upon one thing;-that not entertain higher price. There is, then, only one buyer of wlieat en bloc, and that buyer will not give more than 38s. Mr Watt. I shall refrain from any action u n t i l I hear from you. On the 19th November, after having summoned a meeting of the Wheat Board in Melbourne, I sent the Prime Minister the following cable:Secret. Your telegram 16th November. Wheat. Board met yesterday, and unanimously resolved as follows:"" In view of the fact that another wheat harvest is due, which w ill require at least £10,000,000 for payments to growers, the I am Australian Wheat Board thinks it desirable that you should endeavour to sell 1,000,000 tons of wheat to the best advantage, being balance of 1916-17 and portion of 1917-18 wheat, with minimum price of 4s. 9d. per bushel. The above to be on condition that Australia is permitted to compete in the world's wheat markets, subject only to such war conditions as may be in operation. Board further thinks that the whole of the Eastern and SouthA f r i can markets should be reserved to the Australian Wheat Board for the disposal of the balance of the wheat. Wheat Board is strongly of opinion that you should do your best to preserve our interests in Norway and Sweden."" I addedAs far as I a'm able to judge, there is a strong feeling among wheat farmers that future prices of wheat should show substantial improvement; but I think, in view of financial difficulties, it would be wise to act on resolution of Board. ships at present engaged That is where the matter stood, and where it now stands, so far as the Government are concerned. I saw in the Melbourne papers of the 21st of this month the report of a statement by the Under-iSecretary of Agriculture, New South Wales, Mr Valder, a member of the Wheat Board. In that statement he said that Mr Campbell had asked at the Conference, "" Has the sale been made V and Mr Valder replied, "" I believe it has."" Yesterday I wrote to Mr Holman as follows:I take leave to draw your attention to the enclosed report taken from the columns of the Melbourne Age of this date, in which a statement is alleged to have beeu made by Mr. Valder, Under-Secretary for Agriculture, at a conference in Sydney on the 20th instant, to the effect thafc'he believed the sale of AusRoyal Commission will tralian wheat had been made. It is plain that for a moment proposal of a the conference referred to had been discussing, amongst other things, the announcement which I had recently made that no sale of wheat had been effected. I would be glad to learn if Mr Valder has been correctly reported, and, if so, whether you consider it, in all the circumstances of thb present situation, a proper procedure for a public officer of the State of New South Wales to challenge the accuracy of a statement made by me in Parliament about this important matter. 1 ask your early attention to this communication. That communication went by post, and as yet I have had no reply to it. Then there appeared in to-day's press a statement which is reported to have been made by Mr Grahame, who' is also a member of the Australian Wheat Board, and who either drafted the resolution to which I have referred or assisted in the drafting of it, and passed it. That is the one which I telegraphed to the Prime Minister. I wired to the Premier of New South Wales, . Mr suggestions and the statements of Mr Holman, to-day, as follows:Your Minister Agriculture, Mr Grahame, is reported in Argus to-day to have made following statement:-""Wheat has been sold, that is, 1,000,000 tons, at 4s. 9d. a bushel. The Board kind going to Britain. gave the Prime Minister authority three months ago to sell it, and the Board had no option hut to confirm the sale he made to the British Food Commission, which had accepted the oiler. This was in addition to the wheat which the British Government already held, close upon 2,000,000 bushels."" report, and I am not concerned whether that is confusing bushels and tons or not. cluded :Mr Grahame added: "" It was a good thing to get rid of the wheat at the price. It was full of weevil."" Subsequently, same statement reported in Age this morning. Mr Grahame knows that no sale has been made. I am therefore astonished at statement if correctly reported. Please ascertain the facts, and advise me urgently by wire to-day, as I intend to deal with matter in Parliament before it rises at 4 o'clook. That is all the correspondence of any vital character whatever, in any Government or departmental files, regarding this matter. I want to say, now, two or three things about Mr Grahame's statement. I have not yet received a reply, by the way, [306]2 from Mr Holman. However, the wheels of government grind slowly, but this lot will grind exceeding small. Pirst, as to the statement that we would be doing a smart thing in selling weevilly wheat to Great Britain, I had an interview this morning with the Victorian Minister of Agriculture ( Mr Oman). He indignantly repudiated that we should send one bag of weevilly wheat to Britain, and during this day, since our interview, he has confirmed that attitude in the -course of remarks uttered when introducing 'a measure before the State Legislaturea copy of which remarks has been sent to me. Mr Oman also confirmed what he had said in the earlier conversation with myself as to the actual facts as known to the Wheat Board of Australia, and he contradicted emphatically the Grahame. If there is anything that would poison Australia's reputation or put off the sale of this important staple product, it would be a statement of that AndI intend, if I am in time, to see that that statement is not cabled to Great Britain, whether the man who made it likes it or not. I would go so far as to exercise the censorship in this matter. We do not want to take down Great Britain; but we want;-in the language of the Prime Minister's telegramsa square deal. If I am quoting the press we can get it, it will be of enormous value to Australia, whether the farmers who are now talking of 5s., 6s., and 7s. My telegram to Mr Holman cona bushel, agree with it or not. There are quite a number of men in the various associations of farmers throughout Australia who think they know much more about the actual position than the Governments who are in receipt of all the latest information possible. And while I do not claim infallibility for this or for any other Government in Australia, I emphasize that information is as important a matter on which to form judgment at this critical time as is anything else. These men have nothing to go on except newspaper cackle'and gammon. I had'always been under the impression that Mr Grahame was a clear-headed political thinker; but,",50,Honourable Members Hear Hear

The reason why there is so much dissatisfaction amongst the farmers is that they compare their position with the position of the wool growers, who have the honourable member for Hume( Mr Palkiner) and other representatives on the Central Wool Board, and the farmers naturally think they should have representation on the Wheat Board. Instead of this, we find men like Mr Grahame on it , a very estimable man, who knows nothing about wheat-growing in a practical sense, and various Ministers for Agriculture.

Rightly or wrongly, Mr Giles' statements wero censored. I think that very grave injury was done to the Board itself hy that action.
