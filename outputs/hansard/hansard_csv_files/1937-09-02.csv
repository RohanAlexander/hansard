Trade and Customs yet given consideration to the letter forwarded to him by the Chamber of Automotive Industries of New South Wales on tbe 12th August last in which reference is made to the serious inconvenience suffered by the motor trade in consequence of the Government's so-called trade diversion policy? In amplification of my question I direct attention to the following paragraph of the letter:The information that the department is not in a position to give full consideration to this ported. As Great Britain is by far the matter because the Government's intentions in this regard have not been disclosed, has been received with alarm by my members, and I have been directed to ask if you will be so good as to do everything you can to enable your department to deal with such a vital request. Has the Minister come to any decision on this subject? If so will he announce it so that the anxiety of those engaged in this industry may be allayed? cisms and a good deal of hostile propaganda in regard to the Government's trade diversion policy. I do not recollect the particular letter to which the honourable member has referred, but I have in mind some propaganda from the Tariff Reform League on the subject. Some of the letters that have been received have a note of authority in them, and some are very much the reverse. the from one country to another must cause disabilities and difficulties to certain businesses, but the Government must act, and has acted, in the national interest. It has not been actuated by any desire whatever to injure particular businesses or industries. The advantages of the trade diversion policy to the nation far outweigh the disadvantages of it to certain sections of the community. Trade and Customs inform me whether it is a fact that there is no prohibition on the importation into Great Britain of American motor cars ? If so, how can the honourable gentleman reconcile the unfriendly policy of this Government towards the manufacturers of motor cars in the United States of America with the policy of Great Britain, one result of which is that purchasers of motor cars in Australia are forced to buy English cars which they do not wish to buy owing to the shortage of American cars? ' the world any class of motor car can be imported under certain duties. American motor cars are not prohibited from entry into Australia; they are merely subjected to a very generous quota, while British chassis are free. The number of American. and Canadian motor cars imported here considerably exceeds the number of British cars imbest purchaser of Australian primary production it is only right, however that Australia should do everything it possibly can to encourage the purchase of British products in this country. Trade and Customs inform me whether it is a fact that 70 per cent, or 80 per cent, of each motor car of American origin sold in Australia is actually manufactured in. this country and that, as a rule, only the engine and chassis are imported? claimed that 80 per cent, of such finished motor cars is of Australian origin.'

HARRISON -In view of the improved trade balance between Australia and the United States of America, will the Minister for Trade and Customs bring under the notice of the Government the desirableness of completely revising tlie quota system which at present governs importations from America? policy which cannot be stated in answer to a question'. The Government, however, is unlikely to place further quotas upon imports from the United States of America. It is desirable, of course, that our trade with the United States of America should be placed upon a better footing and we hope that a trade treaty more satisfactory to both countries may replace the trade diversion policy as early say when it is likely that a decision will as possible. Trade and Customs inform me why the importation of motor cars from the United States of America is governed by the quota system, whereas the importation of American tools of precision and certain machinery which is not competitive with the manufactures of Australia, is totally prohibited? hibition of the importation of motor vehicles would undoubtedly have involved many persons in serious hardship and disability the quota system was adopted. Tools of precision and the machinery which, doubtless, the honourable member has in mind could be prohibited without incurring any serious dislocation of trade locally. could be obtained from Great Britain and other good customer countries. For that reason a total prohibition of such at any moment; the negotiations are nearimports was decided upon by the Government. for the Interior noticed, the paragraph in this morning's press to the effect that, suburb said that, after making arrangeas the result of an interview between representatives of Japanese pearlers and the Administrator of the Northern Territory, the arrested lugger' Dai Nippon Maru is likely to be released, and that Mr Yamai, president of the Caiyo Pearling Company, had assembled 110 pearlers and warned them that they must not enter territorial waters off Arnheim Land?

It is not in order to ask ""a Ministhe notice of his department, and also the ter whether he is aware of certain facts. Questions may not be' asked merely to test the knowledge of Ministers. which I asked some time ago, the Prime Minister informed me that MrH . C. Brown, the Auditor-General, had visited London, Toronto and New York, to examine the accountancy practice in operation at those places and that his expenses to date amounted to £709. Is the Prime Minister aware that Mr Brown is shortly to be retired from his position, and can he say whether it is the practice of the Government to send abroad for experience, highly paid officers of the Public Service who are nearing retirement ? term for which the present Auditor General was appointed will expire shortly; I do not know the exact date. It is not the practice of the Government to do as the honourable gentleman has suggested. In this case, the Auditor-General advised that it was desirable that he should have an opportunity to examine the accounts at the places mentioned, and, in the light of his recommendation, the Government approved his visit. the Auditor-General may act independently of the Government in these matters ? may act independently, but I am not sure of the position in regard to places outside Australia.

Is the Minister aware that many specific cases of cure, with the names and addresses of the patients, have been brought under Victorian Infantile Paralysis Board? Has the department made any investigation of the claim and, if so, with what result ? fantile paralysis by Mr Neil Featherstone's methods was brought under my notice last week by a deputation of representative citizens of Canberra, who furnished me with the names and addresses of persons who, they alleged, had been cured by such treatment, and supplied particulars of such cases. I have no knowledge of the treatment myself, but I told the deputation that I would bring their representations before the officers of my department immediately, and would also communicate with Sir John Harris, the Minister for Health in the Victorian Government. I have done as I promised, but beyond that I am unable to express any opinion.

83,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [11.10],"I doLabour members are claiming credit for the action taken by the Scullin Government and asserting that much of the prosperity which has been enjoyed by the country since that time is the direct result have been, throughout its term of office, of the policy of that Government, while at the same time a considerable number of honourable -members opposite, even to this day, wholeheartedly and thoroughly disagree with the action that was taken by the Scullin Government at that time. The man in the street-and he it is who put this Government into office, and has kept it there for the last six years-ma y not be fully aware of the direct results of the policy of the Scullin Government, but he knows full well that, whereas in 1931 this country was in a desperate condition, the intervening six years, through the leadership of the Lyons Government, have been marked by a steady progress to prosperity. honourable gentlemen opposite at this juncture only on the statement that the actions vernment during its term of office have been such as to cause the Government to forfeit the confidence of the people. If for we compare the relative position to-day of any section of the community with its position in 1931 we shall find every justitime workers, only 5 per cent, fication for an expression ""of renewed conremain unemployed in that State. fidence in this Government, and for the fullest possible support of it in consequence of the good work that it has done. Let us consider first the position of the been in a substantial measure diie workers. Honourable gentlemen opposite make the somewhat fulsome and thoroughly unjustifiable claim that they alone have the welfare of the workers of this country at heart, and that any good which may have accrued to the workers through the activities of the Lyons Government has been tbe accidental and indirect result of benefits which it has confor the States of New South Wales and ferred, in the first instance, upon those whom, it is alleged, support it. I point out to honourable members opposite, however, that were it not for the fact that the who are on the basic wage, but also to all United Australia Party in 1931 received a substantial measure of support from the working people of Australia it could not have assumed office, and if that support had not been renewed in 1934, after a three-years regime by the Lyons Government, it would not be in office at present. Prom whatever point the subject is viewed, the fact remains that a very considerable number of' working men and women in Australia satisfied that the policy of this Government has been the best policy for Australia. Let us now examine for a few moments the condition of the workers of Australia at present. It has been pointed out during this debate that marked reduction has occurred in the number of unemployed persons in tlie community during the last six years. According to the information obtained from trade union returns the figures have fallen from 30 per cent, to 9.7 per cent. I am. aware that these figures have been challenged by some honourable members opposite, but they have been neither I join issue with seriously nor effectively attacked. The latest figures made available by the Government Statistician of New South of the Lyons GoWales show that of the number of persons available for employment only 6.3 per cent, were unemployed in the last quarter which figures are available. Furthermore, if we take as employed the full time equivalent of partThese.figures demonstrate the remarkable improvement of the employment position that has taken place, and effectively counter any suggestion to the contrary or that the improvement has not to the policy of this Government. Quite apart from the question of employment, the worker has found that, with the steady progress made, his personal position has also improved. Tbe recent apj)licatio.n to the Arbitration Court by the trade unions resulted in an increase of the basic wage by 6s. a week Victoria and an average increase of 5s. a week throughout the Commonwealth, the increase applying, not only to those workers covered by federal awards whatever their marginal wage may have been. In addition, the worker is aware that the Government is preparing a programme of social security, the lack of which has been one of the least satisfactory features of our economy in thft past. If we turn to the position of the man on the land-and here again the claim has been made by honourable members opposite that they alone hare the welfare of the small man on the land at heart-w e find that this Government, during its term of office, has made available the sum of £12,400,000 for the relief of primary producers and in addition £4,317,000 for farmers' debt adjustment, the latter aid being, not for the wealthier farmers, but for the struggling men on the land who, as the result of reduced prices of primary products during the depression, became involved in financial difficulty. Next take the position of the manufacturer and those engaged in commerce and industry. I dwell on the position of this section of the community, because it was really the remarks of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) in this connection that provoked me to take part in this debate. I have heard repeatedly from the honourable member and others the accusation that this Government, and the party to which I belong in particular, accept dictation from described as relative prosperity. Would outside interests and that the United Australia party is virtually the "" f a t man's party""; but I have never found any substance behind such an assertion. At no time since I have been a member of this House have any outside organizations or business interests, or sections of busiany accusations of dictation by such outness interests, to which the honourable member referred, brought indirect pressure on me as to any line of policy which it was considered should be adopted. That, in my opinion, is the general experience of honourable members on this side of the House. the rank and file. who constitute the rank and file of the speech when he pointed out that if depresparties on this side of the House have sion rates remained at the present time votes, it is reasonable to assume that they the Government would be collecting would get some inkling of any influence almost double the amount estimated for of the character suggested. pause to consider the alleged favorable although rates have been substanor partial treatment meted out by this tially cut the total amount of taxation is Government to the wealthier elements in higher than ever. That has been made the community. First of all, let me say possible, as was effectively demonstrated that the present budget gives a clear indiby the honourable member for Darling cation that there is no substance whatever Downs( Mr Fadden), because, owing to in that charge. tVe are told that we are to improved conditions, an increaseof busia great extent back to the conditions of 1929; yet we find that, although we are now collecting £20,000,000 more from the people of this country than we did in that year, and we are making a record amount available for invalid and old-age pensions-nearl y £2,000,000 more than for the last financial year-and , although -we arc on the eve of an election, no attempt is being made to reduce taxes in order to pander to any particular class or section of the community, certainly not to the wealthier elements, whose influence, it is suggested, controls our councils. If this Government is dictated to by those interests, if their influence does weigh heavily in our councils and policy, is it likely that such would be the position? If we look at the whole of the Australian economy we find the rather interesting situation that the only people in the community who have not been restored to the 1929 level are the bondholders, the mortgagees, the landlords, and, incidentally, as I am reminded by an interjection, members of this Parliament. We have returned to what is it not be expected that the bondholders, landlords and mortgagees would no longer be invited to accept the same return for their investments as they were asked to accept during the depths of the depression? This evidence effectively counters side influences. There is every justification, however, for a continuance of the support by these interests of the present. Government, and not merely on the ground that some reductions of rates of taxation have taken place. The very substantial reductions rates of taxation that have been made were graphically illusBut let us collection in the present year. Yet,",17,Casey

85,Mr Holt,"As honourable members trated by the Treasurer in his budgetness turnover has taken place and industry has consequently been able to meet a greater volume of taxation. If we glance at the evidence supplied by the factory employment figures, we find that they, effectively meet any arguments that the tariff policy of this Government has had a disastrous effect on secondary industries. employed in factories has increased from 337,000 in 1932 to 535,000 at the end of June last, showing an amazing development of our secondary industries. All of these facts provide convincing testimony of the marked improvement which has taken place and justify the claim which the Government makes for the support of its policy and the right to continue it after the forthcoming elections. The right honourable member for Yarra, in a speech which, however polished and eloquent, was lacking in force and conviction, attacked the Government because it proposes tofinance the purchase of defence equipment in Great Britain-equipmen t which cannot be manufactured in Australia-by issuing treasury bills to tbe value of £2,000,000 in London. this was the first heavy draught in an orgy of overseas borrowing. This Government is fully alive to the dangers of unlimited borrowing or of excessive overseas borrowing of any kind. If we consider the facts of our economy at the present time we find not only that the Government has demonstrated its awareness of this danger, but also that it is .able to point to a remarkably Secure position as far as its overseas balances are concerned. If we examine the figures for 1936-37, we find that exports are somewhat higher, and imports £30,000,000 lower, than in 1929-30. In other words home production has replaced imports to about the value of our pre-depression overseas borrowing. In view of this healthy and sound position which has resulted from the Government's policy, can it be claimed that the Government is likely to sacrifice that security by any excessive borrowing overseas ? In the course of this debate we have had occasion to listen to various statements of the defence policy, or policies, of honourable members opposite. I submit that there has been a desperate attempt to create a party political atmosphere about a subject which should never be dragged into the arena of party politics. If one policy should be above the heat and atmosphere of party political conflict it should be defence, not only because we The number of persons must be clear as to where wo stand in the matter of defence, but also because a defence programme necessarily must be spread over a number of years. If we are to have the absurd situation of one party being fundamentally at variance with another over defence, and the normal swing of tbe pendulum making it possible for a new government to upset -materially the programme of its predecessor, a state of chaos would prevail amongst the defence forces and the permanent military staffs. For that reason I regret the attempt that has been made to develop a party political spirit with regard to this subject. Since it has been introduced, however, let us 'examine for a few moments the defence policy-o r perhaps I should say with more accuracy-the defence policies of honourable members opposite, because He suggested, in effect, that here again we find that the Labour party is not able to speak with one clear and emphatic voice on a subject of such major importance. On examination we find that the Australasian Council of Trade Unions at its recent conference in Melbourne resolved that the defence policy of Australia should be one founded on collective security within the framework of the League of Nations, and that it should be directed to a strengthening of the Covenant of the League, and an effective application of its provisions. If that policy were carried to its proper conclusion it would involve Australia in any conflict which takes place overseas. That represents, I suggest,, one extreme of defence policy. However desirable the idea of collective security within the League may be as a fundamental objective, if we examine all the realities of the present situation we find that such a policy is not only impracticable, but also fraught with danger. This has been demonstrated by the lack of firmness which has characterized the handling of international crise3 by that body. This party rejects, at any rate for the time being, the policy which is outlined in the resolution of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. If we examine the policy of the Labour party, we find that it goes to the other extreme, and if it can be summed up in one word, it is in the word "" isolation "". Earlier in this debate and in preceding debates the Opposition's policy has been effectively dealt with by honourable members on this side of the House, and I , therefore, do not propose to attack it at length. The Government, by contrast, stands firmly, clearly, and emphatically for a policy which is recognizable to every man and woman in this country, and has their overwhelming support. It is the policy of the closest co-operation with other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and particularly with Great Britain. In the course of the debates on defence which have taken place this session, it has members opposite that a policy of co-operation is scarcely in keeping with our constitutional independence. concept of independence is, however, not incompatible with the principle of cooperation, and. indeed, if we wish to maintain the independence . of this country, our only hope to do so lies in cotion to take military action. It is moreover operation with the countries which make up the British Commonwealth. This argument is not founded solely on sentiment. If it were, it would be decried by honourable members opposite. Buti f i'hoy ignore sentiment in. this connection, they will be committing a grave blunder. To the people of this country the ties of sentiment arc strong, stronger than honourable members of the Opposition'realize. It is inconceivable that, if Great Britain of the Australian defence policy. I do or any sister dominion were involved in a crisis and fighting desperately for its very existence, Australia, would not throw the full weight of its ""support behind that country and go to its aid. Any argument to the contrary ignores the realities of our own situation. Apart from sentiment, however, we have the realities of defence and trade to make clear to us the fact that co-operation is vitally necessary to our very existence. It has been said on the other side of the subject. How can we hope to have any House that a policy of co-operation is "" Mr Bolt. dangerous because of tbe commitments in which Great Britain may become involved which should not be accepted on behalf of the people of this country. In reply to that charge, I propose to quote at length from a speech delivered by Mr Eden, the British .Foreign Secretary, at Leamington in November, 1936, in which he set forth very clearly just what is the basic -policy of Great Britain on foreign affairs at the present time. On that occasion, Mr Eden said British arms w ill never be used in a war of aggression. They will never be used for ii purpose inconsistent with the Covenant of the League or the I'rnst of Paris. They may, and if the occasion arose, they would, be used in our own defence and in defence of the territories of the British Commonwealth of Nations. They may, and if the occasion arose, they would, be used in the defence of France and Belgium against unprovoked aggression in accordance with our existing obligations. They may, and if a new western European settlement can be reached, they would, be used in defence of Germany were she the victim of unprovoked aggression by any been claimed by honourable of the other signatories of such-a settlement. Those, together with our Treaty of Alliance with Iraq ;uid our projected treaty with Egypt, arc our definite obligations. In The addition., our armaments may be used in bringing help to a victim of aggression in any case where, in our judgment it would be proper under the prov isions of the Covenant to do so. 1 use the word "" m a y "" deliberately, since in such an instance there is no automatic obligaright that this should be so. for nations cannot be expected to incur automatic military obligations save for areas where their vital interests arc concerned. As a statement of policy, that is one which might very well be adopted and supported by any government in this country. A certain amount of criticism has been directed by honourable members of the Opposition at the technical details not propose to speak as an expert, but I am amazed that there arc so many honourable members on the Opposition side who presume to do so. In fact during the debate I have developed the strong feeling that tliere is a field-marshal's baton concealed in the Opposition despatch box. My view is that honourable members must accept the details of defence as recommended to them by those experts who have given a life study to the detailed knowledge comparable to that of those gentlemen? If we ignore their reGisfi,at. B r it a in when he placed the Auscommendations we merely put our necks t i w r a n defence measures before them. into a noose and invite its tightening.

It revealed the unhealthy conditioner in which the working class was then living and demonstrated that the probable length of life was 45 years. In 1921 comparable figures were 69 years for males and 72 for females. In 1848 the first English Public Health Act was passed, and since then we have had a number of health measures. Today we are faced with a problem somewhat different from that faced in the last century, when the negative ideal of health, that of fighting disease and death, was faced. To-day, the main public health activity is directed to the positive ideal of maintaining optimum human health. Every effort must be made to give to the new generation every chance of the fullest and best growth in body and mind. The subject of nutrition has been strongly sponsored by this Government. The High 'Commissioner, Mr Bruce, dramatically brought this subject before the League of Nations Assembly in 1935, when he spoke of the marriage of health and . agriculture, not only as a method to improve general standards of public health, but also to give aid to agriesting. Its resolution relating to the cultural producers throughout the world. Despite the interest and activity shown in this direction since then, a great deal remains to be done. . There are small but effective measures which this Government could sponsor and promote. One of them, which has been strongly advocated by the National Council on Nutrition, is the regular supply of milk to school children and to children of pre-school age. In this country it is remarkable that with the large supplies of fresh milk available, we have not exploited the possibility of improving the general standard of health of these children, and at the same time assisting the milk industry. repeat, the wholehearted support and recommendation Council on Nutrition. Britain of the activity Milk Publicity Council, nearly 3,000,000 school children were provided with a daily supply of milk, either free or at half tbe ordinary price. I hope that the GovernMr Molt. ment will investigate the possibility ef taking action along these lines, and endeavour to co-operate with the States in the matter. In answer to a question which I asked on notice in the House recently, the Minister for Health( Mr Hughes) informed me that the cost of such a supply at the present wholesale rates for milk would be £600,000 for the whole of the Commonwealth. That seems a formidable amount; but, in France, such a distribution has been made with the aid of the municipal authorities. If the necessary expenditure were spread over the whole of the Commonwealth, and the services of the municipal authorities, together with voluntary bodies associated with them, were enlisted, the cost could be easily borne. The ultimate saving in invalid pensions alone would show this to be a justifiable outlay, for it would result eventually in a saving to the country. I refer the House to the report of the first session of the National Health and Medical Research Council, which was recently appointed by the Government. This body has a distinguished personnel and honourable members would find its report and recommendations most interquestion of hygiene of childhood statesThe Council directs the attention of governments in Australia to serious neglect in adequate supervision of the bodily development of children before and during school age. The important influence on individual health in the community of supervision of the growing child up to and including the stage of adolescence has been abundantly demonstrated. While something is being done on sound lines already, a relatively small portion of the field has been covered. The Council considers that the whole system of health supervision of children should be immediately reviewed with the object of securing(a) Regular and complete supervision of bodily health during infancy and childhood to the age of sixteen years.

The Council cannot accept the present state of supervision of child health as adequate, nor indeed a? being the maximum that the public will permit.

In Australia we have had brought home to us only too yividly the dangers and difficulties which may arise when the general health of the children of the community is affected. In Victoria, alone, at had not only the distress in individual families arising out of the epidemic of infantile paralysis, but also a serious dislocation of trade and industry owing to the fear which the epidemic has engendered. Seeing that we have before us the resolutions of a body of distinguished and able medical officers, we should not hesitate to put their suggestions into practice at the earliest possible date, in order to confer the greatest degree of health upon the young members of the community. The children cannot speak for themselves in a chamber such as this, but their full health will lay the foundations of national security and progress in the future. I hope that the Government, in bringing forward its policy for the coming elections, will make a prominent feature of an expanded programme with regard to public health, and, in particular, a more active policy relating to the hygiene of childhood. I sincerely trust and confidently express the opinion that the Government, which has been able to carry out such effective work in the last six years, will be empowered to carry on its work in the three years ahead. I believe that no legislative measure will receive stronger or wider support from the people of this country than one contemplating the supervision and maintenance of the health of the young members of the community and the health of the public generally. .[11.50] -The budget presented to the House is virtually the foundation of the policy to be placed before the people by this Government. In essence, it will have to be supported by the two parties that have constituted the Government and supported it during the last three years. The budget, therefore, is the most has to consider at this juncture, when we are within a few weeks of going to the electors. As a member of the Country slightest necessity for me to apologize for the part that that party has played in supporting this Government during the last three years. What took place prior to that period is not now of great importanco to us as a party, nor do I . consider that what occurred six or seven the present time, we have years ago, during the regime of the Scullin Government, is of great moment to the people to-day. Much water has passed under the bridge since then: Personally, I consider that too much stress is laid on events which are now ancient political history. Of course, I do not blame honourable , members on the ministerial side for indulging in retrospective criticism, in view of the destructive and rather recalcitrant attitude of the Opposition towards the budget and the work done by the two parties which stand behind the Government, but little political advantage is to be gained by raking up the dead past. The budget is satisfactory, in view of the Government's heavy commitments. I do not see how the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) could have done much better than he has; in fact, I am surprised that he has done so well. The only flaw would appear to be that to which our attention has been directed by the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), who, with his usual rhetorical ability, sounded a note of alarm which, according to my view, is quite needless. Before the right honourable gentleman became Prime Minister, or even Leader of the Labour party, in fact, long before the Parliament assembled in Canberra, we were familiar with his practice of warning the government of the day against the danger of an adverse trade balance. There is no doubt that if it had been possible to heed his warnings Australia might have avoided many of the troubles which it has experienced; but, in view of the infinite capacity of the people of Australia for demanding every conceivable kind of concession, particularly in good times, I doubt whether it would have been possible for the governments of the day to",22,Casey

The position in Australia shows that, whether we like it or not, the time will arrive when we must have recourse again to the financial resources of the British money market. In view of the limited capital resources in Australia, the Government cannot continue indefinitely to borrow money in this country. After a few years, interest rates will rise. During the last two or three years they have risen from less than 3 per cent, to 4 per cent. If we continue to utterances about the danger of borrowing borrow under tbe boom conditions which now exist, we shall not be able to raise money in Australia at less than 5 per cent, or 6 per cent., and that will mean the end of any developmental policy.

For that reason, the Government is borrowing in London a sum of £2,000,000 for defence purposes. The Australian money market is such a delicate structure to-day that even the raising of this loan, in addition to our normal requirements, might bring the whole fabric toppling to the ground. That demonstrates beyond all reasonable doubt that, in depending upon the Australian money market for the future development of Australia, we are depending on a rotten reed. The Australian governments have been warned of the inadvisability of borrowing this year more than £16,000,000 in Australia. Before the depression, the average rate of borrowing in the Commonwealth by all governments was about £30,000,000 annually, whicli was considered to be necessary for the normal developmental requirements of this country. rowed overseas. overseas for it again.

What danger has this policy ever been to Australia? We owe one half of our total national debt to our own kith and kin in Great Britain; that gives to them a definite and possessive interest in Australia. Why should not they have that interest in this country? The borrowing of money on the London market also creates among the British people the feeling that they have a heavy defence responsibility towards Australia. I remind honourable members that £187,000,000 of British capital has been invested in Shanghai, of all places, and only the other day property in that city valued at £30,000,000 was destroyed in a few hours by Chinese and Japanese bombers. Australia offers to the British public the « safest field in the world for the investment of their capital. Owing to the present short-sighted policy of restricting . borrowing overseas, however, this valuable field is practically closed to British investors, and they are driven to place their money in the Ear East, where it is blown sky high in a few minutes by Japanese and Chinese aeroplanes. avenues in Australia where British capital could be invested. the resumption of borrowing, I emphasize that wo should not float loans abroad indiscriminately, merely in order to relieve our own money market.

If we accept their money to develop Australia, what harm are we doing to them or ourselves? How far couid we have progressed in the past Avithout recourse to the British money market? The construction of the first railway in 1850 from Sydney to Parramatta was interrupted because private enterprise and the Government of New South Wales were so weak financially that they could not raise sufficient money to enable them to proceed with the laying of the line. Victoria had a similar experience; sufficient funds were not available to enable a line to be built from Melbourne to St. Kilda. There was a noticeable lack of confidence among the public to provide funds for even that elementary national work. The Governments of Victoria and t New South Wales were, therefore, driven to borrow money overseas in order to complete the first few miles of railway in Australia. Had it not been for the willingness of British investors to loan money to Australian governments, we should still be in the pioneering days of the fifties. security, too! is the best in the world. I fail to underin Sydney and Melbourne, which are two stand why the Government does not invite the British people to invest their money in Australia instead of placing it in insecure cities like Shanghai.

I hope that we shall avoid the situation that was reached in respect of migration-that when we seek to borrow money in Great Britain for important national enterprises, we discover that investors have public to invest again in Australia, showing that Ave still desire their interest in us, the Treasurer is doing a national service. We should utilize all the money that AAe' can raise on the local market for the more ephemeral governmental purposes, including the relief of unemployment; but for our large scale national developmental works, Ave should obtain money from abroad. Australia is ful l of opportunities for developmental enterprises to which the public is largely bound. We have gone beyond the time when the States can be expected to provide for the national development of Australia. Our defence requirements constitute a much greater problem than the provision of ships, aeroplanes and military equipment. We should haA'e a foundation for the economic structure required for the effective defence of Australia, and if such a foundation be provided it will be of inestimable value to Australia. At a meeting of manufacturers in Sydneythey are perhaps the greediest in Australia in the matter of asking for assistance from the Commonwealth Parliament-on e had sufficient foresight to say that our economic and defence system is extremely Aveak, in that 90 per cent, of Australian factories are concentrated of the most vulnerable points in the Commonwealth. He said that it was time the Commonwealth Government took cognizance of that great weakness in Australia's defence system. Undoubtedly, the manufacturers themselves are to blame, because factories have been established in Melbourne and in Sydney to enable those controlling them to secure cheap power, and also to avoid unnecessarily high railway freights. Our industrial system has thus become centralized. In the",26,Casey

I am strongly of the opinion"" that it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government to establish an advisory body to deal not only with overseas and local borrowing, but also with the development of our national resources on a sound basis. For these reasons the time has arrived to establish a national, economic and developmental council, and I trust that the Prime Minister will announce in his policy speech that such a body is to be constituted. I do not suggest the appointment of another commission. I was a member of this Parliament when the Development and Migration Commission was appointed, but I had no faith in it, because its main responsibility appeared to be to find work for it to do. It did not function very long, and I do not think that it performed any really valuable work. That commission was appointed before its time, but if a body such as I have suggested were established there would be much usef ul work for it to do. Undoubtedly the time has arrived when the Government should secure the services of economists, engineers, financiers, railways commissioners, treasurers and others to form a national economic and developmental council. The council could determine the actual development required in Australia during the next twenty or 25 years, and study from economic, financial, and perhaps political viewpoints, the defence problems of Australia. Our manufacturing centres are so placed that, in the event of invasion, our principal factories could be blown to pieces in a short time. The council could also consider the works which are urgent, and those which should be undertaken by governmental authori-f ties. The standardization of our railway gauges, which was first spoken of over twenty years ago, should now be an accomplished fact. Although a standard [17] railway gauge throughout Australia is essential for the defence of Australia, this important problem has been attacked in only a minor way. The council could consider proposed expenditure instead of allowing governments to indulge in ill considered developmental schemes which even weaken, the defence of the country. Such a body could also say whether it was desirable to obtain money overseas at cheap rates for national developmental works that cannot be carried out economically by the Commonwealth or the States. Tf we are to be limited to the expenditure of £16,000,000 of loan money each year it is doubtful if we can achieve sufficient nationwide development to accelerate progress and strengthen our defence system. Even an interstate commission will not be a competent authority to deal with these vital problems, and it is, therefore, essential to establish a council such as I have suggested at the earliest possible date. Such a body would meet with general approval abroad, and it would be in accordance with the wishes of the vast majority of the Australian people. I may mention one instance to show how necessary it is to terminate our present haphazard method of dealing with national development and defence. The New South Wales Government has commenced the construction of a railway from Mary Vale to Sandy Hollow, at a cost of approximately £2,000,000, and the general opinion is that the railway is not needed. The State government contends that the line will be of great strategic importance and asked the Commonwealth to contribute towards its cost, but the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) said that it was of no importance for defence purposes. Owing to this conflict of opinion those directly concerned say that the railway is unnecessary, and that it is being constructed to benefit the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, which will be able to transport ore from BrokenH ill to Newcastle by a shorter route, and consequently, at a lower rate of freight than at present. Mr E. J. HARBISON -Hav e not some members of the Country party advocated its construction? structed through the Robertson electorate and that which I represent, and the presence of 1,000 navvies on the job will not assist us during the forthcoming election. If the line is being constructed merely to serve the interests of a powerful manufacturing concern such as the BrokenH i ll Proprietary Company Limited it is unjustified, and £2,000,000. may be wasted. Such projects could be submitted to a council which would have to determine whether the undertaking was of vital importance to Australia. The members of such a body would, I think, be sufficiently patriotic to give their services gratuitously. Consideration should also be given to the value of our main highways and bridges. We have been informed by competent authorities that a number of our important bridges could be blown to pieces by enemy guns within a few minutes; yet State governments are still continuing to build similar structures. bridge across the Brisbane River was commenced which, when comnleted, will have cost over £1,000,000. The Sydney Harbour' bridge, which cost over £10,000,000, is an excellent target for the guns of a hostile fleet. These and other similar facts have to be considered when -studying the defence of the country. The safety of the Sydney Harbour bridge is of great importance to that State, because if it were destroyed its replacement could not be considered for some years. fight? shall never have to resist an invader, but as our defence expenditure is heavier than it has ever been in the history of the Commonwealth, it is essential to consider the problem of defence from every angle. In view of all the circumstances, I trust that the Government will consider seriously the establishment of a national council to examine economic, developmental and defence problems confronting the Commonwealth to-day. I regret that the Government has not seen fit to make some provision in the budget for financial assistance to the Australian tobacco industry. The Government should have made provision for greater assistance to the tobacco-growers. This is a subject which might be submitted to an independent council of the nature I have-suggested in order to determine whether the industry is really of economic value to Australia. There are at present about 5,000 tobacco-growers in Australia, whereas there should be more than 10,000. Last year, the Government made a very small gesture in the direction of assisting the growers by reducing by 8d. per lb. the excise duty on tobacco manufactured wholly from Australian leaf. It was estimated that this would cause a loss of £90,000 to the revenue. No figures have since been submitted to show that that loss actually was suffered; and I very much doubt whether it was as much as that. In any case, this step has utterly failed to popularize Australian tobacco, mainly because tbe price reduction was too insignificant. In New South Wales, I am informed, only about 2 per cent., of Recently the construction of a Australian leaf was used in wholly Australian brands, but in Victoria, where there has been a tendency for some years to market Australian brands, mainly due to the presence of several small manufacturers, the proportion used wa3 20 per cent. I doubt whether the percentage is nearly so high in other States. In Western Australia, a local manufacturer has succeeded in marketing and popularizing cigarettes made from. Australian leaf and he is now the largest buyer of local leaf in that State. This industry produces as much revenue as the income tax, and more than the sales tax, the annual yield from it being over £S,000,000. The Tariff Board stated in its last report on the industry that no more than £6,500,000 should be taken from it in fairness to the local growers, manufacturers and consumers. Tlie Government is, therefore, able to make much more generous concessions than it has given hitherto. Unfortunately, however, it does not seem to be particularly interested in establishing a local tobacco industry. The reduction of excise on local leaf has been more than offset by a reduction of 8d. per lb. of the excise on cigarettes manufactured from imported leaf. I am informed that this reduction has resulted in a loss of £90,000 to the Treasury, although at the time it",27,Casey

I am not putting thesefiguresforward as absolutely reliable, because I have not been able to obtain official information. The whole thing seems to be shrouded in official secrecy. I have been informed confidentially, however, that the loss was as much as £90,000, which was given to the manufacturers virtually as a bonus to offset the loss caused by the reduction by 8d. of the excise on local leaf. Tbe Government's gesture of help to the local industry has not had the effect of re-establishing the industry on a sound basis. It has not resulted in a reduction of imports from the United States of America, which still supplies about 90 per cent, of all the tobacco consumed in Australia. Honourable members will agree with me that tariff protecment in this regard. Generally speaking, tion is failing of its purpose when imports continue steadily to increase. In 1934-35, the total importation of tobacco from all sources was 17,000,000 lb., but in 1935-36, it had risen to over 19,000,000 lb. while for 1936-37 it will be much higher. The Australian tobacco yield has steadily decreased. The honourable member's time has expired. -The debate on the Supply Bill provides honourable members with an opportunity to discuss a variety of subjects-a n opportunity of which they have not failed to take advantage. During this debate the fact that the Government has an extraordinarily fine record has been demonstrated intentionally by honourable members on this side of the House, and unintentionally by those on the other side. The Government has a creditable record of practical performance, not one of unfulfilled promises. The budget introduced' by tbe Treasurer ( Mr Casey) was undoubtedly a courageous statement. It was produced practically on the eve of a geneTal election, and yet, by no stretch of the imagination, could it be called an electioneering budget. The figures cited by the Treasurer afforded ample proof of the economic advance of Australia during the last few years. The primary industries, on which the prosperity of the country depends, are benefiting from higher prices. The wheat market has recovered in a remarkable manner. Wool prices last season were very satisfactory, and the tone of the opening sales in Sydney the other day gave us every reason to believe that the forthcoming series of sales will be equally satisfactory. We are all glad of that, because, even though the expression may bo somewhat overdone, we cannot escape the fact that ""Australia rides on the sheep's back "". Seldom have the secondary industries been in a more prosperous condition than at present. The building trade, which is a fair index to the economic state of the country, shows a most remarkable revival. Even though honourable members opposite may dispute official figures regarding the actual percentage of unemployment, they must admit that there has been a great improvethe economic position of the country is such as to justify our proper pride. While our economic position is undoubtedly satisfactory, it must be evident that we should be foolish not to take steps adequately to defend ourselves and that economic position. We cannot dispose of the matter merely by declaring, airily that there is no danger of attack, and that it is impossible to name any prospective enemy. We all know that covetous eyes are directed by eastern countries, and by those in Europe, upon any land that has room to absorb population, particularly if it possesses ""rich natural resources. That being so, I welcome the defence measures introduced by the Government, and I am sure that every right-minded Australian will do the same. The traditional defence of the. Empire is naval, and, theoretically, of course, naval defence is the most suitable for Australia, because, if it were effective, it would obviate any possible danger of war on Australian soil. The functions of the navy, generally speaking, are twofoldthe protection of trade routes and commerce generally, and the protection of the shores of the country against invasion. The provision of a navy that would be able to fulfil both those requirements is obviously beyond the power of Australia. Such a navy would have to be far greater-",29,Casey
106,"Mr Speaker (""Hon. (J. J. Bell )",,30,Casey
107,Mr Street (Corangamite) [12.36].,"than Australia can afford, and it is therefore right that Australia should make the biggest possible contribution to the Royal Navy on which we have continually ""to rely for protection. The Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) has recently had an opportunity to defence with the highest authorities at the Imperial Conference in London, and we have been assured that Australia's defence plans have received their approval. I know that we are tempted at times to become amateur strategists, but it would be foolish for us to criticize a policy that is founded upon the decisions of high military, naval and aerial authorities in this country and in England. Honourable members will recall that the late Earl Jellicoe suggested at one time that Great Britain should build a fareastern fleet of considerable magnitude, and that Australia should contribute towards the maintenance of that fleet. Then tbe ""Washington Naval Treaty was signed, and the far-eastern fleet was never built, because it appeared, at the time that the need for such a fleet had disappeared. However, the treaty was not renewed, and it was found that the example of Great Britain in regard to disarmament was not being followed by the rest of the world. Now Great Britain is building up its armaments again. It is strengthening its navy so that it will be able to afford Australia such help as would be necessary if this country were attacked. Sitting suspended from 1245 to 2 p.m. that the Royal Navy is gradually being built up, and, as the navy is to constitute Australia's first line of defence, the best part this country can play is to co-operate as much as possible with the British Navy. Speaking on the Defence Estimates in this House last year, the Leader of the Opposition saidIf this country provides a navy for itself from his speech quite fairly and I our people must hear in mind conclusively that the navy would be of no use unless operated in conjunction with the British Navy. of I agree entirely with that view. Speaking at the London Naval Conference last year, the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty saidIn estimating our requirements, we have to take into account responsibilities in European to-day consists of seven divisions-tw o waters, in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. These imply the necessity for a fleet of sufficient strength to be able to dispose simultaneously, in more than one area, the forces adequate to meet all reasonable defensive needs. It is for that purpose that the Singapore base is vitally necessary. ""Without discuss problems of imperial a strong naval force in the Pacific it will not be possible for this country to rely primarily upon naval defence The Singapore base, which is nearing completion, is essential for the protection of British interests in both the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. Apart from the navy, however, it is essential, of course, to develop the other arms of the service. In respect of the air force, I shall again quote from the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition in this House last year as follows:In any case, any attempt to defend this country by aircraft alone would possibly necessitate, as I have said, the creation of an air force of such a size as to be beyond the capacity of this country to maintain. Nevertheless, the power of aircraft to reconnoitre and attack at a distance, would be of the greatest importance to our system of defence. Aircraft are essential to combat the air forces of the enemy after he has effected a landing, and to perform essential functions for, and in co-operation with, the land forces. I come now to a consideration of the place of land forces in defence. In the Last resort the principal factor in our local defence will be our land forces. I quote those statements in order to emphasize the fact that it is a mistake to attempt to concentrate on the development of any one arm of the service to the total exclusion of any other arm. member will realize that I did not exclude the necessity for the maintenance of the Australian Navy. now dealing with a particular phase of this subject, I think the Leader of the Opposition will admit that I have quoted agree with it. The organization any force depends principally on two factors: first, the task which that force is designed to perform; and, secondly, the material and personnel available for the composition of that force. Our army peace organization cavalry divisions and five infantry divi-",30,Casey
108,Mr Street,I was pointing out,31,Casey
109,Mr Curtin,Surely the honourable,31,Casey
110,Mr Street,"No; but, as I amsions with a peace establishment at present filled by voluntary enlistment. Our field army organization, I believe, is sound and is certainly organized in accordance with right principles. However, the training of that army consists of only twelve days a year, of which six are spent in home training and six in camps of continuous training. That period is entirely inadequate. Only those who have personally endeavoured to train troops within so short a time can realize how extraordinarily difficult it is to attain a high standard in such circumstances. It does not give the militia commanders, or staff corps officers, any opportunity to reach a high standard with the troops for whose training they are responsible. I again urge upon the Government, therefore, the need to reconsider the lengthening of the training year with a view to restoring it to the former period of sixteen days. I feel sure that such an improvement would prove popular with the present militia troops, because these are voluntary recruits, and, furthermore, would result in that increased efficiency which is more desirable than anything else. Apart from lengthening the training year, however, we might also increase the efficiency of our land forces by increasing tlie strength of the permanent personnel. Our present permanent force is very small, consisting of artillery, engineering and various technical units, the total strength of which is only about 2,000 men, whilst our very highly efficient staff corps primarily responsible for its own defence. has a strength of only 250. This establishment falls far short of the necesis through the co-ordination of the three sary numbers, and I suggest the time is opportune to consider the. establishment of stronger permanent forces. A commencement of that work could be made by establishing two cavalry regiments, a brigade of infantry, and a brigade of field artillery. If that were done, it would be possible to have at all times one regiment of cavalry, one battalion of infantry and one regiment of artillery on exchange duty with an equivalent British unit i i another part of the world. The advantages of such an arrangement are so obvious that I do not need to emphasize them, nor the advantages of also having a highly-trained body of troops in the country ready for instant action. Quite apart from these considerations, however, such a force would provide a standard at which our militia forces could aim. A t present, they have no such standard to guide them, and the creation of a small standing army would, I feel sure, result in a very great improvement of their efficiency. It would, for instance, afford opportunities to officers of the staff corps to train in regimental duty and give them practice in command. Except in the case of junior officers, our staff corps officers to-day have no opportunity to undergo such training. When he graduates from Duntroon, an officer does a certain amount of training as adjutant to a battery or battalion, and he does a period of regimental attachment abroad; but that is the only regimental experience available to staff corps officers, and in no case does he get any practice in command. Officers in the militia are obliged constantly to work with a skeleton army and their imaginations are highly drawn upon too much in their endeavour to visualize what full strength unity would look like. The creation of a small permanent army would give them practice in handling larger bodies of troops. We are still adhering to the fundamental principles that were laid down at the Imperial Conference of 1923, and which have been re-affirmed from time to time. Among them is the principle that each country within the Empire should be The only way we can apply that principle arms of the service without unduly developing one of them at the expense of either of the other two. Our experts have advised us that our navy is to beour first line of defence. I accept the advice of our experts, but I hope that the Government will consider at least investigating the establishment of permanent forces in order to put our land forces on a better footing. The need for an efficient air force in a country like Australia is too obvious to need emphasis, but we must realize that the power of an air force is, to some extent, an unknown quantity, because it has not yet been possible to test out with any semblance of reality the degree of efficiency that antiaircraft defences have reached during the last few years. It is generally admitted that, these defences have reached a very high standard indeed, certainly far higher than the standard existing during the last stages of the Great War, when the air arm was still inits experimental stages. Thus, any estimate of the effect of either the hitting power or the stopping power of an air fleet is based mostly on conjecture. That an attack by air would be terrible is indisputable, but, on the other hand, wastage and replacements would bo abnormally heavy. I do not wish for one moment to underestimate the value of aircraft, because it is peculiarly suited to this country inasmuch as it possesses characteristics not associated with any other* arm. An air force can hit at a distance and operate effectively before, during and after the landing of an enemy, but we need to proceed with the greatest caution if it is proposed that we make the air our first line of defence. Associated with this aspect of our defence problem, is the very forward step made recently by this Government in the encouragement of the aircraft manufacturing industry in Australia. If Australia were at war and had to depend on overseas supplies of machines and replacements, it would experience very great difficulty in securing its requirements. Closely interwoven with the development of the three arms of the service is the matter of industrial mobilization development of our industrial resources as an aid to defence. As is generally recognized to-day, war is not merely an armed struggle in the field, nor is the defence of a country merely a matter of the numbers of sailors, soldiers and airmen available. the resources of a country for its defence includes all its activities, and no nation could effectively deal with an attack unless its industrial facilities and material assets were capable of meeting immediately the greatly increased demand that might be made upon them in time of war. I notice that some time ago this Government set up a committee to investigate this matter of industrial mobilization, and, I understand, that committee has already presented one report. I hope Mr Street. that it is working toward the objectives set out by the Minister when he was speaking on the Defence Estimates in this House last year. In common with other honourable members, I have always 'been, of the opinion that the defence of Australia should not be a party political question. I have always advocated that the Leader of the Opposition, whoever he might be, should be a permanent member of the Council of Defence, because in my opinion it is right and proper that the Opposition should be consulted in all matters relating to defence. Unless that is done, it is unlikely that we shall have continuity of policy. One does not need to be an expert to realize how disastrous any chopping and changing in regard to our defence policy must be to its efficiency. policy were any good, continuity would ue assured. the policy of the Government is that which has been drawn up by the greatest experts available, men who have devoted a lifetime to the study of defence. They have recommended that the navy shall be the first line of defence. the other two arms. that the air force shall bo the first line of defence. The experts who have adand the fostering .and vised the Minister recommend that the navy shall be the first line. I am prepared to accept the advice of the Council of Defence, the Committee of I m perial Defence, and the Imperial Conference itself. I wish to quote a short paragraph from The mobilization of the report of the Royal Military College for the period ended the 31st December, 1936. I recommend its perusal to all honourable members who have not yet read it. I also recommend an inspection of the college. At page 10, the report saysOur army is a militia force maintained on a nucleus basis, and a highly trained body of instructors is necessary for its administration and training and to enable it to expand should the necessity ever arise.

I should not be doing my duty if I did not mention the fruit industry. day, a deputation waited on different members to place before them the parlous condition of that industry. I trust that their representations will be given favorable consideration, and that the Government will realize the great benefit of this industry to Australia. It is one of the few primary industries which has had a very bad year, through no fault of its own. Inequitable shipping regulations, and the collapse of the market in Great Britain, were responsible for very great losses being suffered by the fruit-growers. A few years ago, in one portion of my electorate, a deep-water port was established with all the facilities necessary for shipping the fruit overseas. The bulk of the fruit grown in Tasmania was then produced within a radius of seven or eight miles of this port, and the growers made application for shipping accommodation. ment can exert a certain amount of influence on the shipping companies, because it has given them a monopoly of the refrigerated space. The reply to the request of the growers was that there was not sufficient wharf space to accommodate the large boats. Those interested in the matter then had the wharf extended and proper sheds erected for the storage of the fruit, so that it might be shipped from that port. were also interested in the matter. They were running small steamers, and they took the fruit from this port to the city of Hobart at a charge of 5d. and 6d. a case. Very few vessels enter that port to-day, because a monopoly controls the shipping services. But sufficient fruit could be provided there to load any number of ships. The Government should give assistance to these people and encourage them to increase their production. Help is particularly needed now for the current year, which has been difficult. The shipping companies have themselves Mr Frost. placed restrictions upon the export of fruit. Some time ago a monopoly was given to certain interests to carry the fruit, and the freight was fixed at 3s. 6d. a ease,toiutthe Australian Overseas Transport Association subsequently used the exchange rate as a justification for putting an extra charge of 7&d. a case on fruit for transport overseas so that although, technically, the freight rate was fixed at Yester3s. 6d. a case it is actually 4s. l£d. a case. It has been asked ""iWhy do the people pay it "" ? Unfortunately they must pay it or leave their fruit to rot in their orchards. The Government could and should do a great deal more to assist the marketing of fruit overseas. The German market, which formerly provided a market for 1,500,000 cases of our fruit, but has been closed to us for several years, may be re-opened at any time; but unless the Government takes a long view, our people will not be able to take advantage of it or of other continental markets when they re-open, for most of the orchardists will have become bankrupt and been obliged to leave their orchards. The fruit industry pays more than £1,000,000 in wages each year and makes possible the circulation of a very large amount of money. Thousands of people find emThe Commonwealth Governployment in this industry year in and year out who could not be employed in any other industry. Skilled work is provided in pruning, grafting, and other orchard operations, and a great deal of unskilled work is also found in fruit picking and otherwise. I trust that the Government will consider seriously the adoption of some policy which will give reasonable help to these people who are doing so much to develop this industry But other companies and to occupy land whicli could not be profitably used in any other way. If the Government would even reasonably distribute through the various States its munition factories, aircraft factories, and other establishments connected with the defence of the country, we should not have quite so much ground for complaint; but actually all these establishments which provide employment are located in Melbourne and Sydney. Tasmania, as every one knows, has an unlimited supply of hydro-electric power and exceptional water facilities. If the aircraft factory had been established in Tasmania instead of at Fishermen's Bend, and if the money made available for the development of shale oil deposits at Latrobe instead of at Newnes, the people of the smaller States, and particularly of Tasmania, would not feel that they have such substantial ground for complaint. If the smaller States could be helped to develop their latent resoiirces they would soon become self-supporting and would not need Commonwealth grants to assist them. Moreover, their populations would increase. To-day their young people are drifting away to other States which offer employment and better prospects of success. As honourable members are well aware, an infantile paralysis epidemic is raging in Melbourne. This is due to the slum conditions that prevail in that city. The Government should do something effective to improve the housing conditions of the people. Russia is undergoing great development at present, but the Soviet Government of that country has had to prevent the establishment of additional factories in Moscow because of the herding of people in that city. Commonwealth Government, however, seems to have no time to think of a problem of that description. All its activities seem to be concentrated in the big cities, the reason being that the votes sent raging in Melbourne. are there. What is needed, of course, is that the country districts, as opposed to urban areas, should be developed. The housing conditions in parts of Melnation should be decentralized; also bourne and Sydney are deplorable. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr factories, and other auxiliaries to the Ward) and the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) could take members of the Government to parts of Sydney in which the housing is the worse in the world. While I was in London recently, I asked a policeman to take me to the worse street in the East End. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr other countries want our goods they Makin) was with me at the time. The' policeman took us to a street which he said was the worse. hesitation in saying that, although we boast of the housing conditions of the people of Australia, some of the people in our big cities are housed under worse conthe policy that I have outlined were ditions than those that we saw that day. I consider that, in consequence of the steps being taken in Great Britain to improve housing conditions, the English were to be spent race in the next decade will be healthier and more vigorous than it has ever been. I understand that 3,000,000 new homes have been built in Great Britain in the last few years. In Manchester, where appalling slum conditions formerly obtained, more than 34,000 homes have been built for the workers. Yet in Australia, which is a young country with less than 7,000,000 inhabitants, this Government is allowing slum conditions to be perpetuated. The Prime Minister in his policy speech prior to the last election said that if the Government were returned to power it would cooperate with the State governments in a comprehensive housing scheme, but nothing has been done to fulfil that promise. No doubt the right honourable gentleman and his colleagues are afraid that if they press a"" housing scheme on their capitalistic friends who own the hovels in which the workers now live, they will withdraw their support of the Government. Nothing effective is likely to be done in this direction until a Labour goThe vernment assumes office. Fortunately, that will occur before very long. It is shameful that the housing conditions of the Australian people should be responsible for epidemics such as that at preWe should be developing a strong and virile race in this country. The permanent forces for the defence of the the munition factories, the small arm defence system. The Minister for Defence had a good deal to say a day or so ago about the need for a strong navy, his idea being that then we should have ships to convoy overseas the vessels which carry our goods to other parts of the world. I contend that if the people of should themselves provide the convoys. The defence vote should be expended in But I have no providing defence measures on a comprehensive scale in each State of the Commonwealth. The money should not be chiefly spent in Melbourne and Sydney. If adopted, the people would be in a position to defend themselves in case of attack. honourable member for .Franklin( Mr tend that if . it is to apply to one section Frost) referred a few moments ago to the housing conditions in Great Britain. He and I were in a party in Liverpool which was shown through a number of flats recently built in that city to improve its housing conditions. Each of these had two nice bedrooms, a kitchen or dining room, and a bathroom and laundry, with hot water connected to the bathroom, laundry and kitchen. The rental for each flat was 7s. 8d. a week and it included electric lighting and rates. It should be possible to do something of that kind in Australia, but before effective steps of that kind can be taken the high building costs due to our xurwise fiscal policy will have to be eliminated. My chief purpose in participating in this debate is to urge the Government to reconsider its recently adopted trade diversion policy, which, I assure it, is causing a great deal of antagonism not only in the motor industry, but also in the radio and other industries. Some time ago a firm, which I could name, wished to import a number of small oil engines of from 1£ to 5 horse-power, but the Government refused it permission to do so on the ground that such engines could be manufactured in Australia. That attitude must inevitably make enemies of people who would otherwise be strong government supporters. be taken to minimize the trade restrictions that liave been applied by the Government. I am satisfied that such a course would be advantageous to tbe country. The benefit of the Government's action in reducing tariffs is wholly was a member, spent about £8,000 in an destroyed by these restrictions. Great need exists also for more sympaterest of British capital in the developthetic treatment by this Government of the wheat-growing industry. If our fiscal policy causes heavy additional costs on Yampi Island. Tbe people whom we to be imposed on all the requirements of the farmers, a strong case exists for the granting of relief to the farmers in other directions. Seeing that the manufacturers of Australia are allowed to charge higher prices for their products than would apply if we had an open market, it is only right that the farmers should be assured of a higher price for their wheat which is consumed locally. I do not believe in the unwise policy which the Government is adopting, but I conof the community it should apply to other sections also. As increased costs up to 75 per cent, have been imposed on all the necessities of the farmers, a minimum price should be stipulated for the wheat they sell for homo consumption. wheat is 6s. a bushel? prefer an open and free market, so that we could buy where we sell. I have suggested a payable minimum price for wheat for local consumption because the policy of the Government assures a payable price for the products of those engaged in other industries. mum price? wheat on the markets of the world at a price at least equivalent to what is considered to be payable for wheat sold on the local market, it might be possible for the Government to assume responsibility for the sale of all the wheat produced, guarantee the farmer a fair price, and itself retain any surplus over that price that might be realized on wheat sold overseas. I should not advise such a policy, but when certain sections of the community are put in an advantageous position in consequence of government Action should policy, I think that other sections should also be entitled to such treatment. I welcome the statement by the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) regarding the development of the Yampi Sound iron ore deposits. An early syndicate, of which I unsuccessful attempt to arouse the inment of the more than 100,000,000 tons of iron ore which are above high water mark tried to interest in the project declared that it was not a feasible proposition because of the great distance to Britain. We lost our money and got out. Another company later obtained a lease from the State government and induced the investment of British capital in the development of the island's resources.

Once these men become employed there, there is no telling what development will take place. Moreover, tbe sale of iron ore to Japan for a few years, will pay for the development work that is being done. able to supply Great Britain as well as J apan ? in 1922 when we tried to interest Great Britain, but then the distance was considered to be too great. iron ore now. Great Britain refused to touch it. Yampi Sound itself is a magnificent deepwater harbour which could hold the whole of the British fleet. It is sheltered by two big islands. I remind the Government that there is nothing to prevent it from imposing whatever restrictions upon the export of iron ore it likes, should the imperative that we should give the need ever arise. Settlement of that part will be of great benefit to Western Australia, and I hope that the Commonwealth Government, instead of retarding the development of Yampi, will do everything in its power to assist it. I so many honourable members strongly supporting the renewal of borrowing in Great Britain. There is nothing to justify it. I remind the House of tbe extravagance in the years from 1920 to 1929, when more than £400,000,000 was borrowed, mostly overseas. In that period prices for wool and wheat exported were tbe highest that had ever been recorded in the history of the country, yet, when the depression came in 1930, it was found that the country had not benefited to the slightest degree from those high prices. That was due entirely to the huge amount of money that had been spent extravagantly while piling up a gigantic interest bill, unduly magnified by heavy customs duties on imports. Eollies have to be paid for, and, if we must borrow, let us borrow in Australia. No matter what difficulties I may experience in regard to the policy of the Government, there is one thing that would justify my strongest support being given to it, and that is its defence policy. I congratulate the Government on it, but I deeply regret the restriction not only in Australia, but all over the world, of the flow of trade and commerce as the result of intense nationalism. Thei l l feeling that has developed between countries as the result of this nationalism cannot be over-estimated. It has undoubtedly created such a feeling of antagonism between nations that from day to day we can never say that we are not going to have a repetition of the horrors of the years 1914-18. It is essential that we put our house in order, and it is because of the Government's defence policy that I give it my support. Almost the whole world policy is one of economic nationalism, creating jealousy, hatred and bitterness, and this necessitates that we should be prepared for any eventuality. The Labour policy of defence and the attitude of the Lang group on this question, together with our association with the Home Land, makes it Government a strong majority to carry it out. The very fullest consideration should be given to the Commonwealth's trade diversion policy, and recognition should be given not only to the injustice that is being am astonished to have heard done to other countries, but also to the ill-feeling that 13 being created among our own people. I hope that the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) will give consideration to the request by Western Australia for Commonwealth assistance towards the development of civil aviation in that State. That is a direction in which Commonwealth assistance could sensibly be given because young aviators are being trained, and who may prove later to be of enormous value to our defence. this opportunity to direct the attention of the House to discrepancies in the Government's taxation administration.

127,Mr Clark (Darling) [2.53],"I takewhat the Government had done regarding taxation, but the budget was not accepted exactly with open arms by a large section of its own following. The Sydney Morning Herald of the 30th August, 1937, saidA lack of one hoped-for proposal has caused deep disappointment to many supporters of the Government. The Treasurer said that the Government had substantially reduced taxation. On that point the Sydney Morning Herald saidWhen the Treasurer claims, however, that he has almost halved the taxation of Australia, he is treading on uncertain ground. In the last year of the Scullin Administration total collections of taxes were £53,000,000, whereas this Government collected taxes amounting to £63,000,000 in 1936-37, which is an increase of £10,000,000. In the face of that, I fail to see how the Government can claim that it has substantially reduced taxation. What it has done has been to remove the taxes from its wealthy friends, the people best able to bear them, and increase the indirect taxes-taxes upon the food of the poorer classes. For instance, the Government took action against the best interests of the country to reduce the land tax. City properties yield 67 per cent, of the land tax and country properties only 33 per cent. The rate of that tax has been reduced by 50 per cent., and the wealthy supporters of the Government have thereby benefited substantially. is said that the land tax bill of the Bank of New South Wales has been reduced by £30,000 per annum. The land tax was introduced by the Labour government in 1910, with the object of promoting closer settlement by means of breaking up large estates and doing away with monopolistic ownership. It then achieved the results for which it was designed. In 1910 and 1911 land valued at £23,200,000 was transferred from the taxable to the non-taxable field, as the result of the breaking up of vast estates. In 1929-30, during the regime of the Scullin Government, land to the value of £10,400,000 was similarly transferred. But, in the last two years for which records are obtainable, 1932-33 and 193334, when the tax was reduced first by Mr Olwrk. one-third, and then by one-half, the land transferred was valued at only £2,500,000. The slump was due to the policy pursued by this Government. As the result of this policy monopolistic ownership of land is occurring once more. Country towns are becoming land-locked, and where employment was once given by many men on small holdings, employment has diminished to a considerable degree. Less money is being spent as the result of great pastoral companies owning the land and sending their profits abroad. Many towns are decaying. It is of serious moment to the people of Australia, particularly those in the outback areas. These companies which arc acquiring additional land as the result of the reduced rate of the land tax, have broken themselves up and operate under different names, and, in this way, evade much of the tax. Also they escape income tax and, as the companies never die, they are not subject to probate duties. All this was shown in the evidence before the Royal Commission on Taxation. In this direction there is room for better administration. There is a determined demand throughout Australia for land. In the outback areas of New South Wales recently thirteen blocks were made available for settlement in the western land division and over 4,700 applications were received for them. For the Government to contend that there is no demand for land is incorrect. People are definitely desirous It of obtaining land at the present time. They include the sons of farmers and graziers who are prepared to produce wealth in those areas, and many others, who have spent a life time in performing work of this nature and are seeking an opportunity to launch out on their own behalf. I regret that the Government, while doing nothing to encourage the development of those areas, is actually bringing about stagnation in rural centres. The wealthy friends of the Government have been treated liberally through the concessions given to pastoral interests. One of the most outstanding examples of those large amounts distributed among the Government's wealthy supporters is to be found in the new provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, relating to the treatment for taxation purposes of the natural increase of live stock. would only be taken into account in makPrior to 1936, the owner of live stock had the option either of including in, or excluding from, his income tax return the value of the natural increase on hand at the 30th June of each year. Where a taxpayer decided to include the natural increase, it followed that in each year's assessment he paid tax on the value of all live stock on hand, inunder the amended act it received as a cluding the natural increase. Where the natural increase was excluded, the payment of tax was postponed until such time as the increase was sold. The average farmer or grazier, who possessed comparatively small holdings, invariably included the natural increase in his returns, because he had very little to gain -by omitting them. On the other hand the large grazier and the pastoral companies always excluded the natural increase, because, by so doing, they postponed the payment of the tax until such time as the stock was sold. The fact that it was possible for one person to include the natural increase, and for another to exclude it, created an unsatisfactory condition. The act of 1936 remedied the position by requiring all live stock owners to include in their returns the value of the natural increase. But a remarkable provision, section 35, was inserted in the act» of 1936, providing that where the natural increase had previously been omitted from tax returns, the value of such natural increase on hand at the 30th June, 1935, was to be treated as a deduction under the heading of "" stock on hand at the beginning of the year "" for the purposes of the 1936 assessment. This had the effect of excluding from taxation the value of the natoiral increase. An illustration, common to large pasfor them in the year 1936. Whilst the toral companies, will explain how the secsmall grazier, who included the natural tion presented a taxation bonus to increase in his returns, paid every penny favoured taxpayers. A t the 30th June, of tax, the big interests who are able to 1936, a pastoral company might have on purchase the best advice on taxation hand 100,000 sheep, representing for matters and to forecast correctly the sake of argument, 40,000 sheep purchased trend of taxation legislation, receive a and 60,000 natural increase, the latter nice taxation bonus from a "" dying "" gopossibly being the residue of several vernment. It is no wonder that a certain years. As the company exercised its "" country doctor "" enjoyed the hospitality option to exclude the natural increase of for taxation returns, it follows that for the purposes of the 1935 assessment, the value of the 40,000 sheep purchased ing the assessment, and the value of the 60,000 natural increase would be ignored. Had the act not been amended the company would, in the 1936 assessment, have received a deduction only in respect of the value of the 40,000 sheep taken into account in the 1935 assessment. But deduction, not only the value of the 40,000 sheep purchased, but also the market value of the 60,000 natural increase. In short it received a special deduction of at least £30,000, representing the value of the natural increase previously omitted from returns, and so it escaped taxation on an income of £30,000. The Government may contend that the company paid tax in respect of the natural increase when it was sold. If this is admitted, the company had no right whatsoever to receive a set-off against the proceeds of the sale, the set-off allowed under the act being in most cases the market value of the natural increase sold. To lay emphasis on this contention, the position is that had the increase been sold during 19'35, the company would have been taxed on the total proceeds, no set-off being allowed. By selling the natural increase during 1936, a deduction of the market. value of the natural increase sold is allowed. The whole business presents a striking illustration of how taxation acts can be "" doctored"" in the interests of people who are in the best position to shoulder taxation responsibilities. The big pastoralists who elected to omit the natural increase, from their returns displayed an uncanny anticipation of what the Government intended to do as a parting gesture London interests who shared in the natural increase bonus. In the year ended the 30th June, 1936, land tax amounting to £191,000 was written off by this Government. There have been many instances of large pastoral interests who were able to pay the tax receiving most favorable treatment from the Government. During this debate the postponement of the operation of the tax on bonus shares was stressed by an honourable member, who cited the example of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which received the benefit of distributing £7,000,000 in bonus shares without having to pay income tax. Such action calls for the censure of the Government by this House. The Government should give greater consideration generally to the rural population by taking steps to relieve unemployment in country areas, and by ensuring the continuous development of country towns. A progressive developmental policy is most necessary. I have repeatedly made requests for the provision of telephone lines and better postal facilibut as the outcome of the restriction ties, because both of these essential services have been sadly neglected by the Government. As a matter of fact, in outback areas, little has been done in recent years in regard to the construction of new telephone and telegraph facilities. The Government should be prepared to give some measure of consideration to the people in this regard. The roads in the outback areas are also neglected, and much work remains to be done in connection with them. AlthoughI pointed out in a previous debate how the proceeds from the petrol tax could be most advantageously spent, the Government did not make sufficient provision to ensure that this money was spent on the proper maintenance of country roads. When improving country telephone services, the Government should give consideration.to the installation of rural automatic exchanges. In a few centres these exchanges have been provided, but many country towns suffer the inconvenience of the lack of a continuous telephone service. By the establishment of rural automatic exchanges such a facility could be given to the people and their social condition would be improved thereby. The possibilities of wireless telephony in far-distant areas have not bean properly investigated by the Postal 3>eMr Ci&rk. partment. Wireless telephony has been proved to be a practical proposition by the "" Flying Doctor"" service, and if the department were to provide this facility in the Never-Never, where it would cost hundreds of pounds to erect ordinary telephone lines, the needs of the people would be better served. The trade diversion policy of the Commonwealth Government, which restricted the importation of many lines of goods from Japan, has acted so detrimentally to country interests as to bring about a continuous loss to the wool growers. At the Sydney wool sales, which recently opened, the Japanese representatives did not operate. When tbe Government introduced its trade diversion policy last year, Japan began to develop the staple fibre industry. In May, 1936the month in. which the Government introduced its proposals-Japan was producing about 35 tons of staple fibre a day; which was placed upon the export of their goods to Australia, it began vigorously to increase the production of this material. It was estimated that, by the end of 19.36, the production of staple fibre would be 170 tons a day. The Oriental Economist, which is published in Japan, contains startling figures in connection with the development of this particular industry. Several years .ago Japan purchased from Australia about 750,000 bales of wool; but, as the result of the trade diversion policy of Australia, Japanese buyers left the wool market for a considerable time, with a consequent loss of millions of pounds to Australian wool-growers. Since their return to the sales, the Japanese buyers have purchased only limited quantities of wool, and in the circumstances are not likely to buy so much as they did prior to the interference of the Commonwealth Government. The Oriental Economist of July last statedThe national production of staple fiber is expanding rapidly. Tho Japan Staple Fiber Association, which started gathering data on the situation from March of this year, reports that the output during the second quarter ran as follows:-March, 1.0,000.000 !b. April, 10,500,000 lb.; and May, ; 11,622,000 lb. This waa a rate of increase from two to three times that of the year before. Staple fiber production last year was 46,000,000 lb., as contrasted to 14,000,000 in 1035 and 5,000,000 in 1934. An article in the Oriental Economist It must affect the man who grows the of June, 1937, statedThe volume of staple fiber exports in the must also affect business men in country first four months of this year was 5,9(36,000 towns and their employees, until, evenlb., valued at 3,208,000 yen. Staple fiber tually, the effect will be felt throughout yarn exports in the same period were 1,597,000 lb., worth 1,504,000 yen, and the export the length and breadth of the Commontrade in fabrics from staple fiber also wealth. The Government's policy in this increased to 2,723,000 square yards in volume regard is in itself enough to condemn it and 1,100,000 yen in value. The three staple fiber items combined provided 5,900,000 yen in the eye3 of the people, and I have no worth of export trade for Japan in the four doubt months, or an average monthly trade of 1,500,000 yen. If it keeps on expanding at the current rate, this comparatively newest textile item's contribution towards Japan's gotten all about it long ago. export trade should attain the importance of 18,000,000 yen for the whole yeaT of 1937, again when the ill effects of the policy and thus become one of the major articles of the nation's foreign trade.

The same trend has been noticeable in manufacturing industries throughout the country. In 1929, the number of persons employed in factories was 185,000, who received an average yearly wage of £208, or £4 a week. In 1936, the number had increased to 197,000, but the average yearly wage was only £170. In 1929, the total wages paid amounted to £38,545,000, but by 1936 this figure had declined to £33,298,000, despite the fact that the number of factory workers had increased by 12,000. Even in those industries where employment has increased, the increase is due, not to the Government's policy, but ment everything it knows.

""We shall withhold our requests, and make them to the incoming Labour Government. At the next election, the people will reward the present Government with dismissal for tbe disservice it has rendered to the community. To-day, the Government is being criticized even by those who wore formerly among its staunchest friends. The Government has repeatedly evaded questions on the subject of immigration, but recently it has shown a disposition to favour a scheme for bringing inchildren from overseas to congest the labour market, although we still have a vast army of unemployed. This unemployment is greatest among our own young people with whom the newcomers would be in most active competition. If the Government is anxious to resume immigration, it should first provide work for all those who are already in the country. When these are absorbed, it is time enough to talk about bringing in more people from overseas. We must find a place in industry for the thousands of boys and girls who are now drifting aimlessly through life without employment and without hope. One way of doing this would be to shorten the working weiek, and I hope that provision for this and other Mr Cloak. reforms will be made by the incoming Government when it has the opportunity to put its policy into effect. [3.25] I propose to touch upon the subject of defence before going on to deal with other matters pertaining to the Northern Territory and its development, such as the meat industry, fisheries, agriculture, and malnutrition among the women and children of the north and western Queensland. Any man who has the safety and welfare of his country at heart must necessarily hesitate before speaking of defence in a time of crisis. A government that does its duty naturally does not tell even to Parliado so it might divulge something that would be' of use to an enemy. No doubt it will be argued that Parliament has the right to know everything, that if there cussed in public there is power to hold a secret session as was done during the war. In theory that is all very well, but it would not work out in practice while there are men in politics who place their allegiance to party before their allegiance to their country, men who are such slaves to caucus that they would find it difficult to preserve national secrets however grave. They are the men who would be first to yell for protection if a shell were dropped a few miles from them. They do not appreciate what war means because, instead of standing to in the trenches, they spent their youth urging men not to fight alongside us in France. Some of them are not to blame for not going to the war; that is a matter for their consciences. And some of them axe not to blame for trusting Moscow delegates with their secrets, because they have the peculiar bent of mind which makes it seem worthwhile for them to curry favour with Moscow. Because of the presence of such men in politics, particularly one or two for whom a foreign vote means the difference between election and defeat, I realize the difficulty which the Government has in making a frank statement on the details of defence, and I should be the last man in the House to ask it to make such a statement even in strict confidence. For it to do so would",42,Casey
130,Mr Blain (Northern Territory),"be for it to run tbe risk of having the information leak out, perhaps to the gentlemen who were congratulated a few years ago direct from Moscow on starting the ""Minority Movement"", and who afterwards scuttled to Russia for instrucyears before that period, when Queen Victions and returned to New South ""Wales to inaugurate the sit-down strikes on the coal-fields.

While I am naturally not anxious to utter any criticism without having full knowledge of what the Government may be considering, I am anxious to emphasize some points, the main being that the crucial area of defence in Australia is the north. We had the spectacle the other day of a foreign boat being pulled into Darwin wharf, a boat which has been taking shell from pearling beds we have always regarded as the hunting grounds of Australian pearlers, so that a proclamation could be read calling up its crew for the service of their country against a nation friendly to us. Had the call to those men been to fight against Australia, it would have come as a shock to honourable members to realize that there would have been enough of .them to outnumber Australians on our northern coast, whilst every one of them would have had the benefit of military, or naval training, as a conscript. Moreover, they would have had sufficient fast motor vessels in their pearling fleets, backed by big Japanese firms like Mitsuis, the industrial bankers, to land at any point in the north three or four battalions, fully white race, and our immense resources. armed, equipped and provisioned, and with a fairly adjacent base in Palau in the Japanese mandated islands. 'Whatever might have been the ultimate fate of such a force, the moral effect of their capture of a large area of this country would have been tremendous. Apart from this we would have to contend with the menace of being compelled to conduct a war in northern waters without an enemy landing on our shores. I impress on the Government that the development of the Japanese pearling business createsan entirely new situation in respect of the defence of northern Australia, and I plead with it to take measures to meet this menace. I am not speaking in any spirit of enmity toward the Japanese, because they have always been friendly to Great Britain, but precaution should be our first line of defence. Ten years before the Great Wari t was difficult to think of Germany as our next enemy. Twenty toria's grandson occupied the German throne, it would have been unthinkable, whilst 30 years before, Britain actually helped Germany with all its power to get New Guinea territory, because it was felt that Germany was a neighbour much preferable to France or any other power. We must, therefore, always provide for any eventuality. To-day the Dutch East Indies have less than us to fear from a possible aggressor, because they are densely populated, and no invader could push out that population. However, they are embarking on a programme, which, it seems to me, is comparable with that being undertaken in respect of the whole of Australia which is a greater, nation than even Holland, the mother country of the Indies. The Indies, I understand, are providing for 200 new fighting aeroplanes, some new cruisers, bases which will reach as far south as Dtttch New Guinea, and a citizen army seven times the size of our present citizen force. Holland must feel, apparently, that a situation of urgency has arisen, because it has customarily been averse to the establishment of citizen armies among its native peoples. When it has armed the Indies, according to this programme, we shall have an immediate neighbour more powerful than Australia, despite our I am not opposing the defence vote; indeed, I question whether it is sufficient. If double the amount were provided to put northern Australia on an adequate defence basis it would not be too much. We should have a base and a dock at Darwin which would provide head-quarters in war time for at least 10,000-ton cruisers. The present method of handling shipping at Darwin is farcical. To-day two vessels find it difficult to come into the wharf at the same time. We should have adequate guns, men and stores, and equipment in the north, whilst a number of naval and military officers should undergo regular training along the northern coast. I trust that somebody high up in our military forces has an intimate knowledge of northern conditions, though I do not know who he could be, and also I trust that some scheme for co-ordinating what knowledge does exist in respect of the north, ' in a time of emergency, is being considered. As a returned soldier, and a surveyor who knows the north, I shall gladly give all the help I .can in this direction, though there are probably men like General McNicol, of Rabaul, who can be even more useful because of their experience in command and strategy. I urge the Minister not to be overcome with a sense of the importance of the south, but to be guided entirely by defence, and not political, considerations. If it is worth Britain's while to spend tens of millions of pounds on Singapore, Hong Kong and other fortified bases, when it has nothing to lose in the Orient but attached colonies and dominions which are certainly not Great Britain's lifeblood, it is even more important -that pains to defend itself when invasion might menace its existence as a nation. In that respect, I point out that it is the announced policy of the High Command of Great Britain that if the mandated territory of New Guinea were returned to Germany, it would not add very considerably to Germany's resources or to Britain's loss, but that, from a strategic point of view, the value of such action would be incalculable. I hope that honourable members will realize that fact. This Government seems to be under the delusion that nothing intelligent comes out of tbe north. Ministers seem to .think that it is unnecessary for Australia to adopt the practice of training tropical administrators from their boyhood as has been done by Britain in Malaya. It seems to be an essential to this Government that administrators for the Northern Territory should have had no tropical experience. When the Minister for the Interior( Mr Paterson) visited Darwin recently, I was not even notified, and he appeared to be more concerned with the job of placating an imported malcontent from the Newcastle coal-fields, and smoothing the way for a new administrator about whose Mr Blain. capacity he must have been nervous, than about hearing the views of men who know the country thoroughly and could help him with constructive ideas and technical knowledge. I trust that the Minister for Defence will mobilize all those who possess exact knowledge of the north. In this respect, I hope that the Government does not agree with the policy of the Department of the Interior. Residents of the Northern Territory are most likely to feel the first and last strokes of an invasion and, apart from the fact that the open door to the Commonwealth is the Northern Territory, they would be the worse sufferers from any aggression because of lack of food resources and because of their isolation from the capital cities. I commend these ideas to the Minister in a friendly spirit, and I hope that he will isolated investments and some regard them as coming from one who has had a better access to knowledge of the north and has lived for years closer to the point of any likely invasion than any Australia should spare no other honourable member in this House. I wish now to deal with matters directly concerning the welfare of industries which are of vital importance to the Northern Territory and Australia as a whole. Replying to a question in this House yesterday, the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) stated that 95 per cent, of the beef grown in New South Wales was sold in that State, whilst 85 per cent, of the total exports of meat from Australia came from Queensland and Western Australia. I point out that a large proportion of those exports is produced in the Northern Territory and the Gulf of Carpentaria, and I suggest that the fact that so little of our meat is exported emphasizes the necessity for stabilizing the markets in our capital cities. Honourable members should make themselves familiar with the manner in which these markets are influenced by certain sections of the master butchers. In this respect, I am concerned particularly with the position existing at the abattoirs at Brisbane and Adelaide, because it is from these abattoirs that much of the meat that is produced in the Northern Territory is exported, and exploited under unfair conditions. At the moment, I am not referring to that meat produced in the Northern Territory, which ia exported from emphasize that much meat, just under chiller standard, does not get a fair deal at the hands of the master butchers in the capital cities, and I suggest that honourable members opposite should be more concerned with rectifying this matter than in criticizing this Government for its alleged lack of ability to deal with the situation. In their efforts to defend their operations the master butchers are throwing up a smoke screen, and I ask the Government not to place too much credence in the statements made at their recent meeting in Sydney, as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald. 1 point out, first of all, that there is very right. State regulations prevent him, little real competition at the Brisbane abattoirs for meat which is just under chiller standard. One buyer operates for many others, and the allocation or division of the spoils is made after the sale. This meat is purchased by certain master butchers or operators, who possess no holding grounds. The market under the present selling methods is overloaded with inferior dairy meat, which they go out of their way to purchase as a standby. are enabled to depress the price of choice meat just under chiller standard. The prices are depressed. Consequently, I notice of that. from the Northern Territory to Adelaide is at the mercy too of unfair conditions, namely purchase hy public auction. The men in the Alice Springs area can raise in average years only one draft of bullocks a year. They might have only 100 or 200 head, because they are in a small way. a lot of worry, and many sleepless nights, wondering whether they will accidentally catch a good market in Adelaide and obtain £9 or £10 for a chiller, or encounter a depressed market and obtain only £7 for it, and thus barely cover costs. are brought in from the Northern Territory, 90 per cent, is the property of Vestey""s and Bovril. that. The Bovril concern, at a moderate estimate, has 1SO,000 head on its own station. Most of their cattle and Vestey's the Wyndham works. I are sent to Wyndham works under a different set of killing conditions. not be nearly as large as has been suggested. impress on the Government is the desirability of assisting these growers of beef by paying greater attention to the local market than to the export trade. We could afford to give away chiller meat if we could control the depression of prices by the master butchers in connection with the local supply. I respect the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) for his endeavors to put the matter however, from doing so. Honourable members should not criticize the right honourable gentleman but should approach the seat of the trouble and endeavour to induce the State governments to take action. There is now chain killing in Sydney. The only way to solve the problem is to have the beefgraded on the hooks at the abattoirs. If the grower himself had control of the matter, and were not, metaphorically, placed inside a barbed By these tactics they wire entanglement, with the master butcher outside levelling a gun at him, the whole problem would be solved. The grower would obtain a fair ask honourable members to take remuneration, and the people of AusMeat which goes tralia would know that they were getting first, second, or third grade meat, not culled dairy cows. Tho people of the Northern Territory who are producing this choice meat arc penalized because the culled cows of the dairymen on the coast are allowed to go on the market and depress prices, coupled with faked They experience bidding by the drop of a thumb. There are one or two other matters appertaining to the Northern Territory that I wish to mention. ber propose to tell us that if he is not given a. vote he will resign his scat? for Griffith( Mr Baker) knows that I have a vote in respect of Northern Territory matters.

136,Mr Blain,"The honourable memberI wish, to refer to tlie possibility of developing the fisheries industry in the Northern Territory. I was pleased to note that the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) had taken such a keen interest, with Dr. Thompson, in Brisbane waters, a few weeks ago. I wish to go further. I have been on most of the rivers of the Northern Territory, and have no hesitation in saying that they are alive with barramundi and other choice fish, as well as deep sea fish. There grows the best tobacco in Australia. is no likelihood of the industry being developed unless the Commonwealth Government takes positive action to assist the fishermen. I ask it to allow Dr. Thompson to confer with those persons in the Northern Territory who are well acquainted with its waters, with a view to establishing the fishing industry on a basis comparable to the fleet of small fishermen in the North Sea who did such valuable work during the last war. I need not dwell on this aspect as honourable members will seize its growing importance among the foreign pearling fleets. Another matter that demands attention is the investigation of the possibilities of the Northern Territory for agricultural production. So many reports have been made on this matter, some adverse and others optimistic, that I am rather diffident about stating my views. Scientists have visited the Northern Territory, but have not remained there long enough to work out their theories; they have scuttled back to Canberra after a visit of about a month. I urge that the Northern Territory be placed definitely on a soil survey basis. The only person that I can think of who is capable of doing that is Dr. Prescott, who needs no introduction to honourable members. ""We all know that he has recently visited Russia for the purpose of studying the Glinka soil survey, the most renowned in the world. It was begun many years ago, and is one of the most remarkable achievements of recent years. As late as 1929 there was a dearth of soil surveyors; I believe that only one-from the Department of Agriculture of New South""Wales-could be found in Australia. I urge that the services of Dr. Prescott be availed of for the making of a definite soil survey that will last for all time. Some very definite informaMr Slain. Lion has been published within recent years. My friend, the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden) has mentioned the tobacco industry, for the establishment of which the northern parts of Australia are eminently suited. He has pointed out that north of 20 degrees south latitude is the only area in which tobacco suited to the taste of Australians, by virtue of its aroma, can be grown. the honourable member for Darling Downs based his statement may be out of date; I trust that it is. The fact remains, however, that north of 20 degrees south latitude tobacco is grown which is superior to that grown in the southern parts of Australia. There are millions of acres of that kind of tobacco land apart from other tropical products in the Northern Territory. I mention particularly the districts served by the Daly and Katherine rivers and the Pine Creek areas. One or two growers are already growing tobacco in the Daly river district under unnatural, almost barbaric, conditions. On my representations, the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) was good enough to allow one man to manufacture tobacco, but he is confronted with an insuperable difficulty in the excise that is imposed. The Aboriginals Department has agreed to purchase his crop at 2s. lOd. per lb., but as the excise amounts to 3s. lOd. per lb. sales at that figure would be quite unprofitable. I appeal to the Minister for the Interior( Mr Paterson) and the Minister for Trade and Customs, if they have at heart the development of the Northern Territory on an agricultural basis, to take positive action. If the excise were not imposed, this man could supply tobacco to the Aboriginals Department at a profit. When he had become firmly established, others might engage in tobacco-growing, and eventually there would be no need to continue this concession. I cannot resume my seat without mentioning the matter referred to by the honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark), that of malnutrition in inland areas. Some honourable members are rather inclined to scoff at any mention of this",46,Casey

138,Mr Blain,"The report on whichmatter. I assure them that it constitutes a very real menace. I invite the cooperation of members representing western Queensland divisions, particularly the honourable members for Kennedy( Mr Eiordan) and Maranoa( Mr that conference, but I agree with the conHunter), because those two large electorates, particularly the western end of Maranoa, are characterized by almost as grim conditions as are to be found in the area adjoining it and which I represent. The whole of the trouble has arisen because of the lack of green vegetables and other resistance foods which act as a preventive against disease and tracoma. The Carnegie Institute has expressed amazement at the work that is being done voluntarily by Dr. Watson Brown at Dongreach. I urge the honourable member for Kennedy to discuss this matter with that gentleman when he is next in Longreach, as I did when travelling to Darwin by aeroplane. He would learn something of the conditions that exist in his vast electorate. member look after the Northern Territory and I shall look after Kennedy. service to the honourable member Dr. Watson Brown has made personal observations of the children out there, and has found that the blood resistance to disease of childrenof the third generation has been so depleted because of the deterioration of the red corpuscles as to be a adjourned. national menace. A complete survey has been made up to Burketown and Camooweal, and has also extended into the Northern Territory. If honourable members were fully alive to the position, they would not refuse to help these people by the provision of green vegetables and fruits and the reduction of transport charges to enable them to leave that country on holiday at least every two years. A matter that has not so far been mentioned in this House is the difficulty TRADE DIVERSION POLICY MOTOR BODYof mothers of the third generation to rear children without the bottle in the tropical regions on the North Queensland coast, such as Townsville. Honourable members may have forgotten that at the 20th Congress of the British Medical Association, held in Brisbane in 1920, some remarkproposedable lectures were given in regard to the virility of the third and fourth generations in our tropical regions. If these reports were widely published they would cause consternation in the community. I do not agree with all that was said at clusion that Australia has never enunciated the conditions to enable women to live there in reasonable comfort. I deprecate the tendency to treat as something that we ought to forget the deleterious effects of the conditions on women in our tropical regions. I urge honourable members always to bear in mind those -famous words which the late Sir Henry Parkes uttered at the inauguration of federation, that ""this is a continent for a nation, and a nation for a continent"". I am afraid that we have not yet given that intense consideration, as Britain has done in Malaya, to our tropical regions that they deserve, and so have not made possible the fulfilment of Sir Henry Parkes' ideal. I , therefore, ask that our northern areas be not forgotten the honourable in the defence and economic programme of this Government, and that the people living in these areas be granted conditions I am trying to be of which would enable them to live in conditions more nearly comparable, in respect of social services and otherwise, to the conditions of the. people of the southern States.

143,Motion (By Sir Archdale Parkhill ),"[4.2j I desire to make another appeal to the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) to grant the requests that have been made to him frequently on behalf of several branches of the automotive industry to relax the Government's trade diversion policy in certain directions. I . wish to make it clear that I favour the plan the Government has adopted, as I think do most people. Everybody was glad when the Government indicated that it intended to make possible the manufacture of complete motor cars in Australia. The difficulties that have arisen are due principally to the sudden disorganization of industry through the complete prohibition of the importation of necessary motor car parts from abroad. I have been approached on several occasions by both employers' and employees' organizations on this subject. Only last week the representative of the Coashmakers Society urged me to bring the matter under the notice of the Government. In recent years many members of that organization have been engaged on the manufacture of motor bodies. Some time ago a number of these men were dismissed. The Minister hopes, and, I think, believes, that most of those men have since been absorbed in the industry, but I assure him that that is not so, for many are still waiting for re-employment. That they are still unemployed is unsatisfactory alike to the men themselves and to the employers who, with a slight relaxation of the existSurely the relaxation of the restrictions ing policy, would be willing to re-engage them. I ask that the quotas fixed some time ago to govern the importation of motor chassis from the United States of America be reviewed. respect of which tliere is complete prohibition? to do harm to any industry; I wish to do some good. If the Government would relax the existing stringent regulations somewhat, it would be to the advantage of everybody concerned. I do not wish to suggest that the Ottawa Agreement has been responsible for all the difficula greater number of Canadian and ties ; but I ask that upon adequate reasons being advanced to support the request for some relaxation of the existing regulations, that course be adopted. When this request has been made to the Minister, previously he has said that the scheme must be worked out in its entirety, and that the difficulties will ultimately be overcome because British interests are anxious that our business should be transferred to them. At one stage difficulties were caused in consequence of the inability to obtain a certain class of steel which was previously secured from the United States of America. Such material is now, I believe, being imported from Great Britain. But everybody is well aware that the British manufacturers, who desired trade to be diverted to them, especially in the engineering industries, are now fully occupied, In fact, it is practically impossible at present to obtain any skilled British artisans in tbe engineering and metal trades to accept work in Australia, for they are fully employed in their own country. Moreover, we have been given to understand that the British manufacturers do not, at present, desire additional orders. In these circumstances, why should we continue to impose hardship on our local firms by forcing thom to place orders with British manufacturers which are not desired? No harm would be done, in fact a great deal of good would follow, if the Government allowed a larger number of motor chassis to enter Australia from the United States of America and Canada than is possible under the existing quotas. to that extent could not affect the ultimate success of the long-range plan that the Government has embarked upon but it would mean that more people would be employed by firms like General Motors and the Chrysler companies. I do not think that members of the Government, or any member of this House, or any expert engaged in the engineering industry, believes that it will be possible for Australia in less than two decades to establish the motor car manufacturing industry in this country on anything like a big unit basis. I therefore urge the Government to give favorable consideration to the request for the admission of American chassis. We are all delighted. I am sure, that at present 80 per cent, of the finished American and Canadian",48,Officers Incom Etax Penalties

He has himself invented many little gadgets which have added to the amount of work done in Australia upon car3 sold in this country, and have themselves given him leave to do his best to accomplish the thing that he desires to do.

When tbe trade diversion policy was introduced I supported it because I believed that Australia's adverse trade balance with the United States of America was so serious that steps should be taken to deal with it. But the success which has attended the operation of that policy has exceeded expectations, and now the balance of trade is in favour of Australia. state of affairs due to the trade diversion old-age pensioners, with their very meagre policy? it is the result of large purchases by the United States of America of Australian wool and gold. Nevertheless, it is true that the trade diversion policy has been more successful than was expected by its sponsors. The situation now is such that the Government would be justified in reviewing the position, especially in relain Queensland. On several occasions I tion to those manufactures which could be imported from the United States of America without seriously interfering with the duty we owe to Britain and British manufacturers. items which I have in mind are motor cvcles, the importation of which from the United States of America is prohibited, although in respect of motor cars a quota re-consider the position with a view to making such amendments as will remove those disabilities which are necessarily associated with the sudden cutting off of trade. take this opportunity to correct a wrong imnrcssion created by a speech which the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies), delivered at Roma, Queensland, reports the American manufacturers of which were published and distributed throughout the Maranoa electorate, presumably by the Assistant Minister( Mr Hunter). As reported in the Roma Western Star of tbe 28th July, the right honourable gentleman saidHe did not know why any member of the point to that record. He said that to Mr Forde, whose reply was"" Y o u have reduced taxation £15,000,000; you have only taken it off your friends and off the man who votes for you. You have given the reduction to them-lau d taxationand benefited the fat grazier."" I deny that I used the expression "" fat grazier "", or suggested that any substantial benefit was given to the graziers of Australia, particularly the small graziers, many of whom are to be found in the Maranoa and Capricornia electorates. Speaking on the Supply Bill on the 23rd June, last, I saidThe Government has remitted taxes which, on its own statement, amount to £18,000,000. These remissions have lightened the burden the improved on the backs of the wealthy sections of the community in Australia, while invalid and allowance of 19s. a week, have had to watch the expenditure of every penny of their income.

I have pointed out on several occasions that the people who would benefit most from the tax remissions granted by the present Government are the banking institutions, insurance, shipping, comMaranoa and Gwydir know that the mercial and land mortgage companies, and the large city proprietary stores, which own city property the value of which has increased remarkably. The total improved and unimproved land values are approximately the same, but as city land-owners pay two-thirds of the land tax, it is clear that they are wealthy persons holding land of great value. At the. instigation of those persons, the Lyons-Page Government reduced the federal land tax by one half, but, that reduction did not relieve the struggling farmer or the grazier with property valued at £8,000 and having on it improvements valued at £3,000, because, as I have said, such land was already exempt from the tax under the policy of the Labour party. I make this explanation because the Attorney-General in his irresponsible way, endeavoured to create the impression among graziers in the Maranoa district that I referred to them .as "" fat graziers."" I know too well that many graziers in Queensland are in poor circumstances, and can ill afford to lose approximately £2 10s. a bale, or £7,500,000 in the aggregate, which the bungling trade diversion policy of the Government brought about, when it caused an estrangement between Australia and Japan-ou r second best customer for wool:-a t a time when it was particularly desirable that the most friendly relations between the two countries should be fostered. It is a pity that servants receive three weeks' annual leave, the Attorney^General and the Assistant Minister did not, when that policy was under discussion, show the same solicitude for the welfare of the graziers that the Attorney-General tried to display at bis meeting in Roma.

That is evident; indeed, the gravamen of my charge against the Those figures show Country party is that it has lost its separate identity, and no longer appeals to the small graziers and farmers in Gwydir and other large country electorates like Maranoa and Capricornia. It may be a separate entity in Victoria, but it is not so in the federal sphere. The graziers of Country party has become but a weak joint in the tail of a Nationalist partu. I wish to bring before the House a grievance that has been freely expressed by those in charge of allowance and non-official post offices, concerning the remuneration they receive for the work that they perform. The amounts involved are small, but dissatisfaction has been caused by the fact that the officers do not know the basis upon which their remuneration is gauged. They receive varying amounts, and when they apply for information as to how the calculations are made, all they are told is that the amounts are calculated in accordance with the amount of business done. In some cases, increased amounts of business are done and smaller amounts of remuneration are paid. I do not expect the Minister to be able to answer me immediately, but I hope that he will take up the matter with the Postmaster-General. This is a star-chamber method of doing business, and it is hardly right that a big body of men who give good service to the Commonwealth should be refused information as to how their salaries are computed. I direct the attention of the Prime Minister to an anomaly in the Commonwealth Public Service regarding recreation leave for temporary public servants. Public but a temporary employee whose name I shall supply to the Prime Minister later, was employed for two years and eight months in a temporary position. For each of the two complete years of his service, he received three weeks' leave, but for the",50,Officers Incom Etax Penalties

153,Mr A. Green (Kalgoorlie) [4.22],"is fair to assume that many of them work from four to eight months and are not granted leave in respect of the periods in which they are employed. Private employers grant leave in proportion to the length of time worked, and even in ""Western Australia, where the Government is hard put to it financially, temporary public servants receive one days' leave for each month of service. It is not asking too much to expect the Commonwealth Government to remove the anomaly in its own method of dealing with temporary employees. I do not blame the present Government, but, now that the matter has been raised, whatever government is in power should rectify the position by amending the Public Service Regulations. To do so would be to give no more than ordinary justice to the temporary employees affected. bring under the notice of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) two income tax cases in which it is claimed that the Federal Commissioner for Taxation( Mr Ewing) has adopted a most unreasonable attitude with regard to penalties which he has inflicted in federal income tax assessments. The facts have been supplied by Mr F. P. Kennedy, who is a former employee of the Queensland Income Tax Department and is now a chartered accountant and taxation expert in Brisbane, and is in every way a reputable citizen. He has no objection to his name being mentioned in these two cases. I understand that there are similar other cases, but that these are among the worse. The department's inspector investigated the first case, and Mr Kennedy acted on behalf of the taxpayer gation, but at no time before that date. The taxpayer's assets greatly exceeded the income he had returned, but for the most part the accretion had remained unidentified with any particular source of income. He had been an hotel keeper, and therefore his income from that source was in cash, and not readily identifiable. The taxpayer advanced certain explanations to the effect that the unidentified income was from a non-taxable source. Mr Kennedy considered that there were good reasons to believe him, and from a particular knowledge of the hotels in which he was trading, would not believe for one moment that those businesses produced the income now assessed. The Stateofficial who handled the matter obviously realized that there was some doubt, and the Commissioner of Taxation in Queensland, Mr Magee, dealt very leniently with the taxpayer in regard to penalty. Indeed,.had he taken a serious view the taxpayer would have been prosecuted in the police court. The penalty imposed by Mr Magee for State income tax amounted to a flat rate of 10 per cent, of the additional tax payable. Federal assessments under three years were also dealt with by Mr Magee in his capacity as Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation, and the penalty for those years was also 10 per cent. flat. The federal assessments over three years were dealt with at Canberra, and a penalty of 100 per cent, was added. The harshness of the federal decision will be more appreciated by a statement of the actual penalties. The federal penalty is £2,155 for all years. On the basis of the federal assessments issued from Canberra, the federal penalty for all years would have been £2,300. ""Whilst the ordinary additional tax payable in the State assessments was greater than for the federal assessments, the State penalty for all years was only £220. Mr Kennedy states that Mr Ewing's attitude, when a reduction of penalty was requested, was definitely hostile and insulting, and could only arise out of ignorance of the matters with which he was dealing. I understand that Mr Ewing called Mr Kennedy"" a bush lawyer "" and the like. According to Mr Kennedy practically every accountant dealing largely with taxation matters in Brisbane has experienced simiduring the investilar treatment, and some have definitely stated that they will not appear before Mr Ewing again in a representative capacity. In a memorandum on this matter, Mr Kennedy writesNo doubt tlie Commonwealth Treasurer would be pleased to tell you that there is a High Court or a board of review to deal with appeals from the Commissioner's decision. For the purpose of this case, such advice is futile. The investigation went back to the year 1913, and there is no need for me to tell you that the average hotel keeper or small business man cannot prove his income tax returns so far back. The Board of Review has hedged itself in with all sorts of rules of evidence, which",51,Officers Incom Etax Penalties

Mr Magee did not prosecute him, but regarded the matter seriously, and in his assessments imposed a penalty of 50 per cent. The taxpayer's agent at the time assured him that the assessments were correct and advised him to pay up and look pleasant. The taxpayer was not so satisfied that the assessments were correct, and when he subsequently received federal assessments from Canberra with a penalty imposed therein of 100 per cent., he. decided to get further advice and consulted Mr Kennedy. In the meantime, however, his cheque book, pass books and other records had gone astray between the inspector and his previous agent. The inspector claimed that the records had been returned to the agent, but he had no acknowledgment or receipt to show that that was so. The agent denied that they were ever returned to him, and Mr Kennedy knows no reason why he should seek to destroy the records. The taxpayer was practically helpless, but from the history of the case which be detailed to him, Mr Kennedy was able to pick out one error, and on that point alone subsequently secured a refund of about £400. This, of course, only confirmed tbe taxpayer's suspicions that there were other mistakes, but the inspector concerned refused to divulge to him any other details of the amended income. The taxpayer was prepared to go before the Income Tax Board of Review, but his death intervened in April last. As his representative, Mr Kennedy subsequently appeared before the board; but without the taxpayer's evidence and h is records, which had been lost, the board soon made it clear that it could not adequately deal with it. Again, he pointed out that the board had hedged Mr Baler. The position is such wrong. The Commissioner in Canberra, in such circumstances, is still prepared to adhere to the penalty, which is His assets showed subundoubtedly harsh in view of the more moderate view taken by the Deputy Commissioner in Brisbane. Furthermore, the slackness of the Taxation Department at Canberra in dealing with these matters was such that it took nearly two years for the taxpayer's objections to be brought before the Board of Review, and, meanwhile, the taxpayer had died. Tho excessive federal penalty is, of course, a burning point at issue. Why should a penalty of 100 per cent, be imposed in respect of federal assessments issued from Canberra, when the Deputy Commissioner in Brisbane imposes a penalty of only 50 per cent, for State purposes? The Deputy Commissioner in Brisbane had the benefit of a personal interview with the taxpayer and should be better acquainted with the circumstances of the case and the reliability of the taxpayer than the Coirfinissioner in Canberra. I suggest that the cases which I have mentioned should be inquired into by the Treasurer. [4.33] I shall ask the Commissioner of Taxation in Canberra to report to me in regard to the matters mentioned, and I shall advise the honourable member of the result later. Trade and Customs) [4.34] -The honourable members for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) and Perth( Mr Nairn) referred to the disabilities suffered by traders in the motor industry as the result of the Government's trade diversion policy. I frankly admit that in any change of policy of such a sweeping nature, disabilities must arise and some firms may appear to be more harshly affected than others. That is inevitable; but it must be borne in mind that the Government's policy is general . in its application and cannot be judged by its",52,Officers Incom Etax Penalties

The trade States of America and Canada by 5,138 diversion policy was adopted in order to divert trade from the United States of America to Great Britain and other countries that had a favorable trade balance with us, and to assist Australian industries. I was glad to hear both honourable members declare the success of the scheme in that regard. It cannot be denied that the trade diversion policy has the United States of America and operated successfully; it has resulted in the establishment of large new industries in Australia and has accelerated manufacturing operations considerably. ""With regard to motor cars, I may inform honourable members that almost a balance has been struck in the diversion of motor chassis from Canada and the United States of America to the United Kingdom. The application of the quota system has not in any way restricted employmtent in Australia; it has merely effected a transference of employment from one factory to another. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports mentioned this morning that one factory had to put off a number of men because it3 quota had been exhausted. I point out, however, that it was only a temporary stoppage of work. The largest firm in Melbourne, the Buskin Company, has secured a large British order which has assured continuous work for some time to come. The Sydney firm of McGrath Limited, which handles the Hillman and Humber cars, is fully occupied and has established a brandi in Brisbane. Thus there is a wider spread of employment. The motor car industry in Australia has expanded to a greater extent than ever before. turbance of industry and employment? the honourable member to have any regard for the welfare of Australia. The honourable member generally has harsh words to say about every local firm. I have already admitted that, some disability has place their orders elsewhere, and the been occasioned to certain firms as the result of the Government's trade diversion policy, but those firms are prospering; they have not been crushed out of existence. ment's trade diversion policy has resulted in a diminution of the imports of motor cars from the United chassis and has increased the imports of chassis from the United Kingdom by 5,194. Surely the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) will applaud that. That increase of the number of chassis imported from the United Kingdom has taken place as a result of the diversion of a portion of the motor car trade from Canada because of the restrictive tariffs imposed by those countries against Australia. Actually motor car registrations increased from 70,247 in 1935-36 to 72,778 in 1936-37. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports also said that certain firms have suffered great disability because of the quota system. The quota fixed for this year was based on the figures for 1936, a year of high importations, and it has been adequate for most of the firms concerned. The only large organization to express dissatisfactions, is the firm which handles the Chrysler-Dodge products. That firm desires to sell more than its quota. Others were not able to sell up to the extent of their quota. Motors-Holdens Limited? cars up to the full limit of its quota, but was not able to dispose of all of them. Another big company did not import up to the full limit allowed. Unemployment has not been created as a result of the trade diversion policy; on the contrary, the experience has been the very reverse of that. The honourable member also spoke of the difficulties experienced in securing motor parts, and to the shortage of steel. The difficulty occasioned by the' shortage of steel, which has now been overcome, was largely the fault of the companies themselves. When there was difficulty in obtaining British steel, they were warned by the department to importation of American steel was permitted under licence. Some firms delayed the placing of orders, with the result that there was a temThe Governporary shortage of steel and that brought about a certain amount of unemployment, but those men are back in employment.",53,Officers Incom Etax Penalties

Does he object to a bounty on wheat? selling anything not required by the primary producer, he complains that prices are too high, and yet he clamours for high prices for primary producers' wares. to make a statement in regard to the quota allocations. The subject of quota allocations for motor vehicle chassis has been under the consideration of the Government. It has been decided to grant a quota of 100 per cent, for the quota year ending the 30th April, 1939, and also for the quota year ending the 30th April, 1940. The grant of a 100 per cent, quota for the next two to allow certain developmental plans to be proceeded with and to give certainty to importers in regard to the future. I am surprised if the Many of them are anxious to know whether they can get the full quantity next year and the following year; this statement will give them that assurance. Requests have been made to the department to permit the importation of a small portion of next year's chassis I have no doubt that quota before the actual commencement of the quota year, provided the chassis remained in bond until the 1st May, 1938. It was represented that this would be of advantage to those distributors who had sold out their quota before the end of the quota year. That would help that group of whom I spoke, whose quota had been insufficient. Such an arrangement, it was represented, would eliminate risks of delayed deliveries due to overseas, industrial and opshipping trouble, and would give a feeling of greater security to the Australian business interests involved. It has therefore been decided to grant permits for the importation of motor vehicle chassis to be imported in April, 1938, up to a quantity not exceeding 5 per cent, of the total quota for the quota year ending the 30th April, 1939, provided that the chassis so imported remain in customs bond until the 1st May, 1938. The idea of the 5 per cent, is that a firm will not import the bulk of its quota, sell out with accelerated sales for a short period, and perhaps afterwards dismiss its sales staff during the remainder of the year. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) referred to the importation of Wheni t comes to motor cycles.
