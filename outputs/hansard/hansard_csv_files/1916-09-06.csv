The Leader of the Opposition has also been prevented by important business m Sydney from coming here to-day, and I have not had an opportunity to_ speak to honourable members of the Opposition concerning the proposal that the Minister of Trade and Customs has just put beforo the House; but I feel sure that we on this side are all of one . mind in thinking that, during the present crisis, we should do everything we can to facilitate the course which the Government wish to take. I , therefore, support the motion. I hope that these adjournments will not be persisted in, because I hold that in a time of war Parliament ought to be sitting. An honourable member, by addressing a question to a Minister from bis place in Parliament, can get as much done in a moment as takes months to effect by representations to the officials of the Defence Department. Were the Minister for the Navy present, I would address to him now a question whicli I wish to ask concerning the treatment given by the Department to a woman with three children depending on her, whose husband deserted her, and enlisted in Sydney under a false name to swindle her, his niece being a partner to the arrangement. allowed to retain money which should go to the wife. I am' sure that the. Minister would not allow his underlings to permit a poor woman and her children to be defrauded. When Parliament is sitting, the Prime Minister should be here, and he could be hero if he so desired. No one in the community, and not even the whole force of public opinion, could prevent that strong-minded man from coming here if he desired to do so. present this week, and there, is a reason for his absence. sons which he regards as justifying his absence from Parliament, and on this occasion I take no exception to what is bein^ done; but, .so long as I represent Melbourne, I shall resent proposals like that which has been put beforo ua by the Minister of Trade and Customs. Having made my protest, I say no more. Question resolved in the affirmative. the Minister for the Navy, will the Minister of Trade and Customs state whether the Government will consider the advisability of constructing in Victoria, so as to give Victorian workmen an opportunity of getting employment, at least one of the three steamers for the lighthouse service that are to be constructed by the Department of the Navy. lighthouse steamers has been under consideration for over two years. When the honourable member for Darling Downs was Minister of Trade and Customs, tenders were called for the construction of these vessels, and no Australian tender was submitted. The tenders were re-opened about October, 1914, so as to obtain an Australian tender if possible, and a New South Wales firm was the only Australian tenderer. There has been some difficulty in fixing up the plans and obtaining the material, but, as the Navy Department is the only Oommonwealth Department that has expert ship surveyors and other constructional officers who could superintend the work of construction, the work was handed over to it. I have discussed the matter with the Victorian Minister of Publio Works, who was The niece is being asked the same question as has been put by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. The honourable member has also interviewed me with a view to giving an opportunity to Victorian workmen to participate in the construction of the vessels, but, as the matter is no longer under the Customs Department, I suggest that the honourable member should see the Minister for the Navy. of Trade and Customs say whether it is a fact, as reported in the press yesterday, that a New Zealand boat trading between South Africa and Victoria is obliged to leave Australia this week in ballast owing to the Commonwealth Government's restriction of exports? letter written by Mr Cowper to that effect, and that gentleman saw me on the subject yesterday.

The instructions in regard to the wearing of uniform by discharged returned soldiers are the same in all States, namely"" That uniform shall not be worn except on special occasions, when the approval of the District Commandant must be first obtained."" 2. Instructions were issued that soldiers of the Australian Imperial Force were not to be used to collect money for patriotic or other wear uniform on special occasions, for which the authority of the District Commandant must be obtained. The ANZAC Band, consisting of returned soldiers, was playing in the street in Australian Imperial Force uniform, and civilians wearing the Returned Soldiers' Association badge were collecting for the band. The whole of the band was marched off the street into barracks, but was released on the Returned Soldiers' Association undertaking that they should cease playing in uniform.

The Pederal Government has entered into a contract with the State, and no one can sell a pound of sugar except through the agency of the Commonwealth authority. On the 5th July last the Central SugarM ill desired permission to sell, outside the Government contractors, a certain quantity of raw sugar that was suitable only for beer-making, or some other manufacturing purpose, but was unsuitable for refining into white sugar. referred by the State Treasurer to the Federal Government, and the answer was received that the Federal Treasurer would not allow the sugar to be sold except through the Millaquin Refinery. CentralM ill was obliged to sell this sugar to the refinery for less than £12 per ton, although 'it was offered from £ 2 0 to £ 2 2 per ton for it by outside people. Millaquin Refinery sold the sugar, without higher rats to some at least of the people who had made the offer to the CentralM ill . What has become of the difference.? When I asked where the balance went I was unable to obtain any information from Ministers. Isi t not extraordinary that the Federal Government should take possession of property in this way and allow the refinery to pocket between £8 and £10 per ton on the transaction, or pass it on to Is that a fair way in which to treat this industry ? It is this kind of treatment that is harassing the only industry that can justify Australia holding the northern portions of Queensland. How can we justify our action in preventing other nations dumping their population into the northern parts of this Commonwealth if w© are not going to use the country ourselves, and if we cause th© shutting down of th© only industry that can be carried on there at a profit? It is only just to those who complain that I should lay before honourable members telegrams that I have received from the Mayor of Bundaberg, th© Childers Chamber of Commerce, and the Fresident of the Cane-growers Association at the same place. The telegram from th© Mayor of Bundaberg is as follows: I have the honour to acquaint you as follows:-A t a meeting of sugar-cane-growers, representing the whole of the Bundaberg district, held this day, it was resolved that, recognisAre we not equally ening the impossibility of continuing to produce sugar-cane under the rates of wages and conditions prescribed by the Dickson award, the growers decline to harvest any cane until the award is withdrawn, and that, in accordance with this resolution, the various mills be notified that no cane will be supplied. Copy of this wire sent Commonwealth and State Prime Ministers, and State Treasurer -E . T. STEPTOE, Mayor of Bundaberg, chairman of meeting. That telegram is signed by Mr Steptoe, th© Mayor, who was chairman of th© meeting. I shall not weary the House by reading the other telegrams which are Its request was to a similar effect. I hope honourable members will realize th© vital importance of this question to th© whole of Australia. I am not here to criticise the increase that has been made in the wages of the The labourers; but it is generally considered that these wages are outside anything that the growers can pay, unless they are given an additional £ 7 per ton. And The even with an additional £ 7 , there ar© other conditions in the award that make doing anything to it , at the it almost impossible to work under it . Th© honourable member for Darling Downs, when this question was before us last week, mentioned the fact that the cane-cutters are now receiving £ 5 2s. a week; and this means that any boy of eighteen years of age may claim that rate if it is considered that he can do a day's work. It is considered that a boy of that age can do so. w© were advocating a Whit© Australia! that question now; w© have a White Australia, and no one is seeking to alter it . What is claimed is that the sugar-growers of Queensland, who are necessary to the defence of Australia, should have something like a fair deal; and it is the duty of honourable members from other States to assist in attaining that object. This cannot be done, however, unless we in sist on the necessary legislation as early as possible. There is another disability upon this industry, th© product of which must be promptly treated. If men come from Tasmania and Victoria under agreement to cut cane, they can leave the work at any tim© without incurring a penalty. This means that if a fortnight before the canecutting is completed these men can get more permanent or lucrative work elsewhere, there is nothing to prevent tbem",9,Newspapers Conscription
57,Them? Mr Bubns,That was not said when,10,Newspapers Conscription
58,Mr Corser,"W © are not discussingleaving the balance of the cane ungathered, and this, of course, spells disaster to the owner. We all know that the cost of living has increased, and this fact was recognised in the higher wages awarded to the workers; but no consideration on this score is given to the grower. According to the award, any nine men or over can claim a certain scale of food, and a very liberal one at that, for which only 19s. per week is deducted from the £ 5 2s. in the case of the cutter. It has been clearly shown that this scale cannot be provided for a small number of men like nine, or even for any number under a hundred, the cost proving nearer 30s. tlian 19s. thought that in the case of one hundred men or over, with a professional cook, aud so forth, the scale could be provided for about 5s. a week more than is allowed. It will be seen, however, that, with thousands of men, a loss of 5s. per week each makes a big demand on the industry. I mention these facts to show honourable members that there are very strong grounds for the strike-for it is a strike. The growers simply refuse to cut their cane and send it to be manufactured, when they know that the only result can be disaster to themselves. These growers are not free agents, and cannot help themselves. Their sugar has been seized, and they are not to receive more than a certain amount in return. All is regulated between the Federal Government and the Queensland Government, and the latter, when appealed to, declare that they cannot act without the Federal Government, though nobody connected w i th the Federal Government seems to be able to give any information, or the slightest idea of what they intend to do. I sincerely hope that honourable members will take an active interest In this most urgent matter. sire to bring uuder the notice of the leader of the House, and the Prime Minister's Department, a breach of agreement as between the Public Service Commissioner and some of his officers. Five or Public Service Commissioner, in view of a shortage of telegraphists in Queensland, called for volunteers in the Department in New South Wales and Victoria to go to that State. He told those volunteers that fares would be paid both ways, with extra payment for undertaking the work, and that, after serving three years, they would be returned to the States whence they came. Many men in Victoria and New South Wales accepted the Public Service Commissioner's terms, and have f a it h f u l l y carried out the signed agreement. Now, however, the Acting Public Service Commissioner is flouting the agreement, and refuses to return those men, although some of them have served over four years. If the Government are not going to carry out their part of the agreement, how in Heaven's name can they expect tlie men to respect their obligations under it? The agreement is all on one side.. The Postmaster-General has done all that is humanly possible to in It is duce the Public Service Commissioner to fulfil his portion of it . Only to-day he forwarded to me a letter which he has received in regard to one officer who has filled the position of telegraphist at Goondiwindi, in my electorate, for the past four years. You, sir, know how trying it is for a man to be cooped up in a small country' office in West Queensland for a period like that. The Postmaster General has done all that he possibly could to insure that the agreement made with these men shall be honoured. But the Public Service Commissioner has not only flouted him, but has flouted the Government. We have frequently been told that the dishonouring of a "" scrap of paper'' was the primary cause of the present conflagration in Europe. Do the Government intend to adopt a similar code of morals here? If the officers concerned had not carried out their portion of the agreement, I venture to say that the Public Service Commissioner would have dealt with them very promptly, and in a very drastic manner. The letter which I have received from the Postmaster-General readsWith reference to the representations made hy you on behalf of Mr P. M. Jones (writing from 72 Harold-street, Albert Park), who ia desirous of being retransferred from Queensland to Victoria, I beg to inform you that I have since been in communication with the Acting Public Service Commissioner, emphasising the position as represented by you, and expressing the view that the circumstances warrant favorable consideration. The Postmaster-General is anxious to see the agreement respected, but the Acting Public Service Commissioner will not permit him to honour it A reply has, however, now been received to the effect that, owing to shortage of telegraphists in Queensland, and in view of the",10,Newspapers Conscription

60,"Six Years Ago, Mr Mclachlan, The Then","fact that no examination for telegraphists can be held until after the termination of the war, tice is not inflicted on the growers as the Mr Jones' request cannot be acceded to. If the agreement was a good one for the Commissioner to make on behalf of the Government, it ought to be -equally good so far as the rights of the men are concerned. I shall move the adjournment of the House every day that it meets if I do not get satisfaction for these officers. It would be monstrous if the action of the Public Service Commissioner should be allowed to go unchallenged. I direct the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to the matter, in the hope that he will bring it under the notice of the Prime Minister, with a view to seeing that the agreement is carried out in its entirety. I am sorry that the Minister of Trade and Customs is not in a position to give us a more satisfactory assurance regarding the 6ugar industry in Queensland. That industry is to-day in a serious condition. I presume, that the Minister is still in control of niatters affecting the industry, although I notice that the Treasurer, for some unknown reason, is charged with the administration of a portion of it . To my mind, the Minister of Trade and Customs is the proper authority to deal with the sugar industry from the point of view of trade, manufacture, and of the encouragement which should be given to it . In fact, it comes almost entirely under his control. It is well known that an award has been given. Before that award had-been made the conditions of the industry had been fixed so far as the growers were concerned. In the latest award, the Judge himself admits that the whole industry rests upon the growers, and the Minister knows that there have recently been imposed upon the industry conditions which render it impossible for the small growers to profitably carry on their operations. Judge seemed to hint that he expected some relief would be given by the Government. He saidSeeing that the industry is of such very great importance, and seeing what an enormous interest the Government has in it, I am not for a moment going to suppose otherwise than that the Government will see that the industry is properly safeguarded, and kept in existence as ft national concern, and that this is being done is borne out by the recent legislation in that direction. In that passage he indicates that he looks amount prescribed by the Judge. to the administrative authorities of the Commonwealth or State to see that injusresult of his award. Now, there are only two ways in which relief can be giveneither by allowing the previous award, known as the McNaughton award, to stand until the Commonwealth alters the conditions, or for the Commonwealth to accept the Dickson award, and to increase the prices to such an extent as to permit the growers to live. The growers cannot produce cane under existing conditions without being confronted with the Insolvency Court. It must be remembered, too, that the sugar industry is not a rich man's industry. This Parliament specially enacted legislation with a view to making it a small man's industry, and, as a result of. that legislation, large sugar estates were cut up, and men with little or no capital embarked upon it . Thus a large settlement of white population was effected throughout the northern and tropical parts of Queensland. All this was done in the belief that the interests of the growers would be adequately safeguarded. A f t e r having fostered the industry for fifteen years, we find that the total capital in vested in it to-day is £12,000,000a very large sum indeed. But we have also to consider the large number of small growers who are engaged in it .

All I am asking the Minister is, assuming this award to be continued, and assuming that the award is a just award, that he w ill, on behalf of the farmers who are concerned, seriously consider what proposals the Government can take to continue the existence of the industry. I will ask the Minister of Trade and Customs also to consider that request, in view of the abnormal conditions prevailing. The trouble we have to meet in dealing with many of our industries at the present time is that the conditions are altogether abnormal, and I would point out to the Minister that we shall have ultimately to look at this industry, as at all other primary industries, from the point of view of competition of the markets of the world in normal times. In any case, however, I would urge upon the Minister to bear in mind that with this award in operation the sugar-growers of Queenslaud are really in a very serious position. Another request I desire to put before the M in is t e r I would not be insistent did I not know how seriously prejudiced the men in the industry are-is that he would get some expression of opinion from his W ill the honourable memDepartment as to the validity of the stock regulations now being ojicrated between Queensland and New South Wales.

These regulations have been in force for some eight or nine months, and some very serious losses have been involved. I know one case of a sheep breeder who carried his sheep through the drought at very great expense. He brought them on to the Darling Downs, but found he could not transfer them to New South Wales on account of tliese stock regulations, and his loss on the sale of those sheep, coniparing the New South Wales price with the Queensland price, was £2,000. I know also of other similar cases. The whole idea of Inter-Statc trading, as agreed upon some years ago, was that Australians might trade freely with each other wherever they might be.

South ""Wales Government started the business, when they would not allow pigs to go into Queensland, but their attitude is different now. Every day the regulations create much irritation, and I hope ihe Minister w ill pursue my request to a satisfactory conclusion. It seems to me that, boiled down, the argument of the two honourable members who have just spoken is that these increased wages in the sugar industry cannot be paid that is so. award, there are increases of wages amounting from £ 1 3s. to £ 1 12s. If a man was earning £2 10s. before, his wages might be increased to £3 13s. or to £4 2s. £3 12s. to £5 2s. from £4 4s. to £5 10s. of 26s. I carry my memory back to the time when I went to Bundaberg to inquire into the Kanaka question, and I am the only member of this House who went to see these Kanakas on their home lands in the New Hebrides Islands. Erom that time. I have taken great interest in them. I met a man in Queensland whose forbears came from Saxony, and I asked h i m if he would give up sugar-growing were no Kanaka labour available. He replied that he would not; and that he did not want anything better than to be able to get labour nearly as good as that of a white man, for 5s. per week. The difference between the pay of a Kanaka and of a white man, at the rate of £3 a week, showed a difference of £2 15s. per week; yet the growers were w ill ing to go on w i th their industry when they had to meet the increase. Now, when there was only a difference of £1 6s. between the wages paid before the award and after, there is trouble. The honourable member for Darling Downs repeated in milder language the statement that has appeared in the press, that, if nothing were done for the growers of cane, they would let their cane rot. I have only to say tliat such a thing should not be allowed. To prevent it , I would follow the example of Japan, one of our Allies, I know the New which has absolutely nationalized the growing and refining of sugar in Formosa. As a consumer of sugar, and as one who knows that sugar is one of the best of foods, I hope that the Minister will take action in this matter. Those who read novels written a century or so ago are aware that in olden days children never got lollies, and that sugar was much less easily obtained then than it is now. This is not merely a question of wages. Knowing as I do the record of Acting Judge Dickson, I feel certain that, having given a close and careful study to the question during a period of six weeks, in which he had under review the heat and terrible conditions under which work in the canefields is carried on-condition s which have been described in speeches made in this chamber in the discussion of the Kanaka questionI feel certain that he has come to a right decision, and I commend him for it . sponsibility with the Government. do that, because it is for Legislatures to T h a t is an increase make or alter laws. I understand that the new crop will not provide for the needs of Australia, and that a large quant it y of refined or unrefined sugar w i ll have to be imported. In New Zealand, sugar costs much less than in Australia. Tliat has been the case for many years, and obviously a profit will be made by the Government importation of sugar. If it were clearly proved that the growers had suffered an injustice, I would devote part of that profit to their relief. I tur n now to another matter which I desire the M in ister in charge of the House to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister. In a newspaper paragraph, headed "" Disloyal Dukes,"" the following statements appear: If there is ono place wliere treason would be expected not to be found, it is the House of Lords. The gentlemen who are privileged to be members of the Gilded Chamber ought to be above all suspicion of treachery to the Crown which guarantees them their coronets. Yet we find that two members of the Houso of Lords are now in arms against England, fighting for the Kaiser.

Yet this traitor continues to remain a member of the House of Lords and to hold several peerages. The House of Lords does not rise in revolt against his infamy. Mr Asquith takes no steps to remove his name from the list of British peers, though sion of the Government. Mr Swift McNeill has urged such action and Mr Markham has assured the Prime Minister that the House of Commons would pass a Bill of deprivation of dignity for both these Dukes in a couple of minutes. Nothing is done. Nothing will, be done, unless the noble and ducal traitors join the Sinn Feiners; then they sugar industry must die a natural death. will quickly be dealt with and made to feel that tliere is a limit to British patience. In my opinion, tlie Prime Minister should voice the wishes of this House, and in f o rm Mr Asquith that it is his duty to expel those traitors from the chief governing body of the British world. The British House of Lords controls the House of Commons, and, therefore, the whole of the British Dominions. Althoughi t has a membership of about 600 peers, three for m a quorum. The House that has the power of veto is always the stronger. The men referred to in the paragraph that I have read, or their forefathers, have received thousands of pounds of British money. The facts show what men, even in the highest positions, w ill do to gain still higher rank or larger emoluments. I intend to put on thc notice-paper a question whicli w ill elicit from the Gonoon, the feeling in that State was one of vernment a formal statement of its views on this matter. Apparently, either the honourable member for Melbourne is prepared to support the White Australia policy so long as it w ill not cost him or his constituents anything, or he has slipped in regard to Protection. I always understood him to be a staunch Protectionist; yet he compared the price of sugar in Australia under Protection with that of sugar in New Zealand. Notwithstanding his remarks, I contend that sugar is cheaper in Australia, despite the import duty of £6 a ton, than it is in New Zealand. If we boast of a White Australia, but are not prepared to pay for it , our patriotism is not very deeply rooted. mania owing to the fact that they have In neighbouring countries men work for a few pence a day to produce sugar which, without Protection, would compete with Australian sugar in this market. Could we let such sugar enter Australia duty free, and allow our rich sugar land to go the honourable member for Melbourne if he has such a thing in his mind. The Government have taken control of and established a monopoly in sugar. No one can import a ton of it without the permisPrevious speakers have not suggested that the wages award to which reference has been made should be interfered with, but unless the price of sugar to the public is in creased in consequence of that award, the It is not the intention of the growers to let their cane rot. If these wages are to be paid, and the Government acquire the sugar crop at a fair price from the growers, they cannot sell the sugar to the public at present prices. The award involves a rise in the cost of production of £ 7 per ton of sugar before it can be placed on the Australian market. A r e the public of Australia prepared to pay that additional £ 7 per ton for the sugar they consume? If they are, and the Government will see that an equivalent is returned to the growers, they will then, no doubt, go on cutting cane under the present award. It is impossible that we should saddle the few growers of can© in Australia with the whole of this enormous increase in the cost of production.

I was not there last Sunday, and I would be very sorry to depend on press reports for accounts of what actually was said at the meeting.

They said they would prefer a man who was honestly opposed to them to a man who was neither one thing nor the other. their business. I have no more to say just now, other than that if this statement by Mr Strong is a sample of what we are going to have on this question of conscription, it will cut both ways, and I regret very much that this kind of argument has been employed. This big national issue can only be settled by reasonable argument. It cannot be settled satisfactorily by misstatements and falsehoods such as Mr Strong has resorted newspaper man, I desire to say there is not very much to complain about concerning the comments of the Brisbane Daily Standard on the question of conscription. It must be apparent to any man who has had any experience of newspaper life that some one made a very good guess of the probable future events, ancl promptly transmitted it to the Brisbane Daily Standard, which made certain comments upon it. That happens every week. If , however, the paper had published the statement which the Prime Minister made in this House an hour after the paper was issued, then I would say that there had been a leakage of information which should be stopped in future. Buti f the press is to be toned down to such an extent that no comments are to be allowed do not think the regarding any course of action which the press believes, on good authority, has been determined upon, then the press might just as well be abolished altogether. the contents of certain speeches are in the hands of the press before such speeches arc delivered in this House? in thc case of the opening of a Parliament an outline of the Governor's Speech is handed to the press as a confidential document before-hand,, and the press is relied upon not to make it public until the speech has been delivered in Parliament. I know of no instance in which this confidence has been abused; but, on the contrary, I do know that a great deal of good has resulted from the granting of this privilege. I rose more particularly to urge upon the Acting Leader of the House the importance of having the sugar question settled without delay, because the position is very serious, owing to the enormous increase in the cost of production, as the result of the award by Judge Dickson.

I hope, therefore, that the Government w ill not look upon this matter with indifference. The other honourable members who have spoken on this question have advanced very good reasons why it should be dealt with promptly. If any further time is lost, I am afraid very serious results for the sugar industry w ill follow. 2»£any growers have had two bad seasons, and they are now faced with the prospect of an indifferent thir d season, so if they cannot realize upon their crop and convert it into sugar the outlook w ill be extremely bad for the industry, for the State of Queensland, and indeed for the whole of Australia.

Some of the cane w ill not stand over t ill next Season, as it becomes short of saccharine density, and must be crushed this year. honourable members from Queensland, with the exception of the honourable member for Oxley, the Speaker, and the Treasurer, who is ill , have spoken on the matter raised by the honourable member for Wide Bay. On the question raised by the honourable member for Maranoa, it is important that telegraphists sent from the other States to Queensland should, at. the expiration of their period of three years, have the opportunity of returning to the other States. It is not f a i r that young men, many of whom are married, should be placed under any disability in this respect, and I will bring the matter under the notice of the Prime Minister. I have heard it said that if a man goes out looking for a thing he usually finds it . Now, the honourable member for Moreton looked in the Daily Standard for something whicli he found, and the .honourable member for Brisbane also looked in the papers for something which he found, too. I have not the I desire to slightest doubt that the honourable member for Brisbane is ready to affirm that? the Labour papers are not being treated fairly so far as the anti-conscription meetings are concerned; that they are censored and gagged in such a way as to prevent them from telling th© truth . On the other hand, the honourable member for Moreton The Government realize . alleges that the Labour papers can publish in regard to anti-conscription matter that other papers would be prevented from publishing. honourable members, having set out to look for something, have both found it in opposite directions, is proof positive that the censor is dealing fairly in this matter. When the honourable member for Lilley, an old pressman, was speaking, I . looked round the chamber, and saw halfa-dozen newspaper men sitting on the benches. I am sure that they w ill admit that any smart reporter of average intelligence, with a knowledge gained over a number of years of the views of honourable members, would be able to make a tolerably good guess as to what had taken place in any Caucus meeting of honourable members on the other side, or party meeting of honourable members on this side. However, I shall bring under the notice of the Prime Minister the urgent need for settling the sugar question, and also the other matters I think all the referred to by honourable members.
