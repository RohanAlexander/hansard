The Full-Time Equivalent numbers of General Practitioners in Australia, New South Wales and the Federal electorate of Throsby are: Full-Time Equivalent number of General Practitioners 2003-04 Australia 14,246 New South Wales 4,868 Throsby Electorate 87 (ii) The measure used by the Department is the ratio of population to Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) General Practitioners. The ratios for Australia, New South Wales and the electoral division of Throsby are: Ratio of population to Full-Time Equivalent General Practitioners 2003-04 Australia 1,412 : 1 New South Wales 1,383 : 1 Throsby Electorate 1,500 : 1 (5) (a) (b) (c) (d) and (e) The numbers of Specialists practicing in the electoral division of Throsby were as follows: Number of Specialists in the Federal Electorate of Throsby Type of Provider 2001-02 2002-03 2003-04 Specialists 43 41 48 It should be noted that the simple headcounts given above do not account for differences in the number of services claimed and will include a high proportion of casual and part-time practitioners. Therefore it will not accurately represent the supply of doctors. A more accurate statistic is the Full-Time Equivalent, which is a standardised measure to estimate the number of full-time doctors which adjusts for the partial contribution of casual and part-time doctors. The Full-Time Equivalent numbers of Specialists practising in the electoral division of Throsby were as follows: Full-Time Equivalent number of Specialists in the Federal Electorate of Throsby Type of Provider 2001-02 2002-03 2003-04 Specialists 26 25 25 (6) The electoral division of Throsby is made up of the Shellharbour and part of the Wollongong statistical local areas (SLAs). For the purposes of granting exemptions to allow overseas trained general practitioners to receive payment of Medicare benefits for professional services provided, the SLA of Shellharbour is a District of Workforce Shortage. The SLA of Wollongong is not currently considered to be a District of Workforce Shortage. Statistical Notes These statistics relate to all providers of at least one service on a “fee-for-service” basis and for which Medicare benefits were processed by the Health Insurance Commission in the years in question. Excluded are details of services to public patients in hospital, to Department of Veterans’ Affairs patients and some compensation cases. The simple headcounts given above do not account for differences in the number of services claimed and will include a high proportion of casual and part-time practitioners. Therefore it will not accurately represent the supply of doctors. It is for this reason that Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) practitioner is the statistic used in the population ratios given above. FTE is a standardised measure to estimate the number of full-time doctors which adjusts for the partial contribution of casual and part-time doctors. FTE is calculated by dividing each doctors Medicare billing by the average billing of full-time doctors for the reference period. Where the doctor’s Medicare billing is greater than or equal to the mean billing of full-time doctors, then the FTE is capped at one. In general terms, practitioners with at least 50% of Schedule fee income from non-referred (GP) attendances in the June quarter of the years in question were considered to be General Practitioners. All other practitioners, including optometrists and some dentists who provided services under Medicare, were categorised as “Specialists.” These statistics were compiled from Medicare data on the basis of servicing provider postcode. In compiling statistics for Federal electoral division boundaries, statistics by servicing provider postcode were mapped to electorate according to the proportion of the population of each postcode in each Federal electoral division. State-level statistics were compiled by allocating each postcode to a single state only. National statistics are the aggregate of all providers. The electorate populations used in Population to FTE ratios were supplied as a special order by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The state national populations used were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ June 2004 Australian Demographic Statistics cat no. 3101.0. Constitution Education Fund (Question No. 158) Mr Melham asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 17 November 2004: (1) Can he confirm that the Commonwealth Government has made donations to the Constitution Education Fund– Australia (CEF-A) – ABN: 76 750 439 829 an allowable tax deduction; if so, when and by whom was the decision made and announced. (2) Were representations made to (a) him, (b) the then Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Helen Coonan, (c) his department, and (d) the Australian Taxation Office about making donations to the CEF-A an allowable tax deduction; if so, when and by whom were the representations made. (3) Is he aware that the CEF-A is collocated with and controlled by leading members of Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy with Ms Kerry Jones serving as the CEF-A’s Executive Director. (1) Donations made to the Constitution Eduction Fund after 20 June 2003 are tax deductible. The Government’s decision was announced by Senator the Hon Helen Coonan on 20 June 2003, enabling tax deductibility of donations from this date. The amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 giving effect to this decision were passed by both houses of Parliament and received Royal Assent on 30 June 2004. (2) I received no representations on the matter. Ken Traill, Director of KA Traill Tax Consulting wrote to Senator the Hon Helen Coonan in April 2003 seeking tax deductibility of donations to CEF-A. Professor David Flint (the Trustee of the Fund) also wrote to Senator Coonan in April 2003 seeking deductible gift recipient status. (3) Decisions to give DGR status to organisations are based on merits only. Remuneration (Question No. 780) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 10 March 2005: (1) At1 March 1996, what were the salary and conditions of employment, including any allowances and bonuses paid, to the (a) Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and (b) Secretary to the Treasury.

178,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) (a) Under Section 24A of the Reserve Bank Act 1959, the terms and conditions relating to remuneration and allowances of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) are determined by the RBA Board. Details of the remuneration of the executives of the RBA are published each year in the Bank’s Annual Report, consistent with its reporting obligations under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. (b) From March 1996 until March 2000, remuneration for Secretaries of Departments was determined by the Remuneration Tribunal; thereafter, remuneration for Secretaries has been determined by the Prime Minister under section 61 of the Public Service Act 1999. (2) (a) The Governor’s salary has moved over this time in line with the annual increase in base salaries of RBA staff. The Governor does not receive bonuses or performance pay. (b) The attached table records the movement in remuneration payable to the Secretary to the Treasury over the period specified by the honourable member. The table records that, until July 1998, Secretaries were in receipt of a loss of tenure allowance in addition to salary; from March 1999, remuneration packages were revised to provide for total remuneration, which was made up in part by a base salary amount. The table also records that, from April 2000, Secretaries were eligible for performance bonuses of up to 15% of total remuneration. (3) (a) to (c) Percentage change in the Consumer Price Index, Average Weekly Ordinary Time Earnings, and Average Weekly Earnings are available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS. Cat. No. 6401.0 and 6302.0) and are published on a quarterly basis.

(3) Will he return to NSW all the GST paid annually by the people of NSW; if so, when; if not, why not. (1) Yes. (2) (a) No. The ATO advises that there is no reliable and accurate measure of the actual amount of GST revenue collected from the people of each State. This is primarily because businesses which operate nationally may collect GST in a number of States, but only pay the GST to the ATO from a head office located in a particular State. It also recognises that residents from one State can pay GST in another State. (b) The 2005-06 Budget estimates that NSW will receive $9,937.5 million in GST revenue in 2004-05 and receive a windfall gain from tax reform of more than $257 million. (3) The Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations, which all States agreed to in 1999, provides that all GST revenue will be distributed among the States and Territories in accordance with horizontal fiscal equalisation principles, based on the relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission (CGC). Since the introduction of the GST in 2000-01, the Australian Government has followed the terms of the Agreement in full. At the meeting of the Ministerial Council for Commonwealth-State Financial Relations on 23 March 2005, the NSW Treasurer did not seek any a change or variation to the CGC’s recommended relativities. Orchestras (Question No. 901) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts and Sport, in writing, on 17 March 2005: Following the draft findings and recommendations of the national review of Australia’s symphony orchestras conducted by James Strong, can the Minister guarantee that there will be no Commonwealth funding cuts to any of those orchestras; if so, what are the details; if not, why not. the honourable member’s question: A New Era– the report of the Orchestras Review 2005 marks an important point in the history of Australia’s orchestras. Reinforcing the key messages of the 1999 Major Performing Arts Inquiry, the Review confirms a number of important principles which should ensure that Australia continues to have sustainable and vibrant orchestras: responsible governance, realistic financing, viable employment arrangements and sustainable structures.",165,Questions In Writing

180,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for the Arts and Sport has provided the following answer toConcerns have been raised by the music sector and the community generally about the reductions in ensemble size proposed by the Review. Commentators have stressed the cultural, social and educational value of orchestras to the community and the negative impact reductions in the size of orchestra ensembles could have. I am pleased to confirm that the Australian Government has announced a commitment of $25.4 million in response to the recommendations of the Strong Report, including providing significantly increased funding to allow the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra, The Queensland Orchestra, the West Australian Symphony Orchestra and the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra to maintain their current ensemble sizes. This additional funding is contingent upon the commitment of state governments to provide matching additional funds based on current funding ratios. Sudan (Question No. 1343) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 12 May 2005: (1) Did the Australian Government make formal representations to the member states of the United Nations Security Council regarding the findings of the independent commission of inquiry established under UN Security Council resolution 1564 in respect of the Sudan; if so, (a) which member states, (b) when did this occur, and (c) what was the substance of the representations. (2) Did he personally make formal representations to the member states of the United Nations Security Council regarding the findings of the independent commission of inquiry established under UN Security Council resolution 1564 in respect of the Sudan; if so, (a) which member states, (b) when did this occur, and (c) what was the substance of the representations. (1) Yes. Australia wrote to the President of the United Nations Security Council on 27 January, in conjunction with Canada and New Zealand urging that, should the International Commission of Inquiry for Darfur determine that crimes within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) have been committed, the Security Council should refer the matter to the ICC. Australia again wrote to the President of the Security Council, together with Canada and New Zealand, on 17 February, strongly supporting the International Commission’s recommendation that the Council refer the situation in Darfur to the ICC. This followed the Commission’s finding that serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law amounting to crimes under international law had been committed in Darfur. The letter argued that it was essential that the international community ensure swift and effective international accountability for those bearing the greatest responsibility for such crimes and that the ICC was the obvious and most appropriate instrument through which to do so. Members of the Security Council were urged to demonstrate their commitment to the ICC and to international efforts to ensure those responsible for serious international crimes were held accountable by supporting a Security Council referral of the situation in Darfur to the ICC. These letters were circulated as formal documents of the Security Council to all 15 Council members (Algeria, Argentina, Benin, Brazil, China, Denmark, France, Greece, Japan, Philippines, Romania, Russia, Tanzania, UK and the US) and subsequently to all 191 members of the United Nations. These letters were also accompanied by a range of formal and informal face-to-face representations to Council members and other interested countries in the normal course of the UN mission’s work. Australia was pleased that the thrust of our representations were reflected in UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1593 of 31 March, which referred the situation in Darfur to the ICC, and",167,Questions In Writing
