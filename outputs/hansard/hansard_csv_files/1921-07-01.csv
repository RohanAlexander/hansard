Deputy Speaker, Whether There Is Any Truth In The Rumour That Several Members Of The House Committee Have Resigned On Account Of Certain Action Taken Yesterday By That Committee? M. Chanter)","I have no knowledge of the resignation of any member of the House Committee, but will make inquiries, and advise the honourable member. as to what course I should follow to prevent a threatened injustice to an employee in this building; who, in my humble opinion, is to be most cruelly and unjustly deprived of his means of livelihood. I appeal to you, sir, to inform me as to the procedure I should follow to prevent this injustice being done. honourable member will place before me any definite facts with which I can deal in my capacity as Acting Speaker, I shall do so. my resignation as a member of the Joint House Committee, and, in order to save time, I ask leave to make a statement. . (Leave granted.) I find my position as a member of the House Committee anything but a pleasant one. The Committee is a Committee in name only, because its members have no power. I find that a young man who has been employed in the capacity of l if t attendant in this building for the past ten or fifteen years has been given notice of dismissal. During that period he has been courteous to every honourable member, and most assiduous in the perform[388] ance of his duties. But he has now been discharged, under the pretext that there is no room for him. The real trouble is that, some time ago, when the Wages Board increased the wages of l if t attendants, he made an application for the increase. He was so insistent that the authorities here had to grant his application. iSince then he has been a marked man. This is proved by the fact that when other officers of this Parliament were granted a bonus last Christmas he was not permitted to participate in it. As a result he saw his superior, officer, to I desire to a3k you, Mr whom he stated that he. had been robbed of the bonus. For having made that statement he was fined £2. Upon four or five occasions this young man attempted to enlist for active service abroad. He was obliged to subject himself to inoculation because of certain epidemics in'Australia, with the result that to-day one of his handsis maimed.. We are how casting him adrift, and .1 refuse to remain upon a Committee which allows that sort of thing to be done. Mr RicHARn FOSTER -May I ask whether you, sir, as Deputy Speaker, will ascertain the facts of this case, and inform the House of them next week? J. M. Chanter) The matter to which the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) ha? allude! was referred to last night, upon the motion' for adjournment, by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney). I then promised that I would make full inquiries into it, and inform the House of the result of those inquiries at a later stage. I have not yet had an opportunity of conferring with the President of the* Senate and the members of the House Committee upon the subject, but I shall do so at the earliest possible opportunity. peared in the press yesterday that the Deputy Leader of the Labour party ( Mr Ryan) had received a communication asking that a nomination for appointment to tha Board .of Trade should.be sent to the Government by him.

ADVANCES TO STATES. swer to a question by the honourable member for ""Wentworth ( Mr Marks), I stated, amongst other things,that this year, the Commonwealth had advanced to New South Wales more than £2,000,000 as a general advance, in additionto a special advance of £250,000.

58,Sir Joseph Cook,"The honorableI n Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from 30th June (vide pase 9599). OrderedThat the consideration of the intervening items be postponed until after the consideration of Division XIII . Item 334Paper, viz. :(C) (1) News printing, not glazed, mill glazed,ot coated, in rolls not less than 10 inches in width, or in sheets not less than 20 inches by 25 inches, or its equivalent, ad val., British, 5 per cent; intermediate and general, 10 per cent. . Under this item, duties of 5 per cent., 10 per cent., and 10 per cent, are proposed for news .printing paper. It seems to me that there is room for some explanation of the proposal. Most of this news printing paper comes from foreign countries, and particularly from Scandinavia. I am under the impression that there should be a greater preference than 5 per cent, given to Great Britain in connection with the importation of paper of this kind. From what I have heard, I believe that Great Britain, if given a reasonable preference, can supply the requirements of the Commonwealth for this kind of paper. Under r-ne Minister's proposal, Great Britain is given a preference of only 5 per cent., as against countries where the conditions of industry are not equal to the conditions prevailing here or in Great Britain. As only the United Kingdom is covered hy the British preferential Tariff, most of the importations of this class of paper will be dutiable under the general Tariff. I understand that the intermediate Tariff makes it possible for reciprocal relations to be established with British Dominions, and perhaps the Minister( Mr Greene) will make a statement, showing where this class of paper is obtained, and will say whether he has any objection to increasing the preference to the United Kingdom now proposed, and whether some provision cannot be made to give some advantage tc Canada, where this class of paper is manufactured, over countries outside theEmpire. for Trade and Customs) [11.35] -This is a subject to which we have given a good deal of consideration, and in regard to which representations of various kinds have been made to us. First of all, the proprietors of newspapers, who are, of course, the great users of news printing paper, are anxious that fixed rates should be substituted for the ad valorem rates. I think that they asked for a fixed rate or an ad valorem rate, whichever would be the lower. Heretofore, the duty on . . . . . newsprint has always been a revenue duty, and I think it will be some time before the manufacture of this paper can be successfully undertaken in this country. How long that will be it is very hard to say, but it will not be in the immediate future, and in the meantime any duty imposed on the article must be a revenue duty. The Government are not prepared to go the length of surrendering revenue under this item to the extent that has been asked. proprietors reduce the price of their papers and cease to rob the people if the duties are lowered? anything we might do in connection with these duties would have any effect on the prices charged for newspapers. what difference the reduction in the price of newsprint makes in the revenue from these duties? that the prices which have been paid in the past have been enormously high, running, I think, up to £80 per ton. The duty has always been collected on 'the home consumption value. Honourable members know that an ad valorem duty must be collected on the home consumption value of the goods in the countries ir which they are produced. The home consumption value fixed for newsprint is considerably below the export value. We collect duty, not on the invoice value of the goods, but on the home consumption value fixed by the authorities in the control of"" prices in the countries from which the paper comes. price for export. Local authorities in the country in which the paper is manufactured fix the price",23,Parliamentary Allowances

The law compels us to collect duty, not on the export or invoice value of the goods, but on their home consumption value. those cases-and there are quite a number of them-the actual amount of duty collected is less than that which the invoice value of the goods would give. Since the period just indicated, the prices of paper have fallen materially, so that the invoice value would now return somewhere about the same sum as in respect of home consumption value. The difference between the latter and the invoice prices of the goods is such that we now collect about the same amount of duty as hitherto. of origin? America, and the Scandinavian countries. The price of paper to-day, I repeat, has fallen very considerably.

The Government are prepared to substitute for the present schedule rates of 5 and 10 per cent, a fixed duty. We propose to make that duty 10s. per ton, British; and £2 per ton, intermediate and general. We expect that by this alteration we shall get a rather less total volume of revenue. under those proposed rates compare, with the returns from, the present schedule? depend on the price of paper. Suppose that we take £20 per ton as a basis; the value for duty is 10 per cent, in excess of the £20; and, so long as the Tariff is 10 per cent., the .duty collected amounts to about £2. Operating in regard to the TJnited Kingdom, if the price of paper is £20, the amount, of duty would be £1. We are, therefore, slightly increasing the British preference. There will now be about 10s. per ton added to the British preference over and above what would be derived under the ad valorem rate. were to enter into a reciprocal treaty with Canada? Canada the British preferential rate of 10s. extend reciprocity in respect of newsprinting paper? able, under the measure shortly to be introduced-that is, if Parliament agrees to it-to extend to Canada the British preferential rate of 10s. as against £2 so far as concerns the TJnited States and the Scandinavian countries. meaning of the intermediate Tariff? to explain that more than once. We must fill in all the columns in regard to every item coming under the Tariff. We do not propose to extend reciprocity, in reimmediate degard to paper, to any other country thana British Dominion-that is, if it is ever so far extended. The Tariff is, therefore, arranged in this way. It is for the Committee to say whether it prefers a further adjustment of the intermediate Tariff. The intention is that the intermediate rates shall only be capable of extension to countries other than British Dominions. I will put it in this way: Negotiations between foreign . countries and ourselves can only be in respect of the intermediate Tariff. As for negotiations with other portions of the British Empire, we can extend the British preference, if we so desire. The proposals which I am now making will result, as I have indicated^ in considerable loss of revenue compared with what has been collected during the past few years. Taking the importation of news-print to be 45,000 tons-whic h is about what we import every year-and taking the duty to be £3, the revenue derived from that source totalled £147,000.",24,Division Xiii Pape R And Stationery

We are, therefore, surrendering under this rate a considerable amount of revenue which we have collected in the past.' 10 per cent, duty under the general Tariff, which on £20 is.equal to £2. If you make, the £2 a specific duty in place of the ad valorem duty it must be the same. £2 we recognise that it means losing a considerable amount of revenue; but, I think it will be some time before the whole of the importations to Australia will come in at £20 per ton. The probabilities are that we shall find in collecting duties this year, if we keep it at 10 per cent., that we shall get considerably more than the fixed rate will produce. If values come down we may receive slightly more revenue thau we would if we kept the rate at 10 per cent.

It is quite possible that in the near future Great Britain may be a strong competitor in the printing trade.

No effort is made to build up a sound provincial press, although there is every possibility, in such places as Geelong, Ballarat, and Bendigo, as well as in some of the large towns in New South Wales, to have influential country newspapers. In my constituency about a dozen papers are published, the proprietors of which have had a particularly trying time, especially during the war period. Many of them have ceased to publish owing to the impossibility of competing with other papers in consequence of the high cost of production.

Prior to the 1914 Tariff, paper was admitted free of duty, and the country realized the great importance of newspapers in the dissemination of news and the education of the people. The country press particularly has been of great service in that way. I therefore ask the Minister to give further consideration to this matter.

The local manufacturers were anxious to learn whether, as the result of their representations, increased duties would be proposed on some of the lines they produce, and I was raised to the seventh heaven of delight last Tuesday when the Minister asked the Committee to defer the consideration of this division of the schedule, because I thought that he had come to the conclusion that, from a Protectionist stand-point, the duties upon paper were useless, and that he should bring down a revised schedule with substantial increases. However, I do not gather from his remarks to-day that this is what he intends to do. He can afford some degree of assistance by rectifying anomalies, such as the one I have just pointed out. I have in my hands an exhibit of the work performed by one local maker, showing that he can produce a very fine quality of paper. This firm makes both white and brown wrapping paper, and has recently spent a considerable sum of money with a view to producing, not only all sorts of paper, but also paper of a higher commercial value. The local manufacturers, after considerable efforts, have at last produced a craft paper which is most suitable for wrapping and other purposes. question of leatherboard, strawboard, or millboard. honourable member in order in discussing the whole division at this stage, or is it necessary for him to confine himself to the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Dampier' ( Mr Gregory) ? The TEMPORARY -The amendment of the honourable member for Dampier is the question before the Chair, but the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is perfectly in order in referring incidentally to other parts of the division in order to support any arguments which he may wish to put forward concerning the amendment. manufacture of newspaper or, in fact, of any form of paper or board in Australia was not encouraged in the way it should ibave. been, and during the war we found, as in other cases, what an awkward posir tion we had placed ourselves. ih, and were very thankful to the local manufacturers of these necessary commodities who had carried on under very slight encouragement. Since the war a good deal has been done. The honourable member for Dampier and myself saw examples of what has been done, to produce paper in Australia in a laboratory connected with the Institute of Science and"" Industry. We agreed that those efforts were likely to succeed, and I look forward to the successful production of paper in Australia in the not far distant future. During the war other industries, which had to use newspaper, strawboard, and other forms of paper or board found that, if it had not been for the local manufacturers, they would have had to go out of business. The firm I have mentioned did not take advantage of the fact that importations were blocked by overcharging for their products. Yet to-day those who use strawboard in other industries are objecting to the duties proposed. In my time, I was associated with a trade which used cardboard boxes, and I am willing to admit that the raising of the price of board was a certain charge on that trade, but it would have been much worse for those in the trade if they had not been able to obtain supplies during any considerable period. Then there is the The Australian mills did not charge for strawboard and other paper anywhere near what the importers of the Japanese article were asking. They did not avail themselves of the high market price as they might have done. I do not pretend to know why they took up that attitude. Unlike most others in business, they might have felt some qualms of conscience, but the full profits that they might have taken. They can manufacture enough strawboard to supply the f u l l requirements of Australia. So far as the price is concerned, the increase would be infinitesimal on certainboxes used for trade purposes, and cannot injure traders in the way that they are suggesting.

We can do -no more in the case of Britain than make paper free, but with a lowered price of paper the Minister's proposal will prove very much greater thau the duty at present in force. Newspapers, irrespective of the varied opinions in the community, have played, and do play, a big part in public affairs. I am told on good authority, which I have verified in one or two instances, that the newspapers were of a greater importance during the war period than, perhaps, many would believe. At one time news-print was almost unobtainable, and, indeed, was quite unobtainable in France, and it is said that, as mills absolutely secure? a result, the morale, not of the French Army, but of the French people suffered in the absence of news from the Front. Before paper was contraband it was going to Germany, there to be used, not in the production of newspaper, but in the production of cartridges and other munitions of war; but the British Government realized that newspapers were a power, and, though they required paper for the production of cartridges, and so forth, sent enough to enable the French newspapers to be published, with gratifying results. An institution of such power as the newspaper press is worth preserving. The duty proposed by the Minister is certainly high, and while it will result in revenue, it will also penalize an Australian industry. I suggest that, with Great Britain on the free, list,' the intermately used. mediate duty should be 25s., and the general duty 30s. opinion, prove of great benefit, not necesgets a fair share of free machinery. sarily to newspaper proprietors, but to the Australian public. There are large paper mills, not only in my district, but elsewhere in New South Wales, and also in Victoria, engaged in the production of wrapping paper. If newspaper from Britain is admitted free, there is great risk of its being used for wrapping purposes, with consequent injury to the Australian industry. These mills have been established at great expense, and employ many people. a duty of 10s. a ton would make any material difference from the point of view of t i e honourable member,. Jhe position has always been the same in that respect. a great struggle to compete in the market, and the admission of this paper free may lead to their being closed up.

Those interested in the country press have already made strong representations to the Minister, and, certainly, they should be given consideration. I do not think the impost is a fair one, inasmuch as it falls so heavily on one section of the community. If the Minister will agree to my suggestion to make the duty in the general Tariff 40s. or 10 per cent., whichever is the lower, he will give satisfaction to that section. for Trade and Customs) [2.31] I have done my utmost to meet the wishes of the Committee in this matter. Bearing in mind the representations that have been made, and the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) knows that there have been many, the Government were prepared to sacrifice some revenue under this item at the present time. We should get considerably more revenue if we adhered to the proposal as it stands in the Tariff, 5 per cent., 10 per cent., and 10 per cent., than we shall receive under the proposal to which I have consented. Recognising the justice of the claims in many instances, particularly in regard to the country press, we have given the fullest consideration to the recommendations which have been made. country press were the largest users of news print in Australia, the situation would be somewhat different. But they are not. The proportion of news print they use is comparatively small. vast bulk of this paper is used by the big metropolitan dailies throughout the Commonwealth. I have tried to meet the views expressed by the honourable member for Dampier, and by other honourable members, and as I have said, I am prepared to amend the original proposal put before the Committee and to agree to a proposal that news print shall be free from the United Kingdom, and that the duty in the intermediate (and general columns shall be 40s. I do not feel justified in going further than that at the present time. If any additional preference were given it would have to be within the Empire, and as the British preferential rates can be extended to the British Empire, there is no necessity in this case for any adjustment in the intermediate column, and we prefer, in the circumstances, to make the duty in the intermediate column the. same as in the* general column. were carried, and I moved to add the words "" or 10 per cent., whichever is the lesser,"" what would be the attitude of the Government? against the honourable member's proposal. At the present time, the 40s. would be the lower duty, and we would collect on that. We are proposing to give away revenue now by the amendment to which I have agreed. If we were to accept the proposal of the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), when the balance, if it did, turned in the other direction, we should lose still further revenue, and that, in the present financial ""circumstances of the Commonwealth, we are not prepared to agree to. of the amount of revenue we shall lose by making importations of news print free from the United Kingdom?

He proposes that whatever may be the lower duty under this item shall be collected. Under the Customs Acti t is provided that when foreign prices reach the dumping point the fixed duty or the ad valorem duty, whichever is the higher, shall be imposed, but the honourable member for Dampier, in some particular interest, proposes that the very reverse of the principle provided for in the Customs Act shall be adopted in this case. His proposition is that if the price of newsprint comes down to £10 per ton the Government shall collect the lowest possible duty on it, and the lower the price of the imported article the lower the duty to be collected. portunity afforded for dumping.",35,Chairman The Fact Remains That They Did Not Take

206,Mr Cobseb,"And the greater the oporable member really proposes is a bonus for the dumping propositions of foreign corporations. The fundamental principles of this Tariff are, first of all, the creation of industries within our own boundaries, and then, if we cannot do that, our object is at least to give a preference to Britain. Under this particular item there is practically no attempt made to give effect to either of the principles. So far as the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) is concerned, all that he wants to do is to collect in this case a purely revenue duty, and even that he is prepared to forgo at the present moment, in order to meet the situation. There is no item in the Tariff which interests me more than this does. It is not a question of the Tariff at all, or a question of the country press. It is a question of sham, fraud, and iniquity, and of bogus Imperialism and bastard patriotism. Under this proposition we are asked to forgo everything for which we have stood for a long period, and I propose to say a few words on the item. First of all, in connection with Protection, we have great industries in this country, and we have refrained from imposing duties on much of the machinery which they require and the raw materials which they must use. We have had constitutional government in this country for fifty or sixty years, and we have never, so far, made any attempt to establish the manufacture of the paper used for the printing of newspapers. Whatever may be the argument put forward for the establishment of industries for the production of various articles in this country, they have never been applied to the production of newsprint. There, Protection has ceased. Our supplies of that particular article are imported from abroad. They are imported, not merely from the centre of our Empire, hut from Scandinavia or Japan, wherever they can be got most cheaply. S6 l o n g ' as' those* i-ntereated oit'u ejct tlioii* some of the raw material required for supplies of newsprint cheaply from the Empire they are content to do so, but if from anywhere outside the realm of our Empire they, can get. cheaper paper, then, so far as they are concerned, the Empire can go to hell. orable member's arguments ought to be. will be, probably. In the first place, there has been.no effort to impose protective duties for the establishment of the manufacture of newsprint in this country. Every effort to establish it has met with great hostility. We possess in this country a large amount of the raw material necessary for the production of newsprint. We have thousands of tons of the straw and other materials used. We have the clay, which constitutes one of the raw materials of the industry. We have certain woods from which wood-pulp can be provided. We may require some other things, and the mere fact that we do not produce every item of the raw material required for the manufacture of newsprint in this country is no reason why the industry should not be established here'. member not know that the local newspaper proprietors have contributed a fairly large sum for laboratory work to, discover whether the industry cannot be established here? their laboratory work, and also to their patriotism presently I have said that we produce a large amount of the raw material required for the manufacture of this class of paper. If it be said that we have not established the industry because we do not produce all the raw material required, I remind honourable members that we carry on many industries the raw material for which is imported. for instance. tries the same thing is done. Great Britain carries on immense industries, such as the cotton industry, for instance, the raw material for which is not produced within Eer own boundaries. Other< countries that produce paper import Cher purp»oo --A.fterj.jom e sixty yearo of constitutional government:;--wo.nannot lay the foundation of this particular industry in the Commonwealth.

213,Mr Anstey,"Yes. In other counwith the Empire in an indissoluble union, and whatever products we require we should, get them, if possible, within the Empire, and particularly from Great Britain. Prior to the war, we imported a large proportion of our newsprint paper from Great Britain. But for the most part, before the war, it eau be safely said that a larger volume of the Imperial sentiments expressed in this country, and of the patriotic effusions that appeared in the press of the Commonwealth, and much of the denunciation of our movement, were linked up with foreign nations. Two-thirds of the newspapers' of this country have been printed on foreign paper withforeign ink, and in very many cases the articles appearing in them have been writteu by men with foreign names. The advent of the war cut off our supplies of newsprint from Great Britain, and we have had to obtain our supplies from foreign sources. We have had to obtain them from Scandinavia and from Canada, where the manufacture of this paper is largely owned and controlled by American capital. Within the last hour, a paper which I have been able merely to skim over has been circulated amongst honourable members. gentleman named Shakespeare, of the Country Press Association. If I read some of it, it will enable me to cut short some of my remarks. He saysDuring the past four years the United Kingdom Jias not been a competitor in the Australian newsprint market. compete for Australian tradp in this direction over the period mentioned left consumers in the hands of foreign manufacturers. The gentleman goes on to say that in New Zealand the conditions were worse than in. Australia. Britain's inability, owing to the stress of the war, to supply us with the newsprint' paper we required, the newspaper proprietors of this country were left entirely at the mercy of American and Scandinavian controllers of their raw material, and as a result they had to pay up to ^£75 per ton _for_-tW-paper' they required. . i uncl"" that the Country Press Association, after sitting in conference, decided to wait as a deputation on the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene), and protest against the duties which were fixed in March, 1920. The -duties then fixed on this item were 5 per cent., 10 per cent., and 10 per cent. Mr Anstey. The market price at the time being round about £75 per ton, they complained to the Minister that, at the date of their deputation-the 5th August, 1920-whe n the price of newsprint was £75, the duty was £7 10s.; so that it was costing them over £80 per ton for newsprint to carry on their industry. The Minister, saw that they were under some misapprehension of the application of the duty, and pointed out that the duty was upon the fixed price' in Canada. He said that that did not apply to Scandinavia. These people had no time for the Canadians, whom they regarded, in this connection, as a race of buccaneers and exploiters. They considered that the Australian proprietors had suffered victimization at the hands . of the Americans who were controlling the raw resources of Canada. They pointed out that the duty at that time amounted to 10 per cent, on the Canadian home consumption price, and that the latter was about £20 per ton. That is to say, they had to add 10 per cent, upon that price, while at the same. time the duty was £8 per ton on the Scandinavian product. The proposition was put to It is signed by a the Minister that they were quite willing, in this hour of their country's agony,, to pay £3 per ton, but that they did not want to pay £8. They emphasized that the duties upon Canadian paper were levied on "" home consumption"" values, but that the same did not apply to Her inability to Scandinavian paper, whereas it should do so. The Minister, in reply, said, "" This shall be done."" And not only did these people get their way in that respect, but the Minister said, further,. Through Great"" Australia has been bled white by those controlling the sources of supply""; and he added that he would give relief at once, expressing himself thus, "" The duty does not pretend to be protective; its sole object is to raise revenue."" Thereafter, the duty of £8 per ton upon Scandinavian, paper was reduced to ahout £3. "" That was the concession which the Minister made. But he went even beyond that, namely, to the extent of giving these proprietors a refund upon the amounts which they had previously paid. were not then aware that the home con-, sumption price of Scandinavian ""news"" was less than the export price. When",37,Chairman The Fact Remains That They Did Not Take
214,Mr Gbeene,"The reason was that wewe discovered that it was so, we were compelled by law to do as we did. not blaming the Minister. duties to be imposed had to be upon the fair values of the exporting countries; but, in this particular case, it was not so much the values that would fairly and ordinarily have obtained, but the values fixed by the markets of those countries in respect of "" home consumption""values fixed in an arbitrary manner by the Canadian Government and by the Governments of the Scandinavian countries. The arbitrary price fixed by Canada was £20 per ton, and by Norway about £30. The price here was £7* per ton, so that the Canadian -people were putting on £55 to their home consumption price, and the'Norwegians £45. In August of 1920-les s than twelve months ago-the Associated Press of thii country were prepared to pay £75. That is, indeed, what they had to pay the foreigners, plus a tax of £3, making the cost of the commodity £78 per ton. however, there has been a considerable fall, and now the price is £25 per ton. But what is the view-point and attitude to-day? ject to ask the foreigner, who has been putting up his prices tremendously, to "" battle "" with the duty of £3. They hate so to hurt and handicap these producers who have "" sold"" them in the market-, places of the world. In January last the price was still £75, Therefore, the patriotic sentiments of so far as foreign suppliers were conthese good Australian folk are not so cerned. But the English prices,ranged bright and strong as a few months ago. between £40 and £50. England was beginning to recover from the ravages of war.

Ultimately, the British paper producers, backed by Now, the the British Government, were compelled to secure large forest areas in Canada, and to purchase timber rights over them. Their power of control over the raw resources ofCanada now constitutes a factor and a force which they had never previously possessed. In addition, as I have just said, they thoroughly re-established their home industry; and, to-day, they have some of the finest newsprint machinery in the world. So superior is the latter that the Scandinavian and American makers are now trying to get hold of these special machines. England is coming once more into the world's markets. In January last the Scandinavian and American price to buyers in this country was still £75 per ton, while, for English paper, the quotation was in the"" neighbourhood of £50. It was at this stage Since then, that some gentlemen in Australia, representing the big metropolitan dailies, became suddenly imbued with a burning Imperial sentiment and a deep love of These Australian people obEmpire, simply because paper was cheaper in Great Britain than in Scandinavia. So these ardently patriotic gentlemen sent delegates to England and got-hold of several thousands of tons of British paper.

He undertook, also, that all reductions in freight which might be made as a result of exclusively using those ships picturesof Empire subjects surrounding should go to the newspaper proprietors of Australia, in the form of reduced rates for -the actual commodity. This latter proposition had nothing to do with the matter of foreign ships or foreign flags, and it might have been thought that such an offer would have appealed to patriotism. It did not, however. The representativeof the amalgamated British interests-added, in. still further concession, preference to newsprint manufactured in that when Australia was prepared to go into the manufacture of its' own news-paper supplies the British corporation concerned would be seady to guarantee, Ur.

Here, they said, was a man who would relieve them of the rapacity of the Scandinavians. And he was flooded with letters of warm welcome, and' testimonials and effusions breathing the love of freedom and bubbling over with patriotism. One of the Australian gentlemen interested wrote to him on the 23rd May lastTlie re-entry of British newsprint manufacturers into the Australian trade is the one real pleasure we have had for several years.

On the 14th June this same writer pointed out that the newspapers of Australia had been for years the victims of "" the cruel exactions"" of the paper rings, not only of Scandinavia, but of America; and, further, he said that the press proprietors of Australiahad a clear and unanimous objection to any Canada, where the mill-owners have combined to rob Australian consumers of several millions sterling.

Down came the price, and, of course, they were no longer patriots. They wanted the price still lower, and at last they said, "" We have no further use for you."" They wanted to adhere to the proposition that the duty should come down to 30s. per ton. There was another round-table conference, and it was said that the confereuce had decided upon 30s., and the executive could not alter its decision. They further said, "" Of course, we may have sufficient influence as an executive to nullify the conditions if new data are submitted."" This was not in writing; but it was so imperative and so important that it had to be whispered through a keyhole to an intermediary. That intermediary is in the vicinity of this chamber listening to what I have to say. He came over from Sydney as a confidential representative. was not satisfied at receiving merely his travelling expenses from Sydney, but required £50 for his expenses. If the British firm would not pay £50, they would send another gentleman. This' gentleman submitted a proposition, in spite of the decision that there might be an alteration and British preference secured if new data were submitted. The new data meant a sole agency for one man of all British newsprint on a 2$ per cent, basis, roughly, £30,000. With this, new data at command, and the new power of conversion, the all-British proposition would be enthusiastically endorsed. Since that has been turned down, they have changed their opinions, and have come to the Minister with a request to reduce the duty from £3 to 30s. These are the men who did not want Canadian or Scandinavian paper, as they were absolutely opposed to the importation of foreign supplies. But what are they now prepared to give ? favour the errantry press.

They propose that the rate shall be-British, 10s.; Canadian, 25s.; and Scandinavian, 30s. The newspaper proprietors of this country, who, twelve months ago,. were speaking of how the Scandinavians had robbed them of millions, and of their cruel exactions and robberies, are not now prepared to impose more than a 5 per cent. duty. A 5 per cent, duty on these robbers! Why? Because the British have come into the market, and have become the instrument of reduction. These gentlemen are asking for a He refund of the amount of money of which they were robbed. The foreign makers of newsprint now say, ""We robbed you of millions, but now we are down to dumped prices,, and will rob you no more, but will give you back a little of that which we previously took from you."" And as they can put money into their pockets, the newspaper proprietors are prepared to allow their patriotism to go into the dustbin. They serve their Empire merely when it pays them. I have never prate.d about my loyalty; but these men are hypocritical scoundrels, and mere paraders of words, who would sacrifice and prostitute their sentiments and loyalty for the sake of profit. They are prepared to say to the Empire, "" You can go to hell if you cannot undersell the foreign product."" I ask the Ministeri f he is not prepared to submit an amendment which will be the means of affording some protection, for the simple reason that we should have some proposition which will give us an opportunity of' establishing an industry of some kind in the near future?

If he needs revenue, what amount does he wish to raise? He said quite recently that on a duty of £3 per ton the Department raised from £125,000 to £150,000. If that is so, why should we not collect £150,000 on imported paper? But the revenue should be' derived from imposts on paper manufactured in the Empire, not in foreign countries. Does the Minister know what I have here? This is Japanese paper. Does he know who are asking him for help to bring in foreign products as against the British? They are the gentlemen for whom the honourable member for Dampier speaks. Some of the Imperalistic newspapers in this country are already using Japanese paper. Even the American paper and the Scandinavian paper is too dear for them. They have no affection for the men of their own race, because their product is too dear. The white man's product is too dear for them, and so they go to Japan. newsprint coming in? have particulars here of £10,078 worth of newsprint, "" other,"" in rolls, in the year 1919-20. newspaper in this city printing upon Japanese paper. Here are samples of a new importation. The Tango Mara left a Japanese port on the 10th June, and has already arrived with a cargo consigned to the people for whom the honourable member for Dampier speaks. Those are the men who want to knock out the protective and preferential rates. The Minister's duty, if I may presume to tell him so, is not to listen to the voice of the press. He is responsible to this country, in the first place, to help to establish within Australia, if he possibly can, industries which are owned by Australians, and which are run for Australians. Secondly, his duty is to see that whatever comes into this country .shall, if need be, be the product of men of our own race and blood, manufactured under the cover of that flag which is so often spoken abou.t by these so-called patriots, who are patriots-only when it does not interfere with their pockets. If the Minister wants revenue, let him raise it upon goods that come from England. If he imposes a 10 per cent, duty on paper from Britain, let him give Britain a preference of 15 per cent, by making the duty on Japanese and Scandinavian paper 25 per cent. That would . mean, on a basis of £25 per ton, a preference of £3 to £4 per ton on British paper. What does the Minister say to that proposition ? Apparently he is against it. If he wantsBritish paper to come in free, then let him impose a duty of 15 per cent, on the Japanese and Scandinavian product. I do. not care how he fixes' it. I do not mind if he levies a duty on the British paper or not, but I do want to see a mar-' gin of 15 per cent, in favour of the British as against the Japanese, Scandinavian, and Canadian article. First of all, we should stand by our local industries, and, in the second place, we should stand by what honourable members have all professed so long to believe in, that is, Imperial preference; but when we do give a preference to Great Britain, let us make it real, and not a sham, a fraud, and a delusion. The honourable member for Ballarat proposes a duty .of 45 per 1 cent, on the foreign article. If that is agreed to, let us make the duty on the British article 15 per cent, lower; but the 45 per cent, proposal will not be carried. If it is not, we can try 40 per cent.; but we will fight this thing from point to point. I put this to the Minister as my last word: "" Stick to what you were pre-' pared to do by giving a preference of at least £3 per ton to British goods. Let that be your sheet anchor and your hope, believing that, in spite of the press of this country, you can stand on any. platform and. justify your attitude to the people of Australia."" [3.20] I endorse generally the remarks of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey), with the exception nf some of his forecasts. The Minister( Mr Greene) fails even yet to realize the importance to Great Britain at this moment of a real protection to her paper industry. It is quite evident, from what has gone on during the past few weeks, that Britain's foreign Competitors are prepared to send into this market, at considerable loss, the paper that is needed by local newspaper",42,Chairman The Fact Remains That They Did Not Take

During the war, that industry was pushed out of every overseas market because of its patriotic devotion to the needs of the Empire. It devoted the whole of its energies to the production of the paper necessary for the manufacture of munitions and for war services. During all that time, the people buying paper here were exploited in the most scandalous way, and now the British industry finds itself faced with the prospect of extinction unless it can regain some of its outside markets. If there is any industry that ought to appeal to the people of Australia and to this Committee, it is an industry that has made the sacrifices that the British paper industry has made in the common cause of the peoples of the Empire and the Allies. I hope we shall yet be able to obtain a greater preference in favour of the British product. If we do not secure such a preference as will enable Britain to retain the market of Australia, we shall repay the patriotism of the paper manufacturers of the Old Country by hastening their extinction in the interests of their competitors. I have heard, during these debates, many requests for the imposition of duties of 35 and 40 per cent., and even higher, in order to establish some very small industry in Australia; and on this occasion we should -go very much further than a 10 per cent, duty in favour of that great industry in Great Britain which did so much to help to win the war, and which, because of what it did then, is likely to suffer the loss of this market unless this Parliament gives it that protection which our many professions of a desire for the preferential treatment of the Old Land might reasonably have led it to expect. I hope we shall get a little higher duty than the Minister proposes, but I am not prepared to go , quite so high as 45 per cent. We ought to go at least to 25 per cent, in favour of Great Britain. listened to the very interesting speech which the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) has been rehearsing for the last couple of days, but which, when stripped of its declamation, has very little left. also. I should be very proud to command the honourable member's language; but I have not got it, and I know it. The honourable member, in spite of his great outburst of patriotism on this occasion, has . been very silent about Great Britain all the time the Tariff has been going through this Chamber. Night after night we have battled for special preference for Great Britain on other articles, but the honourable member has either been away altogether or has been completely silent. Why, then, this sudden outburst? We know that, during the war, not only have the Canadian and Scandinavian importers been exploiting the people of this country, but in Great Britain the enormous profits made by firms like Coats and Company have been something scandalous. There has been exploitation ou every hand, and efforts should have been made to prevent it. If it could not be prevented, the State should have tried to commandeer some portion of the money which was extorted from the public. No one here is in favour of the exploiter. On the other hand, we must consider those who are building up industries in Australia, and newspaper production is quite as much an industry as any other. Right through the Tariff there will be found very fair preferences in favour of British goods, but in this item, which has been standing in this schedule now for over twelve months, the British rate is 5 per cent., as against a general rate of 10 per cent.,, and I have not heard the honourable member for Bourke, or any one else, make any special complaint about it. ber for Bourke has just got the information about the intriguing that has been going on outside. 1 the last' few days that the British agent I has been here, and he has done his share of intriguing.

There has been practically no trade with that country in paper, and we do not anticipate any. Canada, Sweden, Norway, and Finland are supplying us, and we hope that Great Britain will come back into the market. When I proposed my amendment,, I said that I would much prefer to put Great Britain on the free list, but that I did not think the Minister would accept that, because he had included in the schedule a duty of 5 per cent, on British and 10 per cent, on foreign paper, I thought if I proposed 10s. per ton British and 30s. per ton general, I would be giving 100 per cent, more preference to Great Britain than the Minister did. I am pleased the Minister has gone so far now as to propose to make British paper free. than your own caused the Minister to change his mind? unless the fact has come to the Minister's knowledge that Great Britain is desirous of getting into the trade again, and that its agents are-coming to Australia. . I am satisfied that the Minister has a keen desire to give preference to Great Britain. It is true that, on several occasions, when I asked for a larger British preference he would not agree to it ; but, taking the Tariff right through, honourable members will see that what may be looked on as fair and generous preference has been given. The agent who supplied the honourable member for Bourke with his information asked that British paper should be allowed in free, and a duty of *£A per ton imposed under the general Tariff. The question we have to decide is whether that amount of preference is not too great. I have just been handed a letter from one of the newspaper people. The writer refers to the fact that these people have put proposals before one of the large newspaper companies. the company writes as follows.:Our company has received your letter of 24th June, copies of which have been sent to the other daily papers in this city. This company has not had an opportunity of considering your letter, nor has there been an opportunity of consulting with the other papers. . I know of no paper which is opposed to precould have no association with ference to Great Britain. Buti t is unfair And the speech of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey), bursting with patriotism significantly absent on other occasions, was unfair, because, stripped of all its platitudes, it was an endeavour to induce this Committee to give an undue and unfair preferenceto build upon that opinion a suggestion that such a severe impost as you suggest should be placed upon the newspapers of the Commonwealth. has a rotten case. As a believer in the alliance with Japan, he thinks he ought to have Japanese paper brought here. enter into the discussion of another matter, but I may be pardoned for pointing out that it has been absolutely necessary for us to import strawboard from Japan.; otherwise the local boxmakers could not have carried on their trade. But Japanese stfawboard is very inferior, and we know that only a small quantity of printing paper has been imported from Japan, and that, very likely, because of the impossibility of importing sufficient from elsewhere to meet the big demand here I do not suppose that the Minister( Mr Greene) can trace other importations from the same source. dissected importations of newsprint, except, for the year 1920, when the value was £10,000. I understand that. some paper is being landed from Japan at the present time. any previous importations from that source. If it were possible to do so, I would insist upon this printing paper having upon it something to indicate the country of its origin.

239,Mr Corser,"They are prepared tothey must import paper for their own use. Last week, 11,000 tons of printing paper was imported into Great Britain from Germany. I am aware that the British manufacturers are buying spruce forests in Canada with a view to pulping for their requirements, but the only question before us to-day is whether we are giving sufficient preference to Great Britain. The rates of duty set out in the. schedule are British, 5 per cent, and foreign, 10 per cent. The Minister( Mr Canada; because people of our race in Greene) has now come forward with a proposal to allow printing paper to come in free from Great Britain, and impose a duty of 40s. in the intermediate and general columns of the schedule. My original proposal was to make the rates 10s., 25s., and 30s.; but I am quite in sympathy with the Minister's proposal to impose no duty upon printing paper manufactured in Great Britain. If we were to impose the rate of duty asked for by the representatives of the British manufacturers, namely, £4 per ton, the duty payable upon newsprint, imported from other countries, would amount to £280,000 a year. In this connection the communication from ""the newspaper company, portion of which I have already quoted, goes on to sayThe newspapers of Australia realize that the Government must have revenue, and, ""as patriotic institutions, are willing to meet their share of taxation.

The honourable member for Dampier( Mr with America at certain fixed prices, but Gregory) was absolutely in error in trying to make out that the paper manufacturers of Great Britain could not provide sufficient paper to meet the requirements of Australia, because I have proof of the fact that certain British companies are prepared to enter into ah agreement to provide 50,000 tons of paper per annum for Australia.. Although not personally interested, I have felt very keenly the fact that the' press of Australia were being bled white by those countries which were supplying us with printing paper, among which, I am sorry to say, is Canada associated themselves with American manufacturers, and fixed upon a price of £75 per ton for the paper they agreed to supply to Australia, and also imposed very heavy shipping freights upon the carriage of it to this country. This is a copy of a cablegram forwarded to the Australian representatives of the paper makers of Great Britain:Lloyd's Imperial Empire and Marsden group undertake to supply, for five years, or longer, up to 50,000 tons per annum any width, standard substance; commencing next year, or earlier, if necessary. This gentleman has assured me that he has received cables from his principals assuring him that they are in a. position to enter into an agreement to supply this paper at £22 3s. 4d. per ton. The trouble is that those people who have been charging us the excess between this reasonable price and £75 per ton are in a position during the war-proceed s of robbery I call them-by furnishing' us with paper at a cheap price in order to drive the British manufacturers out of the market. I wonder what would 'have been the price ' of their paper now if they had not ascertained that British manufacturers were prepared to come upon the market and charge us a fair price. In the circumstances it is only fair that we should give a preference to Great Britain. I sincerely trust that the Minister will not accede to the request for a lower duty against foreign countries. On the other hand, I hope he will increase the rate against those people who penalized us during the war, when we had to depend upon them for supplies of paper.

If that be so, we have no right, on the pretext f trying to help the press of Australia', to prevent the imposition of an effective Protective duty. In view of the offer which -the British manufacturers have made, :how can it be said that'the press of Australia will be penalized ? The only course is to protect those who have made this offer, fbr five years if necessary, and so prevent dumping by' those who took advantage of us in our time of need. -The honourable member, for Bourke( Mr Anstey) has certainly opened up a new avenue of thought in relation to this item. Some of the particulars which he gave to the Committee were known to honourable members, but we were not in possession of all the facts he has related. One of the most pleasing features is that our own kith and kin, with big financial backing, are prepared, as soon as Australia is ready, to establish the paper industry in our midst, if practicable -That is the only way in which a great industry like paper-making can be established, and small quantity of paper. some of-us have been putting forward that argument throughout this debate.

I have had a personal interview with the Chairman of the Joint House Committee, and I have also had conversations with the members of that Committee who were present at its last meeting. I requested the President of the Senate as Chairman of the Committee to furnish me with a full report of the action of which complaint has been made. From his report, which I shall read for the information of honourable members, ' I gather that the appointments to which excejption has been taken are not within the purview of the Joint House Committee at all.

I have no doubt that that statement is correct. The Public Service Act Regulation, if my memory serves me aright, provides that a temporary employee cannot be retained for more than nine months, whereas this young fellow, to my knowledge, has been employed here for ten years, or always found him most courteous and obliging; indeed, I d'o not think there could be a better lad employed in this House. I have quietly interested myself in the case for the last three or four weeks. It became known to me that I felt very keenly for him. He is in ill health, consequent upon 'being, inoculated at the request of the Joint House Committee, and is now unable to follow any other employment than such as that he has been engaged in here. I interviewed an officer on the Senate side, who pointed out, as you,-sir, have done this afternoon, that efforts had been made by theAuditor-General to have him displaced on the ground that he was not a permanent employee. I do not wish to go into the whole facts of the case, hut I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this young man could be created a. permanent official. The strange thing is that two other young men, who entered the parliamentary employment six or eight months ago, or,, at any rate, quite recently, have been gazetted as permanent officers. It is true that these are returned men; but we notice the great difference in the treatment.

There is some power at work within the precincts of the House, quite apart from the Auditor-General, to "" set"" this yuung fellow. I know all the facts of the case, hut I shall not deal with them this afternoon. With all the feeling at my command I say that I have watched this boy ever since -he came here, and that he has always fulfilled his duties in a perfectly satisfactory way so far as I have observed. In view of his impaired health, the least we can do is to find him suitable employment. sincerely trust that the authorities of the Parliament will take into consideration the facts and arguments that have been placed before us this afternoon. I believe that every member of this Parliament has a good word to say for this man, who, although he looks very young, has, I believe, a wife to support. invalid sister. not in the physical state he was when he entered the Service, and is unable to do hard' work. During the influenza epidemic he was compelled by the parliamentary officials to undergo inoculation, and it is this which has led to his present ill-health. As a returned soldier', and a member of the Soldiers League, I can say that the official body of that League wouldonot sanction the displacement, in favour of any returned soldier, of a young man who had offered his services to the country. I-trust that between now and Tuesday the matter will be reconsidered, and a satisfactory solution arrived at. endorse the remarks which have been made in regard to the courtesy with which .members have always been treated by this young man, and to the ready response he has always made to demands upon him. It might happen occasionally that one had to ring the l if t bell more than once, but he could always be heard running to the l if t from some place where possibly lie had been delivering a message. Quite recently there has been an appointment made in another place, and, although it is said that this man's services are not [389] necessary, we find a new man in the l if t to-day. It has beensaid that the l if t attendant has been seen under the influence of liquor, but while he was working the lift, and, before that, when he was employed in the Eefreshment Eoom, I never saw any sign of liquor about him. during the ten years. that this dismissal was the result of a spasm of economy on the part of the Government, because of the representations made by the Taxpayers Association, the Australian Natives Association, and others, but I am now disabused of that idea, in view of the fact that another man is now working the lift. Some time ago I asked whether the employee in charge of our l if t received wages up to the award made for liftmen outside. I am of opinion that the Government should pay their employees award rates in every instance. I understand that this young man's wages amounted to £2 8s. per week. The award for liftmen is l is . per day, and from the time that was mentioned a certain gentleman holding a position in another place has been very much offended with me for making inquiries in connection with the matter. I will not say what he said, but certain words passed, and there has been evident a dosire to remove this young man, who possesses British pluck, and, like myself, will stand up for his rights and damn every one who tries to deny them. members of the House have spoken, and I think it is right that, as a young member, I should say that I have always received the utmost courtesy from the l if t boy to whom reference has been made. In my view, it is regrettable that his services have been dispensed with, and that another person should now be doing the work at which he was previously employed. There is no question of economy at issue, though there seems to be some misunderstanding on that point. I should fail in justice to this young man, who has an invalid sister and elderly mother dependent upon him, if I did not say that I had always received the utmost courtesy from him.

The fact that he has rendered service here for ten years sufficiently indicates that his service was iiot unsatisfactory. I have been a member of the House for about four years, and to say that this young'man was anything but courteous and efficient is to utter a travesty of the truth. another aspect of the question which should be givenconsideration. Erom time to time honorahle memhers have made inquiries as to the salaries paid to parliamentary attendants. There seems to he, on. the part of those in control of those attendants, a tendency to resent any application by them for better conditions. in that. to do with this matter, because I have reahis presence was urgently required, this son to believe that the dismissal of this young man is only a beginning, and that when we go into recess shortly other servants of the Parliament will be dealt with in a similar manner. for his rights is ""snouted"" by the heads. whatever course may be followed in another place, that honourable members of this House should secure control over the officials who minister to their wants here. We are supposed to be responsible for them, and the dismissal of this young man is, in my opinion, a reflection on every member of this House. We should insist upon the appointment of a Committee of honourable members who shall have full control over the appointment of our attendants. The Committee should be responsible for what is done in connection with them, and they should not be handed over to. splenetic individuals. The honorahle member for Barrier( Mr preference to returned soldiers, it has Considine) has touched upon the real trouble, and that is that the House Committee apparently, has no say in connection witb the appointment of attendants upon Parliament. The President is Chairman of the House Committee, and Mr Speaker is also a member of it. It is a Joint -Committee in every respect, and should be given more extended powers than it has. I had the honour of serving on the Committee concerning the wages of the refreshmentroom staff were considered and determined by that Committee. Why one section' of the wages staff of Parliament should be under the control of the Committee and another should be removed from that control has always been a There is mystery to me. The right course to pursue is to give greater power to the House Committee to control the wages staff. So far as this particular young man is concerned, I may truthfully say that during the last eighteen months, while acting in an official position, as one of the Whips of the Ministerial -party, I never found him anything but obliging to the utmost degree. If there has been urgency in advising honourable members that a division was about to take place, or it has been necessary to inform some honourable member that particular lad was always found willing .to render assistance in a marked degree.' Few honorahle members have had .as much running about this building as I have had in the last eighteen months, and, in common with' my predecessors in the position of Whip, I can assert that this young man has always been most obliging and respectful. I cannot for the life of me understand why. he should he penalized after ten years' service. excuse should be given that he was not a permanent hand, when another man has been appointed to replace him. surprise to me to hear that the services of this lad had been dispensed with.

I desire to explain the reason for the injury to the arm of this unfortunate young man. officers and other persons attached to the staff of this Parliament were asked to undergo a serum injection. The man in question opposed that, because his medical adviser had expressed the view that he was not in good health, and that it would not be well for him to be inoculated. However, Dr. Stevens, who. is a very good man, and who was the departmental oflicer who was doing the inoculating, asked that he might make an examination of him, and then said, "" In. my opinipn, you are fit to have serum injected."" underwent the necessary treatment. The consequences, however, were so severe that Dr. Stevens did not give the second injection To my knowledge, this unfortunate individual has been attending hospital for massage and other treatment, month after month, and his arm.is not right at the present-moment. Conserva™ tive minds in the medical and surgical world are not too strongly convinced concerning the ultimate effects of serum treatment. 'Great results certainly have been, obtained by it. This. cas.e is .the only head of his Department ( Mr U'Ren) ; but one in which the inoculation did .not prove satisfactory among all those dealt with in this establishment. The honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford), myself, and the President of the Senate, had experience on one occasion of certain vaccines, and we were the unfortunate ones. iSerum treatments frequently give results which .are anything but desirable. I am sure every honourable member is -sorry that the young man's mother has been dragged into this vendetta. It was -stated that she had written a letter saying that her son had told untruths about his hours of attendance in this building, and, in other words, that, he was not re[389]2 liable. I have to thank Senator de LargieI feel that on this for the honourable position he took up in this matter. In the Hansard reports of 26th November, 1920 (page 707), there will be found a complete refutation of. the accusation, for the letter was neverseen, and could not be produced. the boy has been in trouble.

The young manin question, in company with several of his fellow workers, was opening his pay envelope in the presence of the Senate .officer who was owski, and he found that he had been given only £12 10s., whereas the others, had received £15. He turned round, and said, ""Look! I have been robbed."" The, paying officer reported this remark to-the President, saying, however, that the young man had said that he (Broinowski.)' Thereupon the young man had done the robbery. One other fellow employee was present throughout, the. whole incident,, and he, as well as the young man immediately concerned, is willing to give sworn evidence that the words were not used as the Senate officer complained. The young man was ready to go before a Select Committee of the Senate, in order to give evidence; but he was not permitted to be a witness.. On two distinct occasions he was summoned by the Committee to appear before it, and he actually-obtained permission from the the President told him that if he dared' to give evidence to the Committee, drastic action would be taken against him.
