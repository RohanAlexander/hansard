(2) Half of these are unambiguous, blatant schemes with no commercial or family justification. Such schemes should be the subject of retrospective legislation to recover tax avoided before the government acted. (3) Such schemes have huge revenue implications. It is likely that retrospective legislation could recover at least $2-3 billion of taxes owing due to these schemes. (4) The schemes against which the Government has acted represent merely the tip of the tax avoidance and evasion iceberg and are merely small tributaries of the tax evasion and avoidance torrent. Total revenue losses are enormous. Professor Russell Mathews estimated in 1980 that the cost to revenue was close to $3 billion per year. ""If taxes paid by other personal incomer recipients had maintained the same proposition to taxes paid by wage and salary earners as in 1965-66, the former would have been higher by $2, 715m."" Other estimates includeDavid Connolly, MP:"". . . tax avoidance which is currently estimated to cost the Government approximately five billion in lost revenue."" National Times, March 7-13, 1982: "". . at the very least an overall total of some $5,000 million a year is lost, and that the true figure could be very much higher."" Andrew Peacock, MP:"". . . the cost to revenue is estimated to be around $7,OOOm.""
