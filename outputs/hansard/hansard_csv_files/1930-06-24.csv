Those barracks consist of a few dilapidated and useless structures.

I presume that what is at the bottom of the honourable member's mind is the opinion that I should have informed him of my visit to his electorate; but I merely called at the barracks on my way to inspect a much more important work, and was accompanied by the honourable member representing the district concerned. The Victoria Barracks are considered by the military authorities to be suitable for their particular purposes, and I assure the honourable member that certain work is contemplated which, when completed, will make him proud of having such an institution in his electorate.

If so, does the Prime Minister approve of that procedure? made no declaration requiring public servants to join unions. My own opinion is that all public servants should be members of the unions for which they are eligible; but no instruction has been issued that they must join the unions. The Government, however, insists that only those who are members of organizations that have received awards from the arbitrators shall receive the benefits of those awards.

In view of his announcement on the 13th instant, that it is proposed to amend the Public Service Act to permit of the absorption of graduates of the Royal Military College into the Public Service, would it be possible for public servants at present employed iu tbe Department of Defence in positions of a military nature or which could be equally well, if not better, filled by military personnel, to be transferred to other government departments, and for Duntroon .graduates to be transferred to tlie Defence Department? 2. Would the employment of suitable military personnel in clerical positions in the Department of Defence make for increased efficiency and provide a reserve of trained soldiers to cope with the expansion in the military system which must take place in the event of the outbreak of war? MrA . GREEN The replies to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w :1. The Commonwealth Public Service Board is responsible for the appointment of clerical personnel, and graduates from the M i l it a r y College approved for appointment w ill no doubt be allotted to suitable clerical vacancies in Commonwealth departments including the Defence Department. It is pointed out that the clerical officers of the Commonwealth Public Service employed in the Defence Department have been trained in the duties they are performing and no advantage would be gained by transferring them to other departments with the view to their replacement by new appointees. 2. No. The defence administration comprises navy, army, air force, civil aviation, munitions, and rifle club activities. Classified clerical positions in all branches are filled by appointments under the Public Service Act. The Military Board has subscribed to the view that clerical positions should be under the Public Service Act in preference to the former system of the corps of military staff clerks. The trained Public Service clerks in military branches would be available in war time for allotment to clerical duties witb military units. Defence, u p o n notice1.

(a) A person who is permanently incapacitated for work and fulfils the other requirements of the act is qualified to receive an invalid pension; (6) No. Form 16, howover, contains the following note:Cases of a transient nature, only temporarily incapacitating the claimant for work; or of a permanent nature, but only partially incapacitating him for work, do not come within the act. 2.

In orderto reply authoritatively to the statements of Senator' Sampson, I have obtained a report on the whole subject from the Adjutant-General. I trust that the figures that I shall quote from it will be sufficient to put an end to the misstatements that are being made, particularly by some senators at political gatherings, for party purposes. The enlistments to the end of May, discourage voluntary recruiting and to 1930, under' the voluntary, system, have decry the present defence system. In been, as follows:All Arms. State.

As honourable members are aware, the flax plant produces both flax fibre and linseed. In some countries, especially India, certain varieties of the flax plant are grown mainly for the production of linseed. . But in other countries it is found more payable to grow varieties of flax plants that will give better financial results in the production of flax fibre and linseed conjointly. That is the experience in Australia. Sowing is usually carried out in springtime; but in Australia it may also be done early in autumn. Harvesting usually takes place in January or February. The flax plant is commercially cultivated in Russia-which , before the war, produced well over half the world's supply-the Baltic Provinces, India, Argentine, Ireland, and several other countries. In New Zealand a different kind of flax, Phormium tenax, is produced, which is much coarser than the Australian flax, and is grown chiefly for the seed and also, to a slight extent, for the manufacture of a rough cordage. Manufactured flax goods, as well as linseed and linseed oil, are imported into Australia from the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, the United States of America, Argentine, and Phormium tenax is imported from New Zealand.

At this time we are anxious to establish new industries. This is one that I thinkcan be satisfactorily put on its feet, giving employment to primary producers and secondary workers.

Flax-growing is best carried on as a three-year rotation crop. Therefore, under ideal conditions, 450,000 acres of suitable flax country is necessary,-and the 300,000 acres not used for flax in any given year could be used for other crops.

It was essentially a war-time measure, and, as such} gave, the industry no assurance of con1 tinuity. One of the problems iu those days was the difficulty in retting. That will be"" overcome by the use of modern machinery. Money was lost by the Government under that guarantee, and the industry did not prosper. The failure between 1918 and 1922 seems clearly to have been due to the much higher prices then being received by the farmers for other farm produce, which made the returns from flax comparatively unattractive. Moreover, there was insufficient pure seed available to meet the suddenly increased demand by farmers at that time for flax-growing, and in consequence, the yield of flax plants per acre was abnormally low. Now, however, every effort possible will be made by the State Agricultural Departments to provide expert advice toflax-growers,and to co-operate with the farmers with a view .. 100,000 to bringing success to the industry.

Moreover, other farm products have diminished in value and flax plants, at £5 a ton, are generally recognized as being a payable crop, aud quite attractive compared with other crops at current values. The principal manufacturers of flax fibre and linseed in Australia include the following:-Flax Corporation of Australia Ltd., Launceston, Tasmania; Flax Proprietary Ltd., Drysdale, Victoria, and Linen Flax Products Coy., Colac, Victoria. There are several other manufacturers, operating mainly in Gippsland, Victoria. At the present time there is great activity in the industry. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr improvement will this bounty make on a Paterson) is probably aware of recent activity in this direction in his electorate. The people engaged in flax-growing anticipate that by the payment of a bounty their industry will be resuscitated. desire to resuscitate an industry that has recently been showing great activity? The industry has shown considerable activity compared with its progress some ten years ago. The Government offered an incentive to the farmers to engage more actively in flax-growing by promising to introduce a bounty on the production of flax and linseed. As a result, farmers are now planting larger areas. That is strikingly borne out by the fact that the area under cultivation in Tasmania increased from 8 acres in 1926 to 87 in 1927; to 225 in 1928; to 1,181 in 1929; and, if this bounty bill is passed, it is anticipated bill. The chief difficulties now operating that 3,000 acres will be under cultivation in 1930.

The Government told them that it was very anxious to establish new industries, and particularly industries like this, that had both primary and secondary branches, and was estimated to give considerable employment, an industry that, if established, would keep large sums of money in Australia that would otherwise go overseas. Experts have advised that the soil and climate of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, as well as portions of New South Wales and Queensland, are ideal in extensive areas for flax-growing. All the farmer witnesses, and several flax experts, who appeared before the Tariff Board, expressed strongly the opinion that if farmers are assured of this bounty there would be a great revival of the industry. ton of flax? 15 per cent., 10 per cent., and 7$ per cent, on the net cash selling value of flax and linseed, at the time and place of delivery from the factory. Clause9 of the bill provides that the Minister may withhold the whole or any part of the bounty if he finds that the manufacturer has paid less than a reasonable price to the farmer for flax plants. that ? careful investigation has been made by the responsible officers. That will ensure that farmers will not be fleeced by -manufacturers. The provision is similar to one contained in the Wine Export Bounty Act, which has operated successfully. Flax-growers are therefore assured of assistance and protection under the against a large expansion of the industry are' the lack of any assurance that the payable price of £5 per ton will continue for a reasonable term of years, and the' uncertainty as to the future which precludes the manufacturers from raising capital to install the latest improved machinery. That is a very important consideration.

In the Melbourne Argus of the 25th March last, the managing director of a new company, called the "" Linen Flax Products Company,"" operating in the Colac district of Victoria, announced that a minimum of 1,000 acres will be set aside for flax-growing iu the coming season, and that much enthusiasm is being shown by the farmers. The project will result in 45 men being employed in the Colac, mills, and their wages will amount to about £10,000 per annum. That gentleman also stated that his company proposed to establish a chain of mills in the Colac districts, .with subsidiary mills in outlying centres. These will be scutching mills, where the de-seeding, retting and fibre extraction will take place. I have in my hand some samples of rough fibre, fibre after scutching, and cordage and rope made of Australian flax at the Drysdale factory. Last year there were in the Australian flax industry approximately 60 farmers, 60 permanent' field-workers,-and 100 mill employees, making'a total of'220.

I think that it was the honourable member for Cook( Mr C. Riley) who paid a visit to Tasmania and was much impressed with the possi-' bilities of both the primary and secondary branches of the Australian flax industry. The honourable member cannot be accused of making the statement in an endeavour to influence votes in his favour. It is important to note that an Australian market already exists for 23,000 tons of linseed per annum, all of which is now imported, and is used to make linseed oil, linseed meal, oil cake, &c. If this quantity of linseed were to be produced from locallygrown flax plants, there would also be produced about 25,000 tons of flax fibre, which is substantially more than Australia could now use for the manufacture of cordage, twine, rope, canvas, linen and so -forth. However, the experts engaged in-the flax industry consider that a large demand cpuld be created in Australia for flax fibre, for various manufacturing purposes, and that any surplus over local requirements could be profitably exported to other countries when the industry eventually became well established. expressed a desire to take some flax fibre from Colac? that, when the industry revives, there will be no difficulty in exporting any surplus production to flax grownin Papua and New -Guinea? sary?

101,Mr Gregory,"Why is a bounty necesyears, before the big mills are established, the requests of the deputation and the some encouragement should be given to the people who are prepared to' invest their money in reviving the industry. Particularly at this time the Federal. Government has a responsibility to endeavour to assist an industry that will give additional employment. By the time the industry is well established, and, in addition to supplying local requirements, is able to export the surplus, local costs of production will have been reduced by the adoption of better machinery and methods, and lower overhead costs will naturally result from large scale production. Flax is not a one-sided industry. Its value lies in the fact that it will create new wealth and' employment both in .primary and secondary industries, and will help to place many more settlers on the land. A further consideration is that this crop is specially suitable for production in Tasmania, and will help that State, whose, financial position is generally recognized to be weak. Tasmania claims to have suffered as a result of federation, and the present Government is prepared at all time's to give sympathetic consideration to any industry that will help to l if t the State out of its difficulties. The development of this industry will tend to modify the present necessity for the younger generation of Tasmanians to depart for the mainland in order to secure employment. ""Without the proposed bounties, the industry has neither stability nor a sufficient inducequantities of 200 tons of flax, and 4,000 ment to expand on a large scale. With a bounty it is believed that rapid expanAfter the most careful consideration, the sion will be possible, which, in turn, will Government decided that the existence conduce greatly to lower costs of production and distribution, and so render the bounty unnecessary after a few years. that the deputation asked for a larger sum. Was he able to convince them that they could do with much less? them that the Government was not prepared to give more than was recommended by the Tariff Board. When the honourable member was chairman of a wages board in Victoria he arbitrated between the claims of the employees on the one hand and the employers on the. other.. I , likewise, arbitrated between interests of the general community. The bill provides for bounty on a diminishing scale ranging from 15 per cent, to 10 per cent, and finally 7£ per cent, of the net Australian market value The manufacturers concerned have accepted these reduced rates. I pointed out to them that, having regard to the present economic and financial position of Australia, they must be reasonable. At the present time the net Australian market values are approximately.: Flax, high grade raw material, £60 per ton; flax, low grade, £35 per ton; linseed, average, £20 per ton. recommend that the bounty should be confined to the variety Linum usitatissir mum, to the exclusion of Phormium tenax? board's recommendation. I shall consider further the merits of Phormium tenax, and, if desirable, it will be included. My advice is, however, that that variety is not suitable to Australia. The production for 1930 is variously estimated at from 400 tons to 500 tons of flax, and from 380 tons to 450-tons of linseed. In this regard, the Tariff Board originally recommended that no bounty should be paid until the annual flax production is worth £20,000 and linseed £70,000. On the 18th January, 1929, however, the Tariff Board advised that minimum tons of linseed should be stipulated. of a hard and fast condition regarding minimum production would militate against the development of the industry. If producers could get no encouragement or assistance until their linseed production reached the high total of 4,000 tons per annum, this factor, together with past disappointments, would be an obstacle to development. Furthermore, an important practical point to be borne in mind is that a given quantity of flax crop produces approximately equal quantities of flax fibre and linseed. Therefore, the proposed stipulation of a minimum of 250 tons of flax, and 4,000 tons of linseed, was not consistent; it meant that",27,Second Reading

106,Mr Forde,"The bill is based on theproducers would qualify for the flax bounty years before they could obtain bounty on similar quantities of linseed produced at the same time. The Government has decided, therefore, that, in the best interests of the industry, no quantity pointed by the Minister, shall not be restrictions should be imposed, especially as inquiries show that the minimum production of 250 tons of flax will be considerably exceeded for 1930, and that production will be appreciably greater in the following year. On the basis of a production in 1930 of 500 tons of flax and 450 tons of linseed, the bounty payments for 1930 will be about £8,000. Allowing for reasonable increases in subsequent years, it is estimated that the following amounts of bounty will be paid under this bill:-1930 , £8,000; 1931, £15,000; 1932, £13,000; 1933, £15,000; 1934, £15,000; total, £66,000. The percentage decrease in the rate of bounties will prevent an increase in the annual liability. The total appropriation proposed is £20,000 per annum, or £100,000 for the five years. This leaves a margin of £34,000 to cover a larger expansion in the industries than is forecasted in the pressed by those engaged in the industry, foregoing estimates. The farmer will be protected by being assured of a reasonable price for his flax plants. The bill also gives protection to consumers of flax and linseed and to employees. The Minister may, under clause 12, withhold the whole or part of the bounty, or obtain refunds of bounty already paid, if the claimant does not sell his flax or linseed at a reasonable price. Further, under clause 13, the net profits of claimants are limited to 15 per cent., and the Minister may withhold the payment of any bounty, or obtain refunds of bounty already paid that would otherwise result in the claimants earning more than 15 per cent, profits. In regard to employees, clause 14 provides that the Minister may withhold the whole or any part of the bounty if he finds that the conditions of employment or rates of wages observed by manufacturers of flax, or linseed, or by growers of flax plants are below the declared or standard conditions or rates prescribed by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, or by any other industrial authority of the Commonwealth or aState. That provision is similar to the industrial clauses recently adopted by the House in respect of the ""Wine Export Bounty Bill and the Cotton Industries Bounty Bill. Sub-clause 7 provides that a Commonwealth authority, to be apappointed unless there is no Federal or State award or determination, or registered industrial agreement applying to the industry. An appointment would be made by the Minister only in exceptional circumstances. Under sub-clause 8 such a Commonwealth authority will be composed of one representative of the employers, one representative of the employees, and a chairman appointed by the Minister on the joint nomination of the representatives of employers and employees. Having regard to the considered opinion of the .Tariff Board"" that if the establishment of the flax industry can be achieved, even at a maximum bounty cost of £30,000 per annum, the cost would be small in comparison with the result obtained,"" and in view of the views exthe officers of the Development and Migration Commission, and others who have been consulted, I submit the bill to the House in the confident hope that it will be acceptable to honourable members, as a measure that has reasonable expectations, even with the reduced expenditure limit of £20,000 per annum, of establishing an industry of a potential value to Australia of £1,000,000 annually. adjourned.

109,Mr Gregory (Swan) [4.45],"This is taking place in a country which is the size of the Dnited States of America, and has wonderful resources. Yet, because of ignoring the great economic laws which have ruled the world for centuries, we are in a most deplorable condition. We continue to introduce legislation imagining that by so doing this country may prosperous. mind our own business and allow those engaged iu industry to manage their own affairs. If that were done there would be a marvellous change within a short time. The object of this bill is not conciliation and arbitration; it is purely a. trade unions bill, regardless of all interests except those of the trade union official and the factory worker. Any honourable member who believes that this legislation is in the interests of the nation, and will bring about peace in industry, is indeed an optimist. Will this legislation he in the interests of the manufacturers ? Their latest statement is as follows:Amongst other menus for tlie reduction of production costs, -without reducing wages, the following are suggested for serious consideration:"" (1) The fixing of a 48-hour week as a standard. (2) Payment hy results, based upon the existing award rates, to be allowed in all industries. (3) The abolition, or, at least, the reducing, and a man in the audience wanted tion of payment for holidays and picnic days. The latter are usually very poorly attended. Most awards cover eight or nine such days annually. They involve not merely the direct monetary loss which the forced payment of wages involves, hut they reduce the output, and so increase the cost of the article to the public. Will the passing of this bill do anything in the direction of assisting the manufacturer to competewith other countries? It will have the opposite effect, despite the revision of the tariff in the interests of Australian industries generally. Today a bill was introduced in this House for the purpose of giving a bounty to even another industry. So the thing goes on. Goodness knows from where the money is to come. This legislation will go a long way towards paralysing industry. It is the duty of this Parliament to endeavour to see that equal justice is done to every section of the community. Why did the big timber strike take place? It was not Mr Gregory. because the trade unions wanted to interfere with the wages of the timber-worker in the country or his working hours of 48 hours a week. It was because the city worker objected to work 48 hours a week that the trouble started. Can we give every person in the community the same conditions? Can we become give the man on the.land the same conWe should learn to ditions as are enjoyed by the men in the city? While it is our duty to look after the interests of the poorest people, and to give them some little concession, if necessary, it is also our duty to see that equal justice is done to every section of the community. This legislation is not likely to accomplish that. member knows that if we applied the conditions of the city worker to the worker in the agricultural areas the farmers would immediately be driven off the laud. Recently this House passed legislation with the object of giving a guarantee in connection with the production of wheat. The cost of production has become so high that the farmers cannot carry on, and consequently this Parliament has had to come to their aid. During the British seamen's strike, which took place some five years ago, I was addressing a meetto know whether I considered that £8 a month was a fair wage to pay a British seaman. I told him that that was not his business or mine, because the British ship-owners and seamen were quite capable of settling their own differences without outside interference. This man was a farmer in the district, and I asked him what wage he paid to the men that he employed on his farm. Instead of answering he left the meeting amid roars of laughter from the audience. I discovered afterwards that the wages of his labourers were 35s. a -week and board, while that of the British seaman was £2 a week and board. This man was like many honourable members opposite who seek popularity no matter what the cost may be-to the nation. The industrial position of Australia is serious, and I did anticipate that this Government would, at least, show some little sympathy with the unemployed. The introduction of the bill itself is an impertinence. If the",29,Conciliation An D Arbitration Bill Second Reading

111,", Mr Gregory","The honorableAttorney-General were dealing with a company, he would charge the persons concerned with fraud for producing :i prospectus similar to this bill. It is proposed, under this legislation to appoint conciliation commissioners. gested that this is conciliation legislation; but there is no mention in the bill of conciliation except in the term "" conciliation commissioners."" Under this bill we are substituting coercion for co-operation, and injunctions for voluntary contracts. The whole bill 'teems with coercion so far as the Worker is concerned. A conciliation commissioner is to have almost the same power as a judge. The Government may appoint any person that it likes as a conciliation commissioner, and' I certainly should not care to see industry at the mercy of the commissioners who are likely to be appointed. We should deal with conciliation as it is being dealt with in other countries. According to Webster the definition of the word "" conciliate "" isTo win over, to gain from a state of hostility, to gain the goodwill or favour of, to make friendly, to mollify, to propitiate, to appease; to draw, or bring together, to become friends, make, friends; to win goodwill.

Is that the idea underlying the appointment of conciliation commissioners? thereany intention of, bringing the parties together for the purpose of getting them to come to an agreement? Certainly not, because these conciliation commissioners are to be given the most absolute power to reduce wages and hours and to vary any award that . ""may be made ' by a judge; of the court. I have looked through the bill in vain to find any proposal to settle disputes in industry by conciliation. The Government claims that it has a maiidate for'the introduction of this legislation.

When that question w,as put before this Parliament only! two members, the then honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) and myself, opposed the Government.

State legislation, and it is, working quite satisfactorily.' The. people of Western Australia do not want interference.on the industrial side by the Commonwealth. This is what Mr Barker, the. secretary of the Western Australian executive of the Labour party, said on the 30th May, 1929The Federal Arbitration Act has never given the court sufficient powers to enable it,, to function as freely as do the State courts, and the court has been blamed for many faults that were inherent in the act.. In his opinion; many unionists would be glad of the change as they preferred to use the State court rather ^than the Federal. The secretary of the. Western. Australian branch, of -the .Australasian Society of Engineers has expressed ,the views'of his organization in these terms,:. So .far .as we.are concerned, the Federal Arbitration CSourt will die "" unwept, j unhonored and unsung"". Mr S. Faull, secretary of the Western Australian Amalgamated Society of Engineers also said that the repeal of the act would be a blessing to all the unions in the State. Since 1904, the Commonwealth Parliament has been called upon to consider measure after measure to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. All these legislative proposals have had industrial peace as their objective, but I suppose in no country in the world is ployer and employee as in Australia. The very atmosphere of the Arbitration Court is provocative of trouble. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde), when moving the second reading of one of the many bounty bills that have been introduced during this session disclosed, perhaps unwittingly, the methods which were responsible for so much of the dissatisfaction that exists with regard to arbitration court awards. He said the usual practice was for the employees to ask for something more than they anticipated they would get in the way of shorter hours and higher wages, and the employers, acting on the same principle when they approached the court, endeavoured to make out a case for longer hours and lower wages. As a rule the judge gave something to the workers, who then took the view that they owed nothing to the ""boss"" because he had tried to increase their hours of work and reduce their wages. As a result, the men were antagonized by the Arbitration Court proceedings, and determined to give as little as possible in the way of labour output for the wages received. No one can doubt that this attitude is taken by a considerable section of the industrial workers in Australia. We all remember the difficulty which the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) had to meet during the war, because of the persistent trouble^ in the coal-mining industry. Eventually he introduced and passed,the Industrial. Peace Act, under which a special ""tribunal was constituted to deal with disputes in the coal-mining industry. What, has been the result? There has been nothing but chaos and trouble for the people of Australia. <' """"' '",31,Conciliation An D Arbitration Bill Second Reading

The real purpose of . this measure seems to be .'to give absolute , control of industry to the trade unions, and .to place the country under the domination of unionism. every member of the Opposition who has spoken on this bill has said something like this"" The .workers must not expect to get more out of industry.than they put into it , "" Othpr outstanding pronouncements have been "" shorter hours are being sought all the time;"" ""unemployment is world wide;""..

Another honourable member said it was true that, to a great extent, machinery had displaced labour. Another said, "" This bill gives the owners. an open go;. there is no penalty for lockouts."" Of course we know that no lockout has been proved against an owner in this country, so it is just as well to remove a penalty provision that there is no prospect of ever principles of the bill, I propose to return to these pronouncements of honourable members, and discuss them one by one. The primary object of the bill is to make our arbitration law more effective, to promote goodwill in industry, and to .repeal the penal provisions of the 1928 act. One of the objects of the act is, "" The prevention of lockouts and strikes in relation to industrial disputes."" The present measure provides that those words shall be omitted, and its primary object is to be the promotion of goodwill in industry by conciliation and arbitration. In order to achieve this the bill provides I do not propose to delay the for the repeal of those sections prohibiting lockouts and strikes. Under section 18A of the act,'three, judges are required to hear any case' with respect to the increase or decrease of the standard hours in industry.

I now wish to refer to the industrial position in New South Wales and throughout Australia generally, with respect to that chorus of protests heard every day, to the effect, that the 44-hour week is ruining industry in Australia. That is one of those untrue statements made by some politicians and public men, and appearing in the Australian press, which should be refuted,' not only on the floor of this House, but all over Australia. I , therefore, intend to quote some interesting figures to show that a 44-hour week is not ruining industry in Australia as some contend. It has been freely stated in the New South Wales press, particularly in the Sydney. Morning Herald, that the 44-hour week in industry in that State is a huge handicap to employers; so much so that they find it impossible to compete, with Victorian secondary industries. What are the facts? According to the New South Wales Year-Booh, the production per employee in, secondary industries in that State' is higher than in any other State, while Queensland, another State in which the 44-hour week is in operation, comes next. The output per worker in the secondary industries in each State for the year ended 30th June, 1920, the latest figures available, are:-Ne w South Wales, £993; Victoria, £801; Queensland, £979; South Australia, £885; Western Australia, £798; and Tasmania, £667. According to the same publication, 43$ per cent, of the total output of Australian factories is produced in New South Wales. In 1928, there were 8,361 factories in that State, employing 1S2,660 workers-137,93 6 males and 44,724 females-of whom 8,763 were children tories employing more than 100 workers, 83,760 employees were engaged. It is interesting to note that productivity was considerably higher in the larger enterprises. The output per employee for the year ended 30th June, 1928, was as follows :Value of The Government output per employee. Factories employing£ Less than 4 workers .. . . 570 4 workers . . .. . . 722 5 and under 10 789 11 and under 20 . . 878 21 and under 50 .. . . 883 51 and under 100 841 101 and over .. 000 The decrease in the production per employee in factories employing 51 and under 100 workers was due to the fact that highly-developed factories in that division are not numerous. In 1918 the surplus of production, after paying for raw material and wages, was valued at £14',798,599, and in 1928 the amount was £33,986,373, or more than double that in 1918. In ten years, the factory-owners of New South Wales, more than doubled the value of their surplus production, although during that period the 44-hour week became operative. What becomes of these huge surpluses each year? A portion is absorbed in overhead costs, depreciation of plant, government taxes, interest to banks, and some to landlords, as factories are often leased to the occupiers. In 1918, the value added to raw materials in process of manufacture was £244 4s. per worker, and in 1928 it was £393 4!s., or an increase of £149 per worker. That is highly satisfactory when one considers the complaints that have been made concerning a44-hour week and the slowing up in industry. In 1918, the average wages paid to each worker was £126 3s. 7d., and in 1928 it was £215 4s. 9d., or an increase of £S9 Is. 2d. In 1918, the surplus production per worker was £118 Os. 5d., and in 1928, £177 19s. 3d., or an increase of £59 18s. lOd. per worker in 1928 as compared with 1918. Surely that is an answer to those who contend that the introduction of the 44-hour week has had the effect of ruining industry. RecentlyI read of an English coal company-the Powell-Dufferyn Steam-coal Companythe chairman of which, after he had gratified the assembled shareholders by announcing that their trading loss of £36,000 for 1928 had been converted into a trading profit of £307,000 in 1929, made a few remarks concerning the Coal Bill which was then before the British Parliament. He saidI deplore that at this moment, when the coal export trade of this country is in process of recovering so many of its lost markets, recover}' should he jeopardized once more. The shortening of hours must of necessity increase the cost. put in a stronger position at the expense of the British coal trade in the foreign markets. I am not concerned with this particular company or its chairman. His is only one voice in the chorus of insistence that if Australian industry is to hold its own in the markets of the world our wage earners must work longer and harder and consent to wage reductions. I do not wish to argue the economic aspect of this subject with such persons. On the contrary, I am inclined to agree with them that capitalism has nothing else to offer the worker. In the competitive scramble in a capitalistic world, one who asks for a high standard of life and human leisure receives the inhuman leisure of wageless unemployment. The process is surely obvious. There will be no work unless the product of labour can be sold, and. it cannot be disposed of in the markets of the world unless it is as cheap as that on a competitive stall. If orders are to come in for our goods,, and employment is to be secured for Australian workmen, our labour costs must be lowered so that our goods can compete with those on the next stall. That is quite true, and I do not see how a governor. Tully. ment of archangels could obtain any other result from the capitalist method of supplying the world's needs. I would like to point out to those who are constantly harping in this way upon the worthlessness of capitalism that to any worker desiring a full life the matter does not rest there. They seem to think that the chance of drudgery for other men's profit is all the worker wants, and that when they have proved that wage cuts and longer hours are necessary to ensure employment in competition with cheap production elsewhere, the matter is settled in the minds of all sensible people. The simple fact which I put to these orators is that, so far from ending the matter, their demonstration of the need for longer hours and lower wages is the Labour demonstration of the inability of capitalism to serve the needs of human life. The more conclusively they prove their point, the more they strengthen our case that capitalism means the abandonment of any hope of a fine and spacious life for the world's workers. All this takes us down to the foundaOur competitors w ill be tion of things-to the simj)le and elementary truths that are at the core of human purpose and human action. The Labour movement, in its final analysis, does not owe its strength merely to economic calculations; but to the quite simple and elemental perception that, in relation to the now known and available resources of the world, the kind of life to which this capitalistic reasoning would condemn us is not good enough. Why should we, in response to such reasoning, abandon our belief in the possibility of a fine and spacious life ,for the world's workers? We are living in a new worlda world of abundant resources and wonderful powers. The sole purpose of work is to supply the needs -of human life. Until quite recently that had to be done by long drudgery. To-day, with the new powers and new instruments at our disposal, an hour of human labour is as productive in the supply of those needs as a thousand hours of hard toil were only a few generations ago. We are furnished to-day with the knowledge and the implements of possible resplendent abundance for all human life. Living in such a world with such resources we know by the clear instinct of sanity and sequence of things that there must be a lie at the needs. If he did so he would be bankrupt core of any reasoning whatever which inside a month, for he would be proleads to tbe conclusion that spacious living ducing beyond the capacity of his market. is impossible for men in such circuma market unrepresentative of human stances. Whatever may be the process of needs, because the mass of the people are such an argument, whether it be simple stripped of effective purchasing power by or complex, plausible or ridiculous, if it the low standard of living whichthese comes to that conclusion we proceed with capitalist apologists insist upon as a conperfect confidence in the sanity of things dition of keeping their trade going at all. to append to it the old tag, "" which is absurd."", precisely as Euclid appended it to such conclusions as "" the whole is about keeping labour costs down, to less than its part"", or "" things which are answer me one very simple question.

It only produces for a why in the name of all miracles, should market in which the purchasing power of the worker care a hang about it? the mass of the people is at a minimum far below the full satisfaction of their real needs.

We can prothat speech I make the following quotaduce up to the requirements of a scale tion :of life far beyond the dwarfed imagination of a starveling capitalistic world. When, therefore, we are told that in order to find any employment and livelihood at all, we must accept a low standard of life and leisure so as to make our produce cheap in the markets of the world, our reply is that the fact that it is so under Bationalization, like most theories, is best capitalistic conditions of production and judged by results. What is meant by distribution is the final and convincing rationalization ?

We have been told that rationalization will The workman does his penance for the crime tliat hunger drove him to commit, Machinery stole ground beneath his feet, Thrust relentless on the road to want, Rebellion cried within him: Nature demands that all shall live! Nature denies that some must feast while others famish! workers. This is the theory advanced by all advanced employers of labour in Britain, Germany, Poland, France, America, aud, indeed, in every country where there is already a surplus of goods. In the ship-building industry in England the inventor and the new system of costing have succeeded in adding 100 per cent, to the efficiency of the individual. A revolution has thus been effected in this industry compared even with 1914. To-day, a liner is built in less time than it took formerly to build a trawler. Two men to-day are able to place a given steel weight on a ship in less time than 30 men formerly took to do it. New methods have displaced riveters. The hydraulic machine aud the pneumatic gun worked by two apprentices, will crush red-hot rivets into place in a tenth of the time required by the hand hammer; the caulking machine and the acetylene burner have also revolutionized the work of cutting and caulking and cutting the steel plates. But perhaps the greatest revolution of all is in the method of templating. In one afternoon more ternplating is done than was formerly done in three weeks. Professor C. Delisle Burns made the following statement on the 25th January, 1930: In the Clyde engineering and ship-building trades, the same production as in 1914 can now be obtained with only about 60 per cent, of the labour. There was an indication of the new situation when an engine was placed in a ship in one afternoon which it would have taken three weeks and perhaps six times the number of men to place in a ship in 1914. But what does the workman, as an individual, get from his power to increase production? If he is a piece-worker, he is supplied with a machine which allows him to double his output in a working day. In that case if , say, Is. per foot was required to earn 10s. per day by hand, he can now obviously earn 10s. if he only receives 6d. per foot; and so he receives 6d. per foot. The value of his increased production has all gone into the pocket of some one else, and although all economists tell him that he has cheapened the cost of the ships and thus reduced the cost of carrying his food and clothes, he is still unconvinced, for his grocery and clothing bills are actually higher than in the days before he began to reduce the price of ships. But if' the individual Mr Tully. gets nothing as a result of increased production, there is still the hope that the mass may benefit. A study of the tonnage figures will make this clear, and it will also help us to judge the soundness of the contention that cheapness provides additional employment. The way in which this theory actually works out in practice is shown by Mr JohnH ill in the February number of the Boilermakers Society Journal. He saysWe do get the annual output in ships and here we find an increase of work and a diminution of men employed. In 1921 the tonnage of new ships built was about the same as in the year 1929, yet the number of men employed was much less last year than in 1921. The figures a r e Tonnage No. of men built. employed. 1921 1,538,052 229,379 1929 1,500,254 150,938 From these figures it will be noted that with an increased output last year of over 22,000 tons we had 72,000 less men employed. Our output per man is increasing year by year and as a consequence every one is being squeezed out except the strongest and most efficient. In 1921 the registered number of men in the ship-building and ship-repairing industry was 358,278. In 1929 the number had dropped to 204,013. Thus, in the last eight years 154,337 men in this one industry have died or have been eliminated by rationalization. A t this rate in another ten years we shall be able to further increase our output without human labour. This is a bit of the rationalization which we are told is going to solve the problem of unemployment. And so one could go on, and point out that in other industries such as the cotton, the woollen, and the engineering industries, the same thing is happening. The lesson to be learned is that, so long as capitalism exists, rationalization means a further degradation of the worker in industry. While thousands of men in Great Britain are going about poorly clad, the consumption of woollen goods has dropped 40 per cent., as compared with, the -pre-war consumption. In its annual review of 1928, the Times Trade Supplement statedBusiness in wool textiles on home accounts apart from foreign goods imported, was unsatisfactory because of the limited purchasing power of the people. The only remedy suggested by employers is more rationalization, or le3S purchasing power. On every hand we hear the cry"" The worker must not expect more from industry than he puts into it.'* What has been the effect of rationalization in. the iron and steel industry? The experience of the workers in that industry shows the necessity for aproperly established Arbitration Court in .order that Australian workmen may receive fair treatment. In 1920 each, man employed in the pig-iron industry in England produced 199 tons of metal. By 192S the per capita production had increased to 298 tons. In 1920, 40,250 men were employed in this branch of the ""engineering industry, but that number had dwindled to 22,160 by 1928. In other words, over 20,000 men who formerly found employment in the iron and steel industry produced so much steel that nobody needs them any longer, and now they are enjoying England's incomparable system of social services--the y are receiving the dole. Now let us see how the increased output has improved the workers' wages. Again let me repeat the parrot cry""Workers must not expect more from an industry than they putinto it."" That has' been said so often in' this House that by this .time it must be true! see what the steel-worker receives and has received. Mr John Baker, a member of the House of Commons, stated recently that every steel-worker to-day is 20,000 per cent, more efficient than' was the steelworker of 1873. Mr Baker said"" In 1873, in all probability the average wage for blast furnace men would be between 25s. to 30s. a week. An elaborate return for South Wales for 1923 give's an average of about £2 19s. per week, and in 1929 about £3. In a period in which the efficiency of men had orable member made a suggestion that increased over 20,000 per cent., the wages had only doubled."" This wage of £3 per week is a terrible commentary on our whole social system, and our hopelessly wrong ideas of social value. The steel-worker who is engaged on heavy, arduous, and skilled work, which keeps him in a bath of sweat for long hours each day, receives only £3 per week. To-day the British worker is told that he is poor because the capacity of the average French furnace is 30 per cent, greater than that of the British furnace; that Belgium's average furnace capacity is 37 per cent, greater; Germany's 129 per cent, greater; and that of the United States of America 276 per cent, greater. Great Britain's problem now is' how to make her men more efficient than the American.. Obviously, it would be useless to increase his efficiency the bare 276 per cent.""; it must be brought, to at least one point higher than the American or he would be no further forward. How many years .it would, take to obtain that result, nobody has yet attempted to estimate, even assuming that America stood and waited until Britain caught, her up. The passing of this legislation will do much to promote peace in industry. It will, at least, give .the workers an opportunity to obtain decent conditions in their employment. I congratulate the Government on having brought the bill forward, and shall give it my support. Sitting suspended from 6.7 to 8 p.m. While many honourable members on the Government side have shown evidence of a detailed knowledge of trade union matters and arbitration, law as it affects trade unions, there has been little or no attempt on their part to examine closely the proLet us posals submitted and to convince honourable members. of the 'Opposition that the amendments proposed in this bill for amending the Conciliation and Arbitration Act are justifiable or in the best interests of Australia. It is true that the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley) put forward a constructive proposal which apparently was given some attention by the Attorney-General( Mr Brennan). [Quorum formed ] The honthe best kind ' of arbitration tribunal would be one comprising a judge, a representative of the employers and a representative of the employees. I was particularly interested in the suggestion because it appeared to me to be a means of making the Federal Arbitration Court in its make-up and in its working, approach more closely the wages board system than has hitherto been attempted. I hold strongly the view that the State wages board system, as operating in Victoria, is a much sounder method of determining industrial conditions than is possible under the federal system, so long as the latter is confined in the constitutional strait-jacket in which it finds itself to-day. AndI do not believe the",36,Conciliation An D Arbitration Bill Second Reading
162,Mr Paterson (Gippsland) [8.0],"people of Australia are prepared to increase the powers of the Commonwealth in respect to industrial matters; at any rate it does not look as if the Government thinks the people will do so, if one is to judge by the indefinite postponement of the referendum proposals. Whatever chance there might have been to obtain from the people greater powers in industrial matters, that chance has been greatly lessened by the introduction of a bill so obviously biased as this. I think il is a fair assumption that the shackles will remain on our constitutional authority with regard to industrial affairs. orable member will devote some part of his speech to proving his statement, which has been repeated, about bias; I submit that he should prove it, if it is capable of proof. bufore I have finished the Attorney General will have realized the truth of my charge that the bill is biased. The shackles which have been imposed by the Constitution upon federal powers in connection with industry are likely to remain, and as a result the Federal Arbitration Court, even though the legislation under which it functions is amended in various -ways,. will be unable to do many things which wages boards may readily do. system simply because it is a federal syssides of the House know of the enormous tem; neither do I extol the Victorian State wages board system simply because it is a State system. I am not what is known as a great States-righter, but I take up this attitude because the State wages boards have behind them a complete charter of powers which enables them to do their job completely, whereas the federal arbitration system has a most incomplete charter under which it cannot deal satisfactorily with all the troubles that arise in industrial matters. I want to contrast tbe two systems. A State Wages Roard is in a position to make a common rule; it can lay down the wage to be paid to all plumbers, bricklayers, carpenters and so forth in the State'; whereas it is generally recogtured articles, instead of having to connized that the Federal Arbitration Court .is only 'able to make its awards apply to those individuals, unions, or employers who have been cited before it. Sometimes, in one town, three factories engaged in the same class of manufacture may be working, one under an arbitration award, another under a variation of that award to which the first is not subject, and a third, which has started business after the award and variation have been made, subject to neither. One can readily imagine a great deal of dissatisfaction being caused when a position of that kind arises. It cannot arise under awards laid down by State Wages Boards. These boards can operate without the necessity for a dispute, whether it be real or manufactured, whereas the Federal Arbitration Court can only operate when a dispute has occurred, either a bona fide dispute in the ordinary acceptance of the term, or a paper dispute manufactured for the purpose of getting access to the. court, aud it must have occurred in more than one State. Through the machinery of State Wages Boards an award can be obtained at very much less expense or delay than is possible when the federal machinery is invoked. Under the State wages board system fair conditions can be secured without all the waste of time, energy, and money involved in an endeavour to secure an award from the Federal Arbitration I do not condemn the federal Court. Honourable members on both sums of money that have to be expended by trade unions in an endeavour to secure certain awards, or sometimes by employers in an endeavour to resist the efforts of the unions to obtain those awards. No one will gainsay that satisfactory conditions of labour' can be obtained with the simple State machinery of wages boards without involving a tremendous loss of time and expense. If all the time, talent, money, and energy which are to-day devoted to fighting for and resisting attempts to. obtain awards in the federal sphere were devoted to bringing about greater production in the industries themselves, this country would soon lead the world, and be an exporter of manufacfine its production of them to the limited and sheltered market of Australia -",41,Conciliation An D Arbitration Bill Second Reading
163,Mr Bkenkan,I hope that the hon,42,Conciliation An D Arbitration Bill Second Reading
164,Mr Paterson,"I hope that longber submit that this bill could be amended in the way he is suggesting? sible to amend it in that direction without alterations of the Constitution, and I do not think those alterations will be granted by the people. I am simply using this as an argument to show honourable members that the State wages board system is preferable; that it is sounder than the federal arbitration system, working as the latter does made up of an equal number of repreunder constitutional shackles. To my mind, the most important difference between the State wage3 board system and the Commonwealth Arbitration Court is that, under the former, there is an impartial chairman Avith representatives of employers on one side of the table arid an equal number of representatives of employees on the other side. The representatives of the employers and those of the employees deal with each other. The representatives of the employers are able to realize the grievances of the men, and the latter can be made to see that the employers have their difficulties. The impartial chairman has a casting vote if the position should reach a deadlock. ciliation Commissioners should have that power. always the suspicion, particularly in a measure couched like this one, that the persona appointed as conciliation commissioners may be men who, with the best intentions in the world, have been brought penalties for strikes and lockouts. There up in an atmosphere which sees only one side of a case. Under the State wages board system the employers and employees can deal directly with each other, whereas under the federal system they arc compelled to go into opposing camps and deal, not with each other, but with a third party, a judge, a gentleman of high standing, trained in the law, but in many cases, ignorant of much of the technique of the industry in connection with which he is asked to make an award. The result is that awards are sometimes brought down which are difficult for either the employer or the employee. There may be in them harassing conditions to the employer or to the employee. One illustration of vthat which comes to my mind is the condition which was laid down in connection with pick-ups in a recent dispute. No doubt that was a condition which was irritating to the employee. I can hardly recall an instance of a strike occurring in connection with a wages board determination, due, I think, to the fact that every such determination is arrived at by men who understand all there is to know about the technicalities of the industry concerned. Any body sentatives of employers and employees must come to a decision which is reasonable, practicable and workable. Many attempts have been made to improve our arbitration system. The first step taken was to ask the people for additional powers. That has been done on no less than four occasions, and on no less than four occasions the people have said ""No"". Yet without the power which is necessary to make a federal arbitration system simple and successful we cling to adiscredited system, and again and again have attempted, by amending the legislation within our narrow constitutional limits, to attain the unattainable. The most notable attempt to amend, in a comprehensive manner, our arbitration legislation, was that which was made in 1928. On that occasion we approached very closely the highwater mark of constructive amending legislation in this field. The only mistake we made on that occasion was by retainingI stress the word ""retaining"" and do not use the word ""imposing""are, no doubt, good theoretical reasons why these penalties should be retained. Some years ago Mr Justice Isaacs said-""If parties are compelled by law to resort to law, it necessarily connotes that they cannot lawfully resort to force."" No one disputes the logic and theoretical soundness of that dictum, but mauy of us have been forced to the conclusion that penalties in connection with strikes and lockouts are absolutely futile. It is impossible to make men work by imposing penalties on them It is equally impossible to compel employers to open their factories or mines by imposing penalties on them. In my opinion, therefore, the bill of 192S",42,Conciliation An D Arbitration Bill Second Reading

168,Mr Paterson,"Yes, but there iswould have been improved hy the deletion of the penalties in connection with strikes and lockouts. I want to make it abundantly clear that what I say with regard to penalties applies only to penalties dealnot necessarily make a man the best that ing with strikes and lockouts. does not embrace the deletion of some of the penalties that have been withdrawn in a later part of the bill, when they should have been left in the act. Had the present Government confined itself to amending the 1928 bill by merely deleting the penalties with regard to strikes and lockouts I should have baid that the highwater mark of constructive legislation had been reached in this bill. But one does not need to go very far through the measure to realize that that high level is rapidly falling. that if the. bill as it stands to-day is passed into law we shall soon reach the lowest level of arbitration legislation yet seen in this country. I propose briefly to review the principal amendments, a procedure that very few honourable members of the Government side have troubled to follow. I agree with the amendment that involves the withdrawal of the penalties in lockouts. But I concur with what was said by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr granted to the former commissioner, but Latham) that it would be wise if these penalties still applied to what may be regarded as essential industries, so that those engaged in . them may not be encouraged to hold the community to ransom owing to the absence of the penalties. The second point that I desire to'make is that the conciliation commissioners under this bill are to have extraordinarily wide powers, powers very little inferior to those of the judges themselves. Special qualifications apparently are not regarded as necessary; yet these gentlemen are to fill the role of conciliation conv missioners, a position requiring the strictest impartiality. pointed an arbitration judge, a. man must have very definite tions. He must have been a barrister or a solicitor of the High Court of the Com^ monwealth, or a State Supreme Court for at least five years. So that he must be a man of some standing. Mr Paterson. appointment is of a 'permanent nature, which makes him more or less indepcivdent of criticism. While I am quite willing to admit that a legal training does It can be obtained to deal with purely industrial matters, it at least enables him to realize that there are two sides to every question. A man trained in the legal world realizes that evidence must be called from both parties, and that there are two sides to every question. Contrast that with the position of these commissioners. They are not required to have any special qualifications, at any rate substantial qualifications that can be written dowii in black and white, but I realize that any government that wished .to make the bill I believe workable would endeavour ,to appoint commissioners who had. alt least some qualification, even though those qualifications could not be reduced to writing, as in the case of arbitration court judges. The appointment of the commission<-TS may be for a limited period. I know that it will be .said by the Attorney-General( Mr Brennan) that that has been the practice in the past; that the former conI have already stated that ciliation commissioner wasappointed for a limited period.. It is safe enough to do that kind of thing connection with strikes. and when a commissioner is entrusted with limited powers such -. as were : it is entirely a different matter when, the status'of the commissioner is to be raised practically to the level of that of the arbitration judges. In one respect; the commissioners, and indeed, the judgesj too, are to have considerably greater powers than were formerly exercised by the judges alone. I refer t'o the. amend; merit to section 3S of the' principal a<i ; by the addition of new paragraph oa giving the judges and conciliation commissioners alike power to "" set aside an award or any of the terms of an award."" It appears to me that a provision of that nature will mean that finality will very rarely be reached. Awards will be moirf To be apor less always in a state of flux, a condition dear to some official hearts, but a qualificavery bad thing for industry. Another thing that I desire to emphasize in connection with the appointment of these commissioners is that : i Again, his conciliation commissioner may, under the powers granted to him by this bill, do what it will take three judges to undo, or undo something that it has taken three judges to do. A commissioner may reduce hours, but it takes three judge.? to increase them. Also a commissioner may, on his own initiative, increase wages; but it takes three judges to reduce them. Formerly there was impartiality legislation-a n honest attempt to treat both sides alike and to put the position of the employer and employee on exactly the same footing with regard to penalties and everything else mentioned in the act. factory state of affairs has disappeared. The bill is now heavily loaded against the employer. That is one of the arguments that I advance to the Attorney General in support of my contention that the measure shows a definite bias. A commissioner 'may do many things. One can speculate as to how his powers are going to be used. Take, for example, section 40 of the principal act, which is amended by clause 31 of the bill. readsTim court, by its award, or by order made on the application of any party to the proceedings before it, . . . may(6,1 direct that us between members of organizations of employers or employees and other persons offering or it could. desiring service or employment at the same' time, preference shall be given to such members, other things being equal; It is proposed to delete the words "" other things being equal"". That may result in a judge or a conciliation commissioner awarding absolute preference to unionists, regardless of their capacity or incapacity. To give a concrete illustration, we will assume that a pastoralist wished to have his sheep shorn and Avas engaging men to do the work. Along came a unionist able to shear 80 to 90 sheep a day and a non-unionist, a capable man able to machine shear 200 sheep a day. The pastoralist had this protection, that even if the judge had awarded absolute preference in the industry the four words "" other things being equal "" afforded him a safeguard aud enabled him, if unable to obtain efficient union labour, to employ efficient non-union labour in its stead. That protection is taken away by the deletion of those four words, and it may mean that absolute preference has to be granted, regardless of capacity or incapacity. Under this clause a zealous conciliation commissioner might compel absolute preference to unionists, whether capable men were available or not. It puts a tremendous power in the hands of a magnificent ambitious secretaries if a man's about our industrial only chance of obtaining a job is through the medium of a union secretary. I wish to say at this stage that I believe that union secretaries are no worse than any other people. That may be of some satisfaction to the honThat satisorable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane) who valiantly fought for the trade union secretary, his integrity and so forth. But I think that even the honourable member for Bendigo will admit that among union secretaries there are men who would not scruple to profit by the absolute dependence of their members upon them to provide employment. Again-and I put this question to the Attorney-General in the hope that it will elicit a reply from him, It perhaps at a later stage-coul d not this power to grant absolute preference to trade unionists by the exclusion of those four words be used as a backstairs method of defeating preference to returned soldiers ? question. Another very bad and inexcusable feature of the bill is what is, in my opinion, the craven acceptance of the decree of officialdom that the secret ballot must go. Wrap that up as you will in all the sugar coating of ingenious sophistry"", yet the plain fact cannot be concealed that this will take away the undoubted right of the trade unionist to claim a fair share in the control of his union without a possibility of victimization. I know that honourable members opposite will say that trade union rules to-day provide for secret ballots to be taken, that secret ballots are taken, and so forth. Buti t must be admitted that there are occasions when a man, if he were to ask for a secret ballot to be taken, would subject himself to victimization. It is because of that that the Bruce-Page Government included in the 1928 amendment of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act the provision relating to secret ballots.",43,Conciliation An D Arbitration Bill Second Reading

By another provision of the bill the Arbitration Court is to supersede the High Court in respect of some functions which the latter tribunal has exercized in the past; the Arbitration Court is to decide for itself whether a dispute is interstate, whereas hitherto that matter has been decided for it by the High Court. One of the most amazing proposals in the bill, particularly at a time of great economic depression and unparalleled amendment deleting the words which require the judge, when making an award, to take into consideration its probable economic effect. Australia is already suffering because too little attention has been given to economic facts; but, apparently, still less attention is to be given to them if the judges are to interpret the amendment as a deliberate instruction to them. The honourable member for Bendigo endeavoured to justify course by saying that the omission of the instruction would make no difference; that arbitration judges had always paid some regard to economic facts, and under this bill the arbitration judge or conciliation commissioners would continue to do so; therefore, a definite instruction was not needed. Had the honourable member been in this House when the amending bill was under discussion in 192S, that argument might very well have been employed by him as a valid reason why, in his opinion, an instruction to judges was not necessary, but it is useless as an argument in favour of the deletion of that instruction. The judges and conciliation commissioners will ask why this provision has been taken out, and they will naturally conclude that it is a deliberate instruction to them to ignore entirely the possible economic effects of their awards. Australia is suffering from arrested ""Why? In the sphere of rural development, particularly pastoral and agricultural, great improvements are left undone because the cost of doing them is more than they are worth. Neither the Mr Paterson. primary nor the secondary industries are expanding as they should because we are attempting to ignore the competition of the world.

In this way we shall never find employment for our people or develop our country. mis-statement! -Order! I ask the Attorney-General to withdraw the words "" wilful mis-statement."" mis-statement! recklessly; I am weighing my words, and I repeat that the removal of these words from the act can bear noother reasonable interpretation than that it is a deliberate instruction to the judges and the commissioners that they may disregard economic facts. this stupid mis-statements! sound deduction from the facts. Despite the sufferings of the unemployed, the Government still clings tenaciously to the old dictum that if an industry cannot afford an impossible standard of working conditions the wiser course is to close it down. ""We shall not increase the avenues of employment in that way. I believe in the highest wages that an industry can bear. But we cannot take more out of a pot than is put into it, and the industrial and financial condition of the country will not be improved if judges and commissioners, acting on the instruction of the Government, deliver awards that disregard economic facts.

I hope that the Government will, even now, put those words back into the bill, otherwise it will be impossible to place on its purpose any interpretation other than the one which I have given to-night. If the bill is passed in its present form it will for its action, and when finally there was aggravate the problem of -unemployment and augment the number of unemployed. In conclusion, I wish to say that apart „ from one amendment which I mentioned earlier in my remarks, namely, the amendment repealing the penalties in regard to strikes and lockouts, I regard this measure as a retrograde .step in legislation. I consider some of its provisions as so dangerous and so biased that, instead of promoting peace in industry, it may work great havoc, and possibly even destroy the system it was designed to further develop. There is little or nothing in the bill to justify its title or its claim to promote goodwill in industry. Unless it is drastically amended, I shall certainly oppose it. as a biased, mischiefmaking measure, unfair to trade unionists and employer alike, and introduced almost solely in the interest of trade union officials. ing in support of this bill, I wish to emphasize that I shall not attempt to discuss it from a legal standpoint, or from the point of view of a trade union official, hut from the standpoint of a man who has worked'in industry for the whole of his life, and is familiar with the effect of the Arbitration Court awards upon the rank and file. Conversant as I am with the industrial life of the Commonwealth, it is amusing to me to listen to the yes-no utterances of honourable members opposite and to contrast what they are saying now, in criticism of this bill, with their remarks only a few months ago when they supported a government that did its utmost -to kill all attempts at con ciliation and arbitration by endeavouring to pass the iniquitous Maritime Industries BiU, which wrecked the Government. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson), the Leader of the. Opposition ( Mr Latham), and one or two other honourable members opposite, say now that they are in accord with the wish of the Attorney-General( Mr Brennan) to delete certain penal provisions from the act. Why did not they take this stand when the Labour party was protesting against the attempt of the Bruce-Page Government to penalize a large number of men and women engaged in industry? Instead, they applauded the Government an appeal to the people, the election was fought on this issue. The electors returned the Labour party to power, and this. Government, in furtherance of its declared industrial policy, has introduced this measure to amend the Conciliation 1 and Arbitration Act with the object of ensuring to employees improved conditions to which they are fully entitled. The honourable member for Gippsland a few moments ago made a point of a judge of the Arbitration Court, in > making an award, having to pay due regard to . its economic effect. I have no wish to make an attack upon any individual judge of the Arbitration Court, nor is it my desire to speak disrespectfully, of the judiciary.; but I direct the attention of the honourable member for Gippsland, and the attention of other honourable members, to the fact that not long ago one of the judges of the Arbitration Court made one of the most vicious, cruel, and cowardly awards ever delivered in this country. I refer to the award relating to timber workers made last year. your attention to the fact that the honourable member for Lang has just said that a judge of the Arbitration Court delivered a vicious, cruel, and cowardly award. I submit that that is not in order. If the honourable member for Lang used those words they were decidedly disorderly.

I ask him not to make any reflection on any member of the judiciary. orable member for Lang withdraws his statement. Speaker. I contend, however, that I am in order in referring to the effect of an award upon the industries of this country, and I mention particularly the timber-workers' award, which was responsible for a reduction in wages from 4s. to 26s. a week per individual, and an increase of four hours in the working week. believe that this is the way to bring about peace in industry, then this Government and its supporters want none of it. The bill provides for the appointment of conciliation commissioners, who by reason of their knowledge of conditions in a particular industry will be competent to deal with any disputo that may arise. In this way it should be possible to ensure some measure of industrial peace. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) emphasized the fact that it was proposed to delete from the act the words requiring Arbitration Court judges to pay due regard to the economic effect of all awards upon industries. To show that this is not worth a second thought I direct the attention of honourable members to certain information contained in the Commonwealth Year-Booh relating to the secondary industries of Australia for the years 1925-26 and 1926-27. In 1925-26 the total value of the output of the manufacturing industries in Australia was £400,342,392; the wages paid to employees in those industries amounted to £S6,724,683, leaving a balance of £313,617,103 to be received by someone, and the average wage paid to each individual was £227 10s. In 1927-28 the total value of the output was £416,994,009; the salaries and wages paid amounted to £91,365,319, leaving a balance of £325,628,690 and the average wage paid per employee was £205 10s. Thus it will be seen that during these two periods wealth production increased by £16,651,616, and the wages paid during the same period increased by only £4,640,636; but it must be borne in mind that the actual individual wage paid per annum showed a decrease from £227 10s. to £205 10s. It has to be remembered also that of the total number of employees engaged 22,565 were children of both sexes, so the need for protective legislation is contrary opinion. opposite have suggested there is no need for our arbitration system and no need for governmental control in industrial matters. I need onlj If honourable members opposite remind them of the situation in the early '90's. when the law of supply and demand was operative. Being then without the protection now afforded by our Conciliation and Arbitration Act the workers were forced to accept practically anything that would never l if t them above the breadline. It is true that we have at present a. huge army of unemployed in Australia, but the same conditions obtain in practically all civilized countries, so it cannot be urged that the Commonwealth Labour Government or our system of arbitration is responsible for Australia's present economic and financial difficulties. Other factors have to be taken into account. No one suggests that we shall be able to check the evoliu tionary march of science, and the application of scientific methods to production. At the present time machinery is coming in at the front door and man-power is going out at the back, and, unfortunately, there is no redress for workers who are supplanted in any particular industry. I am a practical boilermaker, only two years removed from the industry. When I followed that avocation, two boilermakers, a labourer, and a rivet boy were required to rivet the end in a boiler.

It follows therefore that a considerable number of men in that industry are today unemployed. They reap no benefit from the application of scientific methods to production. Practically all men engaged in that particular occupation are suffering from the reactionary effects of scientific machinery, being affected with nerves or deafness. No one can deny that one of the results of the application of scientific methods to production is the need for a universal shorter working week in all secondary industries, and it should State awards that overlap.

Let us come together in a conciliatory spirit and see if it is not possible to reach a common understanding about our economic problems. If we cannot agree, then let us agree to differ. Let us cease vilifying one another and making all sorts of innuendoes concerning men who spend their lives working in the industries of the country. Any man who belittles the attempt by this Government to give some measure of protection to employees through an amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act has little or no understanding on the subject. The honourable member for Gippslund State wages boards, but with great respect I must differ from the conclusions he drew. I have no quarrel with Gippsland, and apart from his politics, I regard him as a friend. I recognize that he holds views of his own, just as I do myself. I cannot agree with him that conditions are any better under State wages boards than under the Pederal Arbitration Court. I have been unable to learn of any State which is free from industrial discontent. The conditions of the workers under wages boards are not better than under the Arbitration Court; in fact, in wages board States they are worse. The honourable member for Gippsland said that with the Federal Arbitra[114] tion Court in existence there was interlocking and overlapping of awards. I agree with him, but point out that that constitutes one of the soundest arguments in favour of the abolition of State industrial courts in favour of a Federal court with jurisdiction from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. tion Court would have a separate sphere of influence, and there would be no overlapping if the Federal Arbitration Court were abolished. claimed that they overlap now? State awards do not overlap each other. as a reason for getting rid of the State courts. Under the present system there is a 48-hour week in some States, and a 44-hour week in others. If industry is to progress on a sound basis in all parts of the Commonwealth, it should be governed by uniform legislation. As things now are the industrial courts of the different States are pulling against one another. Members of the Opposition pray that the Federal Arbitration Court will never be in complete judicial control of industrial affairs throughout the whole of Australia, because when that day comes the workers will be able to apply to the court with the confident expectation of getting a fair deal, something which honourable members opposite would like very much to deny them. unionists support the referendum at which it was sought to obtain increased industrial powers for the Commonthe honourable member for wealth ? The workers refused to place in the hands of three High Court judges absolute power to control industry in Australia. at the table supported it . unionists of the country did not support the referendum, and I have given a truthful reply.

217,Mr Long,"I was asked why theThe time has arrived when something must be done to substitute beneficial industrial legislation for a system which has led only to costly litigation. The trade unions have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds fighting for awards, and there is still discontent in the ranks of the workers, and rightly so. They are discontented, not with the principle of arbitration, but with the manner in which it has been applied during the last few years. I received a letter from the Tramways Union a few days ago pointing out-and I hope the Attorney-General will listen to this-that they have had an application before the court for over twelve months, and have been unable to get it heard, while the Chief Railway Commissioner of New South Wales, within one month of the lodging of his application, had his case dealt with, and the working week for the tramway men increased from 44 to 48 hours. Under a rationing system recently introduced, the members of my own organization are losing 26s. a week, but although they have lodged an application with the court they have not been able to get a hearing. These things are very naturally causing discontent. One of the great benefits which will follow from the appointment of conciliation commissioners will be the more expeditious despatch of business. I do not expect that this bill will result in the workers getting everything they are entitled to, but it will, at any rate, remove many of the anomalies from which they are suffering to-day. The honourable member for Gippsland referred to the proposed deletion of that section in the present act providing that any ten members of an organization may apply to the court for an order requiring that a secret ballot of members be taken. He mentioned the word ""democracy"", and said that this was a democratic country. fore I read the bill. cracy is majority rule, and if the honorleigh workshops during the 1917 strike, able member for Gippsland is a democrat, how can he justify giving ten members of an organization the right to involve their entire organization in the holding of a costly ballot? Why should any ten members of an organization be given the rig! t to upset the amicable working of their union? cannot be taken unless the judge agrees. Australia has embodied in its constitution a provision empowering members to demand the taking of a secret ballot. What the trade unions object to is outsiders coming in and interfering with their domestic arrangements. The policies of trade unions are directed by majorities. cisions were arrived at by secret ballot. will keep harping on that. Let me emphasize this point. Nothing can be done at a trade union meeting without the holding of a secret ballot if the members demand one. The officers of the union cannot deny members this right. are afraid to insist on it. in quite a number of industrial upheavals. member ever yet had a vote? intelligently.

Reference has been made to one trade union which has objected to the deletion of the section referring to the holding of secret ballots. There are 149 unions registered with the Federal Arbitration Court, and it is cerbetainly significant that out of that number only one has been found to support the retention of this section. I was at Evewhen this union came into being.

Some honourable members opposite always refer to the war as if they alone ever did anything to win it, when, as a matter of fact, there are honourable members on this side of the House who did just as much, and perhaps more, but who do not say anything about it. Earlier in my speech you checked me, Mr Speaker, when I was referring to members of the judiciary. I may be permitted, however, to say something of the salaries which are paid to judges of the Federal Arbitration Court. The workers all over Australia are being asked at the present time to make sacrifices by accepting less pay and working longer hours, but one judge of the Arbitration Court receives £3,000 a year, and two others £2,500 a year each, besides being entitled to retiring allowances after a certain period of service. The workers are asking, not without reason, why the judges are not required to make some sacrifice when they themselves are made to feel the economic pinch so keenly. I am aware that there is nothing in this bill providing for a reduction of judges' salaries, but the matter seems to me to be worthy of attention. judges made a sacrifice when they relinquished, their practices to serve on the Bench. the professional fees which they received when practising their profession totalled in one year more than they now receive as judges. I do not think for a moment that in accepting their present positions they ma.de any sacrifice. With all respect retard its progress but support the to these judges I may repeat what wa3 said previously-the y may be qualified but not competent to deal with industrial conditions. Whatever they are receiving does not alter the fact that at present they have to keep in view the economic effect of awards upon industry. It would be interesting to know to what extent economic conditions were considered when their salaries were fixed. The only time when the economic effect of an award upon industry is taken into consideration was is when the wages of men and women engaged in industry are concerned. It is time we had progressive industrial legislation, embodying more conciliation in the settlement of our industrial problems. I do not quarrel with those who are endeavouring to get a fair return for what they may be doing in developing the industries of this country. During this debate unwarranted attacks have been made upon trade union officials. Any one would think from the remarks of some honourable members opposite that they are persons to be feared, but they know that the statements they have made are not in accordance with facts. They should remember that such persons are the paid officials of the rank and file. rank and file keep reminding them of the fact? member for Warringah was the secretary of a political organization I suppose he was frequently reminded of his duty to those who paid him his salary. not need to do so.

Debate (on motion PAGE) adjourned. for Home Affairs) [9.22] I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 10.13-1021, the following proposed work, wbich was referred to and reported upon by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, be proceeded with, namely: The proposed erection of 30 cottages on section yet ready to call for tenders for the other 0, Griffith. With the object of providing houses at low rentals in Canberra, the Government referred to the Public Works Committee the question of constructing groups of cottages. That committee has investigated and reported upon the erection of 30 semi-detached cottages at Manuka. The estimates provide for the building of 5-roomed cottages which should be made available at from 30s. to 33s. per week. Provision has also been made for the erection of four buildings, each containing three flats, which it is anticipated will be let at 25s. a week each. The estimated cost of the semi-detached buildings is £1,800; but when allowance is made for the erection of fences, construction of footpaths, provision of plantations and overhead charges, the cost will be approximately £1,985. that figure? 33s. a week for a semi-detached house, and 25s. a week for a flat will include the rental of the land. each pair of cottages? £1,800 mentioned, the cost of fencing, footpaths, plantations and overhead expenses must be added, which brings the amount to approximately £1,985. In the course of a few months it is expected that 305 or 106 officers of the .Patents and Copyrights Department will be transferred to Canberra. called for these cottages? that phase of the question shortly. At present, a number of men receiving the basic wage or a little more are occupying cottages costing £2, £2 5s., and £2 10s. ber of such persons will leave the higherpriced houses and occupy those which it is now proposed to erect and make available at lower rentals. There are also a number of persons occupying other cottages in the various areas who desire to rent houses of a better type, and it is thought that those to be constructed will meet the demand. It is proposed that the first group of eight pairs shall be built by day labour. The Government is not groups, and it is desired that an early start should be made upon levelling the land on which they are to be built and also on the work of actual construction which would be delayed if the work were simultaneously carried out by day labour and under the contract system. One of the urgent needs of Canberra is the provision of cottages at low rentals for workers and their families.. Every £25 increase in the estimated cost will mean an additional Is. a week or £2 12s. a year in rent. In these circumstances, it will be recognized that every care will be exercised to have the cottages constructed at the lowest possible price in order to bring about a reduction of rentals. Mr Murdoch, the late Director-General of Works, who also occupied the position of Second Commissioner on the Federal Capital Commission, is designing a cottage which it is anticipated will provide four rooms and a kitchen at a rental of 25s. a week.

I commend the motion to the House, and trust that it will be carried. orable members who have read the report of the Public ""Works Committee will acknowledge that they have rendered a useful service in investigating the proposal for the erection of cottages at Canberra. I am inclined to think that the Minister has not been quite candid with the House in stating that it is proposed to commence by building eight pairs of cottages on the day-labour system. Honourable members should realize that if this motion is carried the Minister will have complete authority to build all the 36 cottages by day labour. member will accept my assurance that tenders will be called as soon as the necessary plans and specifications have been prepared. ter's assurance; but I did not understand him to say that that is what is proposed. I wish to emphasize the importance of carrying out the recommendations of the Public Works Committee, particularly when we realize the disabilities experienced by many public servants in having to pay high rentals for their homes. ""We know perfectly well that these high rents are being charged because of the high cost of construction. Probably all honourable members have not read the report, and do not realize that the price of bricks is principally responsible for the high cost of building at Canberra. £4 16s. a 1,000 for the bricks for these cottages. orable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) is a member of the Public Works Committee and knows the facts in connection with the Canberra Brick Works. page 6 of its report on the proposal to erect these cottages the committee saysOne of the contributing factors to the high present in having to pay large sums of cost of building in Canberra is the price charged for bricks. It is generally admitted money in cost of living allowances to that the Canberra brick is a very fine, highpublic servants because of the high cost class brick, but, owing to the shale from which it is manufactured containing a' large percentage of lime, the material must be carefully picked over, and what is called the ""wet plastic process"" of manufacture adopted which demands more coal in the burning, and is consequently more costly than the ""dry press process"" usually followed in Sydney and elsewhere where the raw material is suitable. Two or three other paragraphs in the report contain a wealth of information which accounts, to some extent at least, for the high cost of construction in Canberra. In this connection I quote the following:Labour at the brick works is said to be 17 per cent, higher than in Sydney, and the cost of cartage from the brick works is also high, being lis . por thousand per mile for the first mile and Is. 3d. per thousand por half-mile thereafter. It was stated in evidence that the cost of preliminary investigations and experiments before the"" brick works were established has been added to the capital cost of the plant which has a ledger value of £85,000. It is represented that this contributes to the higher cost of bricks, which, if the capital cost were to be written down to £55,000, which is stated to be a fair present-day valuation, the cost of production with the plant in full operation could be reduced by approximately 3s. Od. per thousand. The report goes on to say that the bricks for this work will be supplied at £4 16s. a 1,000, although the actual cost of them to the Commission is £5 5s. 7d. per 1,000. produced at the kilns cost £10 Is. lOd. a I , 0 0 0 .

I lay particular stress upon the wisdom of calling for tenders for the erection of some of these cottages, because bricks can be supplied from Sydney at £2 18s. 6d. per 1,000 plus freight, &c. It appears to me that sooner or lator the Government will have to face the high On cost of building construction and also the high cost of land in Canberra, for it is at a considerable disadvantage at",54,Pederal Capita L Territory Erection Op Cottages

According to the report the land upon which these cottages will be built will represent about £150 for each of the blocks for the two-storied semi-detached houses. I cannot for the ii of rae see why it is necessary to intain these fictitious values. realize that interest and redemption costs must be paid on the many miles of expensive roads, sewerage and lighting; but these modern conveniences were provided from the national rather than the civic necessity, and other provision should be made to share the cost. From a statement in the press I was led to believe that the Government proposed to proceed with the whole of this work by day labour, but the Minister's speech this evening has disarmed me to some extent. I emphasize, however, that day labour in Canberra has been expensive. This policy is discredited throughout the Commonwealth. It is somewhat surprising to find that, although Labour governments usually .stand for the. day labour policy in the expenditure of public moneys, the Ministers of those governments do not adopt it in their own private undertakings. more expensive than day labour. the Ipswich and Brisbane Trades Halls wanted to make alterations to their buildings they called for tenders for the work. It was not done by day labour. trades hall in Perth. believe the contract system to be less costly. That is easily understandable, for even when we were boys we used to hear about "" the government stroke."" The trouble with the day-labour system is that there is associated with it a lack of proper supervision. In the circumstances, I do not propose to labour this question, but I feel strongly that the Government should not proceed with any of these cottages by day labour, but should, at the earliest possible moment, call for tenders for the work. If it does so, I am satisfied that the public officers who will occupy the houses when they are erected will reap the benefit. also was led to believe that it was the intention of the Government to have all this work done by day labour, and I had intended to speak very strongly against the adoption of that policy. I think the Minister is justified, owing to the great need for houses here, in adopting the I course which he has proposed. The members of the Public Works Committee visited many of the homes in Canberra, and it realizes that there are many structures here which are no credit to the city. It will be remembered that the estimated cost of Parliament House was £220,000. For many years the estimates of Mr Murdoch, while he was the Commonwealth Director-General of Works, were sound. It is true that certain alterations were made in the plans and specifications of this building, particularly in the rear portion of it, which might have been expected to add £30,000 or £40,000 to. the cost of it ; but nobody ever dreamed that it would cost £660,000, particularly as all the glorious timbers in it were bought in 1913 and 1914, when prices were very much lower than after the war. The huge waste of money in connection with the remodelling of Yarralumla House to convert it into a residence for the Governo'r-;General was, perhaps, the greatest scandal that has occurred here. ported by the honourable member was responsible for the expenditure of £70,000 in that connection without referring the matter to Parliament. upon honourable members opposite, but merely pointing to the fact. It is extraordinary that bricks cost £10 Is. lOd. per 1,000 to produce here last year. I am aware, of course, that a comparatively small quantity was produced and that made the overhead cost high. But tiles cost £34 a 1,000 here, which is far beyond a reasonable price. The members of the Public Works Committee visited Yallourn in the course of their inquiry into the proposal to build these cottages, and inspected some very fine weatherboard homes there. We could not build the same type of home here; but I am sure, if the Minister would study the report of the committee, he would realize that we could, with advantage, adopt a cheaper type of construction in Canberra.",55,Pederal Capita L Territory Erection Op Cottages

I cannot understand this, for the man himself would have accepted the responsibility. If the dwellings were unfit for occupation they could have been condemned. But some stupid blunders have been made here and a great deal of money wasted. The houses in which some of the people here are living are an absolute disgrace, and fit only for slum areas. As honourable members are aware,'I have no attachment for Canberra, and I do not want to see too much money spent here; but I recognize that these houses are essential, and I hope that they will be erected quickly. I accept the Minister's assurance that he will call for tenders in the terms he outlined. We do not want poorly built houses here. If the brick kilns could be put into operation under proper conditions it should be possible to reduce the price of bricks. Electricity Commission was operating the two brick kilns at Yallourn hricks -were being produced at £2 8s. 6d. a thousand. The kilns have since been leased to a private person and he is turning out bricks at £4 0s. 3d. a thousand. The quantities required are not so large now as in the peak constructional period. The Yallourn bricks are carted for 8s. 6d. a thousand, whereas the charge here is l is . is no need for them to be first-class for a thousand, for the first mile and Is. 3d. a thousand per half-mile thereafter. Those figures are altogether too high. I hope that the Minister will do his best to bring the costs down to those which prevail in other parts of the Commonwealth. I did not expect that we should be almost face bricks-and there is no reason called upon to debate, on this motion, the why they should be smothered with relative merits of the day labour and whitewash and cement, which only adds contract, systems; but a very good case to the cost of construction.

Many of the walls have had to Let the Government pick its own men, be papered to hide the poor workmanship of the builders. Numerous alterations have been required in that building, and almost directly after the contractor had finished the job expense had to be incurred to correct faults. We well remember that certain foundations were put in, under contract, a hundred yards or so from this building for the first permanent administrative block, and the quantity of cementused was cut down, * which increased the risk of putting a big building upon them. I thing the Government is acting wisely in building the first eight of these houses by day labour. I do not see why the whole lot of them should not be built by that method. proper supervision and competent clerks of works. supervision is the main thing. I agree with honourable members who have said that the cost of land here is too high. The Government acquired the land for about £4 per acre, and there does not seem to be any justification for charging such When the an extremely high price for it for residential purposes. It is also unfair that the price of bricks should be so high. We have two very expensive kilns and a large quantity of machinery .Which have been unproductive for many months. The overhead charges in these circumstances should not be added to the price of the bricks. It is true that the Canberra bricks are of excellent quality; but there internal walls. We should be able to turn out seconds and thirds which would be suitable for that purpose. other than first-grade bricks here. the bricks are covered with rough-cast and I ""I am living at the hope that the first eight of these cottages how the work there was the remainder of them by day labour.",56,Pederal Capita L Territory Erection Op Cottages

295,Mr West (East Sydney) [10.1],"because tbe Federal Capital has not been established within the State they represent. The bricks made in Canberra are, I understand, double-pressed and faced. A less pressed brick would not cost much less. I do not think it would represent a saving of more than £1 5s. a 1,000. A well pressed brick is essential for 4£-inch. partitions, and nothing would therefore be gained by turning out a lower quality brick. In regard to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) about slippery verandah floors, concrete work makes a very much nicer exterior flooring than timber. It is also more hygienic and impervious to borers. Complaint has been made about the price of land in Canberra. At the last auction sale 398 blocks were offered. Some were business blocks and some cottage sites. The upset price fixed by the Government totalled £13,500, but the price realized at auction was nearly £60,000. The Public Accounts Committee which inquired into the annual rental value of city blocks recommended 5 per cent, as a fair annual rental value. The difference between £13,500 and nearly £60,000 is what many of the tenants in the city have to pay. Those who have been responsible for the high cost of blocks are those persons who competed against one another to obtain business and cottage sites. When the Public Accounts Committee was inquiring into the re-appraisement period I secured information from Great Britain which showed that in most cases the reappraisement period there is 25 years. In Birmingham it is 35 years, and in the Duchy of Cornwall Estate, from which the Prince of Wales derives his revenues, it is 50 years. If certain conditions are complied with the lessees have the right of renewal. The Public Accounts Committee ascertained that the period was fixed at twenty years in Canberra because no one had any idea as to what the future of the Territory would be. ' Nothing causes me to laugh more than statements frequently made about the number of bricks a bricklayer ought to lay. About twelve months ago I was interested in a contract in Brisbane. Tho contractor, a smart man, was quite satisfied when his bricklayers laid on an J f f . West. average 360 bricks a day. On a side wall with only one joint to strike they did 420 a day. When I was a boy I saw, in London Punch, a cartoon, which I have never forgotten. Some men were engaged building a cottage when the owner came along and asked them when he was likely to be able to get into his home. One of the bricklayers replied, "" I cannot tell you exactly because the boss is away. He has just gone down town to try to get another job. If he gets the job it won't be long before we finish here. Buti f he does not get it, I can't tell you when we are likely to finish."" There is a good deal of stupidity in the talk of. what bricklayers can do. Some bricks weigh 6£ lbs., others weigh 9 lbs., and good .black stuff weighs 10 lbs. Only a lunatic would expect a bricklayer to stoop down, pick up a 10-lb. brick, lay on the mortar, strike a joint and keep on doing that at the rate of 1,000 a day. I should like all the cottages and buildings in the Territory to have brick or freestone, fronts. There are very few cities in which the houses and buildings have what I call mud fronts-plaste r on brick. Everybody in Canberra would have a brick house if he were afforded a reasonable opportunity to obtain it. Wooden buildings are uneconomical, and have to be painted continually to keep them presentable. I draw attention to the magnificent brick and freestone buildings in the cities, many erected by insurance companies, and particularly to that of the Australian Mutual Provident Company, one of the finest architectural structures in Australia. The Bank of New South Wales and the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney also have very fine edifices, but I marvel at the architectural monstrosity erected by the New South Wales State Savings Bank Department. Although erected at tremendous cost, it is atrociously lighted. I do hope that the architects will ensure that these Canberra cottages will be well lighted. When you have plenty of light you have adequate ventilation. I hope that these houses will be proceeded with as quickly as possible. Honourable members frequently refer to the high cost incurred in constructing the buildings originally erected in the Territory. ize the conditions that then existed. At the time plasterers, bricklayers,and other tradesmen were drawing £7 and £8 in our capital cities. Could it be expected that they would incur the heavy expense of coming to Canberra without demanding adequate compensation? Consequently, an additional inducement had to be offered to them, and that resulted in labour costs in Canberra being 25 per cent, higher thau in the principal cities. The cost of construction was also inflated because of the high railway freights. I hope that eventually we shall have a well-staffed Works Department, with highly-qualified tradesmen at its disposal. They will become permanent residents here, an acquisition to the business people and to the Territory itself. ringah) [10.16] I believe that the most important factor about day labour is adequate supervision. I suggest to the Minister that, as architects are being retrenched from the War Service Homes Commission, their services might well be utilized as clerks of works or in some other similar capacity in connection with the erection of these cottages. I feel sure that my suggestion is conveyed to a recgptive disposition, and that neither the Minister nor anybody else desires to see men who have been in the service of the department for a great number of years ; discharged at such a time as this, when they could do useful work in Canberra. I desire to draw attention to the specificaI support the construction of the cottages tion of these cottages. Now that the Minister has reassured us that he is trying day labour only as an experiment also trying the contract system as an experiment. methods as an experiment I have nothing to criticize in that regard, but I desire to draw attention to the type of roofing material used. I am not asserting that either the works committee or the Government is responsible for it. It seems to me to be part of the bad tradition that has grown up in Canberra of building for ostentation, rather than for service. It is provided that these houses They fail to realshall have tiled roofs. Tiled roofs in a climate such as this are unnecessary, except, perhaps, to afford a congenial outlook for the neighbour or for the tourist. Their utility amounts to about 10 per cent., and their ostentation to about 80 to 90 per cent. It is unfair to expect people earning little more than the basic wage to bear this additional charge entirely for ostentation. Approximately 90 per cent, of the people of Australia, whether in hot or cold climates, live comfortably under iron roofs. They are quite serviceable and much more economical than tiled roofs. An additional cost of £50 a cottage because of a tiled roof means more than Is. a week in rent to the occupant. I do not know the precise difference between the cost of an iron and a tiled roof, but I know that it must represent an appreciable extra amount in rent at the end of the year. I endorse the remarks of the honourable members for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley) and East Sydney( Mr West) regarding stucco walls. Any honourable member who has travelled in other parts of the world must -have been struck with the beauty and durability of brickwork even in climates much more severe than that of Canberra. One portion of the institution which I was privileged to attend was built of brick, and although it was 600 years old it was as solid as granite, and its appearance was as good as any stone I have seen. Canberra produces a magnificent brick but mainly for reasons of vulgar ostentation many of the brick cottages have been covered with stucco at additional cost. This is needless extravagance. at Manuka and hope that the Minister will be able to commence the work at an early date. for Home Affairs) [10.22] -The writing down of housing costs in Canberra is at present under consideration. The Public Works Committee has suggested that the brickworks should be written down from £85,000 to £55,000; I am not sure that the reduction should not be even greater. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) rightly drew attention to a fact which must be taken into consideration when discussing the high cost of building in the early construction stage of Canberra.

300,Mr Blakeley (Darling,"Ministe rMelbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Hobart, during the period 1923 to 1927, were experiencing a building boom, with the result that when the construction of the Federal Capital was undertaken the demand for artisans was abnormal. The result was a foregone conclusion; a big job like the building of a city cannot be carried put efficiently and cheaply without expert tradesmen. The public servants who have been compulsorily transferred to Canberra should not be expected to pay for ever, interest on theex1 cessive cost of buildings erected during the initial stages of Canberra. I am informed that one group of cottages has been written down by £86,000, and that to bring them to present-day values a further £20,000 or £30,000 should be written off. The Government is now erecting cottages with greater and more comfortable accommodation, which can be rented at from 10s. to £1 a week less than older cottages situated within 100 yards of them. Minister that he might consult with the womenfolk with regard to the internal' arrangement of the cottages? cottage construction at Canberra has shown that even the best qualified architects may err. competition for a group of 100 cottages was held by the Commonwealth Government, and the competitive plans and specifications were adjudicated on by a committee of three of the foremost Australian architects. The prize was awarded, and the cottages were built in accordance with the winning plans and specifications. We have since found that they are not of a type suitable for Canberra, and we have developed a different and much improved cottage. The Canberra type is different from that of Melbourne and Sydney; a large living room is one of the essentials. Some of the best architects in Australia put on paper their ideas of what would be most suitable for this city, but, apparently, they were wrong. The residents of Canberra have discovered the type of comfortable home that they require, and the Government is providing it at a cost much below that of the earlier cottages. The motion before the House relates to cheap but commodious cottages having five rooms, kitchen, bathroom and all conveniences. The comfort of the housewife has been carefully considered by the designer. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) suggested that architects now being retrenched by the War Service Homes Commission should be taken over by the Works Department and employed as clerks of works. Unfortunately, the services of many architects who were employed by the Federal Capital Commission have been dispensed with. Honourable members will recognize that the first stage of the development of Canberrathe erection of Parliament House and office accommodation, and the making of roads, parks, and gardens-ha s been completed, with the result that whereas three years ago about 3,000 men were employed on the constructional programme, now comparatively few are employed. Most of those remaining are on the office staff, with the exception of the artisans engaged on cottage construction, which is the only work in progress in Canberra to-day. Therefore the staff necessary for present requirements is already in Canberra. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) advised the use of a cheaper roofing material than tiles. The wooden cottages at Reid are roofed with An Australian-wide iron, but I think that in the brick areas tile roofs are to be preferred. We hope to be able to evolve a brick cottage with tiled roof that can be rented at 25s. a week. The cottages at Manuka will have an attractive elevation, plenty of space at the rear for gardening, and many other desirable features. Question resolved in the affirmative. BILL. Assent reported.

SinceI received a reply from the Minister for DefenceI have had communications from several persons who are concerned in this matter. the following from one of the letters I have receivedBeing an elector of Lang, also a member of the CitizenA i r Force, would you, through your party, ventilate the method of selection of cadets for training as pilots in the Citizen ing the working and purpose of the BorA i r Force? The necessary standard namely, a university education, is the first obstacle to a working-man's son, and is merely a class barrier to make it more conservative. A t Richmond they have men with more knowledge of aircraft and aviation and two or more years' experience than outsiders, and when the time comes round for selection of cadets they arc not even considered, merely because of their education and social standing. position as it is now takes all interest out of young offenders sent to it from the courts; the work of the men, when they are overlooked in preference to outsiders (i.e., university students who have sufficient irons in the fire), nnd I think that with a little more agitation the position could be changed along better lines. Thanking you, in anticipation; I shall not give the name of the writer but the Minister may see the letter itself. He has been at the Richmond Aerodrome for four years, and has attained to the rank of air craftsman, first class (A.C.I.). He, amongst others, is desirous of obtaining a position in the Air Force but cannot do so. He has informed me that on the back of the application form which is used when applying for a commission are the following words in brackets:(Applicants must come up to an educational standard of a university, or Melbourne intermediate examination, and be between the ages of 18 and 20 years, and unmarried). This applicant and many others conform to the age regulation and are unmarried. These young men have been informed by an Air Force Sergeant-Major that unless they can conform to educational requirements as set out on the back of the application form it will be useless for them to apply for a commission. I have no -desire to harass the Minister or cast any reflection upon his administration. E have the utmost faith in his integrity and honesty. I believe that the answers which he gave me were strictly in accordance with what he believed to be facts, but evidently from the information which I have received, there is something radically wrong; hence my desire to bring it under his notice, and the I take notice of honourable members. -This afternoon I asked the right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) a number of questions concernstal Institute in England. I asked him of education, particularly if inmates of the institution referred to were sent to Australia, and if so would he endeavour to prevent this class of migrant from coming to the Commonwealth. In his reply the Minister said he had no detailed knowledge, but understood that endeavours were made by The the Borstal Institute to effect reform in also that inmates of the institute had not, since the inception of the joint Commonwealth and State migration scheme in 1921, been brought to Australia as assisted migrants. I should have accepted the right honourable gentleman's statement as accurate if he had not mentioned the date 1921, and if I had not obtained some knowledge of the institute when I was iu England in 1924. During my visit to the Mother Country in that year, I was engaged in a Labour concert in the constituency of Lewes in the south of England, and came across one of the institutes near the town of Portslade. I learned that nineteen of the lads had been sent to Australia as migrants the previous week. I knew nothing then of the working of the institute, and upon making inquiries I learned, as the Prime Minister stated this afternoon, that its purpose was to effect reform in first offenders sent to it from the courts, and the custom was, if these young people did not misbehave, to encourage them to migrate to the dominions. About two years ago I obtained copies of the annual reports of the institute but could find no reference in them to the migration of inmates, although from time to time. I have seen press statements of the success of the Borstal Institute, and the fact that young men committed to its care were sent to the dominions if they proved satisfactory. The Prime Minister",62,Adjournment Royal Australian Air Force Borsta L Institute Migration Of Inmates To Australia
305,Mr Crouch (Corangamite) [10.35].,"has informed us that there has been no migration of unfit immigrants since 1921, but statements have been made by Dr. Culpin, who at one time was a member of this House, and is now a medical superintendent in a Brisbane hospital, that some are being sent out to Australia, so I suggest that further inquiries be made. When I was in England in 1924,1.took advantage of the opportunity to investigate the emigration methods adopted, not only at Australia House, but at an agency in the Strand. The advertisements of this agency appeared all over London and at all the approaches to Australia House. learned that the agent in the Strand was working in the interest of a certain shipping company. This method seemed to me to be rather lax. Instead of intending migrants obtaining all the information necessary at Australia House they were being induced to apply to the shipping agent who was' interested in booking passages for migrants under the assisted migration scheme, and he cared little for the health or character of the migrants so long as he obtained their passage money. On the steamer on which I returned to Australia there was a young man, suffering mentally, who, -been refused a passage by Australia House officials, but was sent out by the agent referred to. I believe he is now in Tasmania. I have been informed that of the total number of migrants sent from England to the dominions in February and March, 838 or 60 per cent, came to Aitstralia, and 370 went to Canada. This suggests the need for stricter inquiries. It should be the duty of some one to see where the leakage is on the other side, because of the risk of physically unfit, and perhaps undesirable migrants whom the Mother Country is glad to get rid of, coming to Australia. No doubt the answer of the Prime Minister was based on information supplied by his department, and was given in all good faith. I urge, however, that a stricter examination be made of immigrants on the other side. General) [10.41] -The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch) asked me to-day what salary was paid to Judge Lukin, and I answered that his salary was £2,000 a year. I regret that I was not at the time able to check that figure, and I have sinee learned that the salary received by Judge Lukin is £2,500 a year. It was fixed by the act of 1926, and has remained unaltered for Defence) [10.42] -The honourable member for Lang( Mr Long) referred to the educational qualification required for cadetship in the Royal Australian Air Force. In a question addressed to me the other day he suggested that university qualifications were required. I replied I then that a student was not required to attend a university; that an ordinary high school education was sufficient. The standard insisted on is what in some States is known as the Intermediate Certificate, but in other3 as the Junior Public Certificate. It is necessary that cadets should have a fairly good education in view of the work they are required to do. There are usually ten to fourteen cadetships advertised, and there are frequently from 300 to 400 applicants. It is necessary, therefore, that a fairly high standard of qualification should be required. At the last examination 400 ap : plicants presented themselves. Only fourI understand, had teen passed, and of those only one was a student from a university. The others were from State high schools, or from other secondary schools. I shall be pleased if the honourable member for Lang will give me the letter which he read. The case mentioned therein might have some special personal features which it would be desirable to consider. [10.44] -The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch) stated that he had learned authoritatively that boys from the Borstal Institute had obtained assisted passages to Australia in 1924. The reply which I gave to his question was based upon information received from my department, and accepted by me in good faith. It may be that these boys would not receive assisted passages. I assure the House that the answers I give to questions I understand to be accurate. In this case I shall have further inquiries made. Question resolved in the affirmative.
