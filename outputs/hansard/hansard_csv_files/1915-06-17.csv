Minister and Treasurer) [2.31] -The honourable member for Plinders asked me yesterday afternoon if I would make a statement to the House about what has been done regarding the manufacture of munitions of war in Australia, and, with the leave of the House, I shall now supplement what the Minister of Defence and the Assistant Minister have said on this subject. The present Government assumed the responsibility of Commonwealth administration in the middle of September, 1914. A t that time no steps had been taken to provide for the manufacture within Australia of either ordnance or ammunition there for. The Government decided that it was desirable we sliould be self-contained in that respect, and that, if possible, we should be able to manufacture the 18-pounder quick-firing gun and the various kinds of ammunition used by that weapon. Accordingly, on 30th September, 1914, we cabled to the Home Government asking for full details of manufacture of that gun and ammunition, including fuses, also whether foremen of works could be supplied to supervise the manufacture On the previous day the High Commissioner was similarly notified, and asked to endeavour to procure from the trade foremen of works who understood the manufacture of fuses, shells, cylinders, and guns. Thc Homo Government replied, on the 7th October, intimating that the Army Council was unable at the time to spare the special officer who would be required to prepare the lengthy details of manufacture of the 18-pounder gun and ammunition, nor could they sparethe services of any foremen. The Home Government suggested that we should send a deputation to England to study the whole question, and lay out for and obtain the necessary plant. The Government acted on this advice, and a few days after the receipt of the last-mentioned cable instructed the High Commissioner that it was not possible to send the suggested deputation, but that the Minister of Defence had appointed Major B. A. G. Watts, Royal Australian Garrison Artillery, and Captain A. J. Coghill, Armament Officer, and at the time attached to the High Commissioner's office-bot h officers of considerable artillery experienceto thoroughly study the question and' report the necessary steps as soon as possible. Sir George Reid was requested to solicit the aid of the War Office in these inquiries. On 18th November the full despatch arrived from the War Office amplifying the cable of 7th October to the extent that the Chief Superintendent of Ordnance Factories could supply to the Commonwealth Government parts of the",4,Setup

The Superintendent of Ordnance Factories was emphatio op the point that no foremen could be spared to any Dominion. enough for his own services. On the 9th November the High Commissioner had advised that he had consulted with the trade, and had found that no foremen of works were available, every qualified man being required in England. He added that Major Watts and Captain Coghill would make little progress in obtaining details of their investigations owing to the . heavy pressure preventing experts having time to advise. The Minister thereupon approved that neither time, energy, nor money should be spared in placing the Commonwealth in a position to make artillery ammunition. Meantime the Minister of Defence had been pursuing his inquiries in the Commonwealth on the subject. secured estimates from the assistant manager of the Small Arms Factory of the cost of establishing a complete plant for manufacturing quick-firing 18-pounder ammunition. The estimated cost was £98,175, representing £83,175 for plant and £15,000 for buildings. A t the same time, the High Commissioner was told that the Government desired every endeavour made to overcome obstacles ' in the way of obtaining the desired information, and that Major Watts and Captain Coghill were to report their progress monthly. The necessity for urgency was again referred to. Captain Coghill was given facilities to visit the Royal Ordnance Factories, but on 26th December the Army Council intimated that it itself desired to use Major Watts' valuable services "" until the end of the war."" Captain Coghill's progress reports on manufacture of quickfiring 18-pounder ordnance have since been received. The Government resolved to wait no longer, and the High Commissioner was cabled, on 31st December, to obtain quotes for the manufacture of complete plant for manufacturing 18-pounder ammunitionMr Fisher. 200 rounds daily-for forging and finishing,.fuse making, power plant not included; 100 rounds. A reply was received from the High Commissioner that the work was in hand. On the 10th April, intimation of the first offer was received by cable, details to follow by post. On the 10th May, an intimation of another offer came He had not to hand. That is the position with regard to the manufacture by Government agency of ordnance and ammunition. Statements as to the necessity for increasing the supply of high explosive projectiles led to the question of their manufacture here by existing works which, although designed for more peaceful purposes, might possibly be pressed into service. Accordingly, in February, the local manufacturer, and othera. On 29th May last the High Commissioner was asked to forward, as soon as possible, . specifications of steel manufacture, as well as drawings of 18pounder high explosive and shrapnel shell. These are now awaited. Component parts of the shell have been On the 18th November he submitted to the inspection of local manufacturers, but they agree that they cannot ascertain the quality of the steel,until specifications and formula are available. In order that all possible energies may be bent in the direction of supply of munitions, the Minister of Defence has appointed a committee, consisting of expert officers of the Naval and Military Forces of the Commonwealth, together with a and a representative of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, as consultative members, to consider(a) the supply of material to the Government by Australian manufacturers; (&) the Government manufacture of war materiel; and (c) contracts between the War Office and Australian manufacturers. Further, the associated Chambers of Manufactures have been asked to appoint a responsible committee, to be constituted to organize the various trades, collect information as to plant, and capacity of same, and thereby assist in the same direction. Numerous offers of plant, &c, by private firms have been received, and are",4,Munitions Of War

[2.39] -B y leave, I wish to say that I was not aware that the Prime Minister would supplement the statement which was made last night, and I congratulate h i m on his wisdom in doing so. I read the statement made last night, I quate in every sense of the word. May I be quite frank, and say that I doubt very much whether the Ministry yet realize the present position of affairs. Anyhow, the fact remains that after ten months of Herculean effort thing that you failed to inquire about, anyhow! months of Herculean effort nothing has been done. appears to me to be absolutely inadequate for the purposes of this war. it that the Government propose after cogitating over tlie matter all these monthsa plant to cost £98,000. And they have not yet got the plan of the shell they propose to make. They have not yet the remotest idea when or how they are going to make shells at all. statement; it is an accusation. up to make a statement. make some remarks by the permission of the House, and if I am not permitted to make them now I shall sit down and take another opportunity of making them. I want to say, in reply to the Assistant Minister of Defence, that his attitude in this House recently has been anything but what it ought to have been in connection with this war. events have proved one thing more than any other it is that there should be a responsible Minister of Defence in this House. We can get no information regarding the war. 9ven the simplest question answered, and I say the time is fast approaching when this House ought to insist upon a M in ister for Munitions, or for War, or whatever you like to call h i m, being here, clothed with f u l l responsibility, and posI sessing a proper and f u l l knowledge, so that he may answer the questions that are put to him upon the requirements of the moment. That is my reply to the honourable member. I think he would do better to keep quiet. When mud ab him, and not allow him to answer ? ing mud-to complain that we can get no information ? I say you cannot begin to discuss this question from the bottom until you can get information, f u l l , free, and ample, placed at the disposal of honourable members of this House. I am afraid we shall never get that under our present Defence arrangements. Before going any further, I should like to say that the sooner the Ministry get a responsible Minister of Defence in this The proposal as made now House-le t them make the honourable member the responsible Ministeri f they care to What is do so-the better. They w ill get the f u l l and unanimous approval of the Opposition in any proposal of the kind, but a responsible Minister of Defence we must have in this House in order that the country may be made aware of what is actually taking place, and of what steps are being taken by the Department to meet the terrible crisis over the seas. able gentleman assume that the Assistant Minister does not know all ? I got up to no reflection upon the Assistant Minister. That is the furthest thought in my mind. honourable gentleman knows that we never ask a question without being told to put it on the paper while the Honorary Minister goes out to get information to enable him to reply to If recent it. The statement he made last night was a statement he had been authorized to make by the Minister of Defence. Wo want more than that in this Chamber.

I have no power to restrict his remarks in any way. I therefore ask honourable members to allow the r i g ht honourable member to make his statement without interruption. time and place, I hope to call attention to what I consider to be the main trouble in connection w i th this matter. probed to the bottom, it will be seen that, instead of making a serious effort to push on with war preparations, the Ministry, throughout, have been aiming at nothing more than the setting up of more Government factories. Instead of calling in private enterprise in a bond fide way to help them in the supply of war materiel, the Government, as shown by the Ministers' own statements, have aimed all through at setting up a Government institution for the production of munitions of war. What does that mean ? Take the Geelong Woollen Mills. A site was selected three years ago, and yet the mill is not ready. gentleman's Government held it up. yelpers shouting! the woollen mills are not ready to make an ounce of clothing, while the Small Arms Factory, the machinery for which was ordered five years ago, is not working as it should be. that the less we have to do with the cultivation of social experiments in these war days, when the fate of the Empire is at stake, the better it will be for all concerned.

There should be only one object in view, and that is to multiply munitions and multiply men, and get them over the seas at the earliest possible moment. May I remind honourable members of what is taking place to-day? We have sent away A t the proper 57,000 men, of whom 13,000 are now on the water, and, since we began to send men away, I reckon the casualties, includI f it is ing sickness, at, at least, another 12,000. Add to these the MedicalU n it . Now all these deductions mean that we have less than 30,000 men in the firing line, including the Base Staff and men on the lines of communication.

Leader of the Opposition in his remarks just now seemed to desire to convey to the general public that I had done sometiling very wrong, and something with which he disagreed, and, believing that I have been put in an unfair light, I wish to draw attention to page 4488 of Hansard of the 16th December, 1913, which shows that on that occasion I moved-""That Division No. 40 (of the Defenoa Estimates) be reduced by the sum of £ 1 as a direction to the Government that this Committee desires the reduction of the Military and Naval Defence vote by the sum of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 . "" I gave my reasons at some length, and the Leader of the Opposition, who was then Prime Minister, when speaking to the matter, saidI compliment the honourable member who moved the amendment on the manner in which lie has acted. He might easily havo moved a larger reduction, and thus might have embarrassed tlie Government. I understand that he desires the amendment to be regarded as a direction to thc Government to reduce these Estimates by £500,000. That is a very large It may be that order to execute within six months, nnd I cannot promise that a full £500,000 will be saved. But Ministers think that they can see their way to reduce thc Estimates very materially during tbe next six months, without embarrassing'the scheme in thu slightest degree. make a personal explanation. The honourable member for Capricornia stopped reading from Hansard at the point where it was convenient for him to do so, but, even though the statement he read were allowed to stand by itself , I should not have a word to say in palliation of what I said on that occasion, which was that we could see our way to make economies",9,Munitions Of War

No country has been able to show within such a short period of its initiation such an efficient sea and land defence scheme as that to which we can point.

Any delay which occurs is probably due to the conditions under which the lists have to be compiled by the authorities at the scene of operations, and the uncertainty of the communications between the Dardanelles and Egypt. answer my question. officer reports the casualties direct to the a statement in the TVarrnambool Standard to Commonwealth Government as soon as he the following effect, viz.:-"" A year ago a is in possession of the information. get the information ?

Isi t a fact that officers of a State Public Service who volunteer for active service arc reimbursed all the difference between their military pay and their pay as civil servants; whilst in the case of officers of the Federal Public Service who volunteer, the Commonwealtli does not make good the deficiency between the two pays? 2. Is tliere any logical ground for this differential treatment? . honourable member's questions are-1. It was agreed, at the Premiers' Conference (11th August, 1914), that(a) Public Service appointments held by persons joining the Australian Imperial Forces should remain open for them on their return to Australia, and that if, during the period of service with the Australian Imperial Force they would, under ordinary circumstances, have been granted increased pay, such increased pay may be granted to them on resuming duty in the Public Service. (I)) Such officers should receive only Expeditionary Force pay during service with the Australiau Imperial Force. So far as is known, thc Governments of all States have adhered to this arrangement except New South Wales, who, it is understood, arc granting to members of their Public Service serving with the Australian Imperial Force the difference, if any, between the Australian Imperial Force pay and pay of permanent position. The Commonwealth Government has also adhered to this agreement. 2. Considering the liberal rates of pay and allowances and pensions, the cost of which is borne by the Commonwealth, there does not seem sufficient reason for departing from the agreements referred to above. Minister representing the Minister of. Defence, upon notice1. Is he aware that the oflicial list of payments to recruits provides that a. private will receive 0s. per day, a wife ls. oil. per day separation allowance,"" and 4jd. per day for each child under sixteen years of age? 2. Is lie aware that this statement is incorrect, inasmuch as a private receives only 5s. when in camp; also that on his embarkation he cannot receive more than 8s. per day? 1 3. Is he aware that this rate, after allowing ls. 5d. to the wife, provides only 7d. for the children ? 4. Will he direct that correct information be circulated? honourable member's questions are1. Yes. 2. (a.) No, the statement is not incorrect, inasmuch as the rate, 6s. per day on "" active"" service, takes effect as from date of embarkation; service in Australia not being for this purpose considered as active service. » (6) Thc purpose of separation allowance is to raise the daily rate of pay for a private to a sum not exceeding Ss. per diem, and it is essential to place such limitation on the rate, otherwise the next higher rank (a non-commissioned officer), whose dependants could not be in receipt of separation allowance, would be in receipt of less money than the private. 3. Yes. 4. The oflicial lists of rates show 5s. per diem before embarkation, and 6s. per day after embarkation. MrM c GRATH asked the Attorney General, upon notice1.

AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS : the right honourable the Prime Minister the Attorney-General should be postponed to allow the present B ill to take precedence. These motions indicate legislation of a violently controversial character, and coming at a time like this, they appear to me to be an absolute disgrace to our notice-paper. The right honorablo gentleman, in directing the conduct of busiuess in this Parliament, has determined that nothing but bitter controversial measures shall be placed before us at a time when we are all deeply obsessed with a supreme crisisa crisis which involves the very existeuce of tlie Empire. Instead of concentrating the wisdom and thought of I Parliament towards measures for the defence of the Empire, we are daily engaged in bickerings over party warfare, and in antagonising one portion of the House against the other. I do not think that my right honourable friend and his Government have any right to be proud of this course of action in It the present crisis. It is quite true that at this last moment, by reason of promptings from this side of the House, but perhaps more directly by reason of vigorous and energetic action on the"" part of the press, they have come to somo It is merely a formal B ill , sense of the importance of . the existing momentous issue, and to that extent they have been awakened and stimulated into aetion. But the action that they are now taking is the action that ought to have been taken without any prompting some six or seven months ago.

My right honourable friend, I am aware, has from time to time made pious declarations of what should be the attitude of Australia in the present crisis. These have remained pious aspirations and declarations. They have not been followed up by that action and energetic zeal in the prosecution of the vital and all-important work necessary to secure the defence of Australia aud the Empire. That is a regrettable condition of affairs, and it is the more regrettable and in excusable when we remember exactly what has taken place elsewhere. We have had a splendid object lesson from France. We have had another from the Mother Country itself. It was realized by tbe great French nation, w i th whom we are proud to be in alliance, thab the present is no time for party warfare-that this is a time when all should be for State and none for party; that it was no time for antagonizing one section of politics against the other, but a time when all should unite for the common good and in the interests of the nation. The attitude of France may be well illustrated by the eloquent words contained in the speech delivered by M . Viviani, the Prime Minister of that country, shortly after his formation of the National Ministry! . M . V i v i a n i saidIn order to conquer, heroism on the frontier does not suffice. There must be union within. Let us continue to preserve the sacred union intact from every attempt made upon it. Today, as it was ""yesterday, and as it will be to-morrow, let us have only one cry, Victory; only one vision before our eyes, "" La Patrie,"" only one ideal-Right. It is for Right that we are striving, for which Belgium has poured out her blood, for which unshakable England, faithful Russia, intrepid Servia, and the gallant Japanese Navy are still striving. If this is the most gigantic war that history vernment in the one great object of has ever known, it is not because nations are in arms to conquer new lands, to obtnin material securing the united defence of the Emadvantage or political or economic rights; it is pire. because they are fighting to settle the fate of the world. Nothing more grand has ever appeared before .the eyes of men. Against barbarism and. despotism, against a system of provocation and methodical menace which Germany called peace, against the system of murder and universal pillage which Germany calls war, against the insolent hegemony of a military caste which has unchained its scourge. France, the liberator and avenger, with her Allies, has raised herself at one bound. The stakes are more than our lives. Let us continue, then, to work with a single mind, and to-morrow, in thc peace of victory, when Sir Robert Best. politics have been freed from the restraints which have been voluntarily placed upon them, we shall recall with pride these tragic days, for they will have made us more valiant and better. That is a truly patriotic and national note which should resound throughout the length and .breadth of the Empire. position strike that note in connection with the by-election for the Grampians? that we have never failed to strike. We have indicated again and again in this House our anxiety at all times to unite with the Government in passing measures having for their object the proper defence of this community. The Commonwealth has witnessed in this connection a striking object lesson from the Mother Country, one that we are not justified in disregarding. The Liberal Government in Grea;' Britain, comprising some of the ablest statesmen in the land, and supported by a substantial majority, after conducting the affairs of the war for something like seven months, realized that it was not justified in continuing the conduct of the war without the help of other parties. It felt that in this time of crisis, and having regard to the vital and momentous issues at stake, it was its duty to call into the councils of the nation the representatives of every party, and so obtain united action. It was in a truly patriotic spiri* that Mr Asquith approached the Opposition and asked for its co-operation. It has been most improperly suggested that we on this side of the House have sought to impose ourselves on the other side, and to secure oflice by the creation of a National Governmenb. From the Opposition no suggestion of the kind has been made. There have been, however, indications that we ar? anxious to co-operate witli the G i In these circumstances, we have a right to expect, a loftier attitude than has been taken up by the Government, and at least a suggestion from them as to how the representatives of the great Liberal party might co-operate with them in furthering our national defence.

But the Commonwealth Government, after ten months of somnolence, have had to take a lead from people outside. Manufacturers in various parts of Australia are attempting to lead the Government in bhe supreme duty on which Ministers should be concentrating their energies. sands of patriotic citizens in Australia ready and anxious to do their very best to help the Government and the nation and the Empire and our Allies; but they are powerless without some lead being given to them by the Government. The Commonwealth Parliament should be the centre of organization in the matter of supplying munitions, and in the general preparations for the war; but it is not possible for this Parliament to lead the country and the whole of the forces of manufacture, production and commerce, unless there is unanimity among members on both sides of the House. If ever there was, in the history of the Commonwealth, a period when party warfare should cease until we have done our duty in connection with war preparations, it was when the present war broke out. the honourable member's party in Tasmania are contesting the seat for Bass when there is a general election eight months ahead? Pederal politics at the present time. member's party contest the Grampians seat? entitled to see that our representation in this House is fair. I am speaking of Parliament as it is elected by the people. The honourable member for Kooyongi n his very excellent speech, and the Leader of the Opposition, this afternoon, have suggested that there should be a Minister of Munitions in this House, who could devote tlie whole of his time to the task of securing supplies of munitions and equipment. I go even further. I would like to see a War Committee appointed to help the Minister of Defencei n his war preparations. In the absence of a National Government, there is no more effective way in which the whole of the forces of the Commonwealth can be organized and d i rected than by having a Committee comprising honourable members of both sides of the House, which will make investigations into the resources of the Commonwealth, and get into communication with the various industrial and commercial organizations, and by means of sub-committees of the leading men in the various States bring to bear the whole system of such an organization to the service of the Government. I have had a little experiThere are hundreds of thouence of the possibility, by investigation, of expediting the work of providing munitions. Tlie Public Works Committee has made a very exhaustive investigation into . the possibility of starting two shifts at the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow. That factory for the first few years had worked one eight-hour shift, which was afterwards extended to a twelve-hour shift, b u t the Public Works Committee found that two shifts of twelve hours could be worked, and au increase of 70 per cent, in the output was recommended. There was no opposition from the men as to the matter of working two shifts. The leader of the skilled portion of the operatives in the factory suggested two twelve-hour shifts; he said that they were quite practicable, aud that he and his people would be prepared, if necessary, to work on Sundays. Like the workmen of Great Britain, tlie workmen of Australia desire to be brought more into the confidence of the Government. The manufacturers and employers also wish to be brought into association with the Government, not ouly in order to bring to bear all these great forces W h y did the honourable that I have indicated, in order to increase production, but also to give confidence' to the people, and show that everything that ought to be done is being",21,Contractors Scarcity Of

The double shift could have been started months ago."" A grave position has been reached in connection with that factory. Though two Committees of this Parliament have recommended that two shifts should be commenced, the Minister of Defence has appointed another committee-a committee of engineers-to investigate ths possibility of making a start with two shifts. The men on that committee are mostly departmental officers, though not Commonwealth officers, and they were sent to Lithgow to make a report, and, according to the press, as the result of their report, two eight-hour shifts are likelv to be worked. If two eight-hour * shifts are to be worked there will be no great increase in the output for many months to come, as compared with the present twelve-hour shift. Indications show that the committee appointed by the Minister went to the factory, as did the Committees of this Parliament, and drew its inspirations from the management. There are also indications-accordin g to the press reports-that many months are likely to elapse before a proper start can be made and there is anything like an appreciable increase in the output. tion of the management months ago, that these would be no appreciable increase in the' output ? that there was not enough material, but our investigations showed that there was plentv of material available. Another objection by the management was that skilled men were not available, and that there was not sufficient accommodation at Lithgow to house the men. When the State Governments said that they were prepared to give to the Commonwealth Government the necessary skilled labour in order to increase the output in the various Commonwealth factories, and when the people of Lithgow were prepared to throw open their doors to houso the men, these objections were removed. Five elements-machinery , material, men, money, and management-ar e required to make the factory a success. The Public Works Committee were prepared to show agement, and that all that was required to put two shifts into successful operation was method.

Since then lie has addressed a public meeting at Lithgow, at which he reiterated the wil lingness of the men to work an extra shift.

Nothing is wanting to increase the output of small arms but method and management. that has been at f a u l t in the past. to explain that. This is what the president of the Engineers Association is reported to have said at the annual dinner of the local branch of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers at LithgowWe are going to do our best to make the output of rifles woefully insufficient at the present time considerably larger. I hope that you are going to see that the factory is worked every hour of the day and night. It is for us to do our best to make this second shift successful. Let us help our gallant boys and our Allies by turning out every rifle possible. by a trade unionist. member's mind is so obscured by party bias that he cannot dispassionately discuss a matter of this kind. MrW . P. Pedersen, secretary of the branch, saidHe could not help wondering how many more reports thc Government wanted before the second shift was instituted, for reports had already been given, and now the Minister was calling a conference in regard to thc state of the labour market. that the delay in regard to the second shift reflected any credit on the Labour party. The president of the Federated Enginedrivers Association saidAs a Labour man, he deplored the fact that a party, whoso fundamental principle was for the cause of humanity, should have allowed the factory to stand idle lialf its time, when every rifle not turned out might have meant the saving of precious lives that had been sacrificed. We could not listen to any statements more patriotic than those. Despite the reports submitted by two Parliamentary Committees, the Government are instituting another kind of inquiry, and, according to the forecast we have had of the reports of this latest Committee, it w ill be months before a second shift is commenced, and then, probably, we shall have only two eight-hour shifts. In face of the two reports, wherein it is f u l l y explained that nothing is lacking for an increase of output except the method and management, it is now the duty of the Minister not to superimpose another Committee, b u t to give.a firm direction to the We already possess the mamanager of the factory to institute a second shift at once. The position of the Minister now should be like that adopted by Napoleon, when he asked an engineer the width of a river which he desired to It is the management cross with his army. The engineer said, "" I have not my instruments witl i me, and I am not able to give you the distance but Napoleon replied, "" Give me the distance in s t a n t l y ! "" Tho engineer was obliged to find a way of answering the question, and a bridge was thrown across the river. The two reports thab the Government have already had prove beyond all possibility of cavil that two, or even three, shifts can be instituted, and that the machinery can be kept going continuously. Therefore, if the Minister is firm, and has the necessary driving power, it is his duty to give a direction to the manager of the factory, and to supply him with the labour necessary, to keep the machinery in operation throughout thc twentj -four liours. r say that that factory has not done excellent work? what the factory has .done. I am asserting that the machinery is there for an increased output, and that we require more rifles. Every man who goes to the f r o n t He did not consider must have a rifle ; to send forward men without rifles would be to sacrifice them. We require to send forward more men, more rifles, and more munitions. I remember reading recently an article in which Eobert Blatchford, the prominent. Socialist, stated that many of the labour troubles in GreatB r it a in had arisen through the men not having been taken into the confidence of the Government. We know that Blatchford some years ago warned the British public of the German menace; that Britons were fighting for their lives agaiust the most highly-organized and perfectly-equipped nation 'the world has even known, and that it was the duty of every man, whether on the battlefield or in the workshop, to put forward his utmost effort in defence of his home",23,Contractors Scarcity Of

Realizing that those difficulties confront the Prime Minister, one other Avay of uniting our forces in the manner I have indicated is open to us, and that is by the appointment, as suggested by the right honourable member for Parramatta, of a Minister of Munitions, Avho should be relieved from any responsibility in regard to the enrolment of troops, and Avho should be able to concentrate his undivided attention on the obtaining of equipment, supplies, and munitions, and the organization of all the vast forces within the CommonAvealth that can contribute to that end. Personally, I should like to see a non-party Avar Committes appointed to help the M in ister.

The Minister would then be backed up by a body that would be in touch with the manufacturing, commercial, and industrial organizations of the country, and would be in a position to secure the fullest output of supplies, munitions, and equipment. The appointment of such a Committee would secure for the Administration the confidence of the people and their co-operation. ""WhatI suggest would not be ns good as n National Government, which would enable both sides to share Executive responsibility for war administration, but it would be infinitely better than the present arrangement. busiuess of the country is now being controlled by a Government and party representing only one half of the population, and they are continuing party warfare by introducing measures of a party character, to which, in some instances, they are giving precedence.. Further, they are not giving undivided attention to the supreme duty which the situation casts upon them, and which they cannot ignore without being recreant to their trust, and unmindful of the best interests of the nation. [4.37] -There is a matter affecting invalid pensions administration which I should like the Postmaster-General to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister. At present no person is given an invalid pension unless he has become an invalid for life, and many doctors are too conscientious to certify that a man or a woman is totally disabled for life. Besides, there are many cases in which persons are disabled for only a ye'ar or two. Such persons cannot now draw invalid pensions. But the suggestion has been made that persons whom doctors certify to be temporarily totally disabled should be allowed to draw invalid pensions for the year or two during which the disablement continues, fresh certificates, if necessary, being required of them from time to time. amendment of the Actan amending Bill is to be introduced, and therefore I have brought the matter forward. It is only fair that persons who are totally disabled, though only for a few years, should receive consideration. 1 also invite attention to a case affecting the administration of the Old-age Pensions Aet. A woman who was applying for an old-age pension in Victoria stated what she believed to be her correct age, and what, I understand, was her correct age, though there was some confusion of names iu the registration. ""When an officer of the Department was sent to the Registrar-General's Office to investigate the case, he took the wrong name, and thus arrived at the conclusion that the woman was n year younger than she had stated herself to be. She, however, got a constablea friend-to hunt up the register of her birth, and thus made certain that The her age was the age stated in her application form. Nevertheless, the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions for Victoria has penalized her by refusing to give her a pension at all. I do not know whether that officei"" would see any one who called on him, but I have written to the Department time after time without effect, and now the woman is blaming me for not having got a pension for her. Eveni f she had made a mistake in the first instance, I think that she would have been too harshly treated, but I understand that she did not make a mistake, and, although iu point of age she has been entitled for (Corangamite) .two years to a pension, she has not yet got oue. The other matters of which I wish to speak relate to Defence. The Government has definitely turned down the proposal for a coalition. Indeed, the other day the Prime Minister said, in effect, that he would uot be found dead in a Coalition Government. This being so, the Labour party and Government must take full responsibility for Defence administration. I do not advance any criticism on party lines of what has been done; but it seems to me that, at present, the Minister of Defence has more work than one man can do, and that another Minister should be appointeda Minister of Munitions or of Supplies, call him what you will-to see that all tilings necessary for the equipment of our troops are obtained as rapidly as possible.

As to the suggestion of the honourable member for Wimmera that a Committee should be appointed to assist the Minister, it seems to me that tlie appointment of a Committee is only a means of evading responsibility. I believe in having at the head of each Department a Minister wbo can be held answerable for the rectification of any complaints regarding tlie management of its affairs. Tlierefore, I suggest the creation of a Minister of Munitions, or of Supplies. mittee were appointed, and its members were chosen from the two parties in Parliament, one party would be all the time digging underground, trying to find ways of pin-pricking the Minister. The right thing is for the Government of the day to take responsibility for the administration of public affairs. But as the Minister of Defence has more work than one man can do, and all the time of the Assistant Minister is occupied with the affairs of the Navy Office, I think that we need, in addition, a Minister of Munitions. Of course, .nowadays, it is impossible for any one to see the Minister of Defence at his office; indeed, it takes something like three-quarters of an hour to obtain an interview with the Secretary to the Department. I wenb to the Victoria Barracks to-day, and was civilly received by that gentleman, who very kindly forwarded me on to Colonel Hawker, who is in charge of the Thir«l Military District. When I went to the office to which I had been directed, there were three lads sitting at a table, who had not the decency to rise from their seats, or to speak politely, though every No troops have gone to visitor to a public department should, a t least, receive courteous treatment, whatever his position in life may be. InI have not said many public offices, visitors do not receive such treatment. One of the three lads to whom I refer was taking cuttings out of a newspaper. I asked wiiere I could find I am credibly in Colonel Hawker, and one of the lads s a i i to another, "" Jack, give this chap a card, and let him write out what he wants."" I wrote out what I wanted, and asked, '* To whom shall I give the card ?"" Then the lads said each to the others, "" Go on, you take it . "" Is that the way in which to conduct business in a Government I have been told office ? I have received civility at the Base Records Office, and at other offices in the Victoria Barracks; but I certainly was not treated civilly in this instance, although, as I have said, all callers at Government offices, whether they be members of Parliament or private citizens, are entitled to 'civil treatment. If a Minister of Munitions were appointed, we should have some one whom we could hold responsible for the rectification of causes of complaint. If equipment is not being provided quickly enough, let there be a responsible Minister to ascertain why more expedition cannot be used. The Minister could see that If a Comevery recruit was given a uniform as soon as he entered camp, and was supplied w i th a rifle as quickly as possible. I believe that a number of the men have not yet received rifles. The rifle supply could be improved by withdrawing more rifles from the rifle clubs. The first thing \a to get men to enlist, and then they must be properly clothed and equipped. The other day, when travelling by train, a gentleman whom I did not know told mo that his nephew had recently returned from the camp. He said to the lad, "" For goodness' sake, hold yourself together, and t r y to look a soldier,"" and was surprised to get the reply, "" It is pretty hard work trying to look like .1 soldier when I have to wear a hat that I bought for a bob, a tunic for which I gave two bob, and breeches for which I gave 2s.

The answer given to the question I put on the notice-paper, in which the Assistant M in ister of Defence states that a non-commissioned officer took upon himself the responsibility of closing the doors of the barracks at 4 o'clock, without consulting a superior officer, may offer one explanation of why men do not offer themselves more freely. All the men who went to enlist on the day I mentioned put in their day for nothing; and it does not take very much to turn a man away from his object in a matter of this kind. A soldier should be caught at the moment when he is prepared to go on. That is how all the best enlistments take place. There may be other reasons why more men are not coming forward. Surely a man who has served in the BritishA r m y should be fit to serve in Australia, but a case was brought to my notice the other day where a man was rejected because he had on him the marks of an operation. The operation was performed three years ago, and in the meantime the man has been occupied humping bags of sugar. He has had no trouble whatever, and yet, because the medical officer found upon him the marks of the operating knife, lie was turned down; and I was informed that there was absolutely no chance of his passing. for men. kuow where the trouble is. What is the use of going about the country asking for recruits when we know perfectly well that if the doctors can find anything at all the matter with a man they w ill turn him down. The Assistant Minister of Defence has informed me that the main reason why so many men are turned down is because of their teeth. Men are not allowed to go to the f r o n t unless they have a certain number of teeth, including a certain number of molars. If a man has a dental plate he will not be allowed to go. The Assistant Minister told me that the reason for this regulation is that a number of the men who went away with the first detachment, when thoy were at sea, were not too well, and lost their teeth. In other cases tlie platss turned round and nearly choked their possessors. House exactly what the Minister told me, but surely there should be some method of getting over a difficulty of that kind. I do not know whether any honourable members of this House have dental plates, but I do not suppose that if ever they go to sea, and are attacked by sickness, that they lose them; and if this is ""the reason why these men are not allowed to enlist, all I can say is that it is a poor reason, and a large body of men ought not to be turned down solely on that account. I have not the heart to go out to recruiting meetings, to call upon the people to enlist, wben I know perfectly well tliat if they come to Melbourne they will be turned down on such a very slight pretext. There are hundreds of good men in the country willing to go to the front , but who are being kept back because of this state of affairs. During the South African war we were told that unless men had good teeth they would not be able to eat the hard biscuit that would be provided. I suppose the men who went to SouthA f r i ca must have been better sailors than the men who are going to Europe. The men engaged in the present war have not to live on hard biscuits and salt j u n k ; but the whole business requires explanation, for it seems almost as if this pretext is being put forward merely as an excuse to turn down the men. I desire to address a few remarks to the But I want to House on the question of Defence, because it seems to me that this subject overshadows everything else at the preseut moment. A good many centuries ago Belisarius, a celebrated Roman general, told the Emperor Justinian that victory is governed by Providence, but kings and generals are judged ou the success or failure of their designs. In this case victory will rest with Providence, but we here and throughout the rest of the Empire can do something to justify pur attitude towards the war. on the side of the big battalions."" keep your powder dry "" was one eminent officer's maxim.

It seems to me that we have entirely overlooked upon us of not only maintaining, creasing, the production of this We have been told in many that this is a war which concerns only the moneyed classes. If ever there was a war in which the interests of the workers were concerned it is this war.

Is that the way to encourage production in the country, or to help the Empirei n 'the struggle upon which we the necessity which devolves are now engaged? But that Government but inwent a step further, and fixed the price country. of butter. What has been the result of directions that ? I know it to be the simple fact that one of the best herds in New Soutli Wales was turned out because it did not pay the owner to keep his cattle in milk. The price of butter was fixed so low that he could not afford to do this in consideration of the price of fodder and the wages he bad to pay. The outcome of State interference in New South Walesi n this respect has been that production has absolutely decreased, and, in order to overWe live under come the difficulty which their earlier action had created, the Government took cannot a further step, and fixed the price of fodder. Now thousands of tons of l u cerne, which might have been made into hay, are being fed off, for the simple reaIt son that it pays the owner better to do this. Here, again, we have decreased production, and this phase of the In situation strikes right home to the Federal Government, because we all know that the Commonwealth is short of fodder for defence purposes. that huI t will have great difficulty in finding sufficient fodder for the thousands of Then we went a horses which it has to feed, and one of the State Governments has done that which of all things is calculated to cut down the fodder supplies that we require. That, indeed, is the result of the whole system. Tlie more we interfere in the way of fixing prices and imposing restrictions on production, the less our producof which tion will be. It seems to me that we What is happening toshould be able to adapt ourselves to our requirements; but, so far, we have absolutely failed. What has happened within the last week or two? While Australia, with the rest of the Empire, is facing, not as is often said, the greatest crisis of all times, but the greatest crisis of modern times, we see the Prime Minister and his first lieutenant-the Attorney-Generalcasting aside the business of Empire in order to attend a sectional committee. If ever there was a modern instance of Nero fiddling while Rome burned-to compare little things with great things-it surely was when the Prime Minister and his first lieutenant threw aside all the affairs of Empire, all the affairs of civilizationfor civilization as we know it is tottering in the balance-and left the Commonwealth to rock to its very foundations, selves in another State capital, and took their orders from the pick and shovel men of the community. has never been a more flagrant setting aside of the duties put upon a Ministry than occurred when these two Ministers left the affairs of the Commonwealth, in the hands of a Minister who was in no way fitted or empowered to do what they might have done had they remained here. I suggest that we might reasonably deal with the present crisis on lines different from those which have so far been adopted. We might well have a system of rewards rather than of punishments. Up to the present time, with this Government in office, it has been a matter of punishment. Every man is punished for not doing what the Government think he ought to do. They fix the prices of his produce, pile up taxation, and do everything to punish the producer, with the result that they lessen production. We have been told over and over again of the failure of the Government to provide munitions for our boys who are fighting and dying for us at the front . But in addition to this the Government punish those who stay at home by lessening the production which is so necessary for tlie maintenance of the stabilitv of the country, as well as to feed the hungry oversea. If , ' instead of this, they were to in that they would have made a move in the stitute a system of rewards, I think much better results would be secured. If instead of piling up the land tax as they have done, they were to exempt from taxation all land brought under cultivation, there might be some definite, beneficial return. If they were to urge upon the men who particularly support them that they should give the fullest possible return to the community for what they get out of the community, and if they were at the same time to organize the manufacturing and producing interests, as they might readily do, I think we should have on every baud much better results. The Ministry have absolutely failed, not only to realize the importance of this war to the Empire, and to civilization and liberty as we know it , but to take any practical step towards keeping up munitions and supplies for our men at the front, and to increase our production as we must increase it if we are going to pull the Empire safely tlirougli the Titanic struggle in which we are now engaged. The Government should stand whilst they buried themabsolutely condemned in the eyes of the Empire-in the eyes of the men and women whose boys are at tlie front , and There in the eyes of all who believe in the development of Australia and in the maintenance, of freedom as we in Australia know it to-day. If there is any mau in the community who should be doing his best to maintain the position that we occupy as an Empirei t is the man of whom it is usually said, "" He has nothing to lose."" No man can have more to lose than the honour of his wife and the safety of his children. These are the things at stake at the present moment, yet the Ministry continue to fiddle away to the tune of little class interests, that should be put out of sight until we have done with the momentous issues with which we are faced to-day. sire to refer very briefly, and without any party bias, to the momentous question of the part which Australia has taken in the present war. I do not propose to wander over the whole field which such a question opens up, but shall devote myself to one particular matter which appears to me to be the very crux of the whole situation, and to require more consideration than it has yet received from the Government. Had the Government been f u l l y seized of its importance, I feel sure right direction long before now. I am referring, as honourable members will guess, to the Small Arms Factory. Here is undoubtedly the weak link in the chain. We hear a great deal about slackness in the matter of recruiting and of the obstacles thrown in the way of would be",28,Contractors Scarcity Of

All these statements are, yet the fact remains that if more rifles had been available we should have the f r o n t and more recruits offering. The heads of the Defence Department know perfectly well what the difficulty is in this respect, and they undoubtedly are not taking that interest in the recruiting movement which they would otherwise do. I wish to speak of this matter as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, which was able recently to secure considerable information regarding the Small Arms Factory. It was thought by the members of that Committee that the Small Arms Factory, which had been the subject of many and anxious inquiries in this Chamber and elsewhere both as regards its financial position and its output, might very well form bhe first object of its investigations. As far back as 6th February last, the Secretary of the Committee indicated to the Defence Department that we proposed to go into this question. away that the factory was doing its best, and that it would be unwise to intervene with such an inquiry as we proposed. We, therefore, endeavoured to arrange that our investigation would not materia l l y interfere with the work. cognised, of course, that it would be necessary to examine the manager, but principal witnesses would probably be those who were more closely associated with the financial side of the work, so that no lengthened absence from their duties would be required on the part of those who were operating the factory it self. to the Department of Defence, and in order, as we thought, to meet the convenience of the manager, and to obviate any interference with tbe work of the factory, we advised him that we should arrive at Lithgow on a Saturday, and proceed with the inquiry during the afternoon. accommodation for us in the town. When we arrived at Lithgow shortly after noon one Saturday, we found no one to meet us at the station, but discovered that arrangements had been made for our accommodation at an hotel, whither we made our way as best we could. Afr. Pointer. A f t e r lunch we considered how we could best proceed with the duties that we had set out for ourselves. We had still no no doubt, quite reconcilable, information from the management of the factory as to what it was proposed to do. We tlierefore arranged for vehihad to-day more men at cles to convey us to the works. As soon as we reached the grounds we were confronted by a sentry, to whom we explained our business, but who appeared to be quite ignorant of the fact that our visit had been arranged. The officer of the guard was therefore called. He was equally in ignorance of the fact, and, following out his orders no doubt, he politely suggested to us that we should clear out. a plain statement of the facts. I am not blaming either the sentry or the officer of the guard for doing his duty. We went outside the grounds, and then a member of the Committee suggested that, as the manager's residence was not very far distant, the secretary should go there and .inquire whether MrW r i g ht was We were informed straight about and available. The secretary went to the house, aud on his return reported to us that he had met the wife of the manager, who had informed him that Mr Wright was away playing golf. That was rather a bad beginning. There was We reno sign of life or activity at the factory. However, on the following Monday, we started our investigathat, apart from him, the tion, and it was suggested to the manager that it would be a better course for him to wait u n t il others we wished to examine had given their evidence, so that we could question him on any matters that arose during the course of the inquiry. As we were unable to comThese representations were made plete our inquiry at the factory, we arranged with the manager, who was going to Melbourne shortly afterwards, that he should meet us and give his evidence there; but as that time approached we were informed by him that he was unable to leave the factory without the consent of the Minister of Defence, and We also requested him to secure we also had an intimation from the M in ister of Defence that it was undesirable for the manager to leave the factory at that time.

I believe that the work of the factory goes on just as well when the manager is absent as when he is there. However, the next thing to be done was to endeavour to meet MrW r i g h t half way, so we arranged that he should come to Sydnejf to give evidence on the 11th May. Prior to that date, however, he intimated that, as the Public Works Committee was to arrive at the factory in connection with its inquiry about the same time, his visit to Sydney would need to ""be a little later; but we were able to arrange with the Chairman of the Public Works Committee that we should meet the manager of the factory at the time indicated. All through this inquiry one fact has struck me, namely, that the manager has not been particularly anxious to assist the Committee. Now that the Minister has given instructions that a double shift shall be commenced, I am certain that the Government are making a grave mistake in allowing MrW r i g h t to remain at the factory a day longer than is absolutely necessary. nexion with it terminates about the end of August. I believe that I am expressing the opinion of tlie Committee of Public Accounts when I say that all along the principal obstacle to the starting of a double shift has beeu Mr Wright himself ; and how we are to get a second shift put into operation effectively afc the earliest possible moment by a man who all along has declared it to be impossible, I am at a loss to understand. upon the Government that MrW r i g h t should be relieved of his duties at the factory. the assistant manager is the man who is looking after .the new shift. aside, I do not see why he should be there at all. My impression regarding that factory, and its inability to come up to our anticipations, was based to a certain extent on preconceived opinions that the workmen were at f a u l t ; but on going to Lithgow as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts' my mind was entirely disabused of that misapprehension. I. found that the men were of a very high class indeed, both as artisans and as in dividuals. leaders of the sections were exceptionally intelligent men, and there was a remarkable unanimity among the men that a second shift could and should be instituted at the earliest possible moment. I had, therefore, to discover other reasons than that the men were at f a u l t in this regard, and I have been forced to the conclusion, most unwillingly, that the obstacle to an improvement in the output of the factory is the manager. The Committee of Public Accounts has supplied Parliament with a report upon the general conditions of the factory from a financial stand-point; but as the members of the Committee could not f a i l to observe other things, it is their duty to express themselves f u l l y and freely on what appears to be an important matter in connection with the part Australia is taking in the war. I say, without hesitation, that the fact that MrW r i g h t has been in control of this factory during this period has been a misfortune to Australia. expert? 1 understand that his conabout his technical qualifications; but it does appear to me that he has lacked tact in dealing with the men, and is deficient in powers of organization. All along there appears to have been a very lamentable lack of co-ordination in the factory for which we cannot find any explanation than in the short-comings of the manager. We were unable to discover that, although the factory was short of raw material, any special effort had been I urge it made to overcome the shortage, even at a time when it was obvious that every energy and effort should have been used by the management in order to bring the factory to its very highest possible pitch of perfection.

We had evidence at the factory that tliere were many men in Australia trained to a class of work nearly akin to that which would be required from them in a small arms factory, and that a very short experience in the factory itself would make them perfectly competent. machinery in the factory is almost automatic, and none of it would be very difficult to be handled by the ordinary trained mechanic. such industries as motor-car repairing shops, men who could, in a very little while indeed, work effectively the vast bulk of the machinery employed in the manufacture of small arms. There are one or two positions in the factory for which special training is required, but I have no hesitation in saying that we could find the men, not only for a second shift, but also for a third shift, inside two, or at the most, three months. we would need to pay the men well in view of the importance of their work, but I feel certain that we would have that enthusiastic support and loyalty from the men that would make a very great improvement in the output of rifles. I trust that the Government will take the suggestions that I am making in the spirit in which they are offered. Minister of Defence should have discovered this situation for himself without waiting to have it pointed out by two Parliamentary Committees, but I am quite prepared to admit that possibly he thought the opinion of the manager was sufficient. It was not. I think that circumstances will prove that what I say now with regard to the manager is f u l l y justikeep tlie Factory going. fied, and I hope that Mr Wright will be relieved of his attendance at the factory as soon as possible. every effort will be made to obtain the men who, I know, are to be found in Australia, who can apply themselves to the production of these rifles two-fold or three-fold, and in this way enable the Government to overcome the essential difficulty that has met the Commonwealth in regard to the part it is playing in the war. questionably we are face to face at the present moment w i th the gravest difficulties that have ever confronted Australia. We have a great obligation to the Empire, because it has befriended and helped us in every possible way. Australia was given autonomy, and I believe that at heart our people are thoroughly loyal. But loyalty requires that we shall not only talk, but do; and not only do, but do our best; and as time goes on it seems to become more evident that, no Most of the matter how strong the desire may be that we should do our best, that best has not been accomplished. We have listened to a sorry tale from the honorWe have in Australia, in able member for Perth, who has told us that the manager of one of our works for producing essentials of war has been disloyal. ber's statement amounted to that. That manager was so recalcitrant that he was not ready to give evidence to a properlyappointed Committee of this Parliament, and, in the judgment of the honourable Of course, member for Perth, that gentleman has been the means of preventing the Factory turning out the f u l l number of rifles which it is capable of producing. In other words, the manager has opposed the institution of a second shift. I am in agreement with the mass of the people that the Factory should be kept going continuously, to the l i m it of its capacity. It The is useless to talk about installing a larger plant for tlie output of more rifles, because probably no increase """"could be obtained unti l the war is over. W h a t is wanted is an increased output immediately, but that does not seem possible. Why? If that Factory had been under the control of private individuals, self interest would have prompted them to But under Government control the establishment works only one shift of twelve hours, I hope also that which, in the opinion of some people, involves overworking the men, so that the output is little, if any, greater than it would be if a shorter shift were worked. What power is there behind the manager of any Government-controlled factory to compel him to do what is his obligationhis best? I venture to think that the present Government have some earnestness of purpose, and-if they thought they could force the pace in regard to the Small Arms Factory they would have done so, so that more rifles could have been produced and more men sent to",32,Contractors Scarcity Of

Of course, the policy of the Government is that factories producing material for the State should be owned and controlled by the State, but the more we see of those establishments, the more we realize the f u t i l it y of the hope that a factory controlled by the Government can do better than a factory controlled by private enterprise. How is it possible for a Government kept in office by Labour men to force Labour men to do what they do not wish to do? They cannot, and if the Minister of HomeA f fairs were to face the facts fairl y and squarely he would admit that to .be the position. The Government cannot be the controllers and the controlled at the one time. There is another Defence matter to which I wish to refer. I am not afc all sure whether the Government do or do not want more recruits. Sometimes w-j seem to be encouraged to induce the young men to enlist, and at the present time there are in the streets of Melbourne posters, the purpose of which is the stimulating of recruiting, but we are told that often when men come forward they are discouraged before they can have the opportunity to enlist. Honourable members -ought to be able to go into the country and urge all young men to enlist, but when there is a doubt as to whether men can be equipped when they do become enrolled, our argument loses its force. receives a very serious setback by incidents such as that I w ill now relate to the Committee. A good many married men have enlisted on the supposition that their wives and families would receive a sufficient allowance from the Defence Department to provide for their wants. A t least five wives of men who have gone to the fron t have approached me, and stated that their husbands had sacrificed their ordinary income to go to the front , but the Department had failed to give them the pay which it was pledged to give. I will mention a specific case. About the 1st JuneI received a letter from Mrs. Mary Rosser, the wife of a man who went to the front, and the mother of four children. She had written to the Department to complain that no pay had been received by her; she was in need of money for the maintenance of herself and children, but the Department had failed to comply with her request. Consequently, she addressed herself to me, and I handed her letter to the Assistant Minister of Defence, who promised to in vestigate the matter. On the 11th JuneI received this replyWith reference to a letter from Mrs. Mary Bosser, relative to her husband's pay, passed by you to the Assistant Minister of Defence, I beg to inform you that a report is being obtained, immediately upon receipt of wbich you will be further communicated with. Obviously a week is a matter of no great concern to the Defence Department, but to a woman who has to maintain herself and four children, and has no money with which to procure food for them, it is a very long time. I have now received from the unfortunate woman this piteous appeal, which I think it is the duty of the Minister of Home Affairs to bring under the notice of tlie Minister of Defence, with the request that it be immediately inquired intoDear Sir, As I have had no further reply from the Defence Department, your letter of the 3rd June was the last, for which I must thank you. It is hard to tliink that a wife and four children are left to beg, and nothing can be done. As for my husband not been traced, his clothes has been sent home since I wrote to you, so his name must be found somewhere. Trusting you can help me, and to hear from you soon, I Temain, MABV IJOSSEN. This case is not only a hardship to the woman, but such happenings have their effect on recruiting. Mrs. Rosser lives in Enlistment a country town, and I venture to say that her case is known to every person resident there. In that town a meeting has been called for the purpose of encouraging young men to go to the front , but what chance is tliere of inducing men to come forward for enlistment when the wife of a mau from that district has been treated in the way I have described ?

Having regard to the fact that Australia is part of the British Empire, and that in every other part the governing factors have been brought together, and by that action have united the people for common defence against the common foe, I cannot help expressing regret that the position is so different in Australia. also, that the Prime Minister, when questioned a few days ago regarding his attitude towards purely party politics, replied that there was no party politics about the Government policy, because every proposal they would bring forward would be for the welfare of Australia. too! that remark hy the Prime Minister was only a quibble. that the Referenda Bills are distinctly partisan in character. tions.

I propose to draw attention to some of these suggestions, which make it appear that there are honourable members of the party opposite who desire to see economy practised I hope that this does not mean that necessary work in connection with the war will be curtailed. For instance, as reported on page 4705 of Hansard, ex-Senator Rae statedTliere is no reason for our military expendilast year, I am questioning it this year, beture to keep on growing at tlie rate at which it grow during the term of oflice of the late .Administration. On page 3540 the honourable member for Melbourne Ports statesI t is generally known that I have not been in favour of thu excessive expenditure on defence that has been incurred, and to which we are committed. On page 3742 the honourable member for Denison statesI should like, too, to hear that there is to be A diminution of our terrible defence expenditure, thu burden of which is now almost heavier than we can bear. I hope the time will come when some restrictions will be placed on our defence expenditure. On page 3850 the honourable member for Darwin statesI congratulate honourable members who yesterday pointed out tlie iniquity of throwing awity millions on thc defence system, and going beyond the actual necessities of Australia. On page 3786 the honourable member for Brisbane saysThis is expenditure which cannot be recommended on the highest grounds. If we were a sane and civilized people? we should see that such expenditure is unproductive and unnecessary in the highest degreea waste of money We are discussing -and that what is now spent in defence could be better spent in the development of the country. It is time this House stepped in and said, -"" This is too much."" To go further, I might point out that on page 2951 the honourable member for Ballarat is reported to have statedI think the people of Australia will find it impossible to bear this burden. The honourable member referred to Defence expenditure. All these utterances I shall endeavour to lead me to the conclusion that it may be possible, wheu the B ill is introduced, to find in it evidences of economy in a direction that, I think, at the present moment w ill be against the public welfare. I have a number of other quotations from speeches by honourable members of this House and of the other House. Senator Stewart is reported, on page 4707 of Hansard, as having said'.Not only do I think that we are spending too much on defence, but I tliink we arc spending it in the wrong way. On page 4712 Senator Long statedin regard to Defence. I wish to ally myself with Senator Stewart, who has laid down the doctrine that the safety of Australia lies in the development of our land Forces. Without cavilling in any sense at the naval expenditure to which Australia has been committed, I wish to say that, although I voted willingly for this expenditure cause I believe that if we made a mistake yesterday we ought to be prepared to admit the fact to-day. I have made these quotations simply because I am afraid that there may be some evidences of economy in ' regard to munitions and equipment when the B ill comes on for discussion. press that the Australian Forces were the best equipped forces at the front. leads me to ask whether, although we have a Government' in power whioh is supposed to be doing all it possibly can, that Government is not in earnest' over this matter?

A man in such a position should receive every consideration from us.

If a mau finds that he cannot enroll in our own Forces, but finds a place in the Imperial Army, he is fighting just as much for Australia in Prance or Flanders, or even in It a l y or Russia, as are our Forcesi n Gallipoli. I applied, to the Government for information as to the Imperial rates of pav, and was officially informed by the Secretary of the Department that the Department could not inform me as to what the rates were, but ultimately the Department obtained the information. A paragraph appeared in the A.r/e on the 3rd of this month, in whioh I find the followingI n response to inquiries by members of tlio Federal Parliament, documents were yesterday laid on tlie table of tbe House. Evidently the document has not yet been circulated, but this paragraph is a reprint, and no doubt the figures given are correct. They show that privates in the United Kingdom are paid l s . per day, whereas the Australian rate is 6s. per day. Obviously for us to allow a reservist to leave Australia and serve in the I m perial A r m y , and expect his wife and family here to live on his pay, would be asking the impossible. In the UnitedK in g dom, lieutenants are paid from 7s. 6d. to 9s. 6d. per day, whereas the Australian rate is 17s. 6d. per day. So there is a big disparity between the Imperial rates and ours. The Imperial rate of 7s. 6d. per day wil l not provide much for the . upkeep of a. lieutenant's family. Captains receive in the United Kingdom fro m 12s. 6d. to 14s. 6d. per day. In the Australian Forces, a captain is paid £ 1 2s. 6d. Eveni f the Ministryf e lt that they could not grant the concession in regard to the higher officers, they might do so in regard to the lower ranks. When these men leave Australia, where they have established their homes,' and have incurred obligations in the making of those homes, we should see that when they go to the f r o n t , where they are fighting for Justice should us as well as for Great Britain, they are treated on the same footing as that of our own officers. under the notice of the Minister. it sympathetically. The case t h a t ' I have brought forward is a pressing one. The letter sets out reasonsI do not want to go into tliem-bu t the Minister will see that there are reasons which will make him sympathetic. I rose primarily -to press this question, because I do think it is an important one. One does like to think that Imperial officers who are retirin g should be encouraged to settle in Australia. There was a strong movement some time ago in this direction, and I think after the war we shall probably be just as keen to approach this matter again. I do not now wish to press it any further, as the Minister has assured me that he w ill give it consideration. There is one other question that I wish to deal w it h before I resume my seat, and that is this: I do wish the Ministry could see their way t.o accept the offer that was made by the Opposition to lay aside, for the time being, all questions of a party political character, and combine the energies .of the whole Parliament in ' the direction of carrying on the war itself.

312,Mr Gregory,"I believe in indusists who were hounded down for years? night the action of the New South Wales Government in black-listing and hounding down men employed on the Government trawlers; apparently there is black-listing all round. My object in rising is to urge that every effort should be made to secure the co-operation of all parties in the pregun, or one field piece, which could be sent great national struggle. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports said this evening that good old private enterprise is being knocked out. Has not private enterprise been responsible for the building up of Australia ? There are in this Commonwealth a large number of big engineering enterprises controlled by p r i vate people, and the Government have placed on the Munitions Advisory Board, That gentleman, when giving evidence before the Public Works Committee in regard to his large works at Sunshine, said that he never asked an employee whether he was a unionist or not; all he was in terested in was in knowing that a man was a good worker. A r e we to underpart from that policy, and adopt preference to unionists, before his establishment will be allowed to carry out any work for the Government? Such a restriction would be scandalous. that reason and common sense will in duco 'the Government to endeavour to get a system of co-operation amongst ill classes of the people, so that Australia may do its best in the international struggle. Why did not the Government introduce preference to unionists in connection with their call for recruits? The Prime Minister has said that soldiers will be properly treated when they return to Australia; but why has the House had no statement of what the Government propose to do in that regard? In my opinion, a motion should be tabled which would compel honourable members to show by their votes whether or not they are in favour of returned soldiers receiving preference throughout the Government service, irrespective of whether they are unionists or not. A good deal has been said in regard to the proposals of the Minister of Defence for increasing the output of munitions of war. According to the Prime-Minls^rt induiries are being f made in England in regard'to machinery [150]2 for the manufacture in Australia of 18pounder field pieces, machine guns, and I mentioned last shells. The Prime Minister tried to make the House believe that the object of the Government was to endeavour to manufacture these munitions of war for use in the present conflict. Is there the slightest chance of the production with that machinery of one shell, or one machine used in this war? The Government know that it is absolutely impossible to produce one of those items within the next two years. Their desire is merely to build up a b i g Socialistic enterprise in which they can employ union labour to their heart's content. Of what use is . all this rhodomontade, when we know it would be impossible for the Government to manufacture one 18-pounder gun, one machine gun, or one shell within the next two years? What would be the use of that, so f a r as the prosecution of the present war is concerned? In connection w i th the position at the Small Arms Factory, we had a statement from the Minister of Defence that some eight months ago he gave in structions that two shifts were to be worked there. I pointed out last night that, if it had not been for the reports of the two Committees that have inquired into this matter, no action would have I hope been taken up to the present time. The Minister says that the instructions he gave have not been repealed; but he was responsible for those instructions, and for seeing that they were carried out. He could have told Captain Clarkson and others who were associated w i th the establishment of the factory that the Government wanted more rifles produced. He might have told Captain Clarkson that he was one of those who had made investigations regarding the establishment of the factory; that he had organized it , and worked there for some time; and that he, with others, should go to the factory and see whether more rifles could not be manufactured there. No ; the Minister, instead of doing that, slept upon the matter. We have been told that there was a shortage of material for rifle stocks. Tenders were called for the supply of a quantity of timber suitable for the purpose, and the manager, Mr. W ^ ««f%8 l i We * "" ^ ? ? * ^ w c ; . ..

Can any one imagine that, in time of war, tenders for these supplies should bave had to be called twice? Instructions should have been given for the immediate purchase of the logs required, no matter what the cost might be; but no action of this kind was taken. According to Mr Wright, these logs were ordered from.two Sydney firms. They were to be of Queensland maple, and would be obtained from Cairns. According to tbe manager bf the factory, timber enough for 100,000 stocks could have been obtained from Queensland, but no action was taken to obtain, it. Does that look as if the authorities of the Defence Department have been in earnest in the matter? even now. .to do so. ..Are the Government really anxious to send more men to the front ? able gentleman's answer to that question ? it is for honourable members opposite to answer it. I have been surprised to find so little effort made by Ministers to encourage recruiting. I take the case of the Postmaster-General, and I remind honourable members that, while our big banking corporations have Agreed to keep their positions open ,for. . those of their employees who, enlist, and have agreed, further, to make up the difference between their pay as soldiers and the salaries they have been receiving, according to all accounts obstacles are placed in the way of would be recruits from the Post and Telegraph Department; by thc Postmaster General. .

I did not see the contradiction of the statement which appeared in the Argus. It might be of interest to the vacillating Minister of Home Affairs to learn that when we were making some investigations a short time ago, we saw a plant at Alcock's, here in Melbourne, for the electric artificial seasoning of timber. I suggest to the Minister that some of our best timbers might be sent to these people to be electrically seasoned. If this were done we might discover a means b | overcoming a difficulty which might arise at any time from a shortage of suitable timber. Honourable members"" will understand that perfectly seasoned timber is necessary for the manufacture of billiard tables. To experiment in the way I propose on a large scale would be costly, but a trial experiment in a small way would be well worthwhile. The statement has been made that it was impossible to institute a second shift at the Small Arms Factory because of a lack of sufficient steel and other material.

Clarkson's not. The Committee made a special study of the question, and felt quite justified in recommending two shifts. I do not think one member of the Committee would recommend the establishment of three shifts at the present time.

349,Under Twelve,"hour Mr ATKINSON We do not want toThese great papers are not altogether uninformed on public topics; tbey know tliat the situation is serious, and that not only the best minds in Parliament, but the whole community, should be galvanized into thinking alike, and acting for the common good. The Government have an opportunity to do it if they will only fcake it . Every man owes a duty to the Empire, and if the Government will not do what the Opposition requests them to do, all that is l e f t for us is to sit here and offer healthy criticism to t r y to keep the Government up to the right pitch until the termination of the struggle. If Parliament were not sitting, and the Government were free to devote all their attention to the one issue, far greater results would be achieved in a great deal less time. There is an impression in somo quarters that the Opposition desire thc creation of a Coalition Ministryi n order to secure positions of pay and profit. I am not aware of any move from this side to get the Government to . do any such thing. No member of the Opposition would think of joining such a Ministry unless requested to do so by the Prime Minister himself. It is apparent that in some parts of the country there are people who really think that the Opposition are suggesting a Coalition Ministry for selfish and ulterior motives. There is no truth in that suggestion. first raised in this House by the honourable member for Bendigo. He put to the Prime Miuister the question that gave rise to the idea. that. able members opposite to point to any request made by this side to the Government to seriously consider the formatiou of a Coalition Ministrv. I do not wish at this stage to criticise the Government harshly or unfairly, although the Minister of Defence has been extremely lax ou one or two occasions. For instance, two Committees of tbe House have recommended, the institution of a second shift at the Small Arms Factory, but the M in ister of Defence says that ten months ago he wanted a second shift"" there. He is the responsible Minister, and the man to whom Australia looks for a lead on the question of munitions. Why did not ne institute a second shift? The Amalgamated Society of Engineers, many of whom I happened to see when the Public Accounts Committee was takingevidence at the factory, were a l l willing to work a second shift, and, in fact, all suggested it . They could see no difficulty in the way of having a second shift in satisfactory working order within two or three months. Yet ten months ago the Minister of Defence had this brilliant idea of a second shift, and was going to institute it , but never did so. . The manager of the factory may have advised the Minister that it was impracticable, but why is the Minister putting in the second shift now? The manager's opinion to-day is what it was eight months ago-o r what it was when he gave evidence before the Public Works Committee in Sydney recently. I do not want to criticise the Minister of Defence. No one can criticise him more harshly than he has criticised himself. Take, for instance, the matter of shells. The Minister says it is difficult to get formulse, and that he has been trying to' obtain formula? for months and months. Yeti f the actions of the Minister are analyzed, step by step, great gaps will be found wherein he did nothing. Why? He does not explain. The Minister now is taking something like what I consider to be the right course, in appointing an expert Committee to go into this question The question was of munitions. approval ? it goes; but I would far sooner see a Committee that was not composed so It was raised long before largely of men from his own Department. I know nothing about them individually, I challenge honor-* but they may be the very men who have been responsible for the inactivity of the Department during the past ten monthsthe very men whose advice may have been keeping the whole thing back. I do not say this is soI do not knowbut, in my opinion, it would be far better to have a Committee upon which captains of industry, good business men, would be represented. These are the men who may be relied upon to do something, because they know the ins and outs of trade. A Committee of this House, would have to spend a lot of timeacquiring information before it reached the position a Committee composed of such men as I have indicated would occupy a t t.he start.

It is a thing of the present and the future, and it would be a fatal mistake if , in preparing to supply munitions, the Government did not recognise this fact. to volunteer, and you ought to lead the wav. to volunteer. An Honorable MEMBER -D o it now. to do my share. few men we can spare. I should be of as much use as some of my honourable friends. But the point is that the war is going on, and munitions and clothes are wanted now. I understand there are clothes made to the order of the Defence Department that cannot be removed from factories in Australia because inspectors have not been round to stamp them. Business men would not allow a thing like that to happen. round ? surely when clothes are wanted so acutely"" by the troops they should not be left for any length of time in the factories where they have been made, simply because inspectors cannot find time to put a brand on them. One good business man could remedy this in a very short time, but when it is left to the Defence Department, goodness only knows when >t will be done. These equipments have to be found now, not in the distant future, when some socialistic enterprise may be able to find them; and I want to lay stress on this point, because I hope that in whatever is done business people-the people who will get things done in something like reasonable time-wil l be brought in. I can give no^better illustratiqn^f .wha**I^refer to ^ a n j h a t providedi by the Small Arms Factory. It is interesting to look at the history of this factory, and I refer to this as being calculated to show how much more satisfactory private enterprise is at the present time than socialistic undertakings. What may be the state of affairs in a hundred years hence I do not know. .Socialistic enterprises may suit that period, but they do not suit the present period; and what we have to do has to be done now. You have been three years dilly-dallying with a Woollen Factory, and it is not going yet. But to come back to the Small Arms Factory. On 24th September, 1907, the then Minister of Defence, Sir Thomas Ewing, introduced the matter to the House by placing a sum of £32,000 on the Estimates for the erection of a factory. According to the explanation he gave to the House, this £32,000 represented an instalment of the cost of the machinery. He told the House that the total cost would be £65,000 for machinery, but that he only wanted £32,000 then, because that was all he could spend during that year. In addition to'that sum, the Minister explained, £10,000 would be required for buildings, and the House was led to believe that £75,000 would build and equip the factory. him in the matter? whether I was, or whether I was^not. That does not affect my argument. Thomas Ewing's opinion of the present Leader of the Opposition? think the Minister would be showing himself a little more fitted for his position in these serious times if he would take a little interest in the business of the House. It is all very well for him to sit there as perky as a cock sparrow, but that attitude does not win battles. Sir Thomas Ewing promised that in about eighteen months or two years the factory would be turning out about fifty rifles per day, or 150 rifles daily if it worked three shifts. that he had great faith.

365,Mr Archibald,"That merely showsat the present time it is rifles and munitions that we require-no t faith. The rifle which we were importing at the time Sir Thomas Ewing was Minister of Defence was costing us £5 7s. Nearly two years passed before tenders were accepted for the installation of machinery at the Small Arms Factory. It was estimated that that machinery would cost £68,000. About the time of which I am speaking a paper was submitted to this Parliament showing that the machinery, plant, and the motive power of the factory would cost, approximately, £92,144. The cost of the rifle was estimated at £3 9s. l d . .But what has been the result ? Up to the SOth November last we had expended on plant, machinery, buildings, and equipment £182,186, and the rifles were costing more than £7 each. The Defence Department has muddled the entire business. If we wish to contrast Government action with private enterprise, we have merely to turn our eyes to Newcastle, where the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company have erected a plant worth £2,000,000a plant which is turning out steel rails to-day, although nothing like two years have elapsed since the establishment was projected. I say that we have merely to look at what has been accomplished at Mount Lyell and Newcastle to realize the difference that exists between Government work and work undertaken by private pnterprise. I say that the Defence Department should have taken expert advice in connection with the establishment of a Small Arms Pactory. I need hardly remind honourable members that there are very few of these factories in the world to-day. Sir Thomas Ewing thought that the estimates placed before him were correct, and Parliament accepted them in good faith. We now know that they have been very greatly exceeded. I wish to urge upon the Government the desirableness of endeavouring to organize as quickly as possible all the industrial resources of the Commonwealth, with a view to the production of munitions of war. In this matter we must recollect that time is th© essence of the contract. When I was fighting the last general election I found that it was impossible to secure good attendances at my meetings if I talked on ordinary political subjects, and, consequently,*.! hadMi'6 option but to 'discuss the f war. we might have for the future, they must be left in abeyance until we had succeeded in humbling the foe. I pointed out that if Australia were to pass into the hands of Germany it would be idle for us to make plans. We know that Mr Lloyd George recently stated that the production of munitions is one of our chief troubles. Ten months have passed since the outbreak of war, and nothing has been done towards ensuring the manufacture of shells. The Minister for Defence is now attempting to do something, but if he wishes to expedite action in this direction he must call in the captains of industry. The Department has no experts who are capable of organizing our industrial resources. The oflicials are not experts in this matter, and lack the necessary experience. Advantage should be taken of the splendid offers that have been mado by private individuals, and by the State Governments, to expedite the production of urgently-required munitions. Monaro) [9.3] I do not intend to review the history of the Small Arms Factory. It seems to me that an impartial observer,"" upon reading our newspapers, must be astonished at the proceedings of this National Parliament. The truth is that we are engaged in debating all sorts of party questions, and that the party spirit is being exhibited upon both sides of the House. Such conduct is nothing short of disgraceful. Looking around this chamber, would anybody believe that we are at war; that our 1 men are being killed at the front; and fihat we require Jjo, focus all our attention upon the production of munitions, clothing, and rifles, if we are to bring this war to a successful issue? This evening, the honourable member for Wilmot has stated that he knows tliere is clothing in our factories said that I understood that there is. heard the statement made elsewhere.

I should be very glad to have first pot at them. safe. orable member may regard this matter jocularly; but men who treat such a serious subject in that way ought to have their heads bumped against a stone wall, and. I would have very much pleasure in bumping them. I am not going to join in the chorus of abuse of the Minister of Defence. I have a great respect for Senator Pearce, and he is having a very trying time, and needs help. The debate this evening has conclusively proved that bhe Minister ought to be in this House to answer for himself. The Government should appoint the honourable member for Maranoa as Minister of War or Minister of Munitions, to answer in this House all questions relating to defence. He knows what war means. He has faced the music of the guns, and is not likely to deal in a lighthearted way with any question relating to the war. I suggest that the Government should appoint him, or some other member of this House, as Minister of War or Munitions, so that we may have here a responsible Minister to answer our inquiries regarding the defence of this country, and to attend to these vital considerations. It is a disgrace to the Commonwealth that it should be possible for. such statements to be made as we sometimes hear in respect of defence matters. I have heard, for instance, that the gentleman on whose recommendation a second shift was not introduced in the Small Arms Pactory was the agent of the American company which supplied the machinery installed, in that factory, and that the fact that a second shift was not inaugurated would mean for that firm a repeat order for £100,000 worth of machinery. A Minister who would take the advice' of an interested man on a matter of bhat'kind would stand condemned. anything of the kind in evidence. evehte,'-when'I hear a statement bf tfiis ; kind,' I', am prepared to repeat it in the House, believing that it should be ventilated here. If any of these allegations are wrong, then any reference made to them in our debates will be censored. I am not afraid to state what I hear. I am not surprised at the assertion that has been made by the honourable member for Corangamite as to the inability of soldiers to obtain uniforms, and the further statement that there are uniforms in the factories awaiting inspection by officers who are too tired to inspect them, because many of these inspectors observe what fs known as the "" Government stroke."" We know what that means. The"" Government stroke"" means doing the least amount of work for the greatest amount of pay. I am not going at this stage to debate the question of private enterprise versus Socialism. This is not the time to consider where the rifles or the uniforms for our troops shall be secured. We want them, and must have them. The Minister of Home Affairs, who is at present in charge of the Committee, should be making a note of these complaints, instead of reading Hansard or a novel, as he is doing at the table at the present time. the honourable member's speeches. regard to the intelligent way in which the Minister has taken notice of what has been said, I am surprised to hear that he can read at all. He should at leastehave the common decency to take a note of the damning statements which have been made during this debate, and to see that a reply is furnished to-morrow as to their truth or otherwise. I am opposed to the ""Government stroke."" In many avocations in this country men have not been doing more than two hours' work a day. Decent men working . alongside them are quite ashamed of them. There are a lot of hypocrites in this Parliament. I may be classed amongst the number for my failurieTto speak of many of these matters; but I cannot help saying that' the way in which money is being wasted is damnable.

This Parliament is becoming a disgrace to the Commonwealth. The way in which its business is being conducted is a public scandal. I do not blame the Government for all of it , b u t there is certainly being displayed in the House behaviour which makes it more of a circus than a deliberative assembly. of our proceedings by those who have sons and friends at the front? If honourable members are unable to realize the responsibilities of their position, we shall have the people talking presently of hanging some of them up to the nearest lamp post. Let us drop this funny business, show the people that we realize our responsibilities, and that we are determined to give serious and earnest consideration to the matters brought before us. We, on this side, no doubt, will t r y to fbrward the interests of our party just as the Labour party w ill t r y to forward their interests; but I appeal to honourable members at a time like this to forget all questions of party. We should stand to gether as one man. I do not suggest forone'moment that all'the able and sincere men 'in tlie Parliament are to be found in the Opposition ranks. Neither can it be said that they are to be found only on I cannot understand any man conthe Government side. A t the same time, I do not favour any coalition, because L do not think our views are likely to assiSuch milate any more than oil and water .will mix. But the Leader of the Opposition, speaking ou behalf of every member of his party, has said to the Government, "" Go ahead with your war expenditure, we w ill help you in any reasonable proposal that you choose to make, but let us I have known drop this cursed party fighting at the present juncture."" The Leader of the Opposition has spoken fairly, and I urge the Government to accept his offer. The Parliament should be prorogued to enable Ministers to attend to the important work with which they have to deal. If that were done I think we should speedily have a better state of affairs. Asi t is, nasty ""things are being said outside. I have heard it said of honourable members opposite, that judging by the way in which a lot of them are acting, one would imagine that they were pro-Germans. I do not share that view. I believe the Government are sincere and earnest, and. I certainly wish to cast no reflection oo the Minister of Home Affairs, because I believe that he is thoroughly sincere. But we are face to face with the most serious crisis in the life of the Commonwealth. Let us face the situation boldly, free from any consideration of whether the questions with which we have to deal affect any particular party. Let us encourage recruiting, and send more men to the front . The people insist that this What must be the view taken shall be done. It is for the Government to take the lead. I am prepared to do all that I can to assist them, and there are honourable, members on both sides who are anxious to do everything possible to encourage recruiting, but I repeat that the Government must give us the lead. Let us send more men to the front , and provide for their proper equipment. And above all tilings, do not let us turn this Parliament into a circus. We should respond to the national call just as the. Imperial Parliament has done. L e t us do the right thing by our boys, who are spilling their blood for us, so that after tbe war is over we may be able to say that we have played our part-like men.

377,Mr Richard Foster (Wakefield),"member for Eden-Monaro a speech dictated by a very keen sense of public duty. I hope that the debate to-day will lead this Parliament to do the first things first. Our first duty is to concentrate all our energies, all the energies and resources of the people and the country, upon an effort to bring this war to a successful issue. In the Imperial Parliament Mr Asquith confessed that experience had compelled him to recogniseThat there should be a broadening of the basis of Government in order to eliminate even the semblance of a one-sided party character. The coalition would demonstrate to the people at home, their fellow subjects overseas, the Allies, neutrals, and even their enemies, that Britons were more resolute than ever to obliterate all distinctions and to unite every politithat regard by a very long way. It is usecal, moral, and material force in the prosecution of their cause. The position before us to-day, sir, is one absolutely unparalleled in history, and Mr Asquith's message was directly addressed to every part of the Empire. ""We have now, and have had ever since the war began, a powerful and continuous appeal from the principal newspapers of Australia to this Parliament to set aside everything possible, so that all its attention might be devoted to securing the maximum of efliciency in the part that we are playing in the great war which is convulsing a very great portion of the world. I was very pleased indeed this morning to read an inspiring and powerful appeal from the Melbourne Age to this House to lay aside all party considerations; and the appeal was more powerful, because that newspaper advocated even deferring the consideration of the Tariff for the present. that we ought to go on with the Tariff. that that desire of the Age will be endorsed by all the people of this continent who have the true instincts of humanity; and it will be endorsed by the 50,000 homes in Australia which are directly connected with the war, because they have sons either fighting in the trenches now or preparing to make a supreme sacrifice, even to lay down their lives for Australia, for the Empire, and for the liberties of the human race. If it is necessary for appeals tp be multiplied and strengthened we have'*the daily casualty list, and, unfortunately, i? is growing in seriousness every day. Surely these appeals ought to move the heart of every man in this Parliament when he remembers the part which our boys are playing at the front. The least we can expect is that, for their sakes, and for the sake of those who are going to follow them as long as ever it is necessary, we should lay aside everything for this first and chief consideration; that we may be enabled to harness all the resources of Australia for the effective prosecution of this great work, in order that we may insure a victory, whicli is sure to come, but secure the victory with as little sacrifice of human life as possible. We have not secured the maximum of efliciency in less to hide or suppress the fact, because the more we realize what the position actually is, and the more we realize that we have not done all that we can, the more likely we are to be more successful in the days to come than we have been in the days that have passed. We want not only to drop party on the surface, but to drop it in any and every regard where it affects and diminishes the efficiency of our efforts in this greatest conflict in history. The Government know, and know unmistakably, that, as regards preparations for the troops, there has been anything but efliciency in some of the Departments. They have the report of Mr McC. Anderson, and let me say her.ejj;hat we have not the whole of the report as submitted to the Government. It has been censored; it has been revised; and we only have what is on the very face »of the document stated to be an epitome. The Government may possibly have excellent reasons for withholding some part of the report. I am not going to find fault with them at this moment; but I do say that the report, as it stands, is eloquent testimony to the fact that we have had anything but efliciency, so far as war preparations are concerned. Tliere is a desire to create another Government factory. That cannot be justified by any commercial or other considerations at this moment. We ought to organize, and, if necessary, to commandeer private' factories, because we want immediate results. I regret exceedingly that we should have submitted to us*a proposal which .cannot bear any fruit? so far as^productive^-purposes are concerned until a period, I hope, long",52,Foster Rugged Socialism Or Not The State Should Seize

380,Mr Richard Fosteri Believe,"after the war w ill have been successfully instead of the promotion of industrial completed. But we have the industrial agencies of Australia in existence to-day. There is a means of organizing these in stitutions and industries in the shape of the general committee which brings all the Chambers of Commercei n ' Australia into' touch and focuses their operations. In forty-eight hours the Minister of Defence, through this body, could arrive at facts and data that a Commission r u n in the ordinary way would take as many days to secure. Eveni n this very city of Melbourne the Defence Department, through the Chamber of Commerce, could set to work and within a few hours, by the touch of electric buttons, ascertain the extent of the resources of these organizations. By placing the Government's requirements before these bodies, direct and effective results would be obtained very speedily. In association with these captains of industry a proper number of industrial workers could be associated, and the co-operative efforts of such, a united body would result in production a hundred-fold better than anything we have yet achieved. Labour has come forward in the Old Worldi n a most handsome manner to assist the Imperial Government in this tremendous business, and in many directions has said that during the currency of the war it is prepared to suspend any industrial conditions which might operate against the largest production that is humanly possible. He*re in Australia, however, the position is the very reverse. Instead of Labour being prepared to remove restricting industrial conditions, they have been multiplied. We have heard the statement of the honourable member for Wilmot as to clothing awaiting inspection in some of the factories for a considerable time; but I know that nearly all the principal factories in South Australia, with the finest possible equipment of machinery, are practically idle, so far as war requisites are concerned, because the unions in Australia, inversely to the unions at Home, are prepared to enforce all their restrictions, and even to increase them. It is not so long since there was introSouth Australia, regulation 31A, which meant bringing in the walking delegate. to do with the-,creation of munitions?

He is the most f r u it f u l source we have of industrial strife and industrial inefficiency and shrinkage of production, with consequent increase in the cost of living to the very people whom the honourable member and his friends are supposed to represent in this House. The factories in South Australia are controlled by a State Government official, whose business it is to watch the conditions under which the factory the courage to tall the Federal Government that he would nob have their walking delegate in his factory, while nearly a l l ofhis employees signed a statement 4 that he was a model employer, and that their conditions were excellent. I can readily understand the ridicule displayed by my honourable friends opposite upon this particular question at a time of war, when our very existence and our f u t u re are imperilled. the Federal Government not to apply these severe restrictions. In regard to the equipment of the first and. second contingents from South Australia, the military authorities there had very largely a free hand, and, as a result of employing the best factories, and all the assistance that they could get, thess contingents were properly equipped in regard to uniforms and all accoutrements, except rifles, many weeks before the contingents in other States were ready; and if those same factories z whose fine machinery enabled this to be done in South Australia could now be employed in assisting to equip the men at Broadmeadows, we could have them ready many weeks before they can be equipped under existing conditions.

If honourable members persist in bringing in these party measures, an everlasting disgrace w ill attach to this Parliament, and we shall be rightly condemned by the conscience of the community. Believing that the Committee has had enough of war matters for a while, I propose to change the subject. I am glad to note that the Ministers of the Departments about which I intend to speak are both in the chamber, and, taking these gentlemen in the order of seniority, I shall first deal with the Department of the Postmaster-General. the House was gratified when a resolution was passed that some practical assistance be given to those mail contractors who, throughout many years, have rendered splendid service to this Commonwealth by despatching the mails in the back country along dreary roads in the difficult winter months. by both sides of the House, and we were pleased to get the assurance of the M in isterthat a sum of £50,000 had been placed on the Estimates to afford relief to those men. that up to to-day not one penny of relief has been granted, and owing to the movements of the market for fodder that sum of £50.000 is not worth what it was when the Minister gave us his assurance that it had been set aside for that purpose. Por the information of the Committee I will read to-day's market quotations in Melbourne, as follows:Cliaff -It is almost impossible to define values in this market, us tliere arc practically no sales on tlic platform, merchants retaining the small consignments now coming forward for their own requirements. Up to £15 was mentioned yesterday, but some buyers would probably have paid more had it been possible to do business. The shunt at Spenccr-strcct represented only seventeen truck loads. In the absence of supplies of straw chaff quotations arc purely nominal. The position generally is likely to remain acute until the arrival of the fodder which is being imported by the Government. The Postmaster-General has been assured in this House two or three times that this country is face to face with a fodder famine, and I am surprised t h a t more prompfc.a^ct'ion tw'as not takeri'hy the' M in Department the money ^lfaa'^shrunk "" in ister when* tlie""'G'overnment determined'to put £50,000 afc his disposal for those men. I am surprised that he did not proceed to see that the £50,000 would be worth £50,000, when the contractors actually got the money. quickly as possible. Minister can say can possibly defend him. To-day the chaff sovereign, owing to the movement of the market, is only worth about 17s. bhat. Minister is responsible for not having taken action earlier, and, as I think was suggested by the honourable member for Some time ago Maranoa, entered into an arrangement with the States for supplies of fodder to these men in the country districts, these men who are expectant and hoping that the Minister w ill do something tangible to relieve them. The market has risen from £ 1 0 10s. per ton, when the advance was agreed upon, up to £ 1 5 The resolution was supported in Victoria. The Victorian Government were the one Government to take prompt action to face this question of a fodder famine. We have Agricultura l Departments with highly skilled men I understand,however, in charge, whose duty it is to obtain preharvest estimates of the fodder that is likely to be available for stock, and the wheat for the requirements of the people. In November last we knew that the* resources of the country would not see us through. W h a t action has been taken? Sufficient action has not been taken throughout the country to meet this contingency. I do not blame the Minister as to that stage, but I do say that the Minister, when he determined to give some real assistance, should have taken action when he knew the money would be at his disposal. Can tlie Minister say how long it will be ? Could he not have had £50,000 worth of fodder ear-marked for this purpose ? If this had been done there would have been an immense saving to these men, whose resources have been shrinking almost to the point of exhaustion. Tho men have lost horses, and they are exhausted in spirit themselves. I hope the Minister w ill have some assurance to give us on this subject.

An other matter I wish to refer to is connected with the Department of the Minister of the information of the Committee, and to Trade and Customs, that genial Minister refresh the Minister's memory. This tag who generally gives us his best and conis affixed to every carcass that leaves stant attention. attention of the Minister to the methods follows: of meat inspection in Australia, which I think are very unsatisfactory. In several by ante-mortem and post-mortem veterinary inof the States meat inspection for export spection is undertaken by non-qualified inspectors, men who hold no veterinary qualifications. I want to ask the Minister this pertinent I wish to point out that in 1913 the question: How is it possible for any one United States Department of Agriculture but a fully-qualified veterinary surgeon sent a Commission to Australia to in to give that certificate?

Such a step would be in the interests of the meat export trade, and it would be only a fair return to the young Australians who pass through a severe veterinary course that those who are qualified should be selected for this important work. the matter, and Mr Drysdale Brown interviewed'mfe on the subject six or eight weeks ago. appoint qualified men if we are to capture the United States trade.

There is another matter to which I desire to refer. Last year this House voted a sum of £150 towards the expenses of the attendance of the Chief Veterinary Officer of Victoria at the International Congress of Veterinarians in London. That conference dealt with the whole of the diseases to which the stock life of Australia is heir, and its deliberations were of great importance.. The Victorian Government also paid its proportion of the expenses of Mr Robertson, the officer to whom I refer, but I have not heard if any report was furnished If such a report is in the possession of the its advantages should be many, inasmuch as it deals with the stock diseases of all countries. Australia is free of the exporters in many other countries. Our representative should have been able to inform the Congress that Australia surpasses other countries in regard to climate, freedom from disease, and opportunities for. stock raising, and I hope that the Minister will see that the report is placed at the disposal of the House. Mr Cummins Cherry was not sent"". it was thought to be an advantage that a man practising in Australia, and acquainted .with the diseases here, should attend the Congress, so that when-he returned he. would be able to attend conferences'in the various States, a'nd spread throughout Australia the .knowledge he had gained.

421,Mr Rodgers,"The reason was thatman actively engaged in administering a Department was appointed to represent Australia instead of a man who, for the time being, was out of touch with the Commonwealth. I should also like the Minister to lay on the table of the House the report by the departmental veterinary officers who inspected the abattoirs and freezing works subsequent to the visit of the American Commission. That report would be of special value, and would show in what respect the present system is deficient. An occasion like the present should not be allowed to pass without some reference to the conduct of the war. In this chamber and out of it my attitude on the subject is that whatever assistance I can give the Government to aid recruiting or the organization directly behind them of all the resources of the country, I shall be only too pleased to give. ""WhatI object to is that, while that is the spirit animating the whole of the Opposition, and, I believe, the whole of the people of the country to-day, the Government will insist upon bringing forward contentious legislation. On my return to town this week, when I picked up a daily newspaper, I read a report of a speech by the Prime Minister at a meeting of the Chamber of Manufactures. On reading it I thought that the week-end had beeu well spent by the Caucus in determining to eschew party politics. At the meeting referred to the Prime Minister saidHe thanked Mr Brookes for the frankness of the statements he had made. happy to learn from him that private enterprise had, from patriotic motives, been making no profits at this time. He was afraid that that could only last a short time, because it could not be expected that people would work without profits sufficient to keep their business going. At a later stage he said-and this is what I wish particularly to refer toHe did not speak as the Government or as a party. There was no party in Australia just now. There ought to be none. That statement was very properly received with loud cheers. That is the spirit which I was hopeful would pervade this House this week. I am satisfied that the sentiment there expressed by the Prime Minister would be welcomed throughout the Commonwealth by the supporters of both political parties. If the Prime Minister had said here, "" ""We are in charge of the government of this country, [151] and are specially charged with the conduct of the war, and we have determined that all contentious and party questions shall be put on one side, and all the resources of the Commonwealth, political, social, industrial, and economical, marshalled behind the Government for the successful prosecution of the war,"" honourable members on both sides, and their supporters throughout the country, would have welcomed such an announcement, and it would have raised the Prime Minister of Australia to a pedestal as high as that occupied at the present time by the Prime Minister of Great Britain. But, to my disgust, when I entered the chamber this week I found that there are two Mr Fishers. Thc Prime Minister has, through his Attorney-General, introduced in this House six of the most highly-contentious party measures that could be suggested in Australia-the Referenda Bills. ficial measures. the honourable member must recognise that two acute party campaigns have already been fought in connection with them, and, in the circumstances, the furthest stretch of imagination cannot describe them as non-contentious. tions. He was for the honourable member to say that kind of thing out in the country, but to look any member of this House in the face and say such a thing is to talk "" bosh,"" which I do not care to .see recorded in Hansard. Australia is in mourning, and every day there is cause for deeper mourning. Is this a time at which to ask the widows, mothers, and relatives of our fallen soldiers to attend party meetings and wrangle about party questions? I hope it is not too late to raise a protest, and that the Government will yet Tecousider their decision, and refrain from plunging the nation in mourning into a bitter party . conflict. I make this declaration, regardless of the results, that I refuse to take any platform in connection with the referenda campaign until the war is over. That is my attitude on party questions at this time. I feel that if the Prime Minister were called upon alone to determine.",57,Foster Rugged Socialism Or Not The State Should Seize

I presume that the candidates for those seats decided that question. I believe that if the Prime Miuister had alone the determination of the matter he would turn down any proposal to engage in a party conflict at this time. I regret, however, to say that there is a higher power than even that of the supporters of the Government in this chamber.
