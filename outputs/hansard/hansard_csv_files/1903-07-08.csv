10,Mr Deakin (Ballarat,"AttorneyI n view of tlie importance of this Bill, and of the amendments made in it, and because of the misconceptions which apparently still exist in regard to its provisions, I ask the attention of honourable members for a few minutes, while I endeavour to put plainly before .them the effect of the present measure. As honourable members are aware, it was materially altered in Committee, and consequently much of what was said in regard to it by the Prime Minister and myself, both last year and during the second-reading debate, is now inapplicable, and likety to mislead those who depend upon the statements then made. The measure, as amended, complies with the mandate of the Constitution, and will, I think, prove of great value, but in my judgment it would have possessed much greater value if honourable members had seen fit to agree to it as originally introduced. It was, however, caught in the rush for retrenchment, which, to my thinking, though reasonable in many of its objects, was in this case misdirected. I do not find much ground for surprise at the misconceptions which have clustered round the measure. The feature which has presented itself to all its critics is the proposition for the establishment of a High Court. To the average man a court is a place to which he resorts unwillingly, with no anticipation of profit, and, at the best, with only a hope of securing what he deems to be his rights, by a process sometimes prolonged and generally costly. The proposal to create another cou rt, therefore, was one which those who regarded the matter only in the light of their private interests and personal experiences might well hesitate to agree to. So far as I can judge^ the measure has been criticised only in that light. The proposal which has been kept under the public gaze is its effect in regard to private suits. MrA . McLEAN any need for the creation of a High Court. is no need for a High Court has arisen wholly outside, and almost wholly inside, this Chamber, from the fact that public attention has been confined to what I may term the private side of the measure-it s operation in private suits. Therefore all I could do was to endeavour to recommend it by now making a last effort to inform the public that this Bill will not be fully understood if its provisions are regarded ney-General mean by the curtailment of only from the stand-point of the casual the Constitution ? litigant. The Government did not desire to interfere with him. We wished neither to throw further obstacles in his path, nor to multiply the occasions upon which he would have to appear before any courts. But apparently the proposal to create a new court has appeared to the people merelj' as an additional burden to be borne by those seeking to enforce their legal, rights. those who objected to the Bill is a possible litigant. sible litigants may be small, but the prospect of additional litigation was so uninviting that, from the first, the Bil l had to encounter strong opposition. W h a t I wish to point out is that although one of the chief purposes of the courts is to,, as far as possible, secure justice between citizens, and determine disputes, their functions by no means stop there. Although, under our system, suits are conducted practically at the cost of those engaged in them, except so far as the public contribute to the expense by maintaining the courts, and although the attention of the courts is chiefly directed to the decision of private suits, many questions directly affecting important public interests arise out of suchlitigation. It is partly because of this that the country maintains the courts, although it might be compelled to do so even if the}""only settled private contentions. Therefore,, the courts have to be considered, not only in their relation to private suits, but in connection with their public functions. These have a far-reaching effect upon the public well-being. It is because of the publicfunctions which the High Court would be called upon to discharge that the Bill was introduced at the present time. It was not brought in simply to provide another court And the absence of of appeal, to establish a final, or if notfinal, an Australian court of appeal which The opinion that there has long been desired in the States, but because the litigation which takes place under and about our Constitution must lead to its authoritative determination, and to either the development or to the curtailment of its purposes. The public functions of the High Court have been left out of consideration in the debates which have taken place in this House and outside. MrA .

20,Mr Deakin,"I think that we have aJudiciary to write a complete history of the United States, and to record every one of its developments from such reports alone. to give a series of decisions upon the American Constitution, in order to prevent it from breaking down. particular argument, that what holds true of the unwritten Constitution of Great Britain holds true equally with regard to a written Constitution such as our own, and that the decisions of the courts with regard to the interpretation of our Constitution may become part of it in essence, and may be practically embraced within it. Every separate stage of the history of the United States is marked by some case which has been taken to the Supreme Court: such cases, for instance, as that of Ghisholm against the Slate of Georgia, the celebrated Marb'wry v. Madison, the actions relating to the Dartmouth College, McCxdloch v. Maryland, Gibbons v. Ogden, the Bred Scott case, which was the herald of civil war, or the Porto Mica cases, which the other da}'decided the immenselyimportant question of thecolonial expansion of the United States. A number of other cases might be mentioned. All of them mark historicalstagesin the growth and developrnentof the Constitution of the United States. Haying regard to such achievements of the Courts, both in the mother country and in the United States, wearejustified in pointing to the duties which the High Court will be called upon to discharge in the interpretation of the Commonwealth Constitution, and in the interpretation of Federal legislation. Particularly in our early years, proble/ns as grave as those which were settled by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court will require to be solved, and in order that these problems may be dealt with by a Federal tribunal, we have felt justified in urging upon the consideration of the House the necessity for the establishment of the High Court. In the United States the Supreme Court has become what has been termed an organ of its national life. It has been recognised as one of the three great powers under its Constitution. The part it has played has been only second to that of the Congress from whichitderived its endowmentof power, and which has during the last century obeyed the monitor .which was created to safeguard the rights of the States and to determine the just distribution of the powers [S JULY, 1903.] BiM. 1S67 under its Federal Constitution. It was with these aims-stil l ignoring the Constitution-that this particular measure was introduced. A High Court was proposed which would be adequate to the fulfilment of the great State obligations devolving upon it. It is perfectly true that these great T h a t does not affect the duties would have been exercised in connection with private litigation. But we are at the commencement of the life of this Constitution, in its application to practical affairs. We are at a period parallel to what has been termed the critical period of American history. The term of the first Parliament and the next few years will be the critical period of the Commonwealth Constitution. The question as to how the Constitution is to be precisety interpreted when applied to the facts and events around us, is the great problem which Parliament itself will beunableto solve. That can only be done by a judicial tribunal constituting the highest judicial authority in the community. In such circumstances everything which makes for the reputation of that body, everything which enhances the dignity and force of its judgments, is of high value to the community. If we are fortunate enough to obtain under this Bill-as I certainly think we should have obtained under the measure as it was drafteda court to which the whole of Australia can look with confidence for the discharge of its public functions, and for the interpretation of this Constitution, we shall have attained something, the monetary value of which cannot be estimated. Such a tribunal may easily prove of inestimable worth to the Commonwealth or the States, or to both, by reason simply of the interpretations which it will put upon our Constitution during the first few years of our national history. look to it with confidence now 1 The numerical strength of the High Court Bench is one of the elements which properly impresses public opinion, and in my opinion it was our duty to have surrounded the court with every accessory which could have lent weight to its decisions. The truest economy lay in creating the best possible tribunal.

24,Mr Deakin,"I hope that they will.speak, that the Bill, as introduced, provided for the creation of a tribunal no whit in excess of the reasonable requirements of the times. But we had another obligation to which I propose to allude, because it has been brushed aside by our outside critics as if it were a mere matter of fancy or preference, and not one of obedience and loyalty to the Constitution. I again submit to'the House with brevity, but with renewed -confidence, that every independent and impartial critic of this Constitution must admit the mandate that exists for the creation of the High Court. and impartial critic ? What else should I say ? Of course, members of the legal profession are accustomed to take either side, as they are instructed. That is their everyday practice in the courts. Therefore, it is only to be expected that the partizan feeling which is manifested upon all measures, whether they be legal or otherwise, and by all honourable members irrespective of whether or not they are professional men, will often supply the place of legal instructions. A further examination of section 71 of the Constitution, to which the honourable and learned member for In d i called particular attention, makes the case for the immediate carrying out of the mandate contained therein much stronger. Under that section it was clearly intended that whatever might be done in the way of vesting States Courts with Eederal jurisdiction, or of creating other Eederal Courts, the High Court should be 'established forth ' with, and that there should be no vesting of Eederal jurisdiction in any other tribunal, unless it was simultaneously associated with a High Court. SirJ OHN QUICK -Does not the Constitution create the High Court? but I would point out to the honourable and learned member that effect has to be given to the mandate of the Constitution, otherwise we shall have to remain content with a shadowy sketch of the ground-plan of a High Court which could never hear a single suit or pronounce a single judgment. vides for the establishment of a High Courti t does not organize it . submit, when read in conjunction with section 73, affords an additional argument for the immediacy of the mandate contained in this chapter. which have been given in Customs cases by the Supreme Courts of the States may be wrong. tention to be urged, but I agree with the honourable and learned member for In d i that the courts would adopt with extreme reluctance any view which would require the cancellation of any of those decisions. Reading the Constitution here, with a view to discovering whether or not the mandate for the creation of a High Court is instant, I am forced to the conclusion thab the emphasis which the honourable* and learned member for In d i laid upon section 71 is justified, and that similar emphasis might property be laid upon the language of section 73. learned member for Bendigo in his own book declares that it is mandatory. one is at liberty to alter or amend his opinion. Section 73 of the Constitution deals with the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court.

Section 73 providesThe High Court shall have jurisdiction, wibh such exceptions and subjecb to such regulations as the Parliament prescribes, to hear and determineappeals from all judgments, decrees, orders, ancl sentences: (1) Of any Justice or Justices exercising the original jurisdiction of the High Court; (2) Of any other Federal Court or Court exercising Federal jurisdiction ; or of the Supreme Court of any State, or of any other Court of any State from which, at the establishment of the Commonwealth, an appeal lies to the Queen in Council; (3) Of the Inter-State Commission, but as to questions of law only : And the judgment of the High Court in all such cases shall be final and conclusive. But no exception or regulabion prescribed by bhe Parliament shall prevent the High Court from hearing and determining any appeal from the Supreme Courb of a State in any matter in which at the establishment of bhe Commonwealth an appeal lies from such Supreme Court to the Queen in Council. Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the conditions of and restrictions on appeals to bhe Queen in Council from bhe Supreme Courts of the several States shall be applicable to appeals from them to the High Court. Here again is an absolute mandate that an appeal shall lie bo bhe High Courb from bhe Sbabes Courbs, from every court exercising Eederal jurisdiction and from obher Federal Courbs. The language of bhe section plainly shows-as dues the language or section 71 -tha b the clear meaning of the chapter relating to the Judicature is that the High Courb shall be established simultaneously wibh bhe creation of any obher Federal Courb. This section supporbs bhab reading of secbion 71 of the Constibubion, and bhe I have no wish to debwo provisions, when read togebher appear bo me bo consbibube a disbincb mandabe, nob only for bhe creation of the High Courb bub for ibs immediate creation, in order had no desire to do that it may render absolutely valid the proceedings of any court which may be endowed with Federal jurisdiction.

In order to encourage appellants who, under the Constitution, are allowed an option regarding the authoriby bo which bhey shall appeal, ib, was also desirable, if nob absolubely necessary, that the High Courb should compare favourably wibh bhe courbs from which appeals were to be made. Under these circumstances, it required bo be a courb of some numerical sbrengbh, because, in bhe larger Sbabes of bhe Union, wealready have Benches of highly compebenb meu, numerically stronger even than the Bench of the High Court, as originally proposed. In the same way, it was a matter of importance that those who were invited to accept seats upon its Bench should be men of equal repute and standing with those upon the Sbabes Courbs Benches, from whose judgmenbs appeals were to be heard. Finally, as bhe High Courb was bo be established as an essential parb of bhe Federal system, in order bhab ib mighb acb as an independenb umpire bebween bhe Commonwealth and bhe Sbabes, or bebween bhe differenb organized powers of bhe Commonwealbh, and as ib was intended bhab jbs members should become skilled arbiters in the sebtlemenb of Federal issues, ib became necessary that it should be sufficiently strong in numbers, and consist of men of sufficient repute, to give it a standing which would practically make it -",17,Judiciary Bill Thihd Reading

I am happy bo say bhab bhe destructive criticism of this proposal was so effective in this House that no similar proposal was even submitted in Committee. Even the cursory consideration given to this pioject before the Bill was read a second time was of so effective a character that it has been absolutely abandoned as unconstitutional, and as utterly unsuitable. Yet, a proposition which was scouted in the House, and never even formally submitted, is still revived by oubside critics, as if it were an alternative open to us. But the House has realized that no such expedient could properly be introduced, having in view the special tasks which a courb of bin's characber is called on to perform. Accordingly, the Commibbee has shaped bhe Bill inbo ibs presenb sbabe, which, needless bo say, differs very largely from bhe form in which bhe Bill was inbroduced. The courb firsb proposed was enlarged beyond the minimum requirements of the Consbibubion for reasons I have already indicabed. We seb oub bo make ib as effective as bhe Constitution permitted-to invest it with the ainplesb jurisdiction which bhe Consbibubion allowed. In order bo render ib accessible in all bhe States, we sought to make the number of Judges enough to entertain wibh aubhority appeals from bhe Benches of all bhe Sbabes, and enough bo inberpreb the Constitution so authoritatively bhab bhere would be libtle chanc^of appeals oversea from an}' of its matured decisions unless the courb ibself were divided. Of course, I have bo admit that the chapber of bhe Consbibubion dealing wibh the Judiciary left us trammelled, and with by no means a free hand in shaping the powers of the' court. But we had to bake bhe defective aubhoriby which this chapber gave, and make bhe besb of ib. A t all eveubs, we claim bo have made bhe besb of bhe authority by seeking to create a court which not having a single Judge too many would have had sufficient standing to atbracb, by ibs own characber, appeals which obherwise would I bhink bhabfive go to London and to obtain the confidence of the people of Australia, so thab even many of bhe cases now baken bo bhe Sbates Courts would have been taken from a single J udge direct to the High Court. The States Courts would thus become, so to speak, divisional courts, and the High Court would have become the Court of Appeal for all Australia. By thab means a Bench of five Justices, under bhe jurisdiction with which they were endowed, would, have sufficed, and just sufficed, for the work to be done. With the jurisdiction proposed, bhe High Court would have obtained ample litigation to have occupied practically bhe whole of ibs time, or, ab all evenbs, bhe whole of ibs time wibh such additions of duby as were proposed to be made by other measures. torney-General to say that there would be additional Judges for the purposes of bhose other measures. is referring bo measures bo which 1 am nob ab this moment alluding.

It fulfils the mandate of the Constitution, but does nothing more. As a High Court it will perform valuable services to this community, and, .although the area of its jurisdiction will necessarily limit its business, the great importance the causes submitted to it, will not only justify its creation, but will, I' trust and believe, in a short time, more than justify its existence to the people of this country. Only by the test of practical experience-which may come early, or may be postponed-Of the work this court has to do, and of the manner in which that business will be transacted, can the country become thoroughly seized of what a High Court in a Federal Constitution means, and be able to assess its power to help the development-the the social and material of the people of Australia.

And, therefore, I dismiss this part of the subject with a reference to the remarks made by me a month ago when moving the second reading. After referring to my responsibility for the opinions there expressed, I said, as reported on page 615 of J/amsard-r WhatI have said in regard to the need for the High Court and its potencies applies to the High Court which I have described. NothingI have said attaches, or can be attached, to any other. I must uot be held responsible if a courb of another complexion is created.

All such cases must have gone to the High Court under the Bil l as drafted; none of them need go to it under the Bill as it now stands. Then the original clause 41 required litigants to appeal to the High Court in matters of Federal jurisdiction from the decision of a single Judge, or from the Full Court of a State. That provision would have created a very considerable number of appeals. It was, however, amended, and sub-clause (/>) of clause 40 of the Bill as it exists provides only for an optional appeal, so that the number of appeals is now uncertain. Clause 42 of the original Bill provided that, with the exception of the matters mentioned in sub-clauses (a) and (6), any question of Federal jurisdiction could be removed as of right from the Courts of the States to the High Court. The power of removal as of right has disappeared. Air. GLYNN -Does the Attorney-General regret tliat'! Mir. McCAY -The honourable and learned gentleman abandoned it without a word of protest. that nor any other part of the proposed jurisdiction until I saw that it was hopeless to expect to carry it,and that to persist would involve waste of public time. The results of the divisions in Committee amply justified my action. Original clause 45 has been struck out. Underi t cases could be removed from any court of a State to the High Court by order of the High Court on the application of the Attorney-General. That jurisdiction was not compulsory, but the power would probably have been often exercised. All that now remains is the power of removal to the High Court as an appellate tribunal in matters arising under the Constitution, or involving its interpretation. All other matters of Federal jurisdiction are now outside that power. So much for the exclusive or in part compulsory'jurisdiction of the court. jurisdiction, clause 31 of the Bill, as drafted, vested in the High Court the whole of the original jurisdiction permitted by section 76 of the Constitution. That jurisdiction includes cases arising under the Constitution, or under the laws made by the Parliament, . 5Y jurisdiction, ancl. cases relating to the same subject-matter claimed under the laws of different States. That jurisdiction of the High Court has disappeared, except in regard to matters arising under the Constitution, involving the special class of questions provided for by section 74, in regard to which the decision of the High Court is final, except by its own consent. Finally clauses 65 and 66 of the draft Bill, providing for the original criminal jurisdiction of the High Court, have been negatived. Honourable members will, therefore, see the definite curtailment which has taken place in regard to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court, and the indefinite curtailment in regard to the remainder of its original jurisdiction. The court now proposed is smaller, and has a narrower jurisdiction than that originally provided for, the Committee having thought f it to agree to a minimum court, with practically the minimum jurisdiction. I must bow to that decision. The Bill, as amended, however, still fulfils the mandate of the Constitution for the creation of Of course, I do. a High Court. That court will possess jurisdiction of an optional nature, which the Committee did not see fit to reduce. This leaves it a court of appeal to which I abandoned neither suits may be brought either from the High Court in its reduced original jurisdiction, or from the Supreme Courts of the States, or from the decision of a single J udge of a State Court, and from any court from which an appeal now lies to the King in Council. As an appellate body, it is almost the High Court contemplated by the Constitution, but its appellate jurisdiction has not been made compulsory to the extent originally proposed. As an optional court of appellate jurisdiction, it can exercise the remaining powers given by the Constitution. Altogether, the part which it will play in the legal systems-o r legal system, as I hope it will become-of the Commonwealth, will be great and steadily increasing. I could have wished that the court had been numerically stronger for the hearing of appeals, but at all events it possesses powers With regard to its appellate which are not possessed by any other court except the judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and these, in regard to matters of Federal jurisdiction, at all events, are to some extent safe-guarded by the Bill. Its appellate control in matters of Federal jurisdiction heard in the States Courts will Admiralty and maritime be invaluable. If the court had been",21,Judiciary Bill Thihd Reading
78,Mr Deakin,,22,Judiciary Bill Thihd Reading
79,Mr Deakin,"created for nothing else, if it had been possible for the Committee to sweep away, not only its optional, but the whole of its original jurisdiction, I should still have contended that we should act wisely in agreeing to its establishment as a court of appeal hearing not only appeals from the States Courtsi n ordinary matters, but especially appeals in the exercise of their Eederal jurisdiction. In this regard it will have in some respects a partially compulsory power. The work of the High Court may be reduced at the choice of suitors, but its interpretation of the Constitution and of the laws of this Parliament, when suitors resort to it, as they must in certain cases, will be invaluable in the development of the Commonwealth. If the High Court will not be the fully equipped and fully manned body originally proposed, it will still be a court of high jurisdiction, of great powers, and of great authority. More than that, it will be a Eederal Court, and by its acts and judgments will gradually acquire that place in the estimation of the people to which it will be entitled. Wheni t is realized that the court will be open, not merely for the settlement of matters of private concern, but that incidentally it will necessarily deal with national questions of magnitude in, I trust, a national fashion, no one who has been associated with its establishment will have reason to regret that the mandate of tlie Constitution has been fulfilled. No doubt some little time will elapse before litigants come to realize its advantage, or it is discovered how far it is available to suitors. It cannot be expected to enter upon its full functions all at once.

These are a few of the matters which will come before the court. I think the public will discover that it has not been created a day too soon, and that the functions it will be called upon to fulfil will prove the necessity for its existence. In some of them, or in all of them, the High Court may be compelled to take an intermediary position-that is to say, even after the decision of a High Court has been given, the question at issue may be taken further. It will, however, be of immense advantage to have all these issues regarded, from a broad Australian aspect, by a tribunal equally independent of the Government of the Commonwealth and of the Governments of the States, or of any other embarrassing associations, and enjoying the absolute liberty and independence granted to all courts in the British Empire. When matters of this kind are found to be at issue, their determination by the High Court of Australia will be the best answer which those responsible for its creation can give to those who are now questioning the wisdom To what part of the of our action.

If a Bench of 'five Judges had been approved of we should have been able to relieve the courts of the States of a considerable amount of work, and by indirect economies might have largely recouped the expenditure involved in the establishment of the High Court. But that is an old story which I do not desire to repeat, except to say that, whilst believing that the larger court would have been more economical and more efficient, there is no question but that a court such as Australia has not yet seen can be established under this measure. As an appellate body it will lack few of the powers conferred by the Constitution, though as a court of original jurisdiction it will lack very much indeed. It may, however, be trusted that hereafter its conduct and experience of its labours will lead to necessary enlargements of its functions.

That, however, is a side issue. I was alluding to the importance, the dignity, and the power of the High Court. Its urgency is implied, although, perhaps, not expressly stated, by every other authority. I have felt it necessary to compare the measure as it leaves the Committee with its condition as it was introduced, in order that honourable members may be thoroughly seized of the effects of the changes made, and so that there shall be no possibility of mistaking the court as constituted for the court originally proposed by me. I have briefly alluded to the reasons why the court was created, and have also insisted that, curtailed as it is, clipped as its wings have been, it is still a court invaluable to Australia in its appellate jurisdiction, and capable of being easily expanded. It is a necessity, in my opinion, ment, although only, to a minimum extent, of the mandate contained in it . the admirers of the Attorney-General will feel almost sad at the prospect of the disappearance of this particular item from able, during our long and bitter struggles over the Tariff to maintain a stolid silence, he was able to rise to the highest flights of oratory, to sound the most profound depths of earnestness, and to stretch to the utmost the limits of human persuasion. That was the Bill with which we are dealing today. I can imagine now the ardour with which his colleague will follow in his footsteps.' The desperate attempt which the Attorney-General has made to establish a court of five Judges will be emulated by the Minister for Trade and Customs, who, in his impassioned earnestness, will endeavour to secure the appointment of an Arbitration for Home Affairs in connection with the He spoke of the High appointment of the Inter-State Commission.",23,Judiciary Bill Thihd Reading

I only wish they would show as much earnestnessin regard to, well, I do not say more important, but less expensive, forms of public usefulness. The Attorney-General has, it seems to me, taken upon himself a very grave responsibility. Is he pronouncing the funeral oration upon those parts of the Bill which he considered good, and which have been abandoned, cr is he making a deliberate and studied appeal to the other Chamber to undo the work of this House? other House. time? If the Attorney-General wished us to reconsider our decision, the address delivered by him would have been most weighty, and perhaps most useful; but inasmuch as he, although drawing a most discouraging picture of the future which awaits this measure, will not even take the trouble to ask the House to change its decision, why should he make such an elaborate reply .to outside criticisms? We know that Ministers do not deliberately waste the public time; but the speech of the Attorney-General sounds very much like an appeal to members of another place to undo the work of this House. I cannot understand a Minister, when speaking upon a matter of great public importance, saying that he cannot take the responsibility of the Bill of which he has moved the third reading. I could understand a Minister saying, as the Minister for Trade and Customs said, that his confidence had been broken, but that he still took the responsibility of his act. He stood out in a manly way, and said that it was through him that something unfortunate had happened. Contrast his attitude with that now taken up by the Minister upon this most important Bill. The measure, instead of being launched as the legitimate offspring of the deliberations of this House, is branded by the Attorney-General as an infant of doubtful origin-whos e paternity he will not acknowledge. This is an extraordinary position for a Government to assume in regard to one of its principal measures. Is there no point at which the sense of responsibility of tlie Government will make it clear to them that they must choose between occupying a position of guiding the House and of merely following it the burdens which are being piled upon as a recorder of its decisions 1 What is the office of responsible government but, in such cases, to make the f u l l weight of the views and opinions of the Government of the day felt by this House?

The honourable member knows that this is not a question of party politics, but one which affects the soundness and integrity of our system of government. I know very well that there are some honourable members who wish to make the Government the puppet of a certain caucus. No doubt they are wise in their day and generation, holding certain views, in honorably and most successfully impressing them upon a number of persons who are willing to carry out their puipose; but that does not affect the question with which I am dealing. There are points at which a Government has to consider its position-to consider the extent to which it will allow itself to be driven. As far as this Bill is concerned, I wish to point out that the Government in their manifesto said that it was the one measure which should be brought into operation at once. TheA t torney-General to-day says that this is something more than a Ministerial proposalthat the thing itself has been in the Constitution from the moment when that instrument was brought into force. Who is responsible for allowing the Constitution to remain dumb in reference to this High Court for the past two years ? In spite of the differences of opinion in this House, the Bill was passed through practically in a few sittings. Therefore, what excuse had the Government for not bringing the Bill down and getting it passed as one of the very first measures of the first session ? Had they done so, in the glamour of enthusiasm which pervaded this Chamber at that time, they might have secured legislative sanction for the appointment of five J udges.

94,Mr Reid,"My honourable friend surelytlie people both by the States Legislatures and by this Parliament. Irrespective of -whether they are right or wrong, I think that every man who understands the real dangers of Australian democracy will be glad to see the public waking up to take a vigilant interest in the accumulation of national burdens. It may be that some of the imputations of extravagance on the part of the Commonwealth Government are entirely undeserved. I do not wish to champion every complaint that has been made against the Ministry in financial matters. I am very far from wishing to ' do that; but I do applaud the growing disposition on the part of the taxpayers to watch financial matters with a very critical eye. It seems to me that the Government occupy a very strange position in regard to this Bill. The Attorney-General has just declared that the limitations imposed by this House upon the scope of the measure are such that there may not be sufficient work to occupy three Judges. Yet, after those limitations were imposed, the Government fought hard for the appointment of five Judges. The questions of jurisdiction, of the salary of the Justices, and of their number, were postponed until the true character of the measure had been determined. That matter was determined, and a majority of honourable members thought it prudent to very largely limit the amount of work which the High Court is to be called upon to perform. Yet we now find the Attorney-General asserting that, under these limitations, it is questionable whether the three Justices will be fully employed, despite the fact that, after they were imposed, the Government fought hard for the appointment of five Justices, and at a later stage, with the aid of the honourable and learned member for Indi, for the appointment of four. I say that the accusations made outside this House, more fully and clearly than those which have been made inside it, are absolutely justified, when we find the Government fighting for the appointment of five Judges to administer a Bill which they now admit can easily be administered by three. These are admissions of which the public will take some notice. I rather agree with the views expressed by the Attorney-General and the honourable and learned member for In d i that the High Court is part of the Constitution. If I could agree with those -who think that we can absolutely dispense with that tribunal, I would most heartily adopt that course. But I confess that I am unable to see how we can properly fulfil the obligations of our Constitution without immediately establishing the High Courb. But, admitting that, I .am heart and soul with those honourable members who have endeavoured to give that tribunal as economical and unpretentious a start as possible. Nothingi n tlie world is more easy than to enlarge the number of lucrative positions. Nothing in the world is more easy than to pile up your expenditure with or without warrant. Nothing could be easier, if experience in the working of the High Court showed that three Judges were insufficient, than to appoint an additional number to meet the pressure of public business. I take the f u l l responsibility-althoug h I was absent from the Chamber-of everything that has been done in the way of cutting, down the provisions of this Billi n the manner described by the Attorney General. 1 think that the House did well in cutting them down, and in limiting the number of Judges, because it is very easy to alter mistakes which we make in the direction of economy. On the other hand, it is not so easy to alter mistakes which we make in the direction of extravagance. Therefore, I think the House has faithfully reflected the sentiments and the wisdom of the community in the course which it has taken. But I am profoundly disappointed with the attitude of the Government upon one matter. They were not always so ready to accept the voice of a majority in this House as they have been upon the subject of the granting of judicial pensions. Honourable members will recollect the decision of the House in respect of the* Bonuses for Manufactures Bill. They will remember the bull-dog pertinacity with which the Ministry clung to that measure how they 'allowed it to be turned inside out two or three tunes, how they permitted it to be torn from the Chamber down to the parliamentary cellars, and how afterwards a Royal Commission was appointed in connection with it . Still they clung to that Bill. Why could they not have shown a little of that pertinacity upon some of the vital provisions connected with the measure under consideration? No one will deny that the trend of opinion in this part of the world is absolutely against the continuance of the pension system. Whether rightly or wrongly, the experience of the public in connection with the enormous which have been paid under the name of pensions has been so bitter that the tendency is to discontinue that form of remuneration. But I submit most earnestly to the House that there is one class of positions which ought always to be exempted from that wholesome rule. I believe that, as regards the Bench, the prospect of securing a pension is one of the chief inducements to first-rate men to accept comparatively small salaries. Why should men who have been deriving an income of £5,000 or £6,000 a year in their private practice, accept even a dignified office to which £3,000 is attached, if no provision is made for the possibility of their being overtaken by calamity or loss ? It is the pensions which have enabled the States of the Commonwealth to procure the services of the best men as Justices of the Supreme Courts, and which have tempted those men to accept half the amount of their former remuneration to fill these judicial offices. I think that a serious mistake has been made in removing that inducement from the Bill. Personally, I should much rather have reduced the salaries of the Justices than have excised all provision for the payment of pensions. When I speak of judicial pensions I wish it to be distinctly understood that I have no sympathy with the extravagant scale upon which the proposals of the Government were based. and learned gentleman believe in the payment of pensions all round 1 that, in my opinion, the trend of conviction in this part of the world is that the pension system should be destroyed, and I am taking leave to put our Judges upon a different footing. I take them out of the ordinary category. clerks ; the public service is only too tempting to the mass of the people of Australia. But when we come to fill judicial seats, especially in the highest tribunal in the Commonwealth, we ought to obtain the best possible men. AVhen we are dealing with instruments upon which exquisite issues depend, it is the falsest economy to apply ordinary rules. Of course, I do not suggest the payment of a pension representing seven-tenths of a Justice's salary. a* proposal as absolutely wrong. I refer' amounts to such a pension as would afford to a Judge the prospect of a decent subsistence should his energies suddenly fail. 1 am very sorry that the Government, who feel as strongly as I do upon this matter, have not made another effort to induce the House -eve n at the cost of reducing the salariesof the Justices-to attach some pension provision to their offices. If that course is to be adopted it can only be done here. Theother branch of the Legislature cannot increase the burdens on the people.

122,Mr Higgins (Northern Melbourne),"the differences between the Bill as introduced and as it stands at present, but his lamentations over the clauses which have been lost, reminded me of the Russian woman who threw from her sledge child after child to appease the wolves which were following it . According to Browning, she was in turn put to death by Ivan Ivanovitch. I do not wish to put the Attorney-General to death, but, as so many of its vital provisions have been re-shaped in a manner which defeats the intentions of its framers, I think the Bill should be murdered. I am glad that an opportunity has been afforded us of again voting upon the fate of the measure, though I am aware that it is not usual to negative the motion for a third reading. I am sorry that the criticism of the Bill has been left so much to members who have no great party responsibility, and that there has not come from the front Opposition bench an expression of the deep and widespread sentiment of the people in regard to it. I am sure that the personal popularity, and the suaviter in modo of the Attorney General, coupled with the fact that the measure has not received strong criticism from the front Opposition bench, will be responsible for its being passed. honourable and learned gentleman as our Attorney-General throughout the discussion of the measure. position of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn. learned member for South Australia, Mr with the exception of the United States of Glynn, has been, from the first, a most able critic of the measure. In speaking in generalities I wished to avoid personalities, but I am afraid that my sweeping statement has led me into a deeper pit. The leader of the Opposition will admit that the widespread sentiment of the country in regard to this measure should be voiced by some responsible person. I shall pass very quickly from what I regard as an utterly insufficient argument for the B ill that it is mandatory in the Constitution to create a High Courti n this year of grace 1903. measure is made more apparent by that argument than by anything else I can conceive of. It is not mandatory upon this Parliament to create a High Court this year, any more than it was mandatory to create it in 1901 or 1902, or to create it next year, or in the year 1905. No one disputes that the Constitution contemplates and makes mandatory the establishment of a High Court, but the advocates of the Bill have failed to show that its establishment during the year 1903 is mandatory. The hint has been thrown out that without a High Court there can beno Federal jurisdiction, and the judicial powers of the Constitution cannot be exercised. If that be so, the decisions of the States Courtsi n the numerous Customs and other Federal cases which have been heard of late are absolutely void, and the penalties which have been imposed are illegal, and should be refunded. But no one has fathered that opinion, and the best evidence tliat there is nothing in the point is that, notwithstanding the fact that those cases were fought on the most technical grounds from first to last, it has never been sought to impeach the constitutionality of what has been done. I have watched the progress of Bills through other Chambers of Legislature as well as in this House, but I have never ""before seen a Bil l so much based upon misty phrases and illusory hopes. It is also based upon misapplied allegories pedantically drawn from the position of the United States. It is a measure born of misunderstanding, and nurtured upon flimsy hallucinations and illusions. The idea of its promoters is that the High Court will be the guardian of the Constitution. Thati t will not be, nor will it have the final word as to the meaning of the Constitution. It is argued that a High Court is essential to Federation, but there is no country in the world, America, where a distinctive court for Federal questions exists; and it has been explained that the Federal Court of the United States was created because of tha peculiar circumstances of that country, the framers of the Constitution having no confidence in the States Courts, because their Judges were removable at pleasure or appointed annually, and there being no appeal to the Privy Council. The proposed court will neither be the guardian of the Consti'tution nor the appeal court for Australia. In the Convention I voted for a High The weakness of the case for the Court which would be the appeal court for Australia, but the attempt to provide for such a court was unsuccessful.

He quoted from Professor Dicey to show how in such private cases as the ship money case, -in the recent Taff Vale case, and in a host of others, important public interests were involved. No one will dispute the importance of the decisions in all those -cases, but the Attorney-General himself must admit that they were given by the ordinary legal machinery of England.

I regard it as un-Australian, and. as most derogatory to the dignity of Australia to create a High Court, and allow litigation to pass it by and go to the Privy Council. Owing to the blunder in the final draft of the Constitution, and to the interference with the Constitution when the Bill was being passed through the Imperial Parliament, it has been made quite distinct from its original form. I have always regarded the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court as of ten times more importance than its originaljurisdiction. Mr L. E.

132,Mr Higgins,"I explained my viewssuspended. I have come to the conclusion that the Attorney-General is determined to obtain a Bill of any kind that the House will give him. I suppose that he feels that if we appoint three Judges who cannot be removed, and it is found that these are not sufficient, he can afterwards come to the House and say"" We cannot leave the machinery incomplete, and the J udges without work to do; we must appoint two more Judges and extend the powers of the court."" In clause 17A, and elsewhere in the Bill, we have evidence that Ministers consider that the Judges of the States Supreme Courts are competent to deal with almost all Eederal matters, and yet they are persisting in their determination to create a High Court. If honourable members will look at clauses 19 and 20, and view them in conjunction with clauses 31 and 35, they will see that owing to the restrictions which have been imposed, the High Court sitting as a Court of Appeal may be constituted of two Judges only. A litigant who is not satisfied with the decision of a Judge of a State Supreme Court at present, has the right of appeal to three Judges of the Supreme Court, which is the ordinary number. Under the provisions of the Bill he can appeal to two Judges of the High Court. Suppose a Judge of the Supreme Court has given a certain decision, a litigant has now the power to appeal to five, six, or seven J udges sitting as the Judicial Committee of thePrivy Council, and I would ask honourable members which a litigant would prefer ? Would he elect to take his appeal to the Privy Council where he would have the benefit of the services of perhaps the Lord Chancellor and some of the most distinguished lawyers in England, or would he go to the High Court constituted of two Judges? Council hear him unless he went through the High Court? speaking of ordinary cases. I admit that owing to the provisions which have been made with regard to original, appellate, and exclusive jurisdiction, it is very hard even for lawyers to understand the Bill. The measure is meant to be a piece of machinery to settle litigation, bub I venture to say that, of itself, it will create litigation. I never knew of a B ill in connection with which more difficulties can be raised. Under bhe Bill we should compel a man who desires to appeal from the decision of a single Judge of a State Supreme Court to go before two Judges of the High Court, whereas at present he could go straight to the Privy Council. I can speak upon this point from personal experience as a litigant some time ago. I was one of the parties to an action which was bried in bhe Supreme Court of New South Wales. A wicked liquidator wished to put me on the list of contributories bo a certain company, bub he was beaben before a single Judge of bhe New Soubh Wales Supreme Courb. Then bhere was an appeal-no t to the Full Court of New South Wales, but direct to bhe Privy Council. of going direct to bhe Privy Council or through the Full Court of New South 'Vv £L1GS ing thati f this Bill had been passed the liquidator would have been compelled to go to bhe High Courb. Ib was a case which would have come under Federal jurisdiction, because ib was an action bebween residents of differenb Sbabes. I was a residenb of Victoria, and bhe liquidabor was a resident of New South Wales, and such a case would come within bhe scope of bhe original jurisdiction of bhe High Courb. The point involved in bhe case referred bo was one of company law common bo the whole Empire. The English Courts are continually called upon bo deal wibh such cases, whereas our own courbs are sometimes required to do so. The New Soubh Wales Acb was a copy of bhe English Acb, and yeb bhe liquidabor would have been compelled, under bhe Bill, to go to bhe High Courb, where bhere mighb be only bwo Judges, insbead of carrying his case direcb to the Privy Council.

I never felb bhab, simply because I was a Victorian, there was any danger in appearing before a New South Wales Judge,, and I am sure that no one in New South Wales would fear the consequences of having his case tried before a Victorian Judge.

136,Mr Higgins,"Yes; but l a m showtried ; nevertheless, cases between parties living in different States are brought within the original jurisdiction of the High Court. There was some occasion for a provision of this kind in America, but it is utterly absurd to a.pply it to our circumstances. I desire to put another case. Suppose an action were brought against trustees for some breaches of trust involving perhaps £30,000. Suppose, further, that amongst a huge mass of items there was one of £ 5 0 turning upon a bill of exchange, or some point of company law, or something that would bring the case within the sphere of Federal jurisdiction. Not only that matter of £50, but the whole action would have to be taken before the High Court. Moreover, when a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State has given his decision upon a suit involving, perhaps, £29,950, because £50 of that sum appertains to a Federal law, the litigant must appeal to the High Court, and not to the Privy Council. Surely, that is extraordinary and unnecessary. I would further point out that under clause 21, if an appeal be made fiom the Full Court of a State, it is necessary that it should be heard by three Justices of the High Court, whilst if an appeal be made from one Judge of a State Supreme Court two Justices only are required to determine it. In this connection I would point out that in Victoria decisions are very frequently given by five or six J udges. Let honourable members imagine what a litigant would think if he were told that he ought to appeal from the decision of six Judges of the Supreme Court of Victoria, who were unanimous, to three Justices of the High Court. Moreover in the latter tribunal two Justices out of three can overrule the third. It may, therefore, happen that the decision of seven Judges in a State Court-si x Justices constituting the -Full Court, and one being the J udge who originally tried the suit-ma y be reversed by two Justices against one of the High Court. The absurdity of this arrangement will make litigants strain every point to carry their appeals to the Privy Council. They will not go to a tribunal where their rights may be thrust aside by an inferior number of Judges. In order to secure business to the High Court, clause 36 provides that its appellate jurisdiction shall extend to judgments in regard to any claim involv£300, whereas before an appeal can be made to the Privy Council the amount involved must be £500. That provision will, no doubt, increase litigation in respect of cases in which between £300 and £500 is involved, so that lawyers are thus given an extra chance of making fees. Clause 40, which confers Federal jurisdiction upon States Courtsi n certain matters, is bristling with as many points as a porcupine with quills. I have tried again and again to understand its application. I do not blame the Attorney-General or the draftsman. The difficulty of the clause arises from an attempt which has been made to evade the provisions of the Constitution. I am sure that this clause will give rise to considerable litigation unless it is amended. It saysThe jurisdiction of Federal Courts in matters not mentioned in the last preceding section shall be exclusive of the jurisdiction of the several courts of the States, except as provided in this section. It then proceeds to confer jurisdiction upon the different States Courts. I do not understand the meaning of that provision.

The Imperial law declares that a litigant has a right to appeal from a Supreme Court or from a Full Court direct to the Privy Council. the clause to which I have attention it is laid down that no appeal shall lie from a Supreme Court to the Privy Council. What right have we, in legislating under an Imperial Act,to alter an Imperial statute which declares that a litigant may appeal 1 to the Privy Council after he has taken his case to the High Court. can there be to my question 1 to the High Court. ment any power to alter an Imperial Act1 Sub-clause (b) provides that a litigant may appeal from the decision of a County Court to two Justices of the High Court.

I doubt very muchI do not speak so positively on this point-whethe r the Federal Parliament has power to enable the High Court to interfere in this way with a State law. If a State law provides that a penalty of a certain sum of money may be imposed for a certain offence without appeal, I doubt very much whether there is any right on the part of the High Court to interfere by granting special leave to appeal. W it h regard to clause 41, I still think it is liable to the greatest abuse. It means that if there is a case arising under the Constitution, or involving the interpretation of the Constitution, the High Court may, at'any stage of the proceedings, for special' cause shown, have it removed. That provision, in my opinion, will lead to the most flagrant abuses.

As the appellate jurisdiction only applies to causes which involve £ 3 0 0 and over, the effect of clause 40 will possible answer be that in a case involving only £250, the decision of one Judge of a Supreme CourtA suitor must first go will be final. If a man has £ 3 00 or more at stake he will be able to appeal to the High Court, or to the Full Court, as he likes, but if the sum be only £250, and the Judge makes a mistake, there is no power of appeal.

The Attorney-General said also that these matters will be settled by the High Court at a critical period of our history. That is quite true; but the question is whether they will be decided better by the High Court Judges than by the States Supreme Court Judges. That is a point with which the Attorney-General has failed to deal.

148,Mr Higgins,"I am a member of theyears are over, come down with proposals for a complete remodelling of the measure. I apprehend that that is really what is in the minds of the Government. the Attorney-General pressing this B i ll with all these vital changes unless the meaning is"" Get a High Court by any means-hoo k or crook,"" so that when the Judges have been appointed with a life tenure there maybe appeals made to Parliament to give them more power and more officers. This Bill is irrevocable-w e cannot get rid of the High Court when once it is established. But if we only delay the creation of the High Court until we find what exact need there is for it we shall be able to adopt the necessary machinery. The Attorney General himself admits that the Judiciary chapter of the Constitution is defectivea circumstance which he regrets. What a commentary that is on the Constitution as it stands ! I felt sure this sort of difficulty would arise. The Attorney General says that the High Court is mandatory-that the Constitution is defective, and that, though the High Court will not work so well as he would like it to work, we must obey the mandate to create it . The position, therefore, is that even if we should think the High Court to be inexpedient, we are, because the Constitution says so, to be compelled to create one. During the course of the discussions on the Constitution I emphasized as strongly as I could the need for leaving as much power as possible to the future-to Parliament, and to amendment of the Constitution. The more I have watched the working of the Constitution, the more I am convinced that that was the only course which should have been taken. It is simply abominable to think that where the country as a whole feels that a certain course directed by the Constitution is inexpedient, it must follow that course. The inflexibility, the rigidity, of the Constitution will, in this as in other cases, be found to be our great bane. In America this inflexibility . has been found to be a great e v i l ; and I do not hesitate to say that in that country the Judges have made a Constitution as a sort of addition to the old instrument. But those Judges spoke as statesmen, and not as lawyers; no lawyer in these days would speak as did those Judges fromtime to time. It is a lamentable thing that we should be forced to create machinery because the Constitution so provides, instead of endeavouring to-have the Constitution No . amended if we deem an amendment exI cannot understand pedient. I sincerely hope that we shall follow a course which is honourable to Australia, and that we shall not allow a cOurt to be launched inopportunely-lik e a ship without sufficient timber or gear. But that will be, metaphorically, the position of the High Courti f it is launched under present circumstances. We ought to wait for a few years until we have more experience of our wants, and until perhaps-althoug h I would not make this an essential condition -ther e is an amendment of the Constitution which will enable us to create a court as a court of final appeal. We have the present Supreme Courts as ordinary work-a-day courts answering their purpose very fairly, and we have for extraordinary occasions the Privy Council, which may be called on to make the decisions of the local Courts uniform. This proposal reminds me of a man who, having a good serviceable buggv, and the free use of a drag for holidays and race days, insisted on also having a horse and carriage. And more than that, it is as if such a man, before he had finished making the carriage, was suddenly attacked by a fit of economy, and left out two of the wheels on one side. Too late, to my mind, there is throughout the country a kind of movement for economy. Two years ago I was one of those who called attention to the utter absence of any need for creating a High Court. I have done my best to emphasize the stupidity of creating that court under present circumstances. The subject was not discussed in the newspapers until it was too late, and honourable members had committed themselves, and had become used to the idea of having the court. The subject was not discussed until those cant nevertheless phrases"" the guardian of the Constitution "",' "" an Australian court to defend the Constitution from innovation and from State attacks""-ha d become the current parlance of the day. The only time apparently at which we can attack or encourage a proposal is before it reaches its second reading or even its first reading stage. There needs to be a good preliminary education of public opinion. Apparently just at the last moment various institutions began to howl in regard to the expense of a",35,Judiciary Bill Thihd Reading

Indeed, interference at that stage has had the effect of making the B ill worse than it was. The interference came at the last moment, when its effect was to induce honourable members, in a fit of economy, to cut and cut at machinery which might have been of some use, but which has thus been rendered almost useless. I am sorry for the Attorney General, because I think his original scheme was better than that which now appears in the Bill. The Attorney General saw, as a lawyer would see, that if there is a High Court there must be five judges. A t the same time, it was a mistake to introduce the measure when it was introduced. I never saw one more unlucky. If the cry for retrenchment had only been started before the Bill was introduced, .the position would"" have been all right. But the Bill had been introduced, and honourable members, some of them in anxiety and trouble, began to cut and whittle at the machinery. duced last session it would have gone through flying. member is wrong. As I have said already, I was one of several who, on the debate on the address in reply in the first session, called attention to the absence of any need for a High Court. There is a good deal of sound sense in the cry for retrenchment, and any party in the State who ignores the cry is simply foolish. Outside this House there is a strong feeling that we must not appoint public servants who are not absolutely required, and there is an equally strong feeling that if we have public servants we must treat them well. why not have it as perfect as possible 1 not what we have got. I do not know whether the honourable member for Herbert voted for three Judges as against five Judges. member has been consistent in this matter. I do not think we require a machine, but, if we have one, let us have all the wheels necessary to make it work. quired, why leave ib to rust on a lot of the measure which he has so strongly wheels ? bers are fighting for this High Court, with the idea that it will guard the Constitution, and be the usual Court of Appeal. I say deliberately that litigants will in nearly every case, after the first curiosity has subsided, go direct from the States Courts to the Privy Council. The proposed High Court will not guard the Constitution. It s jurisdiction is cut down upon one side and restricted upon another, so that the States Courts will be quite as effective in that respect. In my opinion there is no need for the establishment of such a tribunal at the present time. cognise that upon the motion for the third reading of a Billi t is inadvisable to enter upon a careful analysis of its provisions. I shall avoid doing so because, contrary to the opinion of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, I hold that the work of the Committee has considerably improved this measure, though I still consider it objectionable, inasmuch as it provides for the premature establishment of the I think the honourable High Court. I did not quite understand the honourable and learned member's reference to the action of the Opposition in regard to the measure. Throughout its discussion it has happily been regarded as a non-party measure, and up to the present stage no special credit has been claimed by either the Government or the Opposition for its merits.' Those of us who have taken an active interest in it have endeavoured to do our duty in regard to it . made by some to destroy it . a misapprehensionas totheneed for it, or from a correct appreciation of the duties of a representative. Honourable members have not allowed their opinions to be coloured by their party views. As the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has challenged the position of the Opposition, however, I would remind him that, with the exception of the labour party, only six members of the Opposition voted for the Bill, while seventeen members of the Opposition and eight Ministerialists voted against it. Therefore, if five more Ministerialists If the machine is not rehad crossed to this side of the chamber, condemned would have been defeated.",36,Judiciary Bill Thihd Reading

If he had received a little more support from honourable members who sit on the Government side of the chamber, he would have accomplished his end, though the Government have since yielded to some extent in regard to the matter. Honourable members on both sides of the chamber have endeavoured to keep the discussion of the measure in a pure non-party atmosphere. The Attorney-General told us that it has been considerably altered because it was introduced during a rush for retrenchment. anxiety for retrenchment which is now being displayed was very marked when, nearly two introduced. very strong was evidenced by the interjections of honourable members during the honourable and learned gentleman's speech, and by the opinions published in the press. The opposition to the measure has been shown on the public platform. Before a single word -was spoken about retrenchment, I opposed it as premature, because I considered that a High Court is not yet required to reconcile possible divergences in the judgments of the States Courts. member did not find that the electors took much interest in the question until he introduced it . fest a strong interest in Bills of this kind, even if they feel such au interest. The idea of asking them to "" enthuse "" upon such -a question as the meaning of clause 40 is ridiculous. They listen to the cloudy ex-planations of those of us who are lawyers, but we cannot lash their emotion into white heat on such subjects. But as to the High Court not being required at pre'sent, and as to the consequent extravagance of expending £30,000 a year upon it, public opinion has been fairly, pronounced. The Attorney-General gave us to understand that the effective cause of opposition to the -Bill was the objection of private suitors to the creation of a new tribunal-the objection of probable litigants to the interposition of a new Court of Appeal between the States Courts and the Privy Council. No doubt such an objection is felt, because litigants wish to secure finality as early as possible, and doubtless regard the interposition of a new Court of Appeal as unnecessary. But that is not an objection which was strongly urged on the platform. It is a strictly legal objection which is not present in the minds of many people outside. I have, however, within the last fortnight, presented several petitions against the Bill. Some of them have originated from meetings of electors in the country districts of South Australia, and some of them from associations which are not legal associations, but which include commercial men and bankers, as well as private individuals.

They are influenced by such references to the Bill as ""the Pat BilletsB ill ."" with those objections; I am simply trying to show that it is a mistaken opinion of the Attorney-General that the opposition to the Bill has arisen from the objection of probable suitors to the expense and inconvenience of a new and additional Appellate Tribunal. The statement of such an opinion shows the unfortunate position to which he has been driven in having to apologize for his action in faintly moving the third reading, instead of openly advocating it . He told us that the High Court is required for the discharge of certain public functions created by the Constitution. What are those functions?

SOLOMON -Will more appeals to the High Court1 crease because of the establishment of a High Courb. Such a court is not necessary to give finality to the judgments of the States Courts, because, unless there is an appeal to the Privy Council, the decision of the Supreme Court of a State in nonFederal matters is final. It is necessary only for Federal matters, and what expectation can be reasonably entertained as to tlie frequency of appeals in regard to them ? during the first year of its existence not a single appellate case was brought before the Supreme Court of America. member for Northern Melbourne answered that sbabemenb. the facb, whabever explanation may be given in regard bo ib. wards bhe number of such cases was only five, while during all those years only six were down for hearing. Therefore, when bhe Attorney-General asks us to agree to a heavy expenditure for bhe creation of a new bribunal, it is proper bo ask him what are bhe public functions which ib is necessary for ib bo perform. The number of appeal cases is exceedingly few, and we have bhe Privy Council as a final Courb of Appeal. I do nob bhink that ib is necessary bo deal wibh his statement tliat the liberties of Englishmen were secured by the decisions of the English Courts. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has suggested the answer by pointing out that we have our Sbates Courts to refer to.

Although matters of great importance have, without doubt, been decided, in .the Law Courts, the instances in which the liberties of the English people have been defined by the courts are very few indeed. Our liberties rest upon such charters as the Magna Charba and upon the Declaration of Rights, neither of which was there not be a judicial decision. It sounds very nice bo say bhat the courts are the protectors of bhe liberties of the people, but, as a mabber of facb, bhey very seldom are required bo acb bhab parb. TheA t borney-General has again laid sbress on bhe facb bhab bhere is a mandabe in bhe Constibution for bhe creation of bhe High Courb. I do nob wish to cover ground that has already been traversed several times, but I would point out that section 73 of the Constitution, to which he referred, provides that the very jurisdicI have already mentioned that tion which we must-if the Constibubion is mandatory-giv e to this court can be immediately afterwards taken 'away.

If ib is mandatory upon us bo creabe bhe High Courb, how is ib bhab one of bhe j>rovisions of bhe Constitution enables Parliamenb bo deprive bhe Court of the whole of its appellate jurisdiction? The answer is that the Constitution is not mandatory, but that bhe High Courb is to be simply the creature of the Parliament. It is intended that when a High Court is constituted the judicial powers of the Commonwealth shall be vested in it, and not in any -court outside the limits of the Commonwealth or in England. Of course we know that the Privy Council has certain jurisdiction as a matter of right, but we could not confer Federal jurisdiction upon any other court outside of A ustralia. All that is done under section 71 is to nominate the courts in which certain powers shall be vested when such courts are created.

If honourable members believe that it would be -an act of extravagance to create the High Court at this stage, they may regard themselves as perfectly free to vote against the third reading, apart Eroin any consideration as to the provisions of the Constitution. The Attorney-General has appealed to the prejudices and strong feelings of honourable members by stating that there are many important problems that will require to be solved by the High Court. He has said, for instance, that the question of the validity of the CustomsA c t awaits determination. I am not aware that any appeal has been made from the judgment of the Supreme Court of ""Victoria. I believe that that is acquiesced in as the only reasonable interpretation of the provisions which were challenged before Chief Justice Madden. -The Attorney-General mentioned, too, that the High Court may also be called upon to decide what industrial disputes may be regarded as extending be-yond the limits of one State. Surely -the Minister intended that as an appeal to those honourable members who strongly favour the settlement of industrial questions by arbitration. It seemed as if he were driven to appeal to the prejudices of those honourable members whose loyalty to the Government in respect to this measure is doubtful. He appeals to some members of the Opposition and to others with reference to the interpretation of section 125 of the Constitution, relating to the selection of the Federal Capital site. That is one of the matters that has been discussed politically out of doors, but I do not think it is likely to come before the courts, because the contention set up by New South Wales will not stay the hands of this Parliament. ticularly to that point. the honourable and learned gentleman should have mentioned any matter connected with the selection of the Federal Capital site as awaiting the decision of the High Court. There is no doubt the Minister was driven to refer to these, as cases which would have to be settled, in order to justify the creation of the court. The Attorney-General stated further that the proposal to make temporary use of the Judges of the States Supreme Courts as an appellate tribunal had been regarded, even by some of those who suggested it, as unconstitutional and unworkable. not allow it . for us to test the question, because it would rest entirely with the Government to apply to the Executives of the States for their consent, and also for the consent of the 3 J udges, without which we could do nothing. Unless negotiations were opened by. the Commonwealth Government, it would be useless for us to attempt to test the question by submitting it to a vote of this House. I believe that a temporary court, constituted of Judges of the States Supreme Courts, would answer all our present requirements. I would ask honourable members to consider whether the authoritative lead of the Ministry ought to be regarded as binding. The Bill, as introduced this session, was. entirely different in structure, though not in principle, from the measure introduced eighteen months ago. The clauses have been shifted all over the Bill, and some which were regarded as unconstitutional have been dropped. Therefore those who were inclined two years ago to accept the opinion of the Attorney General as to the perfect character of the measure which had been submitted to the States Judges must have found their confidence rudely shaken by the fact that the measure, as introduced this year, was reconstructed from beginning to end. Then again, when the Bill went through Committee, it was changed in principle to a large extent, and a good deal of the drafting was completely altered. What is more, provisions which were in the High Court Procedure Bill have been transferred to the Judiciary Bill. This is not a matter of detail, t butoneof substantial arrangement. ThewholeI was not referring parof the original jurisdiction first proposed, except such as is conferred by the Constitution and a very slight extension that we have granted, has been struck out. I would therefore ask honourable members who are inclined to rely upon the recommendation of the Government to recognise that, owing to the changes which have been forced upon them, the measure is no longer deserving of the encomiums passed upon it when it was first introduced. My strong objection to the proposed tribunal is that it is not required now, and that it does not satisfy Australian aspirations. Until we have",39,Judiciary Bill Thihd Reading

I admit that this is open to dispute, but in my opinion the clause is ulto'a vires. If that view is correct, we may have the High Court passed over in every case, not at the will of the Attorney General, but at the caprice of any litigant against whom a decision has been entered in a State Court. We were told by the delegates who returned from the Convention in London that they had practically secured the final decision by the High Court of all matters affecting the Constitution, because the certificate of the High Court would be necessary before such questions could be taken on appeal to the Privy Council. But if it is correct that a litigant can appeal from a decision of a State Supreme Court direct to the Privy Council upon Federal matters, an appeal will lie upon every other matter that arises, whether it affects the Constitutional rights of the Commonwealth or the States. As I have pointed out, the decision of the High Court will not be final, and wherever there is a matter involving some point of considerable public interest, appeals are almost as a right allowed to the Privy Council. considering that this Appellate Court will not have the final determination of our Constitution, and considering furthermore, that we have eliminated from its jurisdiction all matters of practical interest, it would be extravagant to add another to our existing tribunals. We shall soon be about the most judicially overmanned race upon the face of the globe. Apparently, we are to have, in addition to the Supreme Courts of the States, an Appellate Court, and a Commonwealth Arbitration State tribunals. to pause until .the necessity is shown for the creation of still another tribunal. amendment which I submitted at the second session of the Convention been carried, and had the direct appeals to the Privy Council been abolished, I should have been one of Mr Glynn. the strongest advocates for the establishment of a High Court to-day. The idea All quesunderlying my proposal was that all apof the peals . should be dealt with by the High Court, from which an appeal as a matter of grace might in extreme cases be made to the Privy Council. Thus, the interpretation of the Constitution, and the determination of all Federal cases, would practically have rested .with the High Court. I think that a division ought to be taken upon the third reading of this measure, and that public opposition to the growing tendency on the part of the Government towards extravagance ought to receive some recognition at the hands of honourable members. I rise chiefly to refer to the speech of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, who has charged the Opposition with being animated by no desire to effect economies. In view of the very strong feeling which exists in Victoria against the measure under consideration, doubtless some honourable members wish to effect reductions in the incidental expenditure, and the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne sought to show that those who occupy the Ministerial cross benches, and not the members of the dii-ect Opposition, were instrumental in effecting the important alterations which have been made in this B ill . But I would point out that in the division upon the motion for the second reading of this measure, only six direct Oppositionists voted in its favour, whilst eight direct Government supporters, with seventeen Therefore, Oppositionists, voted against it . If my honourable friend had successfully used his . eloquence to induce five honourable members representing Victorian constituencies to vote with us, the Bill would have been defeated. M.r.

The honourable and Court, in addition to similar learned member has spoken at considerable I ask honourable members length from' a desire to misrepresent the members of the Opposition.

His proposal to allow the right of appeal to the Privy Council was supported by only eight Government supporters, whilst 23 direct Oppositionists voted with the honourable and learned member. By that amalgamation of forces, we were able to carry the proposal submitted by him, although, it is true, by only one vote. Again, I find that ten Government supporters and fifteen Oppositionists voted against the pension proposals contained in the measure. I could refer to several other divisions which clearly show that the Opposition was chiefly responsible for effecting many of the most important alterations in this Bill. Of course, I recognise the signal service in this direction which has been rendered by some honourable members upon the opposite side of the chamber, including the honourable member for Gippsland. A t the same time it ill becomes the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne to criticise members of the Opposition who have done a great deal more to effect economy than he has. Throughout the discussion of this measure, the Opposition have felt that the Government were not sincere. I hold that the Ministry should have realized-if they believed in the necessity for such a measure-the importance of dealing with it during the early part of the first session, but they have shown no desire to enable those who have actions against the Government to proceed in a legitimate way. Time after time they have employed the strongest counsel obtainable in the different States, and, by raising the objection that the States Supreme Courts were not vested with Federal jurisdiction, have prevented persons from procuring justice. It seems to me that the Government could have effected all that was necessary in an inexpensive way byso amending the Claims against the Commonwealth Act, which was passed last year, as to vest the courts of the States with a wider jurisdiction than they at present enjoy. I would point out that this Parliament has already been in existence for more than two years. A great amount of time was practically wasted night after night in fruitless discussions on such measures as the Defence Bill and the Inter-State Commission Bill, with which the Government never had any serious intention of proceeding. Yeti t is stated tonight, as it has been stated before, that the High Court is essential,.and that this measure ought to be proceeded with at once, if great wrong is not to be done to a number of people. If this measures is necessary now, it was necessary months ago, and we ought to know why it was not proceededwith, instead of the time of Parliament being wasted over measures in regard to which the Government apparently had no serious intentions. It was understood that the Pederal Government was intended, in the matter of legislation and administration, to afford an example to the States, but expectations on that score have not been realized. ber discussing the Judiciary Bill? that the Government have failed to proceed with this measure, one of the reasons for that failure being that they have wasted the time of Parliament in regard to other Bills. is whether this B ill shall be read a third time. to the Attorney-General, who endeavoured to show that this measure is urgent. I doubt the urgency of the Bill, and I am of opinion that if it were passed the expense would be found to be very great. According to the Attorney-General, there would be little work for the court; in fact, the honourable and learned gentleman hesitates to say whether there would be sufficient to employ even three Judges. The proposal to extend the jurisdiction of the court was struck out on, I believe, the 10th June; but notwithstanding this the Attorney-General, some days later, strongly urged the Committee to fix the number of Judges at five. Then the honourable and learned member for Indi, who very often renders valuable assistance to the Government in the way of covering their defeat, came forward with the brilliant suggestion that we should "" split the difference,"" and have four Judges. The Government, of course, readily embraced the proposal. Yet, the Attorney-General, as I have said, now doubts whether there will be sufficient work for three Judges. member rightly understood the Attorney General.",41,Judiciary Bill Thihd Reading

I believe that a Bill slightly amendin'gand extending the provisions of that Act would do a great deal to get over the present difficulty. General alleges, the Government regard the establishment of a High Court as a matter of extreme urgency and importance, why did they not push on with the J udiciary Bill last session, instead of wasting the time of honourable members upon the consideration of measures which they knew could not be passed 1 Commonwealth one year's expenditure upon the High Court. establishment of a High Court is as urgent as. the Government allege, the expense involved should not be taken into consideration. I abstained from speaking upon the Billi n Committee, except on one or two occasions, because I recognised that its clauses involve many technical matters which are more within the province of a lawyer than of a layman. But, so far as its broad principles are concerned, I feel convinced that the measure is unnecessary, because what it is intended to bring about could be done much more cheaply in the manner I have suggested, and I shall therefore vote against the third reading. one could have listened to the jeremiad of the Attorney-General without feeling that sort of Sympathy with him which one might experience in regard to a fond mother who saw her first-born suddenly fall and lose one or more of his limbs.

What he said was that the Bill had been so emasculated that he could not be answerable for its future success. But, as As a matter of fact, the leader of the Opposition pointed out, a Government must take the responsibility for its measures. No Minister is entitled to say, because he is disappointed with the form which a measure has taken, that it is so much unlike the B ill which he brought into the world that he will not own it,' and the House must take the responsibility of Buti f , as the Attorneyplacing it upon the Statute-book. leader of the Opposition was taken from a speech made by me before the Bill went into Committee. able and learned gentleman said wasI must not be held responsible if a court of another complexion is created. what I said in that speech and in a speech delivered last session, not responsible for the measure. that the court created under the B ill as it now stands is not the court which the Attorney-General proposed. He wished to create a court of five Judges, who would receive emoluments as great as, if not greater than, those received by the Judges of the Supreme Courts of the States. The Committee, however, has provided for a court of three Judges, whose emoluments will be less than those of the Judges of the Supreme Courts of the States. Chief Justice of Victoria receives £3,500 a year, and the puisne Judges £3,000 a year, and they are entitled at the end of fifteen years to a pension which is a very substantial proportion of their salary. But the J ustices of the High Court will not be entitled to a pension, and it cannot be denied that their salaries constitute a smaller emolument than the salaries and pensions of the Judges of the States.

No layman or lawyer could read that and subsequent clauses without feeling convinced that the framers of the Constitution, and presumably the people of the Commonwealth who adopted it, intended that there should be brought into existence a Federal Supreme Court, whose powers are so carefully, deliberately, ancl studiously defined in these nine or ten clauses. Yet the honourable and learned member has to-day spent an hour in trying to convince us that after all this court is not wanted. Why should this provision have been inserted in the Constitution, and why should the words I have quoted be placed at the head of this series of clauses 1 How can the judicial power be vested in a Federal Supreme Court if, as the honourable and learned member suggests, the whole Federal jurisdiction is vested in the States Courts?

It may be satisfactory to his own mind, as an answer to my contention, but it does not affect the comment upon his inconsistency in taking up his present position. I now pass from that to the consideration of anotheraspectof the question. AVeare told that the whole of tlie jurisdiction proposed to be conferred upon the High Court might very well be vested in the States Courts. No one can have followed what has occurred in the State of Victoria without noticing that what is known as the Kyabram movement has been a most potent factor in much of the adverse criticism directed against this Bill. I am bound to say that those who have watched the effect of this movement upon this Parliament could pay no very high tribute to the independence of some of its members. That movement, which has developed into a sort of mania in Victoria, has so much affected this, one of the institutions of the Commonwealth, as to deprive certain honourable members of that independence and courage which we should expect from them as the representatives of the people. Can any one doubt that if the Kyabram movement had not sprung up in Victoria during the last twelve or eighteen months, the attitude of this House, whether in its capacity as a House or as a Committee, would, have been very different i Ever since the Kyabram movement was started, it has been obvious to me, and to many others who have watched its effects, that the spiritof parsimony has over-shadowed every expenditure proposal that has beenbrought forward in this Chamber. Wheneveri t has been found necessary to secure an officer of any class, the aim has been to get somebody cheap. Yet in the face of this we have a most notable admission by the leader of the Labour party, an admission for which I applaud him. The honourable mem-, ber stated that, when a gentleman who was. imported from England to manage the railways of New South Wales first came to Australia some years ago, he could not for the life of him understand how any man could be worth £3,500 per annum. But he has said, and courageously, considering the position which he occupies, that he now saw that if New South Wales could get another man, the counterpart of the previous one, he would be cheap at £10,000 a year. I heard the What is that but a tribute to the classification of brain power and a recognition of the importance of securing men of the very highest calibre for the highest positions. AndI would ask honourable memberswhether they could possibly imagine any office in the Commonwealth that would require a man of higher intellectual calibre in one of the learned professions than that of aJudge of the High Court, who will have to interpret the Constitution as between State and State, as between the States and the Commonwealth, and as between the citizens of the one State and of another, and so form a sort of safety-valve for the legal differences of 4,000,000 people. Yet the Kyabram influence has come in here and practically spawned over the whole of this Bill. The, measure has been emasculated, because, instead of having the larger number of Judges with appropriately high emoluments, we have a minimum number, to whom salaries all too low are proposed to be given.",45,Judiciary Bill Thihd Reading

I should have be^n perfectly prepared to proceed on the principle so courageously expressed by the leader of the Labour party, and recognise the positions of the Judges as the highest in the land. The honourable member for Parramatta has apparently not altogether cut himself off from his old associations, or quite left behind him the feeling that was prevalent at one time among his associates, that £30 0 a year was quite enough to give to any one man. insult. say anything offensive to the honourable member. I only desired to point out that he at one time belonged to a party which most openly espoused the principle that £ 3 0 0 a year was enough to give to any man, whether he had command of the Channel Eleet, or performed other comparatively unimportant duties. learned member ought to know that that statement is absolutely incorrect. member of the New South Wales Parliament I heard that sentiment expressed by members of the Labour party over and over again. unregenerate party. say that it was very refreshing to hear the honourable member express the new view, and to find that the light of experience had had its effect upon him. I shall remember his expression, and I shall take the liberty of referring to it in connection with other measures which will probably come before us very soon. There is, I say, no other position that we could create in the Commonwealth that would entitle a man to higher emoluments than those which should be given to the Judges of the High Court. Honourable members know that some men have received as much as £7,000 per annum for the management of big commercial companies in this country. I could mention one case of that kind, and I could instance numbers in which general managers of large banking institutions have received £3,500 a year. I repeat that the Kyabram movement has .COOK What salaries been a potent factor in this discussion, and that it will in the future be recollected that the parsimony exercised under its influence resulted in the reduction of the emoluments of the Judges of the Federal High Court to a level below those enjoyed by the Judges of the States of which the Commonwealth is constituted. We have heard a great many suggestions in reference to delegating Federal jurisdiction to the States Courts, and it seems to me tliat that suggestion is only another illustration of the effect of this movement. Even the honourable member for Macquarie appeared to think that by delegating Federal powers to the States Courts we could save expense. Quite recently I had occasion to speak to a Crown Law officer in one of the States upon I do not wish to this veiy subject, and he remarked that if he had anything to do with the matter, he would refuse to allow the Supreme Court Judges of tlie States to have these additional Federal duties imposed on them in order to avoid expenditure by the Commonwealth. the business already belongs to the States Courts. but the honourable and learned member must know that practically the effect of any such action as that suggested would be to saddle the States Supreme Courts with a great deal of the work which, under the operation of this Bill, will devolve upon the High Court. leave the work there. pose to compensate tlie Statesi f the effect of delegating Commonwealth adjudication to the Judges of-their Supreme Courts is to render necessary the appointment of additional Judges? But under this Bil l has not work been laid upon the shoulders of the Justices of the High Court, which many honourable members suggest should be borne by the Judges of the States Supreme Courts? Would not their ideas, if carried into effect, increase the work of the States Judges? Have not the Supreme Courts of several States complained that they have now more work than they can perform ? AVhat would be the result of the adoption of the policy in question ? It would necessarily be a very humiliating one to the Commonwealth.",46,Judiciary Bill Thihd Reading

228,Mr Bruce Smith,"Very likely.In effect we should be asking the States to supplement their Judicial Benches-to increase their expenditure upon their Judiciaries in order to save the Commonwealthunder the influence of the Kyabram movement-the expenditure that would be involved in the establishment of its own court. Surely that is not one of the reasons for which this Parliament was called into existence. I would further point out that the expenditure connected with the establishment and maintenance of a High Court was included in the Convention estimate of £300,000, which it was anticipatedwould cover the cost of Federation. Why^ should we in a spasm of economy, resulting from this political movement in Victoria, suddenly declare that we will delegate our Pederal powers to the States Courts? apply' to 5 per cent, of the business. M""r. BRUCESMITH to discuss percentages, because neither the honourable and learned member nor myself could say what class of work would be thrown on the Supreme Court Judges of the States. He admits himself that a percentage would be cast upon them, and to that extent I say the position would be a humiliating one for the Commonwealth. The Constitution not only contemplated, but to some extent ordered, the creation of a High Court, because we are told that "" the judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Supreme Court."" Of course there is no judicial power in existence which can command this Parliament to discharge that function by constituting a High Court. Buti f we were a State Parliament, it is questionable whether the position would not be different. If the word "" shall'-' has the meaning which is commonly attached to it in courts of law, I hold that there is a constitutional obligation on the part of this Parliament to bring into existence a Federal Court such as will be constituted by the Bill under consideration. I have never been in favour of the appointment of five Justices, and I should like to give my reasons, seeing that I had not the advantage of addressing tlie House upon the second reading debate of this measure. I have always held that the appointment of five Justices, together with the filling of the many other high and necessary offices upon the inauguration of the Commonwealth, constituted too much patronage to place in the hands of any one Government. But quite apart from that aspect of the case, it is well that the High Court should be established upon a small scale. As was pointed out by the leader of the Opposition, it would be the easiest thing in the world to pass a short measure at a subsequent date providing for the appointment of two additional Judges should the work of the High Court warrant it. We have adopted a similar principle in regard to the Constitution itself. There are people in some of the States-anc l especially in New South Wales who offered the most deadly opposition to the movement in favour of Federal union, upon the ground that the Constitution did not provide for the federation of the States in regard to a sufficient number of functions. In New South Walesi t was contended that we ought to bring about a unification, or at.all events, to go much further than the federaI do not want tion of the Customs, Defence, and Postal departments. The more thoughtful advocates of the movement, however, took up the position that it would be time enough for the States to delegate additional powers to the Commonwealth when we had had an opportunity of seeing how the experiment of federating these three great Departments worked. In the same way it will be easy for us by-and-by to add to the number of Judges-if it is found desirable to adopt that course-by the passage of a short Bill. But whilst the lawyers differ so much as they appear to do upon the probable effect of this measure, I think that laymen would do well to stay their hands, and to limit the number of Justices to three. In like manner the people of the Commonwealth will be acting wisely in limiting the functions of the High Court until they have an opportunity of seeing how it performs its work, reserving to themselves the power at a later stage to increase not only the number of Judges, but the jurisdiction of that tribunal. does the influence of the Kyabram movement come in 1 in regard to the pension orovisions of the Bill. member for Melbourne Ports may shake his head, but that is not argument. and learned member's statement.",47,Judiciary Bill Thihd Reading

We have heard a good deal this evening about the ease with which all our powers could be delegated to the States Courts. In this connection, I wish honourable members to consider for a moment three or four classes of.litigation which have arisen and will arise in the future, and to ask themselves whether the decision of such Pederal disputes could fitly or decently be delegated to a State Court. Let us take, for instance, the question of the interpretation of our Constitution. We know very well that in determining the meaning of our Constitution a great deal of thought, study, and research will have to be entered upon concerning the construction that has been placed upon certain portions of the United States Constitution, which, though not exactly similar to our own, contains somewhat analogous terras to those used in our Constitution. We all know that in interpreting our Constitution, constant reference will be made to the United States law reports. As the A t torney-General pointed out to-night, the interpretation put upon the United States Constitution led in many cases to the introduction of meanings which possibly were never contemplated by its framers. In some instances it led to the curtailment of rights which possibly its framers had thought were safe and sound under the language employed in the Constitution. That same difficult work will have to be undertaken here, and yet it is actually proposed that as questions arise concerning the powers of the Commonwealth under our Constitution, six Supreme Courts of Australia shall simultaneously be engaged in interpreting that instrument. Bill. subject to appeal to .the High Court. In stead of every State Supreme Court having the power to determine these questions, is it not infinitely better that they should be decided by one Court, so that we may obtain uniformity of decision, without any of tlie circumlocution which would be produced by vesting six different courts with Eederal jurisdiction? .The adoption of such a proposal would be productive of much I put forward my confusion and expense to suitors. I would further remind honourable members that there is a very large class of cases concerning which endless dissatisfaction exists in the States at the present time. I refer to actions in which a citizen of one State has attempted to obtain legal redress against a citizen of another. In this connection we know that although Acts of Parliament have been in existence under which it was believed that the judgments obtained in one State could be registered in another, endless confusion h'as arisen. In different States the J udges have repeatedly refused to register the judgments of another State, simply because the same reciprocal arrangement did not operate in the State from which that judgment came. creation of the High Court will overcome that difficulty. A citizen of Victoria may supply merchandise to a citizen of Western Australia, and a dispute may arise over the contract. Under such circumstances, if the citizen of Victoria wishes to sue and obtain a complete remedy, it will be very easy for him to do so under the Bill. Hitherto in such a case an action has had to be brought in Victoria, and then an attempt made to have the judgment registered in Western Australia. Under the Bill the citizen of Western Australia may be sued as if he were a citizen of Victoria, and a judgment obtained from the Eederal Court, with the result that execution is issued and a remedy obtained without its being necessary to ask any favour from a StateJ udge. Then how are questions between State and State to be dealt with? Suppose that the suggestion had been adopted of conferring Federal jurisdiction on all the States Courts, how could we ask the Judges of New South Wales to adjudicate between their own State and another State on an occasion, perhaps, when there was a good deal of feeling between the two States? How could we ask the States Courts to adjudicate in the case of a great difference of opinion as to whether the waters of the Murray really come within the boundaries of New South Wales-whethe r they are limited to one side, or are in the middle of, the river? We may imagine the difficulty and complexity likely to arise in asking a J udge or a State Courti n New South Wales to adjudicate on a question of the water rights as between New South",48,Judiciary Bill Thihd Reading

239,Mr Bruc E Smith,"Yes; and theAVales and Victoria, where a judgment in favour of A ictoria would involve the taking r away of what the New South Wales people believe to be part of their rights under their Constitution. No one can dwell on questions of this sort without feeling that it would be ridiculous, merely on tbe ground of economy, to attempt to get from a State Court a thoroughly satisfying opinion on a question in which the rights of another State were concerned. Then questions will arise between the Commonwealth and the States. By-and-by a question may very easily arise with regard to the acquirement of property from the different States by the Commonwealth. Claims will arise in connection with the value of the property, and the way in which the States shall be paid. AVe know of the somewhat bungling provision that was made by the Government in a Bill during last session, when it was provided that, as the Constitution had laid it down that the Commonwealth should pay the States for the property transferred, Parliament should determine how they should be paid. extraordinary process. The Commonwealth had to take a State property-a-post-office , a custom-house, or a defence workand it was provided that the State should contribute to the Commonwealth a sufficient sum to enable the Commonwealth to pay the State back for its own property. Such a measure was seriously introduced, not only in this House, but also in the Senate, If that legislation were persisted in it would lead to law suits between the States and the Commonwealth, in order to ascertain whether, under the Constitution, the States should not be fairly compensated for property taken over with the transferred services. How would such a question be settled 1 Could we ask a State from which property had been taken to adjudicate between itself and the Commonwealth as to whether it should be paid for that property ? If we did ask a State Court to so adjudicate, could we reasonably expect the State to deal equitably, fairly, and as I am concerned; that is a matter beOpenly between itself and the Commonwealth ? All these questions will arise in the future. It is all very well for honourable members, and honourable and learned members, to say that we have done without this High Court for two and a half years. But have we done without it ? AVe have done without a High Court in one way, but there has been a great outcry in some of the States. Something like eighteen months ago an officer of the Post-office in New South Wales stole a public document, and when an attempt was made to prosecute him in the State Court, that Court held that there was no jurisdiction. It may be said, of course, that it was proposed to confer Commonwealth jurisdiction on the States Courts, but at the same time we proposed to throw on the States the expense of trying men for offences against the Commonwealth. If that course were proceeded with we should have not only one law officer of the Crown, but a number of law officers protesting against the attempt to throw on the States the cost of carrying out work of a judicial character which should really form part of the expense and obligation of the Commonwealth. I have other notes, but I do not wish to prolong the debate. I . voted by pairing for the second reading of the measure, reserving to myself the right to vote against, the five Judges as proposed. The number has now been reduced to three Judges, which certainly meets with my personal That Bill provided for an approval, and the pension clauses have been cut outa step which meets with my disapproval. But still this Bill creates a Pederal Court, and gives emoluments enough to obtain a type of Judges who, notwithstanding the absence of pensions, will enable the Commonwealth judicial work to be, I think, satisfactorily performed. I shall, therefore, have much pleasure in voting for the third reading of the Bill. Attorney-General must have come to the conclusion by this time that his experiment of having what is practically an inquest on this mutilated infant is not a wise one. However, the experiment has afforded comparative strangers in this House an opportunity of telling other honourable members who are regular in attendance, what they ought not to have done. The honourable members to whom I have referred as comparative strangers can stay from the House as much as they like so far tween themselves and their constituents; but when every two or three weeks we have them coming here and criticising the work which has been done during their absence, I think we have a right to direct attention to the circumstance. The honourable and learned member for Parkes took it upon himself to say that the amendments in the Bill are the result of the Kyabram scare. .",49,Judiciary Bill Thihd Reading

Then the leader of the Opposition took up a similar position to that assumed by the honourable and learned member for Parkes, and complained bitterly about the pension provisions being struck out of the measure. The honourable and learned member for Parkes, in his closing sentences, admitted that the salaries provided in the B ill are the Kyabram party came into existence, I quite sufficient to attract a good class of men to the Federal High Court Bench. When the leader of the Opposition was speaking, I reminded him that the question of pensions had been settled long ago, and that afforded him an opportunity to practically sit on me with all his weight, and endeavour to completely extinguish me. The leader of the Opposition also referred, by way of innuendo, to something that occurred in the House some months ago.

Opposition had an opportunity of being here to discuss the Bill.

Opposition had a worthy object in criticising the pensions provisions, let him advocate pensions for other officials than those who have a salary of £3,500 a year provided for them. As I have been opposed to this measurefrom first tolast, and certainly long before shall vote against the third reading. As the evening appears to be devoted to the third reading of this measure, it is not oub of place for me to say a few words. In the first instance, I should like to say how surprised I was to observe the character of the speech delivered by the Attorney-General in support of the third reading. I have been in Parliament a good many years, but I have never heard a gentleman who wasanxious to get a Bill through make aspeech of such a character. a tragic note running through the whole of the Attorney^eneral's speech, and no doubt he looks with supreme pity on proceedings which have left him with a B ill of the character now before us. His original intentions were so large, and grand, and were so much on the American scale, that now the measure has shrunk to the actual requirements of the moment and has been put on a more modest basis, he practically says to the House-""There it is; it is worth almost nothing, but we will take it."" I never before heard an honourable member, who wanted to get a B ill through, argue in such a way. I can only interpret the utterances of the Attorney General, as the leader of the Opposition has already done, as a sort of appeal to another Chamber to insert some of the provisions which have been struck out by this Chamber there, I am sorry to say. to hear that, and the reply only makes the speech more remarkable.

255,Mr Joseph Cook,"I am very gladmust give the Attorney-General credit for his outburst of candour, and also for the analytical skill with which he proceeded to show how different this Bill is from the measure as originally introduced. That, again, only makes his speech more remarkable. The Attorney-General still wants five Judgesi f he can get them, notwithstanding that nearly all the work provided for them has been taken out of the Bill. If the Attorney-General still thinks five Judges are necessary, it is quite clear that, under the original Bill, fifteen Judges would have been necessary. Here the question of cost undoubtedly comes in. It ' is not for honourable members to sweep aside the question of cost, as the honourable and learned member for Parkes did, and taunt honourable members with being under the influence of the Kyabram movement in Victoria, when they show that they have some regard for the public purse and the requirements of the moment. In this connection I should like to say that I do not at all appreciate the references of the honourable and learned member to myself. quite gratuitous, and uncalled for, because they have not a scintilla of basis. Search the New South Wales Hansard reports as industrially as he may, I defy him to show that any member of that Parliament, labour member or any other, has made the statement he attributed to them tonight. 1 advise him not to repeat a parrot cry with such persistency and iteration. One might with a great deal more justice say that the honourable and learned gentleman is consistent in the attitude which he has taken up in regard to the probable cost of the High Court.

I have never believed But is that a reason why we should imthat all salaries should be levelled down to mediately set up this proposed court 1 The the lowest amount, and I hope that in future the honourable and learned member will not make such taunts whenever any one dares to differ from him in the slightest degree. No one questions his courage. Indeed, he rather courts the unpopular view, .and will go out of his way to discover an unpopular cause in order that he may be singular, and display this great virtue. The Attorney-General told us that among the matters to be decided by the High Court is the question of the water rights of the States. That has been admitted over and over again; but the reply to his argument is that there is no immediate prospect of the difficulty arising. Similarly, no difficulty can arise for some time to come in connection with the transfer of State properties to the Commonwealth. It is quite clear that such a difficulty cannot arise during the continuance of this Parliament, and it will be some years before it arises, if it ever arises at all Are we then to create a costly court, whose Judges will sit waiting for this business to come along ? No one has ever questioned the mandatory character of I regard those references as the provisions of the Constitution which relate to the establishment of the High Court. Every one admits that ultimately we must have a High Court. But we contend that until the functional powers of the Constitution are much more developed, we shall not need such a body. The establishment of a High Court will be imperative in the future, and we may then have to appoint more Judges than are now proposed; but until the Federation has felt its feet, and its financial arrangements are in a better condition, it will be imprudent to establish an expensive court. The Attorney-General spoke of the need for a High Court because of the public functions which will attach to it . He spoke in a most delightful way, hiding himself as usual in a cloud of that very high salaries should member for In d i that it has taken the",51,Judiciary Bill Thihd Reading

257,Mr Joseph Cook,"The honourable concrete cases he went back hundreds ofhonorable and learned gentleman must be in difficult straits when he has to buttress up the case for the Rill by an appeal to ancient history. We sympathize with him, because he seems like a lost sheep seeking the fold which was in his imagination when he first introduced the Bill. I think, however, that the Committee did good work in amending the Bill, and that the House will do better work in postponing the creation of the High Court for at least another three years. In spite of all the taunts about Kyabram, and about favouring small salaries, I am of opinion that we shall do a service to Australia if we-at present refuse to create costly machinery to do what may be done with less expense by the existing legal machinery of the States. able and learned member for Parkes seems to think that the opposition to this measure is mainly, if not entirely, due to the spirit of instead of from the members of the legal ""Kyabramism"" now prevalent in the States, and particularly in Victoria. Very few will credit me with much sympathy with Kyabram politics, or think that I am affected by any exposition of political reform emanating from that highly respectable association. But I recognise that we are responsible to the Commonwealth for the proper expenditure of its money, and, Kyabram or no Kyabram, if we think an expenditure unjustifiable, we are within our rights in refusing to consent to it . There is a very wide difference between unnecessary expenditure and expenditure upon necussary services. I shall always oppose anything in the nature of extravagance, and indeed any expenditure for which the Commonwealth is not to obtain a quid pro quo. member for Bland, however, that New South Wales, iu paying a very large salary to her first Chief Commissioner for Railways, gotgood value for the money expended; and so, if the Commonwealth determines to establish a High Court, it will probably be necessary to pay high salaries in order to obtain the best talent available upon its Bench. If the best talent is secured, there is not likely to be any complaint about the salaries paid. But I question the wisdom of establishing the Court at all at the present time. The Attorney-General, in the course of a very extraordinary address this afternoon, contended that Parliament is under an obligation laid down in the Constitution to establish a High Court; but that obligation is no greater now than when we first assembled. If the need for a High Court was so pressing, the Government should have endeavoured to establish it last session, instead of allowing the matter to stand over until tlie concluding months of our existence as a Parliament. The Commonwealth has got along very well up to the present time without a High Court, and I do not see that there is any pressing need for its establishment. I feel sure that it will be in tlie best interests of Federation, and of the High Court itself, if the consideration of this question is allowed to stand over until the next Parliament assembles. If , in the meantime, any cases arise which show the urgent need of a High Court, it can be established without further delay. If there had been any necessity for the court, we should have had a demand for it from the lay members of the community fraternity only. No doubt the High Court has been clothed with very high powers-power s greater than those conferred upon any judicial tribunal in the Empire. The Bill has been framed very largely upon American precedents, and we find that whereas in most British communities Parliament has hitherto been the sole custodian of the Constitution and of the rights of the people under it, it is proposed now to delegate these functions to the High Court. I am not sure that that would be a wise course to pursue even in view of the provisions of the Constitution, and, in any case, we need not be in too great a hurry to confer large powers upon an irresponsible body. I do not regard the measure as urgent, and for this, and I agree with the honourable the other reasons I have stated, I shall record my vote against the third reading.

Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) I do not know whether honourable members feel in a fitting humour for the resumption of the debate upon this important question at an advanced hour of the evening, after so much time has been absorbed in considering another subject. It is' to be regretted that we could not resume the consideration of this question without having our minds disturbed by other matters, because it is almost ' impossible to over-estimate the transcendent importance of the question of naval defence. I should like to pay what I consider to be a deserved tribute to the Prime Minister for the exhaustive, comprehensive, and able manner in which he .launched the Bill, although I must say that his statement 5z has not removed the very serious doubtsSpence, W. G-. which I have entertained from the beginning, YVatkins, D. as to the propriety and wisdom of ratifying, Watson, J. C. the proposed naval agreement. The keyWilkinson, J. note of this agreement is to be found in theChapman, A. preamble, which states that the Admiralty,, Clarke, F. as representing the Imperial authorities, and the Governments of the Commonwealth McLean, A. and New Zealand, having recognised the Paterson, A. importance of sea power, have resolved toPoynton, A. conclude the agreement which is set out.

ST. contemplated by the second affirmation, Conroy, A. H. namely, the development of sea power i it YVilks, YV. H. Australia, and I propose to advanceBraddon, Sir E. reasons in support of that contention. I a the first place, I should like to direct attention to some prominent features of thisagreement, and to remind honourable members of the very far-reaching results which will flow from its adoption. Although the financial aspect of the matter is an important one, I consider that it is of subordinate importance compared with the indirect consequences that will result from. the adoption of this agreement. Regarding, the £200,000 per annum, which it is proposed to appropriate for the development of the sea power, either of the Empire, or of Australia generally, I , for one, should be very sorry indeed to oppose any scheme which involved that amount, or even a much larger sum, assuming that I was satisfied it would achieve the purposes in view-pur poses which' are concurred in by every patriotic Australian, as well as by every patriotic citizen of the Empire. A t the sau\etime, it is just as well to remember that by the adoption of the agreement which forms the subject of the Bill, this Parliament not only commits itself to an annual expenditure of £200,000 for a period, of ten years, but absolutely parts with all control over that vote during the period, mentioned. We sliall have nothing more to say about it , because, as the Prime Minister admitted last night, the interpretation of tlie agreement will practically rest with the Admiralty. Of course, if Parliament is satisfied as to the wisdom, practicability, and desirableness, of entering into this agreement, the fact that it will with the power of control of our naval operate for ten years is not an insuperable obstacle to its adoption, although I think we ought to recognise that these permanent appropriations are unusual, and should be limited to a very small class of subjects. The second point in regard to this agreement is that it abolishes the old Auxiliary Squadron which was established for the special purpose of providing naval defence in Australian waters -and creates a new force as a part of the universal navy of the Empire. It is of no use disguising the fact that the new naval forue which is to be created under this Bill will not be one of a purely Australasian character-that it will practically be a part of the navy of the Empire, and will, subject to the commands of the Admiralty, be required to render service in any part of the three stations which were referred to by the Prime Minister last evening. In fact, the men and the ships, in cases of emergency, would probably be available for service in any part of the world. That, of course, introduces quite a new element into the consideration of a scheme such as this. It affords a very striking contrast to the policy embodied in the agreement made with the Admiralty in 1SS7-9. The third feature of this agreement is that it proposes to create a new Naval Reserve in Australia under the control of the Admiralty, and that it deprives the Commonwealth Government of the right to organize a naval reserve. A t the present time, of course, the Commonwealth Government can organize an Australian Naval Reserve. Sir future. for a moment that we are likely to have two rival Naval Reserves. To that extent the agreement will deprive the Government of a power which it at present enjoys. The fourth feature which impresses me is the agreement was subject to the approval that it obliterates and destroys the Austraof Parliament at the very opening of my lian Naval Forces, which have been estabspeech last night. lished in Australian waters by the States Governments. Finally, it makes no prothe Prime Minister did avow that condivision whatever for the naval defence of tion. A t the same time. I felt that the Australia in what are regarded by naval impression might have become current experts as special risks-thos e of raids and attacks by roving cruisers in time of war. These are some of the features of the agreement which I think ought to be very carefully considered before we finally part force for a period of ten years, ancl before we vote away £2,000,000 of Australian money. I cannot but regard a scheme possessing the features which I have outlined as failing to carry out the intentions of its framers, and I venture to say that it will fail ignominiously in developing the sea power of Australia, which, I am sure, is the desire of. every honourable member, and, indeed, of the people generally. I can only describe it as a make-shift or a stop-gap scheme, which has probably been adopted without a sufficient amount of preparatory consideration of the consequences that may flow from it in years, and perhaps, ages to come. I desire to remind the House of the fact that for the agreement in its present form this Parliament is in no way responsible, except to the extent that it was adopted conditionally by the Prime Minister as its representative in London during the Coronation celebrations. But I might further point out that the right 'honourable gentleman distinctly promised, on the eve of his departure for Europe, that he would do nothing to commit this Parliament to any grave question of policy, and that everything which he did would be subject to its approval. Doubtless that condition was well understood in London at the time he became a party to, and signed, the agreement. A t the same time we cannot but feel embarrassed by the consideration that he has pledged his word, and thus impliedly committed the Parliament of which he is the leader.

They hod been, he said, an objectlesson, not only to bheir fellow Britishers, but to onr Indian subjects, of the patriotism which inspired all parts of the British Empire. No body of men ever deserved the description of being ""handy men"" more than the men of the contingent.

Sir JOHN QUICK -show, sbill further, what has been done in -accordance with the power conferred by the Imperial Parliament. As early as 1866 the Victorian Government, upon the recommendation of Colonel Scrabchley, acquired the Cerberus and organized .a permanent naval force of 217 men, wibh a naval brigade of 227. in reserve. The Cerberus was afterwards reinforced by a number of small gun-boabs, which may .be found described in detail in the Naval, Manual. The number of men was afterwards increased to 301, at a cost of £27,000 per annum. Under the recent retrenchment by the Commonwealth Parliament, the number of men in .the Victorian naval forces has been reduced to 267, at the lessened cost of £19,700 per annum. I should here like to invite attention to a most peculiar circumstance. On the eve of the departure of bhe Prime Minisber for England, bhis House reduced bhe Naval Estimates very considerably. Mr O'MALLEY -The Military Estimates. I would remind the mates generally; and the result was that the number of men employed in the Australian naval forces was reduced from 1,933 to 1,463, making a difference of 400. The amount formerly expended on their maintenance was reduced from £67,410 to £46,524, showing a difference of £20,000 as tiie consequence of the vote of this House. There was a reduction in the number of men and a reduction in the amount annually expended ; and yet a few months afterwards the Prime Minister went to England, and, knowing of those reductions, he became a party to an agreement, by which our naval vobe is bo be increased by £94,000, involving bhe creation of a new Imperial force, bub, ab bhe same bime, involving bhe ubber effacemenb of bhe Australian forces. The question for bhe House to consider is whether the policy proposed is a wise policy. I remind honourable members for South Australia of the fact that in 1877' Sir William Jervois recommended is nothing in that a powerful ship of war should be What did I interject 1 obtained by the Government of that colony, to be supplemented with heavy guns on shore. Sir William Jervois pointed out that South Australia, with a sea-board of 1,500 miles, presented a very wide stretch of country open to attack, and that the main defence of Adelaide must be' a vessel of war. Acting On that recommendation, the Government of South Ausbralia procured bhe Protector, and emI should like bo ployed nearly 200 men ab an expenditure, ab bhe bime of bhe esbablishmenb of the Commonwealbh, of £8,598 per annum, which amounb has since been reduced by bhis House to £5,848.

268,Sir John Quick,"The Defence Estimay thus see what was done by the colonies, and what has been done by the Federal Parliament in the way of retrenchment. We can contrast what was done in the past with the proposal now before us to increase the naval vote by £94,000, after it has been red uced by £20,000. In New South Wales, the principle of local naval defence was also (recognised by the Government of that colony. -recommended the purchase of an ironclad to protect local commerce and the minor harbors, but particularly to secure Sydney from bombardment by a vessel lying outside the Heads. He pointed out the danger of leaving the city protected merely by land batteries, and the importance of sea defence. The Government of New South Wales took some action upon that report, though it was action of a limited character. They obtained and commissioned the Wolverene, and created a naval brigade which, at the time of its transfer to the Commonwealth, consisted of <563 men. It has since been reduced to 443 men, and costs now £5,583 per annum to maintain, as compared with its former cost of £9,904. In Queensland, in 1881, the Government was advised to procure for coast -defence swift gun-boats and torpedo boats and, as the result of the recommendation of the same distinguished naval officer, they procured the Gayundah, the Balnmah, and another small gun-boat, and created a naval brigade, consisting of 785 men, which has .since been reduced to an establishment of 581 men. Queensland formerly expended £23,000 per annum upon her naval defence, but the Federal expenditure is only £15,000 per annum. In 1881 Sir Peter Scratchley urged that provision be may for the naval -defence of AVestern Australia. He recommended that a sea-going vessel be provided to repel hostile ships on"" the coast, such vessel to be armed with modern guns, capable of piercing armour-plated iron-clads. I have drawn the attention of honourable members to those instances to show that the policy of local naval defence has been part of the continuous and permanent policy of the Imperial Government, aud has been supported by some of the most distinguished officers sent out to report on the -subject. It is not, as it has been described, the policy of naval faddists, and is not a ?new thing. Neither is it a policy which has been suggested by interested persons for the purpose of retaining existing organizations. It has been recognised as part of the naval strategy of the Empire to encourage the creation of local naval forces. had any other advice to offer. reason why the Australian . Governments were invited and encouraged to establish local naval defences was that Australia, In 1S79, Sir William Jervois being far removed from the possible theatre of naval warfare, would be liable to attacks, not by massive squadrons, but by stray cruisers. In support of that statement, I invite the attention of honourable members to the utterances of one or two authorities upon the subject. The liability of Australia to attacks by stray cruisers is the basic principle of the idea of an Australian Navy. One of the first authorities to draw attention to the subject in a very marked way was Sir AViHiain Jervois, who in 1877 wrote that he considered that the enemy might, no. doubt, despatch one or more cruisers to operate against our maritime commerce, or make a descent upon any of our colonial possessions. . . . A squadron intended for such an operation might consist of some three or four vessels. Eluding our cruisers, and appearing suddenly before Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, or in .Moreton Bay, it might capture the merchant vessels lying in the harbors, intercept any of the numerous vessels conveying valuable shipments of gold, or, under threat of bombardment, or, after actually firing into one of the lauge towns, demand and obtain a payment of many millions of nioney. Another authority is Sir Peter Scratchley, who, in 1876, reported that he considered that the Australian colonies were exposed to attacks from one or more cruisers -as a maximum, a squadron of four-which , eluding the British cruisers, might capture merchant ships in harbour, demand from onr capitals payment of many millions of money under threat of bombardment. Admiral Wilson, who was once on the Australian station, whilst not apprehensive of a squadron of frigates, was of Opinion that the class of vessels to be expected out here in time of war, and which we should be prepared to meet, are armed merchantmen. In 18S9 Major-General Sir Bevan Edwards reported officially to the Australian colonies on the organization of their forces, and in April 1891, in addressing a meeting of the ""Royal Colonial Institute in London, he saidIf we are found without' a decided naval Superiority, we shall again see attacks made upon our stations and bases in all parts of the world. If we had this undoubted superiority",57,Barton
269,Mr Higgins,"Unti l recently, no expert",58,Barton
270,Sir John Quick,"That is so. Thethe Australian colonies need only be prepared to resist the attacks of stray cruisers which wonld make a raid npon stations where coal is to be had, or to extract a ransom from some of the towns on the coiist by threat of bombardment. My next authority is the present esteemed and respected G overnor of Victoria, who, in addressing an audience at the Royal Colonial Institute in 1896, saidSmall expeditions directed, not to effect territhat in 1887 the Admiralty proposed, torial conquests, but to destrojnational resources, may, nevertheless, as in the past, evade a special localized squadron, owned by the superior navy. Such expeditions are of the nature of raids. Wherever national resources necessary for purpose of war are accumulated, local means of resistance agaiusb a raid are needed. I would next quote, a passage in a report submitted by the Colonial Defence Committee of Great Britain in March, 1901, in which it is stated that, although the Admiralty have accepted responsibility for protecting all British territory against foreign aggression, they may not always be in a position to prevent raids by hostile cruisers, their object being to destroy shipping or other accessible property of value in the British possessions in different parts of the globe. Then, on 7th April, 1902, Major General Sir Edward Hutton, a similar view in regard to the liability of Australia to attack by stray sea-wolves, It was in consequence of the reports and recommendations of these various Imperial experts that the Australian were induced to launch into large expense to make good their local naval defences. Not only were harbour works but naval forces were organized-on a large and expensive scale. The principle of an Australian Navy, which has been advocated by many members of this House, and by many public writers, in both Australia and the old country, is nob a new one. It is not, as was suggested the other night by the. Minister for Defence, a fad. Ib has been worked into bhe sysbem of Australian defence for upwards of 40 years pasb, and cannot lightly be disposed of by terming it a fad It was particularly in bhe development of the policy of Australian naval defence that the agreement of 1887 was adopted. author of bhe scheme was the late Admiral Tryon. It is not generally known, though ib is nevertheless a facb, bhab bhe idea originated wibh bhe Imperial Governmenb, and first assumed the suggestion bhab bhe Ausbralian Governments should, under Imperial advice and direction, purchase a fleet which, under Sir John Quick. certain circumstances, would. be under I m perial control and command. That does noblook as bhough bhe Admiralty had in any way departed from the principle laid down, in the Act of 1S65. But, probably, ib was in 1887 differently consbibubed as a body from bhab which ib was in 1902. It is, however, an hisborical fact that there should be in Australian waters a Australian colonies, and subject to thesupervision and direction of the Admiral. That statement will be found to be borneout by the records. Admiral Tryon discovered bhat the scheme would not work,, because the colonies could not act jointly in the matter. to be lefb wibh old iron on their hands. Sir JOH N FORREST -AV e are in the same position now. The federated Sbabes are now capable of joinb action.

Whereini t was stated that the Com. sioners for the Admiralty and the Governmenbs of bhe various Ausbralian coloniesHaving recognised bhe necessiby of increasing; the naval force for bhe protection of the floatingtrade in Australasian waters at their joint charge It is well known thab bhe have resolved, &c. There is a recognition of the necessity for an Australian naval force to protect the floating tra'de in Ausbralian wabers. Provision was made for a specialized naval force for bhe distinct purpose set out in the preamble to the agreemenb, and bhis wasfollowed up by a specific covenant by bhe",58,Barton
271,Mr Thomson,And they did not wish,59,Barton
272,Sir John Quick,"No, we are not.Imperial Government that they would not remove that Australian force without the consent of the Australian Governments. Here we have the recognition of the principle of a localized Australian squadron embodied in an agreement adopted and ratified by the Imperial Government, and yet we find the Prime Minister to-day supporting an agreement which removes the restriction and limitation as to the operations of the squadron, and asking us to contribute towards the maintenance of a fleet which will be free to go to almost any part of the Southern Hemisphere. What has become of the principle of a localized squadron, as provided for in the agreement of 1S89? of naval strategy to have a localized squadron in 1889, what change has taken place in naval strategy to render that principle unsound to-day ? What -change has taken place to justify the Prime Minister in giving prominence to the doctrine that it would be absolute madness to create a purely Australian squadron ? Sir JOHN too much expense. forward as a question of expense, but as one of naval strategy, pure and simple. Were we not warned that if we had a squadron of our own we might be left in the lurch, because we could not count upon the co-operation and support of the squadrons on the China and East Indian stations? The question is just as one of pure strategy, and not as one of finance, because we are told that strategic reasons of the most important character stand in the way of our having a squadron specially designed to protect Australian commerce. tish Admiralty were in favour of the conditions embodied in the 1889 agreement; they only yielded to our wishes. The late Admiral. Tryon was distinctly in favour of the restriction of the operations of the Auxiliary Squadron to Australian waters, on the ground that it would pro""bably lead to the establishment of an Australian navy at the termination of the agreement; that, in other words, the Australian Auxiliary Squadron would be the .germ out of which a purely Australian Squadron would be developed. He thought that this would afford a splendid means -of encouraging the colonies to have a combined naval force, and he laid great stress on the personal participation of our people in the naval defences of Australia. He saidI t is not a mere subsidized force that will do what is wanted. It is not only money that is required to produce effective forces, but it is the personal service of our countrymen all over the world. It is blood rather than gold that is the basis of every true force,and to awaken the true spirit, the Government of each colony, the people of each colony, should manage, as far as possible, their local forces during time of peace. Unless they do so, the burden of cost will be irksome, and the interest of the people iu their maintenance-whic h is a first factor for success-wil l not be evoked. Therefore, the Admiral's idea was that Australian men and boys should have an If it were a sound principle opportunity of being introduced to naval work by serving on the ships of the Auxiliary Squadron, and of thereby becoming acquainted with sea life and acquiring a taste for naval pursuits. He laid stress on that fact, and this was held out as a great inducement to the colonics to agree to the subsidy of £126,000 per annum, extending over a period of ten of £1,260,000. We were told that the It was not put Australian Auxiliary Squadron would be practically au instalment of a navy of our Own-that it would form the nucleus of au Australian naval force of which our people might well be proud. In Admiral Penrose Fitzgerald's Life of Admiral Tryon, the following passage occurs :-Whatever the future may have in store for them (Australians)-federation , monarchj', republic, or some new, and us yet unheard of, form of government-it is certain that their extensive maritime interests will eventually require a powerful navy for their protection ; and it will be on record in the archives Of the various Australian Governments that Admiral Tryon had more to do with the initiation of that navy than any other man. It is to be regretted that Admiral Tryon was not spared to work on the Australian station long enough in order to give effect to the primary and fundamental ideas whichwere at the basis of that agreement, namely, to endeavour to get the Australians to participate actively in their own naval defence. After his recall the command of the station passed into the hands of Admirals with other views, and it is to be mentioned as a most regrettable circumstance that they did not give effect to the idea that opportunities should be given to Australians to obtain some degree of train ing and drilling on board the subsidized",59,Barton

286,Sir John Quick,"The money isof the Imperial Blue-book. Referring to the Australian agreement at present in force, he saysLike every obher document that commences a policy it has faults, ancl to my mind there is no fault greater in it than this, that the relations of the Australasian Governments to the Imperial are simply that of the man who pays to the man who supplies. The Australasian Governments pay us a certain contribution. Por this contribution we supply thein with a certain article. Now this is good so far as it goes, but it does not to my mind go far enough. It does not give our New Zealand and Australian fellow-countrymen the sense of personal interest, of personal possession, in the British navy which I most of all desiderate for the future. , What is the true application of that 1 It is that if we wish to develop the sea power of Australia we must-personally participate not merely by paying cash subsidies to the Imperial Government or any other authority, but by organizing on our owniuitiative and atour own expense. It is true that under this agreement some Australians are to be employed, but they are not to be employed by the Australian Government. They are to be employed by the Admiralty. They are to be under the control of the Admiralty, and not of the Australian Government. I consider, sir, that the art of governing is equally as important as the art of serving ; and if, instead of taking the responsibility of organizing these forces ourselves, and keeping them under our control in time of peace-subject , of course, to Imperial control in time of war-w e hand over the whole control and the whole organization both in time of peace and in time of war, then I say we shall never develop that maritime spirit to which the First Lord of the Admiralty refers, but shall always maintain the relationship which exists between the man who pays for services and the man who receives that payment. That is the fundamental vice of this agreement. It fails to give effect to the very principle which the First Lord of the Admiralty was most anxious to impress upon the Imperial Conference. In the Spectator at the 21st March, 1903, further prominence is given to this idea of an Australian navy. Referring to a statement made by Mr Arnold Foster, as to the persistent objection of the colonists in the matter that we are now discussing, the Spectator saysWe entirely object to this way of looking at the question, ancl believe that far more serious results are likely to ensue from attempts to shame or cajole the colonies into Admiralty contribution. Sir John Quick. Again, later on, the Spectator saysOur statesmen grumble because the colonies are apathetic, and yet will not allow them, or, at any rate, will not help them to make the form of contribution towards naval preparation which they make and are willing to make. If we left off dinning into the ears of tlie colonies tliat only contributions in cash were worth having, and. that contributions in kind were worthless, we Should find the colonies raising naval reserves from their sea-faring population, and also equipping small local squadrons. The latter might uot be powerful at first, but they would be a beginning, and they would be immensely useful in creating and maintaining a naval spirit in the colonies. That is the fundamental idea to which I desire to give prominence in my remarks, namely, that by encouraging the colonies to defend themselves by conjiributing in kind, by supplying men and ships, they would be stimulated not only by self interest, but by patriotic and Imperial pride, and would do more in the direction of contributing towards naval defence than they are ever likely to do as the result of this constant dinning into their ears of the request for a money subsidy. I should like to quote, not only these authorities, but the opinions of three British Admirals' in support of the contention to which I now give prominence. The first I quote is Admiral Hopkins, whose opinion is to be found recorded in the Spectator of the 28th March last. I invite the attention of honourable members to this, because in some quarters it seems to be accepted as an almost axiomatic principle that the idea of an Australian navy is beyond the realm of reasonable possibility and discussion. According to Admiral Hopkins and other Admirals, whose names I shall give, it is not so. Admiral Hopkins saysIn my judgment, the reiteration of our demand, for money, and more of it, is undignified, ancl more likely to estrange and weaken their regard for the mother country than to strengthen their desire for Imperialism, and it is Imperialism we want, and not a miserable contribution in money which would hardly provide a third-class cruiser, and only tends to wound the pride of a young and rising nation, whose susceptibilities should be soothed rather than riifHed. In fact, as you suggest, let them contribute in their own way and be encouraged to provide reserves, &c, which would be as their military volunteers have been, of the greatest use when men are wanted in war time, and of real value on the side where we are navally weakest. That idea of providing naval reserves was Lord Brassey's idea. Admiral Hopkins goes on to sayOn the North American continent, Canada, whose Imperialism none can doubt, refuses to -give a money contribution, whilst Newfoundland, -a comparatively poor country, supplies'her quota -of hardy fishermen as naval volunteersa far better gift than any money concession. 1 nm aware, sir, that you and I are advocating an unpalatable doctrine to many who apparently cannot see that for England (in-the plentitude of her wealth) to extract a valueless sum of hard cash -from those who in thoir prido of race, consanguinity, and country, would cheerfully pour out their blood for us, is rather to retard than advance the Imperialism we desire. That is the testimony of a British Admiral, not of a faddist.
