Italian and other Mediterranean migrants are notsubjected to any medical examination other than the customary quarantine inspection, which is more or less casual. .Does the Minister for Health approve of this differentiation? was in England, in 1928, I recommended to the Commonwealth Government a system of medical examination of migrants with a view to protecting this country against an influx of people who did not conform to our physical standards. That system is now in force. Migrants who have passed the examination preliminary to acceptance are again examined on the What action ship, and a third time before disembarkation. 1 understand that in Italy intending migrants to Australia undergo a careful medical examination, based upon the K form used at Australia House. If applicants do not conform to the standard laid down in that form, they are not allowed to embark. They are also examined on board before disembarkation, and any persons who, in the opinion of the quarantine omcers, do not comply with the provisions of form K are reported to the department with a view to their compulsory repatriation.

16,Dr. Earle Page,"The CommonThe following paper was presented:New Guinea Act-Ordiname of 1020-No. 6 -German Missions received from the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) an intimation that he desired to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" the effect of the tariff on agricultural implements, and tbe report of the Tariff Board thereon.' ' Five honourable members having ris"",n in their places, Question proposed. I desire to discuss the effect of the tariff on tlie prices of agricultural i m plements, and to urge that the present duties be replaced by a bounty. There is a strong conviction amongst the primary producers that the implements required in their industry are more costly than they .should be, and that the very high tariff is partly, if not wholly, responsible for that. Their persistent agitation over a number of years for relief culminated in the Prime Minister's request to the Tariff Board, in 1924, to inquire into ancl report upon this subject. The board's report was presented to Parliament last year, not long before Parliament was dissolved, and this is the earliest opportunity I have had to discuss it . Whilst1 agree with some of the conclusions in the report, others are open to criticism, and w ill not meet with general acceptance. A t least one conclusion is absolutely ludicrous. its investigations upon four vital and pertinent questions-1 . Is the existence of the agricultural implement industry of udvantagc to, and in the interests of, the primary producers? necessary in order to maintain that industry? 3. If so, should the industry be protected by a duty or a bounty? 4. Has the tariff resulted in excessive prices being charged to the primary producers? I entirely agree with the board's answer to the first question. It is desirable that Australia should manufacture the implements required by its primary producers. Therefore, I am wholeheartedly in favour of local production. In moving this motion to-day I am not acting as propagandist for the importing firms. On ON AGRICULTURAL my own f a r m I have used Australian implements with satisfaction. I am not pleading for the unrestricted importation of implements; but, in common with other agriculturists, I believe that the prices at present charged are too high. Through the courtesy of tbe honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister), I was afforded an opportunity some time ago to inspect the Sunshine Harvester Works. I was Agreeably surprised by thc magnitude of the operations conducted there, and the facilities for mass production, whicli, I believe, are not excelled in any other agricultural implement works in the world. I saw men engaged on piecework who appeared to display the acme of efficiency and speed, and I could not help thinking that paying for work done rather than for the time occupied i u doing it is better, not only for the men, affording, as it does, opportunity for efficient workers to earn more than they otherwise would, but also, by reducing the overhead expenses, cheapens the article to the consumer. I believe that no men work harder or more skilfully than tliose employed at the Sunshine Works. I am one of those who believe that the manufacture in Australia of the implements we require is not only of advantage to the workmen engaged, who are our own citizens, but provides opportunities for the invention and perfecting of the best type of agricultural implement for Australian conditions. The second point considered by the Tariff Board was, "" Is protection necessary for the maintenance of the inThe board based dustry?'"" I believe that the contention is sound, that protection if it is used not to inflate prices, but to secure the whole of the business to the local manufacturers, and thus enable them to undertake mass 2. Is protection production, should mean cheaper implements. So far, there has not been much practical proof of this iu the direction of a substantial reduction of prices to the users of implements. If I were asked if protection is necessary for the maintenance of the industry, and to state how much fiscal protection was necessary to that end, I would inquire, first,",15,Examination
17,Mr Speaker Announced That He Had,,16,Duties Implements Format Motion Eor Adjournment
18,Mr Paterson (Gippsland) [11.11].,"how much natural protection the local manufacturer received in the way of ocean freight, marine insurance, packing, and loss in exchange. Secondly, I would ask how our wages and conditions compare with those in the countries with which we are competing. Natural protection varies with the commodity. bale of silk may be described as mid turn in parvo, as it is valuable, but pmall in bulk, and consequently the freight on it is small in proportion to its value. Agri cultural implements, on the other hand, are not only weight}' but bulky. Ocean freights are generally based upon measurement and hence in regard to agricultural implements there is a great of natural protection enjoyed by the local manufacturers. before the Tariff Board showed that this natural protection ranged from 25 per cent, to 41-J per cent, on different articles. This was made up in ocean freight, marine insurance, packing, railway freight in the country of manufacture, and also a certain amount for loss in exchange. The last-mentioned item has now almost dropped out of consideration, so that the natural protection at present is actually a little less than it was when the report of the Tariff Board was prepared. am, however, dealing with the figures considered by the board. Most persons will Agree that a natural protection of from 25 per cent, to 4 1 i per cent, is a heavy handicap to overseas competitors, and ought to be sufficient to give local manufacturers a good start in tbe race for the market. Another question considered by the board was, "" A r e we under any disability in regard to wages? Do our Australian conditions impose upon us a handicap as compared with our competitors?"" thc scale of wages in Toronto, Canada, compared with that in Melbourne, for 48 hours a week in each case, as follows :-Toronto. A week. is. d. Rlai-ksmitlis Machinists Irunmoulders Patternmakers . (i 13 2 5 0 0 Sheet-metal workers Carpenters Painters Ur. Paterson. I wish to be quite f a ir in this matter. I l appears highly probable, although I cannot prove it , that tbe Canadian wages paid are probably for piece-work performed during a period of 48 hours, whereas the rates for Melbourne are the ordinary wages board determinations. AsA a good deal of piece-work is undertaken at Sunshine, it is probable that the men there are earning more than the wages board rates, and are possibly receiving as much as their Canadian competitors. But I think it is safe to say that Canada pays at least as high wages as we do, and, therefore, it cannot be said that our manufacrather than on weight, turers are under any disability in that respect. In the matter of material, iron deal forms the principal portion of an agricultural implement; and, as is well Sworn evidence given known, we have in Australia some of the richest iron ore deposits in the world, from which as much as 67 per cent, of iron can be obtained. Mr G. D . Delprat, when the general manager of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company, informed his directors that the iron ore which his company was treating was so remarkably rich that it could be smelted in open competition with any other country without protection. I admit that since that statement was made, owing to the in I crease in the cost of coal and transport, these .conditions do not now obtain. Nevertheless, we must admit that we are in a particularly fortunate position in having iron ore containing 67 per cent, of iron. I am satisfied that if some of the dairymen in Victoria whom I represent and those in Queensland whom you, Mr. Speaker, represent, could breed cows capable of producing m i l k containing 67 per cent, of butter-fat, they would think that the economic millennium had como. In addition to the natural protection which I find in the evidence that I have mentioned, which, at tlie time of the Tariff Board's investigations, ranged from 25 per cent, to 41 per cent., there is a fiscal protection of from 35 per cent, to 57 per cent, on Canadian factory Melbourne. prices. The difference between the A week. nominal percentage as shown in the £ «. d, tariff schedule and the actual per. 0 3 3 4 17 0 centage is made up in this way: The 45 . 5 18 ii 4 !) fi per cent, on binders is not imposed upon . 5 18 a 4 19 fi the actual net price of the binders as they (i 13 2 4 17 0 leave the factory, but upon a price which . 7 13 0 4 17 0 includes cost of carriage to the seaboard 6 6 7 4 5 0 to and various other costs which fluctuate, 4 17 0 with the result that at the time the inquiry was held the fiscal protection on a binder was 57 per cent., and the natural protection was 40 per cent., making the total 97 per cent. The average farmer does not mind how high the protection is, provided that it is used to secure the local market, to make mass production possible, and to supply him with implements at rates approximating those charged to Canadian farmers. He would be satisfied 1$. he could obtain an Australian implement at a price remotely approaching that which a Canadian or American farmer pays for his implements."" The objection of the Australian farmer to the tariff, as applied to agricultural implements, is that it is used to maintain high prices. Before dealing Jwith question 3 asked by the Tariff Board, I shall pass on to question 4, "" Has the tariff resulted in excessive prices being charged for agricultural implements ?"" The Tariff Board has in all cases refrained from comparing our prices with those ruling in Canada, America, or 'Great Britain. The board has invariably used the foot rule of import parity, and compared our prices with those at which our competitors could land their goods in Australia. facturers have taken f u l l advantage of the natural protection and 12£ per cent, of fiscal protection as well. other words, they are selling their impleof production, which should be borne by ments on an average at 12$ per cent, above the import parity. If they sold these implements at, say, X2-\ per cent, above the Canadian price, or 12£ per cent, below import parity, which would be much the same thing, we would have little to complain of, but to charge for them at 12£ per cent, above import parity is a horse of another colour, and leaves a good deal of room in the farmer's mind for believing that this particular industry is an incubus rather than a blessing. I am indebted to the Tariff Board for a particularly good joke contained in its report. joke, and it is in regard to the taxation disability which it considers the local manufacturers suffer as compared with the importing firms. Both local and importing firms pay a company tax at the rate of Is. in the f l , but the shareholders of local firms, who, according to the Tariff Board, appear to be generally in receipt of individual incomes of more than £6,500 a year, pay income tax at the rate of 6s -5d. in the £ 1 ; and thc board considers it reasonable to deal with the payment of 6s. od. in the £1 on private income as a business expense and a legitimate charge against, the cost of producing implements. It says, in effect., that a manufacturer does not really get the benefit of 12^ per cent, of the tariff, but only of 6^ per cent., because the remaining 6 per cent, is used to pay income taxOverseas firms, however, have to pay income taxation in the countries in which they are manufacturing. The Tarifl Board should state the position in one of two ways. It should stick to the undiluted statement that the agricultural implement makers in Australia take advantage of the whole of the natural protection and the tariff to the extent of 12^ per cent., or, if it wishes to put the case in an optional way, it should say that thc manufacturers charge the fanner only. 6§ per cent, of the fiscal protection, and,, in addition, compel their customers to> It has found that our manupay their income tax at the rate of 6s. 5d. in the £1. My own view is that the company tax might fairly be described In as a legitimate charge against the costthe industry; but personal income tax imposed upon individual shareholders should be regarded as remote from the business, and concern only the private life of such shareholders.' It should not be a charge against the cost of production. If we turn from this attempt to compare our prices with import parity prices, and get right down to what the Australian farmer pays as compared with the Canadian or American farmer, we find, according to sworn evidence given before the Board, that when the price of binders in Australia was £75, a similar implement was sold in Canada for £47, and in America for £45. Our price was 59 per cent, above the Canadian, and 66 per cent, above thf:' American price. The price of a mower was £33 5s. in Australia. £17 7s. 6d. in Canada, and £16 10s. in the United States",16,Duties Implements Format Motion Eor Adjournment

I commend to the House the proposal that it should foster the agricultural implement industry by a bounty instead of by the present tariff, which is much too high, and undoubtedly has the effect of increasing the cost of necessary machinery. Trade and Customs) [11.38] -The honson) has placed before the House some reasons why, in his opinion, bounties should be substituted for import, duties on agricultural machinery. I do not in tend to be tempted into a general tariff discussion, and I shall confine myself to replying to the observations of the honourable member. The whole subject has been exhaustively investigated by the Tariff Board, which took many months to arrive at its conclusions. Those conclusions have been printed, and have been open to the scrutiny and criticism of all persons affected: but they remain unchallenged, even by the honourable member. I am glad that the honourable member has been moderate in his criticisms. In reply to two or three of those criti cisms, I point to page 19 of the Tariff Board's report, and to the board's report on the profits of manufacturers. Time w ill not permit me to traverse the whole argument; but I shall add a few observations of my own on the matter wider discussion. The agricultural implement industry is a very important secondary industry in this country. It employs 5,000 men directly, and 3,000 to 4,000 indirectly, in supplementary manufacturing processes. Tlie value of its output is nearly £3,500,000 a year, and it pays in wages about £1,500,000 a year. Our total im portations of agricultural machinery amount, to £893,000 worth, of which £276,000 worth is imported under the British preferential tariff, or can be so imported, entirely free. This great industry in Australia is unique. It is comB u t by mon knowledge that the stump-jump plough and cultivators, the combined harvesting machines, and the combined d r ill and cultivator, are all of Australian in If we are to f ill our great vention, and have been of enormous advantage to the producers of this country. all that. tion to say that the strippers and combined harvesters have saved millions of pounds sterling in Australian farming, and have been a means of greatly extending the production of wheat. Stumpjump ploughs and cultivators have saved the farmers in all the States enormous sums of money in clearing their lands, and have enabled them to produce grain profitably over great areas which could not otherwise have been cultivated. The foreign trusts that have been operating in Australia for over 30 years have done nothing of that character; they have merely copied the inventions of Australians, and competed with them in the Australian markets. Striking testimony to the value of Australian implement factories is to be found in bulletin 166, issued in 1918 by the Department of Commerce of the United States of America. I quote that bulletin, which readsThe enormous increase in wheat-growing in Australia would hardly have been possible had not suitable machinery been evolved capable of satisfactorily handling the matured crop under the climatic and labour conditions prevailing in that country. The entire credit for the development and perfection of the stripper, and later on of the stripper harvester, is due to the Australians themselves, as both of these machines were invented and first perfected and built in that country. Wheni t is considered that these machines, as built at present, are but little different from the first ones built, and that under ordinary conditions they work in a most excellent manner, it must be admitted that Australian agricultural engineers are second to none when given an equal opportunity. Bounties are granted for the purpose of initiating and establishing industries, and are largely a temporary expedient; import duties are for the .purpose of protecting established industries against the undue competition of outside manufacturers. Also, Customs duties aim at giving, if possible, the whole of the home market to the home manufacturers, subject, of course, to efficiency on their part and reasonable charges being made to the purchaser.

26,Mr Pratten,"It is uo exaggeraentirely different from those that have so f a r been granted bounties. Tbe latter -deal with simple, single items, whereas there is a very wide diversity in the range of agricultural implements. reason of its complexity, it would be almost impossible to apply the system of bounties to the agricultural implement industry. facturer alone has 275 different items in his price-list, and otlier manufacturers have numerous items, each of which differs in some degree from every other. If we attempted to provide a range of bounties, rendered impossible. The different reports that have been made in regard to the agricultural machinery controversy have repeatedly demonstrated the fact that the duties are paid by the importer. That is particularly noticeable when a comparison is made with prices in the Argentine and New Zealand. However desirous an importer in Australia may be of getting a higher price, he is unable to do so against well-established local competition. An ounce of fact is worth a ton of theory. I have, therefore, gone to some trouble to ascertain the position of a Mallee farmer in relation to the agricultural implements that he uses. that can be done is to go on a Mallee block. tion of the honourable member for ""Wimmera( Mr Stewart), and I challenge it with the statement. I shall now make. Assuming that a Mallee farmer, on an average 1,280-acre Mallee farm, grew crops of wheat, oats, and some fallow, he would require one tractor, or eight horses. The tractor is free of duty, and nobody wil l suggest that an Australian horse is an agricultural implement. A further requirement would be a wagon; but that does not come within the scope of our controversy. Other requirements would be one eight-furrow plough, stump-jump, tractor-drawn, the selling price of which in Australia to-day is £ 1 1 5 ; one set of eight-wing harrows, the selling price of which is £22 10s.; one 20-combine, which costs £91 4s.; one 10-ft. header harvester, costing £219 ; one 8-ft. reaper and binder, costing £ 9 0 ; and one chaff-cutter plant, 9-in. mouth, three-knife, costing £66 10s. He would also' have to purchase sundries from time to time; but I have not taken those into account. The total purchase By price of those agricultural implements is £604 4s. It was more or less admitted by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) that the increased price of those implements, because of the operation of the tariff, was 12-J per cent. On a capital outlay of £600, that would amount to £75. I am informed, and 1 believe, that with reasonable care those implements w ill last for fifteen years. pulling the Minister's leg. fifteen, we find that the annual increase is £ 5 , which is equal to only 2s. a week. The primary producer has the advantage of the presence of efficient factories on the spot. The prices of Australian-made agricultural implements have, since 1921, been regularly and consistently reduced. The Australian implement makers are not charging excessive prices, nor' are they making undue profits. The fullest possible inquiry has demonstrated the fact that the Australian agricultural i m plement industry is of inestimable benefit to our producers. It leads the world, and to now. change from duties to bounties would not only make administration i m possible, but would also be u n f a i r to the industry. The only conclusion possible is that the duties on agricultural implements impose no real burden on the primary producer. -It was a noticeable fact, Mr. Speaker, that when you asked whether the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) was supported in his proposal to move the adjournment of this House, a few of those honourable members who sit in the corner opposite rose in their places, but tbe solid phalanx of honourable members who support the Government and sit on the back benches remained in their seats. what protection means to Australia. stration of a distinct cleavage between the two sections to which I have referred.

I then met Mr Masterton for the first time, and I said to him, "" I must commend you, as the representative of the primary producers, for having signed the report submitted by the Tariff Boardi n connection with agricultural imFenton, is unanswerable."" I believe that he spoke the truth. the Tariff Board has submitted. the Government acceded to the request of members of the Country party to submit to the T a r i ff Board the question of the imposition of duties on agricultural implements. The board made an exhaustive investigation, and in its report it has made some very pithy comments. The report, which was signed by every member, favours the protection of the agricultural implement .industry in Australia. Minister( Mr Pratten) stated that this industry paid out in wages £1,500,000 annually. sons in Australia, are directly dependent upon the industry. in employment. thing we wear and eat has primary production as its source. If secondary industries are to provide a greater number of consumers for primary producers, not only should existing industries be supported, but others should be established. The board has shown that Australian implement-makers are being advantaged by the tariff to the extent of only 6£ per cent. 12^ per cent. a joke. From what I know of the Gippsland farmers, he does not represent them on the tariff issue, and it was not upon that issue that he was elected. In the opinion of the Tariff Board, the prices of agricultural implements in Australia, with protective duties added, are much lower than they would have been under free trade conditions and no local manufacture. I agree with that assumption. I put in my early years on a farm , at a time when the reaper and binder was not being manufactured locally. The farmers then had to pay a higher price for reapers and binders, and for binder twine, than they have had to pay since the industry has been protected. not advocating free trade. honourable member and his friends are It is the best report that seeking, and I do not think that they do. If I had to choose between a local manufacturing monopoly and a foreign monopoly, I would unhesitatingly choose the former. We ought to be able to exercise some control over the local manufacturer. If we have not sufficient power to do so at the present time, we should secure it . W ill honourable members in the corner opposite support an amendment of the Constitution, if that is necessary, to enable this Parliament to effectively control The monopolies? I hope that honourable members in the corner w ill use their influence to force the Government to subApproximately 25,000 permit to the people at an early date a referendum for the amendment of the Constitution.",21,Duties Implements Format Motion Eor Adjournment

The argument in favour of feeding these f a t industries has broken down completely. I have before me the balance-sheet for 1922-3 of a firm of agricultural implement makers which started with a capital of £10,000. In two years it made a clear profit of £40,000, and improved its financial position to the extent of £89,000. honourable member that; but I am prepared to show h i m the balance-sheet containing the details.

A division would, at any rate, show the sincerity or otherwise of honourable members in their attitude on this matter, which has been a sort of shuttlecock in politics for some years. Let us now place our cards on the table, so that the people may know where we stand.

The Standing Orders impose such limits to the discussion of a motion for the adjournment that we can barely touch the fringe of the subject brought forward by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson). The sole purpose of our tariff is to encourage dairymen's children who are sweated. the development of Australian industries. After listening to the debate this morning, I am fearful that there are some honourable members of this House who desire to see the tariff totally abolished, regardless of the consequences -consequence s that would bring a condition of unprecedented depression upon the manufacturing industries of Australia. The honourable member for Perth stated this morning that no country in the world had developed the important industry of agricultural implement manufacturing under a system of protection. I remind the honourable member that Canada commenced this work under a protective tariff of 35 per cent. As the industry developed, she was able to reduce her tariff. I contend that we must work along the same lines. I have no doubt that the time will come when the industry in Australia will be on such a sound footing that no tariff will be necesthe Government of the United States of sary to protect it. Some honourable members said this morning that about 83 per cent, of the implements in use are of Ausa direct contradiction of many of the tralian manufacture. I shall not be. content until 100 per cent, are manufactured here. There are strong reasons why we should maintain our protective tariff. It has been said that the tariff inflicts a tremendously heavy burden upon the primary producers of Australia. But I do not agree with that statement. I have some figures which are illuminating on the point. In the year 1922-3, Australia produced 109,455,000 bushels of wheat. In that same year the duty on agricultural implements collected from her producers totalled £150,777, or one-third of a penny a bushel on the wheat they produced. any duty on their wheat? Why should one industry be obliged to support another in that way? practice. The honourable member for a low tariff. Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) himself has propounded a scheme for the stabilization of butter, which obliges every consumer of butter in the community to pay tribute. Our people have not refused, in any general way, to doso, for they desire dairymen to work under the best possible conditions. wants cheap butter at the expense of kind. We want our dairymen to get a reasonable return for their produce, and for that reason we are prepared to help them. In the year 1922-3 the agricultural production of Australia was valued at £122,425,000. The duty on every £100 worth of produce amounts to 2s. 6d. Surely that is not an exorbitant tax on the consumers and producers of this country. The agricultural implement making industry is employing, directly and indirectly, under the very best conditions, some 30,000 people, including men engaged in the timber, iron, steel, and coal industries. men who buy their output. ment by Mr Juan Home, contained on page 47 of a report that he furnished to America, which was issued by the Department of Commerce in 1918. It contains statements of free trade advocates in this House and throughout the country. Referring to the importance of the Australian manufacturing interests in relation to our wheat-growing industry, he saidThe enormous increase in wheat-growing in Australia would hardly have been possible had not suitable machinery been evolved capable of satisfactorily handling the matured crop under the climatic and labour conditions prevailing in that country. The entire credit for tlie development and perfection of the stripper, and later on of the stripper harvester, is due to the Australians themselves, as both of these machines were invented and first perfected and built in that country. Wheni t is considered that these machines, as built at present, are but little different from the first ones built, and that under ordinary conditions they work in a most excellent manner, it must be admitted that Australian agricultural engineers are second to none when given an equal opportunity.",28,Duties Implements Format Motion Eor Adjournment

I am now able to in for m the honourable member that, following thc arrival of the fleet at Hobart on tlie 6th February, slight disturbances, due to intoxication, did occur that day and the following day. drunkenness were probably due to the excessive heat, and to the excellence of the beer, which, I am informed, is of unwonted strength. Since then, w i th the exception of a few isolated instances, the conduct of the men on shore has been very good. Leave was not curtailed in any way, and this indicates that the disturbances were not of a serious nature. For the information of the House, I desire to quote the following letter, addressed by the Mayor of Hobart to the Commodore Commanding H . M . A . Fleet Town Hall, Hobart, 17tli February, 1920. Dear Sir, My attention having been drawn to certain statements published in the Sydney Evening News, relative to thc behaviour of the men of your Fleet in this city, I at once communicated with the Police Department, and as a result have this afternoon forwarded the following urgent cable to the editor of the paper referred to:"" Cabled reports published in your paper regarding conduct of sailors of Australian Fleet in Hobart grossly exaggerated. little trouble first two days only. Police report behaviour of men generally very f ood. Statement that citizens desire leet to leave absolutely untrue and unfounded. On contrary, the city looks forward to and welcomes the visit of Fleet every year. Glad if you give this special prominence."" It is very regrettable that the misdoings of a small percentage of men should result in such aspersions being east upon the whole of the Fleet, and I shall be glad to do anything else in my power to counteract the bad impression which may have been created. Yours faithfully, (Signed) In committee (Consideration resumed from 25th February, vide page 1169). Clause3 (Validation of refunds). This is the vital clause of the bill, and reads as follows : Where the paid-up value of any shares distributed out of taxed profits has been included in any assessment under the Income Tax Assessment Act, as being included within thc meaning of paragraph (b) of section 14 of that act, and income tax has been paid on that value, any refund of the income tax so paid made by tbe Commissioner prior to the It is thought that the cases of commencement, of this act shall be deemed tu be and at all times to have been as lawfully made as if that value had been exempt from income tax under that act. The Government having taken the responsibility of making refunds of public moneys to private individuals under circumstances, to say the least of them, and from their own point of view, of grave doubt, and having had the validity and propriety of its conduct raised in a striking manner by a recent decision of the High Court, now seeks from Parliament the f u l l weight of its support to just if y it in the action it has taken. The Income Tax Assessment Act of 1915 made it very clear that bonus shares in the hands of shareholders were taxable when distributed, inter alia, from accumulated profits. According to that act, "" income "" includes "" dividends, interest, profits, or bonus credited or paid to any member, shareholder, or debenture-holder of a company "" which derives income from a source-in Australia. Further on, that general statement is modified in a way which is not important to the purpose of my argument to-day. Nothing could be clearer than the intention of the legislaSmall percentage caused ture as then and there expressed in regard to bonus shares distributed out of accumulated profits. I understand that the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr. W a t t ) has stated that he does not believe that Parliament ever intended to tax such bonus shares in that way, but to my mind it was impossible for the language of the section to have been clearer, and, without hesitation and for a considerable length of time, the Commissioner of Taxation seems to bave acted upon the clear expression of the intention of the legislature to tax these shares.

If the then Treasurer meant that there was a large number of complaining payers, I should be quite prepared to believe him, for the taxpayer, as such, is not a happy man, but if there had been any litigation throwing light on tbe meaning of the words of the section, or justifying either by the dicta of judges or by judicial decision, the statement of the section were not clear, the right honourable gentleman good enough to submit them to the House. My view is that there was no judicial decision touching tbe point until the Webb case, which has already elaborately dealt with in this At any rate, the law on the subject remained unaltered, seems to have been an itch on the part of the Government payers of an onerous responsibility. all due deference to the generous spirit in which my friend the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) dealt with this matter, looking at it coldly and entirely on its merits, I say that there seems to be more than a suspicion that from the beginning the Government was influenced by motives possibly arising from its environment and from its support in the House. There has unquestionably ence affecting the miuds of the members of the Ministry in the direction of removing this taxation from members of companies. opportunity found them in the Webb case, and operating, as they did, upon that basis, they succeeded iii persuading Parliament these refunds of taxation effected in the natural order of legal development, and in the light of the improved legal knowledge we were assumed to have.

121,Looking For An Excuse And An Mr Brennan,"I can find no eviasked to r a t if y, and for which this bill asks us to issue an indemnity. The simple fact is that the ""Webb case, which afforded an excuse and an opening for the Government to remit this taxation, did not deal with bonus shares paid or credited out of accumulated profits. It simply did not touch the point, except to emphasize the distinction between distribution and reconstruction by pointing out that the Webb case was not one of payment of bonus shares by way of distribution, but simply a case of re-construction. This makes it , in my view, abundantly clear that the H i g h Court did not even suggest, by its decision, that shares paid in the clear terms of the statute should escape taxation, but said that what was dealt w i th in the Webb case was something different and distinct from the condition laid down in the statute as involving taxation. The Commissioner of Taxation, it has to be noted, adopted the same view, because, in his report of 28th September, 1924, he states'.I'll is decision did not deal with bonus shares distributed out of past profits upon which the company had paid income tax. That appears to me to be a very clear but of reconstruction, and that the shares and common-sense statement on the dealt with in the Webb case had not been part of the Commissioner of what the paid out or credited in a way to render H i g h Court had decided. When one them liable to the payment of income turns to the speech of the Treasurer, in tax. introducing this bill, it is found that he note what followed upon the statement. I commenced by saying that it was neceshave quoted from the speech of the then sary that confidence should be maintained Treasurer, Mr Bruce. Sir Robert Best, in the good f a it h of the Government.

The balance of clearness seems in this view 'to"" have favoured the' taxi It would not be surprising if it was not clear so far as these shares are concerned, because the High Court gave no decision in respect to them. It is not the practice of courts to spread themselves upon income tax or other cases which are not relevant to the particular point they are called upon to decide. It is the practice of the judiciary to decide only as much as is necessary for the decision of the actual point submitted to it . It was not for the court to enter into a discussion of whether bonus shares might in varying circumstances be taxable. Its concern for the moment was to say that in the particular case under review it was a matter not of distribution I invite honourable members to It was made clear in regard to the reconThat is all that the court was concerned to make itself clear upon, because the Yes.

123,Mr Brennan,"I intend to do so inthat there was very little doubt that the decision would be something entirely different from that which the Treasurer had said was not absolutely clear. He went on to sayIn view of the judgment in Webb's ease, the Government have come to the conclusion that although the point has not been absolutely settled by that case, it would be unable by taking further action in the eourts, to establish that bonus shares issued against accumulated profits are liable to taxation under the law as it existed prior to the present act. They bave accordingly decided to take no further steps in an endeavour to establish a claim for income tax in respect of such shares, and they are prepared, where any tax has been collected, on the ground that such shares were liable for tax, to make a refund. It will be seen from that that the policy of the Government "" Don't shoot; we will come The present Prime Minister, then Treasurer, said that the Government would be unable by taking further action in the courts to establish that shares issued against accumulated fits the is that there was no obligation iipon the Government in the courts. the law stood intact and under which those taxes were being collected, and the right to collect them had not been affected in any way by any decision of the court. There was no obligation, therefore, upon the Government to take any action whatever except to continue the collection of His Majesty's which it was bound to do. If in the collection of His Majesty's revenues any one of these sensitive gentlemen, who are so privileged as to pay income tax on the higher scale, found himself called upon to pay a tax which think recourse to the courts of the in his claim then be the duty of the to give effect to the decision of the court, and if it was adverse to it to make the refund, but not until then.. In my view, there is no doubt that the Government had no excuse whatever for saying that because of the decision in the Webb case, which did not touch many cases in which it would give up the revenue Commonwealth who, judging by the rate of tax they Mr Brennan. paid, were presumably well able t.c pay it That latter aspect, of course, is not vital to the principle, but it is rather in teresting on its political side; otherwise, we need not stress it . The statement, of the Prime Minister, when Treasurer of the Commonwealth, was a most audacious statement. It was due, as I have suggested, either to his political environment and the pressure brought to bear upon him, or to a light-hearted carelessness whioh should not manifest itself in a gentleman charged with the responsible duties of the Treasurer of the Commonwealtjh, having recourse ""to -the advice which the Government can always obtain. It was in this connection that the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) at that time was asked. "" What more could the Governdown."" ment have done than have taken indewho was pendent advice?"" I have suggested that it was not necessary for the Government to take advice-, in the circumstances. It bonus had only to continue its collection of the protax and leave it to others to take advice. were liable to tax under As to the advice of independent counsel, law. My answer to that I take this firm stand in regard to that: I absolutely, as a member of this House, to take any further action decline to take any cognizance whatever My further answer is that of any alleged opinion given to the Gounassailable vernment, and upon which the Government is acting, which is not submitted to the scrutiny of honourable members. The committee should back up honourable members on this side in such a stand. How do we know what is contained in the -opinion? It might be that if put under revenues, the searchlight of a public investigation here, it would be found that the opinion meant something quite different, from that which the Treasurer, no doubt, quite honestly, has interpreted it to mean. A t all events we know nothing of it , and he did not I decline to take further notice of it . The he should pay, he had ready Government sponsors this legislation upon country, its own responsibility, and it can gain order if possible to establish no additional support or strength from to exemption. It would the fact that there is alleged to be in the Government archives a legal opinion that justifies it in the course it is taking. The announcement in 1922 of the then Treasurer ( Mr. Bruce) was quoted by his colleague, the present Treasurer, as most explicit. I do not challenge it on the ground of indefiniteness; but mere explicitness does other not invest it w i th the wisdom of Solomon. taxation was paid, A burglar may make an explicit state of the ment that he proposes to make a raid on to private gentlemen, the Commonwealth Bank to-night at 7.30, but tbe mere explicitness does not invest his intention with morality or any other virtue. The Treasurer said also that he had given the interpretation of the law as then accepted by the Taxation Department. ""When was it so accepted by the Taxation Department? According to the quotation I hiive made, it was not so accepted as late as August, 1924, when the Commissioner clearly pointed out that the judgment in the Webb case did not deal with bonus shares distributed out of past profits. When was the PrimeM in ister converted to the view that it is within his power declaration in Parliament which w ill override the discretion of the Commissioner? In connection w i th the taxation of leaseholds, he took a very different stand in opposition to the honourable member for Yarra. Buti n this case apparently all that was necessary in order to clarify the law was for h i m to announce in Parliament the action he proposed to take, regardless of whether such action was buttressed by law, morality, or any other guiding principle. The opinion of independent counsel, which has not been submitted to the scrutiny of this committee, seems to have been diametrically opposed to that of one of the admitted leaders of the Australian bar, Mr Owen Dixon, K . C , who, when the same matter was under consideration anterior to the James case, expressed a different view, supporting that which was accepted by Parliament and operated by the Taxation Commissioner for a number of years. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. sion of the committee I shall take my second period now.

That was the unkindest cut of all. The lawfull y collected or assessed. I call honourable member for Y a r r a has already upon the Government to justify, if it can, pointed out the circumstances in which the handing back of public moneys which the Leader of the Opposition accepted the apparently candid statement of the Government, and withdrew his opposition to the bill, although he laid down the general principle that bonus shares should be taxed, and in support of that view quoted the minorit y report of the Taxation Commission. But he was disarmed by the Prime Minister's interjection that these shares had already been taxed in the hands of the company, and the further in terjection by the honourable member i o r Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) that otherwise exemption would not be asked for. Acceptto make a ing those assurances, tlie Leader of the Opposition, with characteristic fairness and magnanimity, conceded to the Leader of the Government an honest desire to state the position f a i r l y . But the Prime Minister's interjection had no relevance to the validity of the tax already imposed, and it obscured the fact that the company tax was triflin g in comparison with that payable by the individual shareholder. In any' case, the policy of this Parliament was that taxation should be levied upon the company, and ultimately upon the shareholder, 'when the profits reached him, and became part of his income. I am pleased to note that an able member of the commission, who is also a member of my own party, Mr Duffy, and also Mr Farleigh, in a minority report, saidWe therefore recommend that bonus shares issued out of current or accumulated profits should be taxed in the hands of the shareholders in the year of receipt, subject to the fact that an adjustment should be made by allowing the shareholders the amount of the tax already paid on the profits of the company. When the Prime Minister quoted the W it h the permismajority report of the Taxation Commission in support of his proposed action, he was not generous enough to say that two members of the commission dissented from the view therein stated, as a matter of policy. There is no escape from the conclusion that the 1922 bill was presented to the House with a lack of candour on the part of the Government, and a sorrowful lack of information as to the facts and the then existing law. That is warrant enough for strong criticism, but a much more serious feature is the remission without legal warrant of taxation",34,Income Tax Assessment Bonus Shares Bill

As a matter of policy, I am opposed to it , and I regard the conduct of the Government in handing back the money as utterly outrageous. The honourable member for Y a r r a ( Mr Scullin) said that this bill is not based on law or equity, und can be justified only on the ground of expediency. took the view that, as the Government has got itself into an unpleasant muddle, it must adopt some more or less arbitrary means of escape. Certainly the Government has logic on its side. Having passed the act of 1922 to secure certain -taxpayers against further exactions, it promised that it would immediately hand back the moneys already lawfull y paid. Andi t has clone so. Now, being alarmed by the decision in the James case, it naturally seeks parliamentary endorsement of what it has done. It is interesting to compare the decision in the James case with that in the Webb case. One would imagine that the Government was alarmed because the decision of the H i g h Court in the James case, in August, 1924, had in some way reversed the decision in the Webb case in 1922. But the two cases are not parallel. There is not the slightest inconsistency in the two judgments, ancl the validity of the law is not affected by them. In the Webb case, the Court heldThat no part of the shares of the new company allotted to a member of the old company was ""profits or bonus credited or p a i d "" by the old company to the member within the meaning of section 14 (o) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915-1918, and that the member was not liable to assessment for income tax under that act by reason of the allotment to him of such shares. In tbe James case, the Court heldThat the proportion of the bonus so credited monwealth is increasing by leaps and to each shareholder was "" profits or bonus credited"" to him within the meaning of section 14 (6) of the Income Tax Assessment ]915-lf)2'l, and therefore was properly included in his income. Mr Brennan. There is nothing whatever revolutionary in that decision. It is on all fours with the previous decision. It merely sets out that the facts in each case are different. It has not shaken the validity of the statute itself in the slightest degree, but it has laid down that in one case the shares were taxable, and in the other, on different facts, ancl for reasons which are mentioned, they were not. On the strength of the original decision, the Government gives away this undisclosed sum of public money-undisclose d because we do not know what the amount is. In view of the later decision, the Government, thinking that the searchlight of public criticism is directed to what it has done, submits this bill in order to He generously validate its action. Do honourable members opposite approve of this? If they intend to support the Government, they should at least justify their positions in the face of the criticism honestly addressed from this side of the chamber. I contend that a strong case has been made out by honourable members on this side, and if honourable members opposite intend to support the Government they should give us their reasons for doing so. This is not an ordinary matter of policy. It cannot be said .to be even a grave matter of policy such as we discussed the other day. This is a matter vitally affecting the integrity and reputation of the whole Parliament, and especially the reputation of the Government, which has taken the responsibility of introducing the bill. It is not for me to say how the Government is to get out of the muddle in which it finds itself, or even that it should once again collect these moneys from the taxpayers. Such a course would presumably be impracticable, as well as ridiculous. The procedure involves, not only the Government, but members of its party, who it may be said are approving of what the Government has done in this regard. Ths suggestion I make, in all good faith , is that the Government should reinstate that statute which was surreptitiously removed from the statute-book. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Sbullin) pointed out bow the number of companies in this State and throughout the Combounds, aud will continue to do so when, by such easy methods as have been shown., Act their members can evade taxation. In tlie Webb case it was shown how a taxpayer escaped because the company, a very wealthy one, of which he was a member, was reconstructed. ""We cannot applaud the fact that this taxpayer did escape the payment of taxation. Reconstruction in that case was an evasion, but the Government, by its action, has applauded the evasion by way of reconstruction, and is bringing others down to the same level. In other words, it has said that since you have evaded the payment of your taxation by the easy method of reconstruction, Parliament will pass an act to make even reconstruction unnecessary in the case of other companies. There was only one way in which these refunds could conceivably and with propriety have been dealt with, and that was by an act of Parliament. Before refunding a single penny, the Government should have obtained, or endeavoured to obtain, the sanction of this Parliament in what it was doing. I venture to express the doubt whether the sanction of this Parliament could have been obtained. I used an expression yesterday, Mr Bayley, which you regarded as disorderly, when I referred to the docile followers of the Government. I do not believe that if this House had had an opportunity to discuss the question of refunds the Government would have received parliamentary sanction to what it then proposed from even its most loyal supporters. nitely stated that he was going to make refunds. right ? ber said that if the House had had an opportunity to express its opinion at the time it would have objected. Uhat this House considered the matter, the Treasurer submits that, instead of introducing a bill which would be read a first, second, and third time, and f u l l y debated at its various stages, the fact that the then Treasurer said, in the most offband way in the course of a speech, that the Government intended to make these refunds, should be sufficient.

We heard something from the honourable member for Boothby (Mr. Duncan Hughes) concerning retrospective legislation. Such legislation is often objectionable from many points of view, but if it is necessary to right a wrong such a course must be followed. It is quite immaterial to me whether retrospective legislation means refunding money to taxpayers or recovering money by the Government, but it may be necessary to employ such a means in certain circumstances to right a wrong, and do elemental justice. In such circumstances I have no unbending objection to retrospective legislation. But that is not the case in this in stance. It rests upon the Government to justify its action with much stronger arguments than have yet been adduced. Where is the Attorney-General( Mr Latham"") ? I should like to hear him. Perhaps be could tell us something about the mysterious opinion of which we have heard. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), of course, is engaged in another part of the Lord's vineyard whilst his integrity as the Leader of this House is being seriously challenged. I should like to hear the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), who is usually a purist, on this meaA s proof of the fact sure. U p to the present that honourable member has remained doleful and silent. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann), who usually has an independent mind, should give us the benefit of his opinion. Oould not the discussion of this measure be delayed for !i further week or two, instead of hurrying it , as is being done this afternoon ? The Treasurer ( D r .

I ask the Government to withdraw the b ill and discuss the whole matter in Cabinet w i th the Attorney-General, who w ill probably produce a framed copy of the mysterious legal opinion. During the debate last night reference was made to the difficulty of properly understanding our taxation laws. It is certainly true that the Federal law is more difficult to follow than the State laws, and the difficulty is accentuated by the fact that, in many respects, the State laws follow different lines of taxation from those adopted by the Commonwealth. For instance, under the Federal law we follow income into the hands of the taxpayer, whereas, under the State laws, it is taxed at the source. The result of this variation, together with the fact that, in consequence of the numerous amendments made from time to time, not one, but many acts have to be studied, is that persons outside, and even laymen claiming to be, in a sense, experts in taxation law. are prone to make mistakes. It would be preferable to have but the one taxation law, which would mean that either the Federal authority should relinquish the field of direct taxation and hand it over to the States, or ihat the States should hand over the collection of income taxation to the Federal authorities. In the determination of in tricate questions of taxation even lawyers differ, and when they cannot readily settle them, how can laymen be expected to do so ? tion procedure, since I have frequently to deal with it in the pursuit of my profession, but I have often to obtain 'the advice of a lawyer on certain aspects of it. However expert some lawyers may be in elucidating the meaning of a particular provision of the act I do not think rhey would be able to prepare an income tax return from the documents and books supplied to them. The interpretation of :he law is one thing ; the question of pracrelates to something that was done in tice is another. I wish to compliment the l in) on the absolute fairness of the speech it was taken, and we are now asked to he made on the motion for the second reading of the bill last night. The honourable member did not make a single in sinuation concerning the good f a it h of the Government. When honourable members of the Opposition keep clear of the wretched innuendoes in which some of them so often indulge, they are always listened to very attentively by the members of the Government and by honourable members generally on this side of the chamber. The honourable member for Yarra very properly and fairly pointed out that the present Government was not to blame for the position with which this bill deals-that it arose while the last Government was in office; but the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) clearly inferred that this Government was responsible for what he described as "" the mess we have got into."" same man. He was Treasurer in the last Administration, and is the Prime Minister in the present. entirely different Government. In dealing with the issue raised by this clause 1 am not going to follow the honourable member for Y a r r a and the honourable member for Batman, because I think most of their arguments were based on the question of whether bonus shares should, or should not, be taxed. That is not the question at issue. w ill admit that it was only towards the close of my speech that I referred to that matter. In both my speeches I dealt with the action of the Government in making these refunds, and showed that it was neither legal nor equitable. of the manner in which the honourable member stated his case, but, at the same time, a good deal of his speech was de: voted to the question of whether or not bonus shares should be taxed. the consideration of the equity of the action taken by the Government? with this particular bill. The measure 3922. Whether the action then taken was right or wrong the fact remains that validate it . This trouble goes back to 1922, when the Webb case was decided.

142,Mr Hunter,"No t in connexionfectly clear by tbe judgment in the James case that bonus shares should be taxed, but it was not so clear in the Webb case. That, however, was not the question raised in the Webb case. There is no escaping the conclusion that the reconstruction of the company involved in that case was a legal way of evading taxation. It was a distribution to shareholders of shareholders' interest, but it appeared not as a distribution, but as a sale. I regard it as a sale of assets to the persons who owned them. It is feasible that the Income Tax Commissioner ( Mr Ewing). acted upon the judgment in the Webb case. His position is simply that of an official who has to administer the law, and if he does not do that he is guilty of a dereliction of duty. We must assume that he took every possible means of ascertaining what the law meant; otherwise his only alternative would have been to continue taxing bonus shares. He did not do that, and if he were not clear in his mind that they were not taxable, he did not do his duty. His duty is to tax everything that should be taxed, and he must have been quite satisfied in his own mind that the Webb judgment justified him in not taxing these shares at that time. I should like to direct attention to certain words in the majority judgment in that case"" There was no detachment of profits from the assets of the company,"" and "" The transaction permits the shareholders to retain their interest in the assets of the company."" I do not set myself up in opposition to any lawyer, particularly H i g h Court judges, on these intricate matters,' but the words "" retain their in terest in the assets of the company "" seem to imply that if a person retains by any form of distribution his interest in the assets of the company he still has a capital interest, and not a profit interest. must read that in conjunction with the rest of the judgment. taking these words because I wish to spjak particularly of them. We know that Mr Ewing could never be accused of dereliction of duty. I have had a lot to do with -him, and I know that no man in this country is more cursed. payers say that he always takes the side of the Government, rather than the side of the taxpayer. taxpayer is wrong, but he nevertheless holds it . It is, therefore, not fair or reasonable to assume that Mr Ewing was not satisfied in his own mind that after the Webb judgment these shares were not taxable. knows that after the 1922 amendment the Commissioner could not collect this taxation, and that he was net responsible for making the refunds. was not his, was laid down by the Government, and he had to obey tlie law. He had no alternative but to refund the taxation. I should like to follow the honourable member for Yarra( Mr. Scullin) i u one of his arguments. I u my opinion, when a taxpayer receives bonus shares instead of a cash dividend he still retains his interest. Before those shares were issued he held two classes of capital interest in the company. One class was represented by his share scrip, which every one recognizes is capital, but he held also a capital interest i i i the amount of the accumulated profits. The accumulated profits held by him were in the same ratio to the whole of the accumulated profits as the number of his shares to the total number of shares in the company. That was really a capital interest, and taxation on it had already been paid. The bonus shares need not have been issued. If the company had continued from generation to generation the interest might still have been held in reserve capital. The holders would not have had to pay taxation; but if , for the sake of expediency, the reserve capital was distributed in the for m of bonus shares, which were placed in the names of individual shareholders instead of the shareholders as a whole, there would be no material difference. The reserve capital or shares would still be the interest or property of thc shareholder. The honnan) and bhe honourable member for Yarra, are correct in stating that T h a t is so, but I am the Webb judgment did not explicitly say that bonus shares were taxable: but the Prime Minister of the day could do nothing, f a i r l y and honestly, but square the past and lay down a policy for the future. Refunds have been made. In Taxthe Estimates the taxation refunds are not separated from other refunds. In 1921-2 the amount of refunds, including That opinion of the refunds of taxation, was £731,000 odd;",39,Income Tax Assessment Bonus Shares Bill

What happened previously was done bona fide by the Taxation Commissioner aud the government of the day. If the bill is not passed the Commissioner w ill have no alternative but to obey the existing law, whicli says that bonus shares are taxable; every penny that has been refunded w ill have to be re-collected, and companies that have not been taxed w ill have to be taxed. Many of those companies are no longer in existence, and enormous difficulties would be encountered in dealing with trusteeships. I have in mind a case of a widow shareholder who had certain shares bequeathed to her. When the personal representative received the shares he had to pay probate duty, not on their face value, but on their true value, taking into consideration the value of reserves, assets, and other things that aft'ect the value of shares. According to the w ill the widow could only draw the income, which amounted to £400 or £500 a year. I am quoting, not actual, but supposititious figures. Later, the company may decide upon a division of reserves in the form of bonus shares. The amount of such distribution may be very large, and may, in this case, amount to more than the value of tbe shares held. If that amount is to be included in her return as taxable income, it is quite possible that the income for ten years will be absorbed in taxation. the act providing for cases of hardship. questions. I hold that the action of the Income Tax Commissioner was not wrong. spite of the decision of the H i gh Court; but I do not think that the In come Tax Commissioner shares them. The Treasurer of the late Government explicitly stated in this House that there would be no furthe r taxation on the same lines, and that the amounts collected would be refunded. If persons have allowed themselves to be influenced b}' that statement, and they find that a subsequent government can upset the decision, there will be no faith in any government and no stability in any business. We cannot do other than uphold the action that was taken four years ago. What is to be done in the future is another matter. The honourable member for Yarra has stated what he considers should be done. The James case has furnished us with a new aspect, and it will be for the Government to decide what its future policy shall be. We have now to decide whether we shall honour statements that were deliberately made in this House, on behalf of the Government, or ignore them, and act in a contrary way. The question that was raised by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) the other night is one of the most important with which the Commonwealth Parliament has had to deal for some considerable time. Honourable members, and the taxpayers generally, owe him their thanks. The lucidity of his statement, and its exhaustivoness, have no doubt opened the eyes of many taxpayers. Those who move about among the people, as we do, are frequently asked by taxpayers what condition Parliament was in when it agreed to exempt a number of wealthy taxpayers from taxation. The case of a woman taxpayer, mentioned by the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter) reminded me forcibly of four cases that were raised some years ago by the late Hon. A l f r e d Deakin. When he was in terrogated upon them, the fact was elicited that those whose case he was stating did not come within the operations of the taxation law ! The woman mentioned by the honourable member for Maranoa must have been in receipt of £4,000 per annum. But that raises other vear. Certain shares were left in trust to her, and she was entitled to receive only the income from them. If bonus shares I have my own opinions, in are to be treated as income, she will be taxed heavily. Parliament which passed the original act. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) was Attorney General in the government of the day. Whenever he had a taxation measure drafted, he was very particular to see that practically everybody was ""roped in , "" and that no loophole for escape was left. I know that it was the intention of that government ancl Parliament to tax these people. The Webb case dealt with only one feature.

I do not know whether the Government has decided that bonus shares are not to be taxed. If the Treasurer cannot now give the desired assurance, the further consideration of the bill should be deferred until next week, in order to ascertain the views of the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce).

The poorer classes have to struggle hard to obtain the money with which to pay their tax, and they will have good cause for complaint if the wealthy persons in the community are exempted from taxation. I desire to refer to the secretive method adopted in ths Estimates in regard to these refunds. A t page 77 of the Estimates for the year ended 30th June, 1923, I find that there were remissions amounting to £1,050,00 0 on certain items. The footnote readsTo be applied by the Treasurer in making refunds of duty collected on or after 18th August, 1922, under tbe following items of the Customs tariff, 1921, viz. : No. 145-S o far as it relates to galvanized iron; No. 158-Wir e netting; No. 159B-Wir e for use in the manufacture of wire netting; No. 177-S o far as it relates to tractors.

An opinion which causes the Government to change its policy should be worth bringing before Parliament.

I point out that this bill does not deal with that aspect of tlic question, whicli should be determined when the Income Tax Assessment B ill is before ns. There w ill then be ample opportunity for honourable members to express their opinions. B y no amendment of this legislation could we do anything which would interfere witli the present policy of dealing with bonus shares. I suggest that honourable members, having made their position clear, should allow this bill to pass, especially as Ave all admit the impracticability of doing more than the Government now proposes. If. having been suggested that one reason for the Government's action is that this legislation applies only to wealthy men, I point out that the Government has. on two occasions during tbe last two years introduced legislation to prevent the return of money to taxpayers after it bad been determined that tbe law, as interpreted by the High Court, ran counter to the intention of Parliament. Honourable members will remember the Income Tax Assessment (Land Tax) B ill aud rhe manner in which it was disposed of in another place. session a bill to appoint a board of appeal was introduced, because it was felt that, although it was retrospective legislation, justice and equity demanded it. about the equity in the other case. the same here.

It is. now almost impossible to trace that money, which has been used in all good faith . The only thing to do is what the Government now proposes. tion? a different matter, which cannot be dealt with in this bill, but should be discussed in connection with an income tax assessment bill. I possibly have different views from some honourable members on both sides i u regard to the taxation of bonus shares. When the Government submits its policy on that inatter to Parliament, honourable members will be able to say what they wish to have done, and, if their numbers are sufficient, to see that it is done. The clause now before us merely validates the action taken from August, 1922, to February, 1923. The other clause relates to taxes that were assessed but not collected. A long debate on the general question of the taxation of these bonus shares would be of no avail at this juncture. Progress reported. THE SHIPBUILDIN GUNION S. Motion (by Dr. EARLE PAGEproposedThat the House do now adjourn. the absence of the Minister for Defence( Sir Neville Howse), I ask the Leader of the House (Dr. Earle Page) if he will Last state what the position is in regard to the construction of the seaplane carrier at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. Honourable members have heard nothing about the matter for a considerable time. I direct attention to the position that has arisen since the Attorney-General( Mr. Latham), in introducing the CrimesB ill , made a strong indictment of Mr Jock Garden, secretary of the Sydney Trades aud Labour Council. It would appear that the principal shipbuilding unions a confessed communist is still the secretary. One of the main planks in the platform of the communist party is that there shall be no increase in the British navy. The construction of a seaplane carrier, which would join the Australian fleet, would constitute an addition to the British navy, and Mr Garden's association as secretary with the council with",43,Income Tax Assessment Bonus Shares Bill

The men now employed there are working under happy conditions, but many of them have in formed me that, owing to the fact that Mr Garden is secretary to the Sydney Trades and Labour Council, the shadow of communism is a disturbing factor. In fairness to the men concerned, the position should be closely investigated. able member suggest should be done ? be appealed to on the ground that their unions should not be affiliated with the council while Mr Garden remains secretary. I am to a certain extent glad that the construction of the vessel has not been commenced; but I am not aware that any emphatic protest has been made in this House against the starting of that work until this matter has been cleared up. honourable member anticipate ? objects to any addition to the British navy. delegates to the Sydney Trades and Labour Council, and Mr Garden admits that his influence as secretary is great. He boasts that eleven out of the twelve members of the executive of that body are communists. Should we proceed with the construction of a vessel that will be a unit of the British fleet while a man such as Mr Garden holds his present position ? fairness to the men employed at Cockatoo Island, many of whom are my friends. able member suggest ? in my own way, and do not wish the honourable member for Yarra to frame it for me. hand, and I want Mr Garden removed from his present position before it is commenced. no desire to interrupt the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) in the course of his speech, but I was curious to know what trouble he was anticipating. I gather that he asks the Attornev-General to take some drastic action before a beginning is made with the construction of the seaplane carrier, because, as the honourable member says, the policy of the communist party is well known. He contends that, because the shipbuilding unions are affiliated with the Sydney Trades and Labour Council, and the secretary of that council is a communist, something drastic should be done before the work is started. The honourable member ought to be explicit, and say plainly what he means. Does he suggest that, because the unions are affiliated with the council, and the secretary of that body holds political opinions that are regarded as strange, or even dangerous, members of those particular unions are likely to do dangerous things ? there are from two to twenty communists i u every union in New South Wales. orable member mean? may surmise what he likes. ber ought to be frank. munist should be permitted to work on a ship to be constructed for His Majesty's Navy. ber should have made that statement at the outset. The inference to be drawn I am raising this matter in from his remarks was that, so long as the shipbuilding unions were affiliated witb the Trades and Labour Council, it would be dangerous to allow their members on the vessel, but that once tbe unions ceased I am making my speech to be affiliated with the council, everything would be right. There is no escape from the fact that some members of The work has not been put in those unions hold certain political views. Some of them may be communists, although I believe that the great majority of them are labourites. they should not ho allowed on one of H is Majesty's ships, since it is against their principles to permit any addition to the British Navy. communist views, just as others share the",44,Adjournment Construction Of Seaplane Carrier Communism Mr Jock Garden And
