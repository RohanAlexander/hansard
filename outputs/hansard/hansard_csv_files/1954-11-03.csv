18,,"I rise to order. I s the Mr Holt As to the terms of theStevedoring Industry Board. The right honourable gentleman is fully aware that at the time the Labour Government, of which he was a member, made the extraordinary concession of giving a monopoly of waterfront engagement to the board, it was made a condition of that arrangement that the quotas prescribed by the board should be promptly filled by the Waterside Workers Federation. That has not been done; it remains undone; and the proposed amendment seeks to cure that deficiency; I merely say in conclusion that the terms of reference which will cover the freight aspect to which the right honourable gentleman has referred had been determined long before any strike action was threatened, or had taken effect, on the part of the Waterside Workers Federation. mentary question. The Minister has referred to delays and obstructions which have occurred in filling quotas. Does he not think thai: honourable gentleman may not ask the Minister for an expression of opinion. reconsider the statement which he made a few moments ago, and postpone dealing with those substantive matters until he has a judicial or impartial investigation of the matter which he proposes in another connection? other than the inquiry, which the bill as at present drafted seeks to cover, and that is the aspect of recruitment in order to bring the quotas at the various ports up to the strength prescribed by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board. It has been within the power of the Waterside Workers Federation at all relevant times to ensure that the quotas were maintained at the prescribed strength, and in accordance with the arrangement which it had made with the then Labour Government. If the union, by reason of its refusal to fill, or its delay in filling, vince, will he use his good offices to assist those quotas after repeated protests and requests on the part of the Government, has now to face a change in that method of recruitment, the responsibility lies at the door of the officials of the federation and nobody else. Labour and National Service consider that the action of the Waterside Workers Federation, in suspending work on the waterfront and threatening to bring about an Australia-wide strike, is intended to intimidate members of this Parliament in the performance of their duty? an expression of opinion. able member for Bennelong may not ask the Minister for an expression of opinion. proceeded with, will the Minister consider the introduction of amendments to the Stevedoring Industry Act beyond those at present proposed, in order to deal effectively with a situation that may arise? M.r. HOLT I point out that the action of the Government depends entirely upon the support which it receives from this democra tically-clecterl Parliament. If it is made evident, to the Government that action will be taken in defiance of decisions of this democratically-elected Parliament, then the Government will certainly consider what additional powers it should take to meet the challenge to democratic government in this country. for Social Services announced that it was intended to build 400 war service homes on the Lewis Gordon estate at Picnic Point, in the Bankstown district. Can he advise me whether any provision has been made on this 900-acre estate for recreation grounds and parks? Perhaps he will recall inspecting this area when he was Minister for Air, and that on that occasion the Picnic Point Regatta Association sought his aid in its endeavour to have set aside a portion of this natural beauty spot for playgrounds. If thia matter comes within the Minister's prothat association to acquire the surveyed section of the estate for the purposes which it has in mind? attracted my attention when I had a look at the Lewis Gordon estate was whether",12,Stevedoring Industry

I was assured that the War Service Homes Division had been trying to persuade the local government authority to take over a little more land, but that the latter body was reluctant to do so. I have asked the Director-General of Social Services to pursue this matter in order to see whether additional land can be made available. As far as my memory goes, the piece of land shown to me by the Beauty Point Progress Association was not the same block as that to which the honourable member has referred. I shall have a look at the matter and advise the honourable member whether steps can be taken in the direction that he has indicated. Mr J. R. FRASER -Can the Minister for the Interior now make, or will he be able to make before the present sessional period ends, a statement giving the decision on proposals that the maximum amount of loan by the Department of the Interior for the building or the purchase of homes in Canberra will be increased from £2,000 to £2,750? promise the honourable member that I shall give him an answer before th? House goes into recess. It depends when the recess will begin. the Navy aware that experiments are being conducted in the United Kingdom with the construction of a small motor vessel made of glass fibre and resinous material? If these experiments are successful, is it considered that this type of construction could be adopted for naval use for small warship hulls which would require little attention and .could be built quickly with semi-skilled labour? Is the Royal Australian Navy keeping in touch with this development ? respect to all experiments that are conducted by the British Government in respect of both naval and military equipment is made available to us from time to time. The Royal Australian Navy has standardized itself on Royal Navy standards, and I am confident that we shall be kept fully informed of the progress that is made in the experiments to which the honourable gentleman has referred. acting for the Postmaster-General received a request from the Graziers Association of New South Wales that telephone calls from small rural automatic exchanges to the nearest town, or township, should be regarded not as trunk calls but as local calls?

Minister for Defence, who is acting for the Postmaster-General, when the Postmaster-General's Department will be able to attend to public telephone installations, a considerable number of which were approved by the department more than three years ago, in the Bondi, Bondi Junction and Waverley districts, in Sydney. Have the installations been deferred until the modifications necessary for 4d. calls are made? If so, when will the modifications be completed, and when will this long overdue service be provided? Sir PHILIP MoBRIDE -It is true that delays have occurred in the installation of both public and private telephones, but the Postmaster-General's Department is proceeding with installations as quickly as the available manpower and materials will allow.

Whilst the Census Branch is under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's Department, the Electoral Branch is under my jurisdiction as Minister for the Interior. Until the Chief Electoral Officer receives the final census figures, I shall not be in a position to supply the information for which the honourable member has asked. to the Minister for Health by reminding him of the fact that, on the 12th October, I asked whether he would consider granting to a pensioner patient in a private hospital the same benefit of 12s. a day as applies, by agreement with the State governments, to pensioner patients entering a public hospital. In reply to that question, the Minister asked me whether I could indicate how the matter could be dealt with, and I wrote to him suggesting that arrangements should be made with the appropriate State authority, which could certify that accommodation was not available for the pensioner at a public hospital. The Minister did not accept that suggestion but pointed out to me the question? The honourable gentleman is merely recounting the correspondence between himself and the Minister. out to me that a pensioner in a private hospital could receive an additional 4s. a day, which would bring his benefit up to 12s. a day, if he paid an insurance premium of 3d. a week, but I pointed out the question? The honourable member is giving information not asking for it, which he is required to do in a question. give consideration to this matter so that a. pensioner patient in a private hospital shall not be prejudiced by comparison with a pensioner patient in a public hospital ? lienor able member for Swan when he asked his question a few weeks ago, the Government has given this matter a great deal of thought, and since that date it has actively pursued the question with the object of removing the anomaly. The position of pensioners in public institutions is 'denned by two statutory provisions. One of these is the social services legislation, and the other is the hospital benefits legislation which incorporates the agreement with the States. There is some doubt in the legal mind in relation to the exact position of pensioners in private and intermediate wards of public hospitals, which we hope to clear np. The position of pensioners who are admitted to private hospitals has become less complicated as a result of the liberalization of the means test, under which 170,000 pensioners have acquired an increase of between 10s. and £2 a week. As a result of this circumstance, which arises from the Government's action, many of these pensioners are already insured for medical benefits and apparently many others will insure themselves, which will reduce the number of people who may be at a disadvantage under the present procedure. Unfortunately, as the honourable member may have noticed, there has been considerable abuse of the pensioner medical scheme. In fact, certain casea are before the courts at present despite the fact that disciplinary committees of the British Medical Association have been very active in trying to reduce this abuse. Changes in the procedure will undoubtedly be necessary. I can assure the honourable member that the question raised by him will receive full consideration when those changes are made. Health aware that a report on the Australian health scheme was recently presented at the World Medical Association meeting held in Rome, and received highly favorable comment from world medical authorities? Will he consider keeping the various countries that are interested advised on the progress of the scheme, and its continued practical success in this country? communication with other countries that are asking for information about our health scheme, which they hope will be a",14,Electoral

Will the right honourable gentleman consider a request made by the Parkes Municipal Council that a special committee be appointed to consider and recommend the most practicable methods of decentralizing industry and population?

70,Mr Menzies,"The Olympic GamesCommonwealth has accepted a very big financial obligation in relation to the games. The equestrian events could not be held in Australia because of quarantine regulations, in relation to which a ruling that was given hy my colleague, the Minister for Health, was entirely supported by the Government and, I think, generally by the country. It was then suggested to me that, as that particular branch of the Games could not be held in Australia because of our own. internal rules, it would be a gracious gesture, as Australia had been accorded the games, to assist in the sending of an equestrian team overseas. For that reason I recommended to my colleague the Treasurer, and he agreed with me, that we should make available an amount of money, which is relatively small compared with the £650,000 for which we have accepted liability on account of the Olympic Games generally, so that an equestrian team could represent this country, which is the kind of country that should have an equestrian team. I thoroughly agree that it will be expensive, per head, to send that House, and to be appointed to certain team, and I queried the matter when it was first put to me. But, as the honourable member will appreciate, we cannot send horses and riders away from Australia and plunge them suddenly into another climate and hope they will do well and bring some credit to Australia. A lengthy period of acclimatization, experience and special training is required. That, of course, means that the sum per head will be fairly substantial. I am sure that the honourable member will agree that it would have been a rather curious action on our part, the Games having been allotted to an Australian city and the equestrian events having been excluded from Australia as a matter of Government policy, if we had declined to facilitate the entering of a team for those events on the other side of the world.

74,Mr Beale (Parramatta,"Ministerseriously unsatisfactory, I took action to place on the commission men who would administer its affairs properly, correct defects and discover what had been wrong. J. shall relate the history of events. Early in 1952 I became dissatisfied with the lack of detailed information made available to me concerning the commission's financial position, and its methods of financial control generally. I expressed my dissatisfaction to the chairman and the then Treasury representative, and was assured that the commission's financial affairs were under proper control, and that there would be no trouble in obtaining the Auditor-General's certificate in due course. By June, 1952, I was still uneasy about the matter, and appointed the Secretary of the Department of Supply, Mr Stevens, to be a deputy member of the commission, with instructions to attend commission meetings to try to ascertain the way in which the commission's financial affairs were being controlled, and to report directly back to me. About November, Mr The Commonwealth Investigation SerStevens, after attending several meetings of the commission verbally reported that in his view the financial and storekeeping control by the commission were unsatisfactory, and that a confused position existed at Bell Bay on the stores and accounting side as a result of a great increase of activity there over the last two years. I also learned, for the first time, of the then chairman's personal interest in the Wessel Island contract. The tabbing of the Auditor-General's report in the Parliament in November, 1952, also disclosed that the commission had not produced its balance-sheet for 1951-52a matter upon which I had received reassurances some months before. I thereupon voiced my strong dissatisfaction to the chairman, and indicated that I proposed to make changes in the personnel of the commission. This was done early in the new year, 1953, when the amending bill came before the House, and the chairman and two other members were replaced. Two members who had represented Tasmania remained. Instructions were given to the new commission to investigate the affairs of the project thoroughly, and to put them on a sound footing. To the best of my Mr Beale. knowledge, all the matters raised in the Auditor-General's report occurred during the years 1951 and 1952 under the management of the old commission. The new commission has done remarkably good work in reorganizing administration, especially as regards costing, financial and stores control. The commission has also made extremely rapid progress in the construction work of the project, which will come into production in January of next year. In the course of the examination last year of the affairs of the old commission, especially for tbe years 1951 and 1952, incidents and items involving bad administration and control were revealed for the first time, and were reported to me. Some of these were of a character which indicated the desirability of having a full investigation of the commission's affairs made by the Commonwealtii Investigation Service to see whether laxity and administration had given rise to wrong doing, and this the commission was instructed to do. vice was engaged for many months on this work and made a detailed report on several matters, including those mentioned by the Auditor-General. Some of these matters came to the knowledge of the present commission and myself for the first time when the report was presented to us. The report has been examined by the Crown Law authorities to ascertain whether the matters referred to involve any criminal wrongdoing. I am advised that no case of criminal wrongdoing has been, established. One matter ' is still being examined. With reference to the commission's failure to obtain certification of its accounts, I am informed by the present commission that the Auditor-General is quite satisfied with the present accounting and stores system, but that the ""unsatisfactory accounting records "" for the years of 1951 and 1952 make it difficult for the . Auditor-General to obtain a starting point from which to give future certificates. The chief difficulty which the new commission has had to solve is not one necessitating the obtaining of an independent valuation of assets by outside experts, as has been suggested, but of properly costing the commission's expenditure for the years 1951 and 1952 in order that this expenditure may be correctly allocated to particular asset heads. The commission is confident that this difficulty w ill be resolved, and is now in the process of doing so. Without excusing the mistakes which were made under the old commission, I consider that it is satisfactory to know that these were corrected as soon as they were discovered, and that nothing of the sort now exists. In addition to the detailed investigations which have been made by the commission, the Commonwealth Investigation Service and now the Auditor-General, the question of the commission's will also be examined shortly by the Public Accounts Committee, and as the result of that examination, an impartial report w i ll be tabled in this House.

I think that the Minister himfinancial administration, self w ill agree with that statement. The most important consideration is not the mistakes which were made in 1951 and 1952 under the administration of the present Government, but the future policy of the Australian Aluminium Production Commission so as to ensure that the events of a few years ago w ill not be used as an occasion to leave this great industry or u t i l it y virtually derelict.

Bill presented, and read a first time. Vice-President of the Executive Council arid Minister for Defence Production) [3.19] -by leave I move That the bill ibe now read a second time. This bill provides for the validation of collections of customs duties under Customs Tariff Proposals No. 1 and Customs Tariff (Canadian Preference) Proposals No. 1, which were introduced into Parliament on the 18th August, and Customs Tariff Proposals No. 2, which were introduced on the 28th October last. The time of validation specified in the bill is until the 30th June, 1955. Pressure of other business in the period since the proposals were introduced and the anticipated ending of the present sitting has prevented, for the time, the bringing down of the customary bills for the enactment of the proposals. Consequently, it is desirable to validate duty collections pending the introduction of the enabling bills. This is purely a machinery measure, and the opportunity for a full debate on the proposed tariff amendments will be presented as early as practicable. I like the delightful final sentence of a statement based on fact. Before this the remarks of the Vice-President of the particular measure is passed, tbe ViceExecutive Council( Sir Eric Harrison) President of tbe Executive Council might in which he said that an opportunity give a definite assurance that in tbe first will be afforded to honourable members week of the next sessional period tbe for a full debate on these matters as early House shall be given an opportunity to as practicable.

We cannot close up the Parliament in a way that, perhaps, might bave been possible under State laws in otber days wben State parliaments collected duties of customs and excise. We must do what the Government wants. We bave no alternative but to agree. However, tbe Vice-President of the Executive Council bas treated tbe Parliament with scant courtesy. First, be said that an opportunity to discuss these proposals will be given to tbe Parliament later; and, secondly, be put forward tbe argument that pressure of otber business prevented tbe Government from bringing down tbe necessary bill of enactment. Tbe Opposition does not accept that excuse. Tbe Government has not been subject to pressure of other business, but, on the contrary, has bad difficulty in producing sufficient legislation for tbe House to debate. Had it not been for the co-operation of tbe Opposition, the Parliament would bave been in difficulty in that respect on more than one occasion. So, the argument about pressure of otber business preventing the Government from introducing tbe proper enacting measures earlier will not appeal to the well-informed, or, indeed, to anybody with any political intelligence.

The Government will not depart from that practice because bonorable members on this side believe in freedom of speech. After all, this is a democracy. Wben the honourable member for Melbourne was on this side of the chamber, tbe Government be supported had a long record of prevention of discussion not only on matters of this kind but also on all matters associated with its administration.

Again, we are to be given an opportunity some time in the dim and distant future to discuss bow generous tbe Government bas been to brandy drinkers, because, under this measure, tbe nips are going to cost less for brandy drinkers, whilst persons wbo drink beer will still bave to pay tbe same prices as they bave paid for beer since tbe days of tbe horror budget. 1954-55, which includes these excise proposals, is just tbe horrible little sister of the horror budget. Tbis Government is a wbisky-andbrandy government. Last year it reduced the excise on whisky for the benefit of its friends in tbe Melbourne Club, tbe Union Club and other such places. Tbis year it wants to reduce tbe duty on brandy. But the excise duty on beer, which was raised from 4s. 7d. to 7s. 2d. a gallon under tbe horror budget, bas not been reduced. The Opposition is most anxious that something should be done for .tbe ordinary people wbo drink beer because tbey cannot afford to drink anything else. Tbis Government is a class-ridden government. It looks after whisky and brandy drinkers, but does nothing for tbose wbo drink beer. Deputy Speaker.

Tbe Government has done nothing to reduce the excise on cigarettes, cigars and tobacco. These duties are very heavy, of course. In fact, the burden is so heavy that I know of a number of married men wbo have bad to ask their wives to give up smoking because the strain on the family purse has been too severe. Tbe Vice President of the Executive Council bas said that we shall be able to discuss all these matters at some time in tbe future. Well, I hope that bis assurance will be honoured.

Pirst, heOf course, the budget for said that tbe House would be given an opportunity to discuss excise duties at some future date. We have beard promises of that kind on a number of occasions, and tbey bave not always been honoured. We bave plenty of time to discuss these matters now. Some of tbe items on which excise is charged are of great interest to many people, and therefore we should be given an opportunity to discuss thern at an early date. The Minister should not be allowed to put the matter aside with the airy statement that tbe Government will consider tbe holding of a discussion at a future date. Tbat sort of thing gets us nowhere. In fact, from my previous experience of such airy promises, I am inclined to believe that we shall not bave a discussion of the excise tariff until we have a change of government. worried arises from tbe Minister's statement that be is a great believer in freedom of speech, that tbe Liberal party believes in freedom of speech, and that the Government will continue to give tbe same freedom of speech to bonorable members as tbey bave enjoyed in past years. My experience bas been that a few Ministers have had great freedom of speech in this House, but on various occasions when I bave risen, tbe "" gag"" has been applied and I bave been denied my right to speak.

AGED PERSONS HMS BILL 1954. toTliat leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to provide for assistance by the Commonwealth towards the provision of homes for aged persons. Bill presented, and read a first time. Social Services) [3.37] -by leave I moveTliat the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to set up machinery so that tbe Commonwealth may make grants to churches and recognized charitable bodies and institutions to assist them in providing homes for aged people. A sum of £1,500,000 has already been appropriated in tbe budget to meet expenditure on grants during the year 1954-55. Tbis bill breaks new ground in tbe history of Commonwealth social services for aged people. Hitherto the Commonwealth's activities bave been mainly concerned with tbe provision of pensions and related benefits, leaving most of what may be termed welfare services, otber than rehabilitation and social case work, to the churches, the State governments, voluntary organizations and other kindly groups. We march a little ahead of the times. New conditions demand new policies; new problems demand the breath of novelty and novel solutions. Tbe Commonwealth is anxious to provide leadership in assisting to find a solution of what is a delicate human problem-tb e care and companionship of aged people. For years now tbe churches and other voluntary organizations all over Australia bave done a splendid job providing for this need. With devotion and unselfishness tbey bave given time, energy and thought to tbe problem of raising funds and by building and maintaining homes for 'Our own aged people. There are now almost 200 institutions of this kind in Australia. Some of them are small cottage-type settlements, some are small homes catering for fewer than 50 people and some are larger institutions. Most of tbem provide a bappy home-like atmosphere and, so far from being the over-regulated impersonal places many people may think, they are a source of mental and physical comfort to the people wbo live in tbem. Tbe contribution they make towards the well-being and happiness of our elders is immeasurable. We should be wrong if we thought that elderly people are concerned only with income and that an increase in pension will cure all tbe troubles of tbe aged. Income is not tbe only problem. Loneliness, boredom, and the sense of not being wanted are also among tbe problems of old people. It is, I think, generally recognized that care and attention, and the comforting thought that someone is interested in our well-being, increase in importance as one grows older and perhaps infirm. These are the needs that tbe voluntary organizations are attempting to meet. We all recognize that tbe demand for accommodation for aged people far exceeds tbe supply. Tbere are no reliable statistics to quote in proof of this need, but anyone who has come in contact with tbe work being done for older people knows of it. A recent survey in New South Wales shows that many homes have closed their waiting lists, knowing that it is impossible to meet additional requests for assistance. W think we can e go a long way towards helping to meet this need. Tbe voluntary organizations are anxious to expand and take on new responsibilities, if finance is available. Honourable members will be interested to know that already more tban 50 organizations bave applied for assistance under tbe proposed scheme. This is proof, if proof is wanted. It is evidence of a need and that tbe Commonwealth will be playing a leading part in providing assistance to those wbo are willing to give their time, money and attention to the aged.",23,Second Reading
98,Motion (By Mr Mcmahon ) Agreed,,24,Second Reading
99,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Minister forAll of us would like older people to be able to remain contentedly in their own homes, and to bave tbe feeling of independence. Tbe family remains tbe most important unit in our society and tbe stronger tbe family unit with its mutual ties of love, companionship and care, tbe stronger will be our nation and our Commonwealth. The basis of the Government's social services legislation has been the wish to strengthen tbe ties of tbe family and to strengthen its status and independence. It does so recognizing that tbere are many outside factors wbicb tend to weaken these ties and to break up the family as a unit. These we need not debate. Whatever view we take of these tendencies we cannot ignore tbeir effect on society, nor can we overlook tbe fact that tbere are many older people who have no families with whom they can enjoy tbe comforts of life. Tbe Government's approach to tbe problem of homes for the aged is therefore twofold-socia l and economic. On the social side we think that older persons, whatever degree of independence tbey seek, wish to live in surroundings as close as possible to tbose of normal domestic life, with all tbe associations we assistance. The first is that tbe organizathink of when we think of our home. In tbe bill before tbe House, this is stressed. In particular, tbe companionship of husband and wife will be preserved. On tbe economic side we realize that with many age pensioners, an increase in pension rates would not solve their bousing problems. Sometbing more is needed. Tbis bill provides one answer. It provides that tbe Director-General of Social Services, on behalf of tbe Commonwealth., may make grants to eligible organizations on a £1 for £1 basis towards the capital cost of approved homes for aged people. The organizations eligible for assistance and grants of Commonwealth funds is a wide one. It includes churches and organizations primarily charitable or benevolent, and also ex-servicemen's organizations of a national character. Otber voluntary organizations that may wish to join in this great work, which of course differs in pattern and type, may be approved .by tbe Governor General. Tbe definition, of eligible organization bas been extended to include tbe trustee or trustees under a trust, or a corporation, established by an eligible organization. In addition, a trustee or trustees under a trust established for charitable or benevolent purposes may be deemed to be an organization, if the Governor General approves, and may become eligible for a. grant. Tbis will cover cases of individual persons, or, for example, a public company wbicb establishes a charitable or benevolent trust, though that individual or company may not be itself an eligible organization. In tbe main it is expected that tbose seeking grants will be the cburcbes and long-established and soundly-financed voluntary organizations. Tbe Government does not wish to be tbe dictator of legal forms. Wherever good work is being done, we want to be in a position to assist, provided that tbere are reasonable safeguards to protect the use of public moneys, and provided that there is reason to believe that the purpose of the grant will be fulfilled. Two limitations are placed on tbe type of organizations that may be eligible for tion must be carried on otherwise than for tbe purpose of profit or gain to itsindividual members. Tbis would not exclude a commercial enterprise from setting up a foundation for benevolent or charitable purposes. Indeed, some of the world's great foundations have been set up by great profit-making companies. As I have explained, the trustee or trustees of such a foundation could be deemed an organization and become eligible for assistance. A second restriction requires tbe effective control of tbe organization to be in tbe bands of otber than government appointees. This is to preserve tbe whole purpose of the measure, which is provision relating to tbose Commonwealth assistance to voluntary agencies. Government appointees may belong to tbe controlling body of an eligible organization, but where such appointees conduct or control it, tben it bas substantially lost its character as a voluntary agency. It follows, of course, that tbe legislation is not intended to be used for inter-governmental grants.",24,Second Reading
100,Mr Mcmahon.,"I now turn to the kind of homes which may be approved and to their capital cost. Tbe general administration of the act is placed in the hands of tbe directorgeneral-define d as tbe Director-General of Social Services-wh o is subject to any direction of tbe responsible Minister. The director-general is given power to approve proposals and to make grants on behalf of the Commonwealth. He may approve a home if be is satisfied that it is intended to be used permanently as a home for tbe accommodation of the aged. An aged person is defined as a woman who bas attained the age of 60 years or a man wbo bas attained tbe age of 65 years. In tbe case of a married couple wbo wish to reside together in a borne tbe definition includes also tbe wife or husband of an aged person. In granting approval the director-general w ill look at tbe real character and essential nature of tbe borne. It is appreciated that at some time in tbe future a building established as a borne may be used for another purpose. Tbe director-general is required to look at the purpose intended by tbe organization at tbe time approval is sought. ""We do not doubt that tbose voluntary agencies with whom tbe director-general shall be called upon to deal w ill at all times act in good f a it b and that their charitable or benevolent intentions w ill be carried out. The bill relates to buildings purchased or to be purchased, and erected or to be erected. As tbe announcement of tbe Government's intention was first made on tbe 4th May, 1954, only a building or proposed building or one commenced or purchased after that date, or one to be commenced or purchased after tbe date of approval, may be approved as a home. Tbis is necessary to prevent projects already completed before that date from coming within tbe scope of tbe bill. Wben an eligible organization has bad its borne or proposed borne approved, the director-general may, in bis discretion, make a grant to ""assist towards meeting tbe capital cost of the borne. For the purpose of tbe bill, tbe capital cost means tbe cost of erecting the home, including tbe cost of necessary fixtures. Where existing premises are purchased it means tbe cost of purchasing tbe home and making any necessary alterations or additions and installing necessary fixtures, in order to make tbe borne suitable for tbe accommodation of tbe aged. In this latter case also, tbe cost of tbe land required for tbe purpose of the borne is included, as it may not be practicable to sever tbe cost of an existing building from the cost of tbe land on wbicb it stands. In determining tbe capital cost of a borne in course of erection on the 4th May, 1954, tbe director-general w i ll take into account only tbe cost of the part of tbe borne erected on or after that date. As a home must be vested in some person legally able to own property, payment under tbe act may be made only to a corporation or to trustees in whom tbe approved home is, or is to be, vested. Tbe bill provides that the directorgeneral may impose terms and conditions in making a grant, and that be may require an organization to enter into an agreement with bim regarding tbem. Such an agreement could require an eligible organization to repay tbe agent if tbe borne ceased to be used as a borne for aged persons, and may also require the organization to give security to carry out such an undertaking. It is not expected that this provision w ill be frequently needed. Since public moneys are involved, tbe Commonwealth should have some legislative authority in order to ensure that tbe purposes of tbe grant are fulfilled. Tbe main provisions of tbe bill bave been dealt with already. It remains to explain tbe provisions relating to the amount that may be granted, and tbe instalments and timing of payments. Tbe whole concept of the b ill is to provide Government assistance to voluntary effort and self-belp and for tbe matching, on a £1 for £1 basis, of funds actually raised by an eligible organization for tbe building of tbe home. A grant may not exceed one-half of tbe capital cost of the borne as determined by tbe director-general. In addition to this, the grant may not exceed tbe moneys actually raised by an eligible organization from donations or subscriptions or from its own resources. In the bill, this intention is expressed negatively, and the amount of tbe grant is limited to moneys expended, or available for expenditure, wbicb did not become available as the result of the borrowing of tbose moneys or of tbe borrowing of other money;or moneys which were received from a government source, or from a government authority. It is intended that tbe assistance given by this measure shall enable eligible organizations to expand tbeir activities. It is also hoped that it will be an incentive to State governments to make additional assistance available. Tbe Commonwealth's intention to encourage tbe provision of homes for tbe aged could be defeated, and tbere could be a considerable waste of public moneys, if projects were commenced before organizations were certain that funds for tbe completion of tbe homes were available. lit is therefore provided that tbe director-general shall not make, or agree to make, a grant unless be is satisSouth Wales, Victoria and South Australia, fied that tbe moneys expended and tbose presently available, together with tbe grant, will be sufficient to meet tbe capital cost. It is emphasized that no restriction is placed on tbe source of the moneys available for expenditure by an eligible organization. For example, an organization might raise £20,000 from public subscriptions or__donations, may receive £10,000 from a State government, and may raise £10,000 on mortgage. The moneys matched by tbe Commonwealth would be the £20,000 raised by public subscriptions or donations. The amount available to meet tbe capital cost of tbe home, however, would be £60,000, of which £20,000 would be represented by tbe Commonwealth grant. Provision is made that grants shall be payable out of moneys appropriated by the Parliament. As I bave stated, tbe Parliament has already approved of tbe grant of £1,500,000 for this year. Tbere is also the usual provision giving power to make regulations. That is a general outline of tbe bill before the House. I think tbe House will agree that the Commonwealth, in entering tbe field of providing homes for older persons, has made a generous but a necessary gesture towards the solution of one of our great human problems. Already tbere is plenty of evidence, both from individuals and churches and organizations, of appreciation and approval of tbe Government's proposals. We look forward to the day when tbe principle of government assistance to self-help and voluntary effort will be more widely accepted. Meanwhile, we lay the foundations to what must be a more personal and fruitfu l approach to one of the problems with wbicb modern society is faced. I commend the bill to tbe House. adjourned. BILL 1954. agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to ratify and approve an agreement for the further variation of the agreement entered into between the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the Premiers of the States of New respecting the River Murray and Lake Victoria and other waters, and for other purposes. Bill presented, and read a first time. Minister for the Interior and Minister for Works) [3.55] -by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. Tbe whole purpose of this bill is to ratify tbe agreement that was signed recently by tbe Australian Government and the governments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia to increase tbe capacity of tbe Hume dam from its present limit of 2,000,000 acre feet to 2,500,000 acre feet, and also to approve the construction of certain regulators and otber works on effluents of tbe river Murray between Tocumwal and Echuca to reduce tbe loss of water during tbe irrigation period, and to prevent tbe flooding of certain areas wbicb occurs at the present time. The original agreement that was approved in 1914, and subsequent amendments, made provision for the Hume dam to bave a maximum capacity of 2,000,000 acre feet. Originally, the capacity was 1,250,000 acre feet, but that was raised, by the amending act of 1948, to a maximum of 2,000,000 acre feet. An expenditure of £14,000,000 was approved. Under the original agreement and subsequent amendments, the following works have",25,Second Reading

104,Mr Kent Hughes (Chisholm,"been constructed: Thirteen weirs and locks on tbe river Murray itself, three weirs on tbe Murrumbidgee River, a diversionary weir at Yarrawonga, tbe Lake Victoria storages, and barrages at tbe mouth of tbe river Murray to prevent salt water seeping back from tbe outlet. The 1948 agreement, wbicb approved the raising of tbe capacity of tbe Hume dam to tbe limit of 2,000,000 acre feet, also approved tbe enlargement of tbe inlet channel to Lake Victoria, and gave the River Murray Commission authority to institute investigations in relation to any additional storages that might be required to complete conservation of tbe waters of the river Murray system. Tbe estimated cost of raising the capacity of the dam to 2,000,000 acre feet was £2,000,000. That estimate was made in 1947-48. Tbe work bas been going on steadily over tbe last three or four years, city of 2,000,000 acre feet. However, but the cost, like tbe cost of many other works of a similar nature, bas risen. It will now be £4,450,000, an increase of £2,450,000. On tbe 19th July, a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers was held. New South ""Wales was represented by tbe Minister for Conservation, Mr from which is tbe basis of tbe agreement Enticknap, and tbe Minister for Public Works, Mr Renshaw; Victoria was represented by the Minister for ""Water Supply, Mr Stoneham; South Australia was represented by tbe Minister of ""Works, Mr Mcintosh; and I represented the Australian Government. It was agreed unanimously that the dam should be raised to compound 2,500,000 acre feet of water. The decision to increase tbe capacity of the dam by 500,000 acre feet flowed from tbe fact that, in July, 1949, tbere bad been a conference of State Ministers and Commonwealth authorities in relation to tbe best method of handling the waters that were to be diverted from the Snowy River into tbe river Murray. The amount of water available from the two diversions, one from Tooma in tbe river Murray watershed into tbe Tumut in the Murrumbidgee watershed, will be 280,000 acre feet per annum. Tbis diversion is part of stage 1 of the Snowy Mountains scheme, wbicb is under construction at tbe present time. Tf and when it is decided to go ahead with stage 2, tbere will be a diversion of 722,000 acre feet per annum from tbe Snowy River in the neighbourhood of Jindabyne, into tbe Murray River somewhere near Kbancoban. At tbe time this matter was considered, tbe Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority stated that it would be necessary to build a regulating dam of 250,000 acre feet in tbe neighbourhood of Jingellic, tbe estimated cost of wbicb was £5,000,000. ""When that matter was referred to tbe River Murray Commission, that authority considered that it would be much better to build a larger dam, possibly one of 1,500,000 acre feet, in the upper river Murray watershed. It considered that that project would be a final conservation measure for tbe beadwaters of tbe river Murray, and would leave tbe Hume Dam at its present capawater conservation experts recommended that it would be uneconomical to build a dam of that size in tbe upper reaches of tbe Murray, and stated that tbe best method of conserving tbe waters of tbe Murray River was to increase tbe capacity of the Hume dam by 500,000 acre feet. That is where tbe proposal came that this bill will ratify. Those experts also stated that it would be economical to increase the capacity of tbe Hume dam by 500,000 acre feet, irrespective of whether the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority proceeded with tbe diversion from tbe Snowy River or nol, and pointed out that such a scheme would provide the cheapest irrigation water in Australia. Therefore, it is natural that wben tbe States concerned with tbe River Murray Commission, namely Victoria, New South ""Wales and South Australia, met and discussed this proposition with the Commonwealth, tbey reached a unanimous agreement that that was the correct thing to do. That is why the bill is at present before the House. Tbe economic limit upon the time when it would be wise to start the work of increasing tbe capacity of the Hume dam to 2,500,000 acre feet, was tbe end of last month, but tbe constructing authorities bave taken it for granted that this measure will be passed, and tbey have been carrying on the work slowly in anticipation of the measure being ratified by this Parliament and tbe State parliaments concerned. Another small matter which enters into tbe bill is tbe construction of the regulators or other works on effluent creeks of tbe river Murray between Tocumwal and Ecbnca. During tbe irrigation period it is necessary to keep a high flow in the Murray River, and in that area tbe banks of tbe river are higher tban tbe surrounding country and tbe river overflows into tbe lower areas. Tbat overflow causes a considerable loss of irrigation water by evaporation during the summer months, and interferes to a considerable degree with saw-milling activities in that area. Tbe overflow of tbe water also bas a very bad effect on tbe local river gum trees, and bas saused many of them to die. These are not large works, and about £100,000 will be expended on tbem over a number of years. In some instances tbe work done will be half paid for by tbe forestry authorities who are concerned with tbe overflow of tbe river. Honourable members will find in tbe agreement a proviso to the effect that the States do not waive tbeir claim to their share of the money wbicb may be required to be paid later by the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority in connection with the increase of storage water from 2,000,000 to 2,500,000 acre feet. original cost of tbe construction of tbe regulating dam was estimated by tbe Snowy Authority to be about £5,000,000. Tbe cost of tbe increase of tbe size of the Hume dam will be £3,200,000, which is considerably less than tbe cost of building a regulating dam. It was therefore suggested at the July, 1949 conference, at wbicb I believe tbe honourable member for St. George( Mr Lemmon) was present as tben Minister for Works, that tbe Snowy Mountains should pay half the cost of building a storage dam of 1,500,000 acre feet in the bead-waters of tbe Snowy River, or whatever regulating works might be necessary, in conjunction with the River Murray Commission. Snowy Authority has pointed out that it will not Mr Kent Hughes. require any work to be done for probably ten years, and that it therefore considers that it should not bave to pay interest and sinking fund from tbe present time until tbe money is needed. The raising of tbe Hume weir to conserve 2,500,000 acre feet of water will mean that all tbe electricity produced from tbe additional water will be controlled by tbe two States concerned, or by tbe River Murray Commission. In otber words, tbe Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority will get no benefit from tbe extra electricity that will be generated after tbe Hume dam capacity bas been increased to 2,500,000 acre feet. In tbe original agreement of July, 1949, the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority agreed to pump the water just below Albury to tbe places where New South Wales required it for irrigation, at no cost to tbe New South Wales Government, because funds from the sale of electricity would be available if a regulating dam were constructed at Jingellic. I mention tbose points because it will be some time before any decision is arrived at as to whether the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority should pay any amount towards increasing tbe capacity of tbe Hume dam, and if so, what amount it should be asked to pay. Wben we were discussing .this matter in July, the State Ministers decided that Tbe we should not refrain from inincreasing the size of tbe Hume dam until this matter had been deterMountains Hydro-electric mined, but that we should put a proviso in the agreement that we do not waive any claim to our share of tbe amount wbicb may be provided at a future date by the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. If it is decided that tbe authority should provide £1,000,000, tbe three States and tbe Commonwealth will each receive a refund of tbe amount that tbey are now expending, wbicb is Hydro-electric Authority £250,000 each. That is why tbe proviso bas been put into tbe measure. I again remind honourable members of tbe important points in this measure. There is the proposed increase of the capacity of tbe Hume dam to 2,500,000 Since then the acre feet, tbe construction of regulators Mountains Hydro-electric or otber works on tbe effluents of tbe River Murray between Tocumwal and Echuca, and an increase of the total cost of the scheme from £14,000,000 to £19,750,000. That increase is made up of £2,450,000 increased cost of the old work, £3,200,000 the cost of the new work, and £100,000 for the small works between Tocumwal and Echuca. Another matter is the increase of the water reserves to be held in storage in tbe Hume dam for use in drought years, from a minimum of 750,000 acre feet to 1,000,000 acre feet. That extra water will be an insurance for irrigators in Victoria and New South Wales, and will also give some benefit to South Australia, because the severity of drought years will be lessened. Therefore, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia will all participate with tbe Commonwealth in this proposal. Tbe Hume reservoir is the key storage dam of tbe scheme, and the Commonwealth bas, in tbe past, contributed its share towards the cost of tbe works at the Hume reservoir, and the other structures built under the agreement. I believe that, from the national viewpoint, the Commonwealth should continue as a full partner in tbe scheme by contributing its share towards tbe cost of tbe works now recommended. Tbe contracting governments are willing to impose on tbe River Murray Commission tbe further duties provided in tbe new agreement. By doing that tbey bave expressed their confidence in the commission, and have again illustrated tbeir interest in the success of tbe scheme. I commend tbe bill to honourable members. adjourned. (CONVERSION TO STANDARD Debate resumed from tbe 2nd November (vide page 2537,) on motion by Mr gauge, are in existence at Marree. Yards That the bill be now read a second time. [4.12] -I , like otber honourable members, support this bill, which must be looked at in tbe context of the Government's pro£821,000, and the net cost of the proposal posal to standardize tbe railway line fTom Port Augusta to Leigh Creek. Tbat work has now nearly been completed. Tbe proposal, which I may call tbe preliminary proposal, involves not only the construction of a standard gauge railway line from Port Augusta for about 219 miles north to Legib Creek, but also a welllocated railway line. As bonorable members are aware, tbe existing line goes over Pitchi Ritcbi Pass, wbicb is not only steep, but also bas bad curves in it, and is unsuitable for heavy and fast traffic. Tbe Government bas wisely chosen a new route to tbe west over practically flat country following the line of Lake Torrens. Tbat railway line will give a first-class standard gauge line to Leigh Creek, and will link with tbe standard gauge line south from Port Augusta to Port Pirie, and westwards from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. Tbis bill authorizes a further extension of some 56 miles of standard gauge line northwards from Leigh Creek into Marree. Tbe 219 miles of line wbicb was constructed earlier, was built mainly for tbe coal traffic from Leigh Creek into Port Augusta. Tbis was very heavy traffic, wbicb had to be carried at a low freight over the Commonwealth railways, as tbe result of a very advantageous arrangement wbicbtbe shrewd Premier of South Australia bad obtained for bis State. He was a keen bargainer. Coal constitutes the bulk of tbe traffic which passes over that line. However, we believe that the line will carry a considerable volume of other traffic in future. Let us examine tbe proposed construction of 56 miles of standard gauge line. The cost will be £1,241,000, but against that, savings will be made. The old line is in a very bad condition. Rails and sleepers will have to be renewed, and it will require ballasting. So, keeping the old line in operation would require very soon tbe expenditure of sometbing like £693,000. In addition, railway yards, which are necessary for the break of are not in existence at Leigh Creek, and an additional £128,000 would bave to be expended if tbey were to be provided at (Mackellar) that place. So it means that, although we shall spend £1,241,000 on tbe construction of the line, we shall save approximately is only about £420,000.",27,Second Reading
105,Debate (On Motion By Mr Haylen ),,30,Townley
106,Mr Wentworth,"I think that the House will agree with me when I say that such expenditure is fully justified. According to estimates, it will result in an operating saving of some £22,000 a year. As honourable members know, tbe cost of haulage over a standard gauge line is considerably less per ton-mile than is the cost of haulage over a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line, and where tbe volume of traffic is considerable, we bave a saving in pounds, shillings and pence. So tbe first thing to remember is that for the net expenditure of £420,000, we shall bave an annual saving of approximately £22,000 in cash. However, that is far from being tbe sum of tbe advantages that we may expect. Among tbe other advantages is this: At Marree, the trans-shipment facilities for cattle will end of what is known as the Birdsville be better. For example, tbere will be water, which will 'not be available so readily at Leigb Creek. The holding paddock conditions will also be better at Marree. In addition, the location of Marree as a spelling point between Alice Springs and the meat works at Dry Creek is rather better tban it is at Leigb Creek itself. But again, it must be remembered that nearly one-third of tbe cattle traffic which U3es this line is loaded at Marree or Farina, an intermediate station between Leigb Creek and Marree. Under this proposal, cattle will go through to tbe meat works without trans-shipment at Leigb Creek. In otber words, the trans-shipment of approximately one-third of tbe total number of cattle passing over that line will be saved. Tbis proposal to extend tbe standard gravitate gauge line for another 56 miles is a move Channel country until tbey come to tbe towards the more complete standardizaedge of tbe good fattening areas. From tion of Australia's trunk railways, wbicb, tbere, it may be that tbey will be moved all honourable members will agree, is justipartly on foot, partly by road vehicle, fied from both tbe economic and defence to standpoints. I do not tbink that one diseasterly from Marree. AgainI say to sentient voice will be raised in this House tbe House that I do not believe that this about what tbe Government is doing, and is an immediate possibility. One looks what it is proposing to do, following what forward to long-term development, surit has already nearly completed-that is, veying tbe subject in its broadest perthe line of standard gauge from Port spective, although it would be quite out Augusta into Leigb Creek. However, let us turn our minds toof tbe question wards this as one phase in a more comstruction plete scheme for future development. WeI t is important need to look forward, and tbe first thing wbicb which anybody wbo looks at the map goes will realize is that Marree is a point of tancesouth considerable strategic importance. I use Mr Wentworth. tbe word "" strategic"" in the economic rather than in the defence significance. As bonorable members know, tbe Flinders Ranges come up from tbe gulf northwards, and form a considerable barrier. Tbey terminate in tbe steep Freeling Heights, which are in excess of 3,000 feet, and are quite precipitous. So any eastward traffic from the Broken Hill area has to go round through Marree or across tbe quite formidable ranges. It looks as if, for tbe future, Marree has prospects of receiving that traffic, either by rail or perhaps by road, not in tbe immediate future but in tbe foreseeable future. Marree is well placed at tbe southern track, which serves tbe Queensland Channel country. We believe that, with tbe plans wbicb the Government bas in hand at tbe present moment, there will eventually be a considerable development of fat cattle-raising in tbe Channel country to take advantage of tbose pastures wbicb are not perennial but which jccur whenever tbere are favorable seasons in the north-eastern part of Queensland from wbicb area the rivers of the Channel country receive tbe bulk of their waters. One of the outlets will be along tbe line of Strzlecki Creek in the direction of Marree. I do not know, looking forward, whether this movement will be done on foot, by road vehicle, or by rail. I tbink it is most likely that it will be done by some kind of combination of them, because fat cattle will naturally soutbwestwards along tbe a small rail spur constructed northto consider such a contbis year or even next year. to realize that Marree, is situated on a bend of tbe railway line wbicb goes south, turns east, and again, bas a strategic imporboth as a town which lies to the north end of the Flinders Ranges, and on the south-western end of the Birdsville track. We look at this also as one link in the more complete standardization of our trunk lines. I shall not take up the time of the House, even if you, Mr tbe location of tbe line is fairly easy Speaker, would permit me to do so, by speaking of tbe vital economic necessity for standardizing our trunk lines. I have spoken of that in tbe past, and 1 bave no doubt that I shall speak of it again, but for tbe present, I merely wish to remind tbe House of this factor rather than, discuss it in detail. I should now like to speak of tbe extensions which follow on this line specifically, and which relate to central Australia and the Northern Territory, which depends on it. I believe that extensions should be clone in a way wbicb permits a mixture of gauges. It will not be practicable for many years to convert to the standard gauge the 3-ft. 6-in. lines of Queensland, wbicb lie to tbe east of this Territory except perhaps tbe trunk lines. So we bave to assume, for many years at'any rate, tbe existence of a 3-ft. 6-in. complex of railway lines in at least a large part of Queensland. But tbere is very little difficulty in mixing will be located as to curvature, gradient a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge track with a 4-ft. 8£-in. and clearance to meet tbe requirements gauge track. Tbe clearance between tbe two lines is sufficient to permit of an easy throw of points, so that we do not have those technical difficulties wbicb we bave if we try to mix the standard 4-ft. S^-in. gauge with tbe 5-ft. 3-in. broad gauge of Victoria and South Australia. It is quite reasonable to think that we would have a third rail inside a 4-ft. Sj-in. gauge track so that the track could carry both tbe economic standard gauge trucks and also tbe trucks of the Queensland system. I repeat that I do not believe that we can look upon tbe Queensland system as likely to be converted in Mo for very many years. It may be that when we construct tbe lines, we shall build tbe 3-ft. 6-in. part first. Tbat depends on the existing circumstances in every case. We lay our 4-ft. 8-J-in. sleepers, and have alignment with radius, curves and everything like that, correct for the standard gauge. We lay an outside rail, and a rail 3-ft. 6in. from it, leaving to a later date tbe provision of « -[05 ] the third rail 4-ft. 8§-m. from that firstnamed outside rail. That seems to me to be a sensible thing to do. In this country, tbe grades, generally speaking, are not bad. From a railway standpoint, and except for the sleepers, tbe difference between tbe cost of construction of a 4-ft. 8^-in. requirement bed and a 3-ft. 6-in. requirement bed is very slight. It does exist. I know that it is not sometbing entirely negligible, but it is comparatively small. Therefore, I should tbink that, for extensions in this area, we should make provision for a standard 4-ft. 8-J-in. gauge line, with the necessary sleepers, but it may be that, in some cases, we would lay tbe second rail 3-ft. 6-in. from tbe first, leaving tbe otber 4-ft. 8-^-in. rail to be placed in position at a later stage. Tbe line could tben operate as a mixed gauge track, and, in that way, at tbe smallest possible expense, we would bave tbe best of both railway worlds. I look on the construction of the north-south line from Alice Springs to the present terminus at Birdum as a work which should be done in tbe not too distant future. I hope that when it is done, tbe track of tbe 4-ft. S^-in. gauge. Eveni f tbe line is first built to tbe 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. I urge that it be built on 4ft. 8£-in. gauge sleepers. Tbe same principle might be applied to tbe cognate railways when we come to consider them from somewhere in the vicinity of Newcastle Waters to somewhere in tbe vicinity of Mount Isa. Those matters are outside the scope of this debate, but it is useful to mention them because tbey are a part of the picture to wbicb this very forward move by tbe Government is tending. Tbe only question remaining to be considered is whether standardization should at present be pressed forward from Marree in the direction of Oodnadatta, and, ultimately, to Alice Springs. This question depends very largely on particular conditions. If the conditions of tbe rail are bad so that tbe existing gauge line must shortly be replaced, tben one thinks of it in rather a different light; but taking it, all in all, and unless tbere are particular considerations, I should tbink that for the moment the Government would be wise to bait the standardization programme at Marree, because tbere are otber lines of higher priority on wbicb standardization should be carried out. I am not saying that this line should not be standardized, but I tbink that tbere are lines of higher priority wbicb should be tackled first. that. Earlier in this debate tbe bonorable member for Grey( Mr Russell) made the good point that it would be wise to retain in tbe area tbe gangs and facilities already there. I shall confine my remarks to lines in tbe area wbicb I tbink would have higher priority on standardization tban tbe line forward from Marree to Alice Springs. First and foremost is the line from BrokenH ill to Port Pirie. I cannot understand why the standardization of this line is not being pressed forward. Tbe present position is silly and intolerable. Tbe economic loss to Australia resulting from tbe nonexistence of this short link of 250 odd miles from BrokenH ill to Port Pirie is terrific. Between tbe trans-Australian line from Kalgoorlie to Port Pirie and the centralian railway, tbe line proposed under this measure to be standardized will be a little gap, leaving a 4-ft. 8-^-in. gauge island isolated from the main 4-ft. 8|-in. gauge Hoc in New South Wales. With a standard gauge link from Port Pirie to Broken Hill, we would be able to bring tbe transcontinental from Kalgoorlie, through BrokenH ill to Sydney and through to Brisbane and that would mean an immense increase in tbe revenue of tbe Commonwealth Railways and an immense saving in freight; and it would provide an assurance against happenings, like watersiders' strikes, to these wbo live in tbe west and are clependent on industrial supplies from tbe east. From a defence point of view, tbe provision of that line is not only overdue but is also absolutely vital. I believe that the construction of that link, wbicb is in tbe area we are now discussing, should bave higher priority tban tbe extension of tbe standardized gauge line from Marree to Alice Springs. Another undertaking, again in this area, wbicb would be much less costly tban this proposal, is tbe standardization of one of the lines wbicb leads from Port Pirie for approximately 130 miles southward to Adelaide. As bonorable members know, tbere are two lines from Port Pirie to Adelaide, the easterly one running via Snowtown and tbe westerly one running via Gladstone. If one of these lines, wbicb are of 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, were reduced in gauge, no substantial inconvenience would be caused to tbe remainder of tbe Sontb Australian system by reason of that duplicate line. Tbe cost of narrowing a gauge compared with that of widening it is small indeed. This is 8 job which, measured on experience 70 years ago in Great Britain and 60 years ago in tbe United States of America, could be done during a week-end. If tbere were a standard gauge line from BrokenH ill to Port Pirie, tbe rolling stock could be moved on to it. Tbere would be no difficulty in that respect. The only real cost would be that of providing terminal facilities at Salisbury and Adelaide. I shall not go into tbose difficulties at this juncture; but tbe expenditure involved would not be very high I tbink that in priorities tbe first thing to do is to standardize tbe line from BrokenH ill to Port Pirie, and to narrow tbe gauge on one of tbe lines from Port Pirie to Adelaide to 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. If that were done, cattle could be moved from Marree into Adelaide without changing gauge, and it would be possible to move trains from Kalgoorlie to Adelaide without changing gauge. In that case, we would bave a line without a break of gauge between Woomera and tbe services workshops at Salisbury; we would be able to bring coal from Leigb Creek to Adelaide without a change in gauge and we would bave from Adelaide to BrokenH ill a line which could be operated without a change in gauge. These advantages are so great that I do not know bow any sensible railways commissioner could possibly neglect them. I urge tbe Government to go ahead with this project in this area. In spite of what bas been said by honourable members, I believe that tbe two projects I bave mentioned should",30,Townley
107,Mr Russell,Wbicb lines?,33,Townley
108,Mr Wentworth,"I shall come to take priority over further standardization from Marree northwards to Alice Springs. The only other matter I wish to mention relates to the position of Marree -'the rail wins bands down. If railways Under this proposal, Marree will acquire a new importance. We must envisage soon the establishment of an air service from BrokenH ill to Marree, or to Leigh Creek. Tbe distance is approximately only 250 miles. I know that preliminary inquiries have been made, and that preliminary reports on this matter have been discouraging. I believe that tbose reports bave been wrongly based, because if one bad that short air link the fares from Alice Springs into New South Wales, or to Melbourne, would be very much reduced. It would be tbe cheapest, as well work unworthy of consideration. If the as tbe quickest, way of travelling. We might be able to bave not only air services from Sydney to Broken Hill, but we might also consider tbe rail service from Sydney to BrokenH ill with an air bop to Marree and tben northwards by rail again to Alice Springs. Any sensible railways commissioner would be thinking of putting in this service as a feeder in preference to tbe proposals now under consideration. As tbere is no serviceable road from BrokenH ill to Marree, or to Leigb Creek, it is not practicable to think of covering that link by tbe provision of road transport. The lack of junction between BrokenH ill and tbe systems in central Australia is tbe great missing link in Australian air services at present. I believe that if one were to be put in, tbe cheapening of tbe fares from Sydney to Alice Springs, whether it be done all by air or partly by air and partly by rail, would attract sufficient patronage to make tbe service payable. But, apart from tbe payability of tbe air service, its impact on tbe rail services and the additional custom that it would bring to tbem makes it worthy of consideration. There has been too much a tendency in Australia to write off our railway lines too soon. I do not tbink that tbe railway bas a proper function in short freight hauls, but for long freight hauls it stands, needed to be renewed but, having regard so far, without peer. I believe that we get too discouraged wben we say that tbe railway has no future. I agree that many of our little lines bave no future. We must revise our concept of tbe proper use of rail and its proper relationship to roads. But for tbe long haul, there is no comparison between tbe rail and tbe road are properly run and if we make proper use of the new techniques of tbe diesel electric locomotive, I tbink that tbe railways in Australia have still tbeir most prosperous days ahead of tbem. with much that the bonorable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) bas said with respect to tbe standardization of railway gauges. However, I do not agree with bis view that the standardisation of tbe 3-ft. 6-in. gauge in Queensland would take so long to carry out as to make that Government really got down to the problem, that work would be completed within a period of ten years. I think that it would bave been undertaken by now if the Chifley Labour Government had remained in office. However, I find myself in agreement with tbe bonorable member and, at tbe same time, slightly at variance with bonorable members on this side of the chamber, wben he says that tbere are lines of higher priority wbicb should be standardized before tbe work proposed in this measure is undertaken. I commend the Government for what it bas done because any step in the standardization of railway gauges, no matter bow small it may be, is to be commended. However, tbe Government must do more than it is doing in this matter. Tbe need to standardize tbe line from BrokenH ill to Port Pirie is predominant. Tbat section, in particular, requires early attention. Tbere is no need for me to elaborate on that point. The Minister for Air( Mr Townley), in his second-reading speech, saidThe need of this conversion is best demonstrated, first, by consideration of the economics of retaining the existing line in 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. The Minister referred to tbe age of the existing track and said that tbe sleepers to the cost of such work, the Government concluded that it -was better to proceed with the standardization of the line to wbicb this measure relates. Tbe same observation applies largely to many otber lines of 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. Tbe 3-ft. 6-in.",33,Townley
109,Mr Webb (Swan) [4.42],"I agreegauge line in Western Australia is in such a parlous condition that speed limits have been imposed in many instances. In fact, tbe maximum speed at wbicb passenger trains are permitted to travel on any section of tbe line is 45 miles an hour. That speed is permissible on only 950 miles of tbe track. Tbe limits elsewhere vary from 15 to 40 miles an hour. That indicates tbe condition of tbe track, and that is why I say that it would be a good idea now to institute a general plan of standardization. I am certain that lines in otber States are in a similar condition. It would be foolhardy to modernize tbe 3-ft. 6-in. gauge railway and then, shortly afterwards, be faced with tbe job of uprooting it and laying standard-gauge track. The expense, both to the Commonwealth and to the States, will be much greater if the work is left to be done in the future. Therefore, I submit that the time is now ripe to get down to business and reach agreement with tbe States on this important matter. Three-quarters of tbe track controlled by the Western Australian Railways Department ,needs complete renewal. Tbat system has 4,112 miles of track in use at present, and, of that total, 1,200 miles is merely developmental and would not be involved in any standardization plan. Thus, only 2,900 miles of track would be converted to standard gauge. The immediate objective, of course, should be tbe conversion of tbe line between Fremantle and Kalgoorlie. I bave been in close touch with various members of the State Parliament in relation to this matter, and I bave learned that tbe present cost of this project would bi approximately £28,500,000. Tbis estimate includes the cost of new locomotives, new rolling-stock and other equipment. However, the actual expense might not be as bigb as the amount I bave mentioned, because the Western Australian Government is at present purchasing locomotives which are convertible to tbe broad gauge. It has 68 new diesel locomotives of this kind already in operation or on the water. Tbe cost may appear to be colossal when considered as a total figure, but tbe conversion of the track from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle would take approxiMr WeVb. mately five years and, spreading tbe cost over tbe full period that tbe work would take, tbe expenditure would amount to about £6,000,000 a year, wbicb is not a big sum these days for a job that is worth doing. For instance, this bill provides for the expenditure of over £12,000,000. I submit that, if we got down to business, tbe cost would not be excessive in the long run. Tbe rest of tbe Western Australian Government railways track, apart from tbe line from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie, should not be done immediately, because tbere are more important sections in otber States that should be converted as soon as possible. However, tbe whole of the track in Western Australia could be converted to broad gauge within a period of ten years. It is estimated that tbe work m tbe second five-year period would cost about £16,000,000 a year. AlthoughI bave said that tbe work for which tbe bill provides has been taken out of its proper order of priority, I am happy that action is being taken to extend tbe standard gauge track from Leigb Creels to Marree. Sir Harold Clapp's report on the standardization of railway gauges, which was tabled in this House in 1945, listed the conversion of this section of railway as proposal "" F "" . His proposals "" A "", "" B "" and "" C "", of course, related to the conversion of tbe main trunk lines. Thus, the project for which tbe bill provides bas a low priority under Sir Harold Clapp's scheme. Tbe Minister bas directed attention to the advantages of conversion. I venture to say that tbe advantages be mentioned would accrue in a large measure if this Parliament got down to the business of arranging for tbe conversion of all major links to tbe standard gauge. As tbe bonorable member for Mackellar has said, tbe establishment of a standard gauge throughout Australia would shorten times of transit. Furthermore, rolling-stock and locomotives would be interchangeable between tbe various railway systems. Tbis is a very important factor, wbicb would effect a great saving of costs, as well as of time, because fewer locomotives would be needed. Admittedly, the standardization of gauges throughout Australia will be a colossal job, but it must be done eventually, and it will be a colossal job whenever we face it. It was considered to be a colossal job in 1921, when a royal commission investigated tbe proposal. Tbe total cost of tbe work then, according to the commission, would bave been about £57,000,000. It was considered to be a colossal job again in 1945, wben Sir Harold Clapp presented his report. He stated that tbe trunk lines and certain other lines could be converted to standard gauge for £76,000,000. Tbe work would cost much more if it were done now, but it will be even more costly twenty years hence. Therefore, now is the time to get on with tbe project. I have spoken largely from tbe point of view of Western Australia, because I do not think that point of view is stated sufficiently in this House. Nevertheless I regard tbe standardization of railway gauges as a national project, and it should be treated as such. In fact, it has important advantages from tbe point of view of tbe whole British Commonwealth of Nations. Honourable members can readily imagine the benefits that would accrue in time of war. Goods could be unloaded at Fremantle, the nearest major port to Great Britain and Europe, and could be quickly transported to all parts of Australia. At tbe same time, goods could be moved by rail to Fremantle and shipped overseas from tbere. Tbis would mean that a tremendous tonnage of shipping would be made available for other sea routes, which would be an important consideration in time of war. Tbe economies that would be effected also in time of peace are obvious. It is important that goods should reach their destination as quickly as possible. The bonorable member for Mackellar referred specifically to tbe advantages of standardization in relation to defence, as distinct from its economic benefits. Sir Harold Clapp stated in his reportThe justification for the standardization of operating conditions, to the detriment of the gauges must, of course, rest primarily on defence rather than on economic grounds. Tbe truth of that statement should be clearly apparent. For instance, a standardized rail gauge would enable us to operate our transport system efficiently with a reduced supply of man-power and materials, which are always short in time of war. Unfortunately, although the advantages of standardization become so evident in war-time, reports on tbe subject are shelved as soon as tbe danger is over and nothing is done until another national emergency arises. That is why I say that now is the time to do tbe job. Honourable members may say that we are suffering from a shortage of man-power now. But surely workers could be brought from otber countries to do tbe job! Tbe work would take a number of years, and, when it was completed, they could easily be transferred to otber activities. We are trying to increase our population, and this would provide a means towards that end. Manpower shortages should not be allowed to stand in the way. I shall conclude by directing attention to an independent opinion on this subject. I am sorry that the Minister for tbe Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) bas left the chamber, because tbe report to which I shall refer was submitted to bim wben be was a Minister in the Victorian Parliament. It was made by Mr John Elliott, a member of tbe Institute of Transport in England, and was handed down on tbe 20th May, 1949. Mr Elliott is a world authority on transport, and he bad been called upon to make a report upon the Victorian railways system. He made an additional report on tbe subject of tbe standardization of railway gauges, although it was not part of bis job to do so, and his comments, wbicb represent an impartial expert view, are of particular interest. Tbis is what be had to sayI believe tliat the present railway systems in Australia, with their varying gauges and consequent transfer points, are unsuitable for a country of great distances populated by one people of the same race and Commonwealth. So long as the vexatious restrictions on free railway passage of freight and passengers from one part of the Commonwealth ^o another persist, the railways w ill continue to be worked under adverse technical and national well-being. W it h separate State systems working to varying gauges, standardization of equipment of a l l kinds is impossible. Without such standardization, tlie cost of railway working is unnecessarily high and wasteful. Economies in handling of interstate, and intra-state traffic offer themselves through standardization of gauge and rolling stock; while through the total elimination ot exchange points economy in labour w ill be secured, and transit of traffic remarkably speeded up. I believe that standardization of railway gauge in Australia is bound to come, sooner or later. From the point of view of long-term planning of railway development, on Avhich so much depends, the sooner the decision is taken, the better for Australian transport, and therefore Australian industry. After tlie decision is taken, at least five years w ill elapse during which tlie new 4-ft. 8|-in. gauge and Port Pirie. As a Victorian-and I rolling stock is being built, before any considerable labour force can be employed on track VictoriaI consider that these advances conversion. With standardization of gauges should come unification of all the Australian railway systems under one Federal control and organization, as in South Africa and on the Canadian National Railways. Onlyi n this way will the Commonwealth obtain the greatest advantages from the traffic and technical aspects which unification alone can bring. From the defence point of view, I imagine that the transport problems of the last war have shown how great are the shortcomings of a disunited railway system, which had to be supplemented at a very heavy cost by road and air transport absorbing far more labour in the transport of a given tonnage -than would have been the case if the Australian Railways had been of a standardized and unified structure. That is a very important statement, of which this House should take notice. The honourable member for Blaxland asked the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) in this House only a few weeks ago whether he would agree to establish a joint committee representative of all parties in this Parliament to make recommendations on tbe subject of tbe standardization of railway gauges, but, so far as I know, be bas not received an answer to bis inquiry. I commend tbe bill to tbe House because it will enable us to make a step in the right direction, but, all tbe same, I suggest that much more should be done. We should press on with tbe conversion of important sections of our trunk lines to standard gauge for a start. Tbe standardization of otber sections should be undertaken thereafter as soon as possible. [4.58] -Tbis is one of tbose bills on wbicb both sides of tbe House can agree, but I am afraid that nothing very serious will be done about the standardization of railway gauges unless tbe Government shows much more enterprise in tbe future tban it bas shown in tbe past. This measure represents tbe third attempt by an Australian government to press on with tbe work of standardizing our railways system. Therefore, it will make a useful contribution towards a desirable result. Tbe only sections of track that bave been converted since standardization was first given any practical consideration in 1921 are tbe sections between Kyogle and South Brisbane and RedH ill am speaking now as a representative of have been negligible in the light of tbe recommendations to wbicb tbe honourable member for Swan( Mr Webb) bas referred Tbe report of Mr John Elliott, wbicb the honourable gentleman quoted, was particularly interesting. Mr Elliott was brought to Victoria for tbe purpose of making expert recommendations, and bis opinions deserved much more practical consideration tban tbey were afforded. I do not believe that it would be possible for any State to undertake tbe standardization of any part of our trunk-line system without Commonwealth assistance. However, I remind the House that, wben tbe honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) was Minister for Transport in tbe Chifley Government, large sums were made available for States that would undertake certain classes of work on tbe standardization of gauges. Tbat did not mean that the State authorities, wbicb owned tbe rolling-stock and tracks and bad tbe responsibility for maintaining them, were able to escape their liabilities. The Commonwealth was ready to assist tbem. However, between 1945 and 1949, unfortunately, the man-power needed for tbe project was not available. Tbe standardization of railways should be undertaken by this Government, which bas a majority in both bouses of tbe Parliament, in a much more practical fashion tban it bas been attempted in the past. I bave not before me tbe map that the (Maribyrnong) bonorable member for Mackellar referred to, but I bave read tbe honourable member's views, wbicb were expounded in a pamphlet that was made available to passengers on tbe Trans-Australian railway line. Tbe bonorable member this afternoon bas virtually repeated the views that be expressed in that pamphlet. I",34,Townley
110,Mr Drakeford,"do not complain about the pamphlet being made available to passengers, but why should not the opposing views of tbose wbo object to tbe expenditure of large sums of money on rail gauge standardization be made available to passengers also? I am aware that many people are of the opinion that tbe standardization of railway gauges should have far lower priority for the allocation of funds tban otber schemes should bave. Rail standardization is a defence rather tban an economic measure, and it must be attempted. Much more money should be expended north of tbe Tropic of Capricorn, which lies just south of Rockhampton, in Queensland, for tbe effective defence of Australia. Tbat may be another reason why a parliamentary joint committee should be appointed to make an investigation. The bonorable member for Swan, wbo, like myself, was a locomotive enginedriver, and a practical railwayman, knows what is required to put the railways in reasonably sound economic condition. Tbe financial losses incurred on tbe railways are not peculiar to Australia alone. Canada bas bad similar experience. In fact, the principle on which early Canadian governments acted was that tbe railways should be allowed to run down to their lowest ebb financially and should tben be transferred to private enterprise, which with tbe assistance of tbe Government would make them profitable. There is a danger of a similar situation arising in Australia at present, and I should be sorry to see it arise. I am glad, therefore, that this Government-be latedly, in my opinion-ha s decided to proceed with tbe construction of another section of standard-gauge railway line. The cost of standardizing tbe gauge of the railway lines between Brisbane and Perth was originally estimated in 1921 at £21,600,000. In tbe 33 years that have elapsed since that time, I have been mi ardent advocate of tbe standardization of rail gauges. I believe that in 1936 I gave tbe honourable member for Mackellar a pamphlet on the subject that I had prepared that year. Mr ""WENTWORTH -That is true. in detail, but in broad outline, most of the statistics that bave been quoted since were given in that pamphlet. In tbe past it was found impossible to obtain agreement between the railways commissioners of tbe various States on tbe action that should be taken. In my opinion, Victoria has missed tbe bus by insisting on retaining tbe 5 f t . 3 in. gauge between Melbourne and Adelaide, and it deserves to be by-passed by the construction of a standard-gauge link between Broken Hill, in New South Wales, and Port Pirie, in South Australia. If a standard-gauge railway between Kalgoorlie and Perth were constructed, we should bave a standard-gauge line from Perth to Brisbane. Sncb a line, with numerous lengthy sidings, is essential for defence purposes. During World War II . , we could not transport a division of troops from Perth to tbe eastern coast of Australia in less tban a month or six weeks. Unless tbe railway line from Perth to Brisbane is standardized, it will be futile to talk about tbe value of the railways for defence purposes. I remind the House that during World War II . Australian troops from tbe Middle East, wbo were urgently needed in New Guinea, bad to be taken by ship 200 miles round tbe south of Tasmania to disembark at Sydney for jungle training before going to New Guinea. Delays are one of tbe great defects of our present-her e I would bave to use an unparliamentary word properly to describe it-syste m of diverse railway gauges. Tbe standardization of rail gauges should commend itself to every one. I do not oppose this bill in any way. I merely wish to mention tbe priorities that should be observed in relation to tbe construction and standardization of railway lines and the development of air services. Tbe honourable member for Mackellar advocated an air service from BrokenH ill to Marree. I cannot imagine any useful purpose that such a service would serve. The proper course to take to provide quick transport would be to establish a service from Melbourne, through Broken Hill and Mildura to Alice Springs. I suggest that if a service were opened between BrokenH ill and Marree, it would probably be left to Trans-Australia Airlines to operate, and that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited would",37,Townley
111,Mr Drakeford,"I think that, notnot be expected to conduct sucb a service because it would not be profitable. Tbat matter may not be strictly relevant to the bill, but it is doubtless in tbe minds to Marree, and this bill provides for that of some of tbose people wbo do not believe in government airlines and are not greatly enthusiastic about government railways. For my part, if such an air service were necessary, I should put it in the bands of Trans-Australia Airlines. A government airline, like a government railway, should be used for the development of tbe outback areas, and substantial government funds should be devoted to that purpose. Trans-Australia Airlines bas developed many air services in the outback, and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited did not bother about many of the non-paying lines until they bad been developed and made profitable by Trans-Australia Airlines. Trans-Australia Airlines is operating many services for wbicb subsidies were formerly paid to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. Tbe most satisfactory air link to facilitate speedy transport between tbe interior of Australia and a port on the coast would be a service, not from Darwin to Adelaide, as at present, but from Darwin to Melbourne, through Alice Springs, BrokenH ill and Mildura. When I was Minister for Civil Aviation in the Labour Government, I travelled over that /oute. Sucb a service would provide quick transport over many hundreds of miles. However, this bill does not relate to quick transport alone. It largely relates to the best means of transporting cattle, which are tbe product of the most important industry in central Australia. The Minister for Air, in bis second-reading speecb, dealt clearly and very well with a number of matters to which the honourable member for Swan referred also. The proposal made by Government supporters that sleepers suitable for a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge line should be laid between, say, Marree and Alice Springs, is not sound. Every one knows that in central Australia white ants destroy railway sleepers at a prodigious rate. sleepers are now being used. member did not mention concrete sleepers. area, with the result that gangs of men ' better than concrete. thing to do is to proceed with tbe construction of a standard-gauge railway work. But we should not stop there. A standard-gauge railway from Darwin to Adelaide, or even to Melbourne, should be constructed as quickly as possible, not for economic reasons, but for defence reasons. This bill is a move towards tbe alleviation of tbe present miserable situation in relation to Australia's railway system. I agree with tbose bonorable members wbo have suggested that tbe north-south railway through central Australia should not have been constructed through Quorn in the first place. Its present route was chosen by agreement between South Australia and tbe Commonwealth, arid tbe Commonwealth was eventually to take over the whole of the line. It was constructed with grades as steep as 1 in 30. This measure makes provision for much more suitable grades in tbe railway line with which it is concerned. Any engine-driver knows bow difficult it is to take over grades of 1 in 30 loads that could be transported with comparative ease over tbe grades on the proposed new line from Port Augusta to Brachina, wbicb will not exceed about 1 in 60 or 1 in 80. 1 in 120. 30 are disastrous. It is necessary either to use two engines, and to make the train a double-header, as it is termed in railway parlance, or to leave half tbe load below tbe ruling or steepest grade while the first half is taken on to the next station. Tbat is a completely unsatisfactory state of affairs. I am indeed pleased to learn that the grades will not exceed 1 in 120. It can safely be said that grades no steeper tban that will avoid some of the difficulties that bave been experienced in relation to tbe existing 3-ft. 6-in. line, which sand is constantly blown over the the line of sand. I am glad to know",38,Townley

117,Mr Drakeford,"Grades of 1 inthat such troubles will not be experienced in relation to the new line and that as a consequence tbere will be a considerable saving in maintenance costs and labour. I bave travelled over tbe existing line in both goods and passenger trains. Tbe standardization of that section of it between Marree and Alice Springs should be undertaken without delay, though I do not suggest that it should have priority dardization of railway gauges that bas over the standard-gauge link between Cockburn, in South Australia, and Broken Hill, which was suggested by the honourable member for Mackellar in bis speech. That link should be given tbe highest priority in order to standardize the line from Kalgoorlie to Brisbane, with tbe ultimate object of completing a standard-gauge line from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle. Tbat follows as a necessity from tbe standardization of the line between Kalgoorlie and Brisbane. In tbe meantime this Government, belatedly, as I observed at tbe outset, intends to proceed with a railway work that gives much satisfaction to me as an experienced railwayman. I bave always hoped that during my lifetime railway gauges throughout Australia would be standardized. I am afraid that I shall bave to live a long time yet in view of tbe rate of progress made by this Government and its predecessors, including tbe Labour Government, which was hampered by tbe lack of man-power to wbicb I bave referred, because the States were unable to take full advantage of provision that was made by tbe honourable member for East Sydney as Minister for Transport. If Victoria is left out of the standard gauge arrangements it will be its own fault for insisting on tbe retention of the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge line between Adelaide and Melbourne. Victoria could bave undertaken tbe conversion to standard gauge of that line, as other bonorable members have pointed out, with less difficulty tban would be experienced elsewhere, because tbe existing sleepers could have been used to carry the 4-ft. 8-J-in. gauge line. It is true, as any one with railway experience knows, that modifications of platforms and stations would be required also. The cost would have been R -[96 ] much lower in earlier years tban it would be at tbe present time, and narrow-gauge locomotives and rolling-stock would have been cheaper. I could discuss tbe matter in much more detail, but that would serve only to cloud the broad issues. I support the bill, because it is the third step in tbe right direction along tbe road to stanbeen taken in tbe last 33 years. The work envisaged in this bill is not great, but it is essential. I trust that tbe views expressed by honourable members on both sides of tbe House will be considered earnestly by the Government. I do not tbink honourable members generally would oppose tbe expenditure of vast sums of money on tbe construction of railways, particularly in the northern part of-Australia. After almost 50 years of experience in tbe railways and after eight years as Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation in tbe Labour Government, my view is that although airways can be used to develop tbe country initially, railways are essential to enable tbe population to be increased in remote areas where uranium and other valuable minerals are being produced at present and will be produced in tbe future. Cattle can be transported by air economically, and air transport of cattle should be undertaken in advance of railway development, because it is far less costly to construct the necessary aerodromes than it is to construct hundreds of miles of railway. Another factor in favour of air transport is that it does not require the steel, building materials and other materials that are required by railways for lines, station buildings, points and crossings. Tbe proposal embodied in this measure is commendable, though it is far too small. It is unworthy of tbe Government to plan merely for this proposed small railway extension. It is doing only part of the job that the Commonwealth undertook to do in the original agreement with South Australia. I trust that tbe Government will in tbe future display more imagination and more concern for tbe defence of Australia by proceeding with tbe construction of the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge railway from Alice Springs to Birdum. That would make me feel much more happy than the present limited proposal does. quite evident that all honourable members wbo bave participated in this debate are in agreement with the proposal that was outlined by the Minister for Air( Mr abandoned bas grades of 1 in 30. Townley) in relation to tbe conversion of the railway line from Leigh Creek to Marree. I desire to associate myself with tbe remarks that bave been made, and to support tbe bill. It is evident also, from Port Augusta at a considerably reduced tbe Minister's second-reading speech, that this is a beef railway. For that reason, I am amazed that, so far, no member of tbe Australian Country party bas participated in the debate. I am aware of the opposition of tbe leader of the Australian Country party to the construction of railAdelaide market. Tbe points that were ways in northern Australia, and of his support for tbe air-beef scheme. I bave frequently read of tbe observations of tbe Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) in relation to tbe movement of beef by air. order. Tbe remarks of the last three speakers bave been very wide of tbe bill. The bonorable member for Griffith bas referred to tbe fact that no member of tbe Australian Country party bas participated in tbe debate. It may be that, if a member of the Australian Country party did so, he would speak on tbe bill. -Order! I am allowing a little latitude. figures are available, the cattle population The honourable member may proceed, if be comes to Marree instead of the airbeef scheme. tralian Country party, so far as that party has a policy, is related completely to the introduction of an air-beef scheme, but members of that party have been overcattle slaughtered in South Australia awed by members of tbe Liberal party, which is the major party in the coalition. I bave obtained some satisfaction from my own speech, because one member of the Australian Country party bas been goaded into making a remark. As tbe Minister for Air pointed out, tbe line is being converted on economic grounds. Tbe original railway to Marree was built in about 1884. It is yet another example of undertakings in relation to wbicb we are now paying for tbe sins and blunders of politicians in tbe past. I can assure tbe bonorable member opposite wbo has interjected that tbe railway was not built, by a Labour government. As the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) stated, the 3-ft. 6-in. railway wbicb is to be The cost of the proposed railway from Stirling North to Marree will be £12,250,000. Tbe new railway will bring Leigb Creek coal to tbe power station at cost to tbe South Australian consumer. Tbe proposal now before tbe House is to extend tbe standard gauge to Marree for the purpose of bringing beef cattle from tbe Northern Territory, and from the Channel country of Queensland, to the made by the Minister in relation to the economics of tbe scheme are extremely sound, inasmuch as tbe conversion of this line will ensure that beef cattle that will be delivered to tbe abattoirs in Adelaide will retain, as it were, tbe fresh bloom of youth. The people of Adelaide will enjoy the good beef that Queenslanders usually enjoy, but wbicb is denied to the citizens of Canberra. Tbe figures relating to cattle populations are very interesting. It is significant that tbe conversion is taking place in a State that bas sucb a small beef cattle population. In tbe last year for which of South Australia was 189,000; of the Northern Territory, 1,019,000; and of Queensland, 5,293,000. A considerable number of the beasts that will be carried over this railway will be drawn, not from South Australia, but from other areas. It is significant that tbe number of during tbe last year for which figures are available exceeded tbe total cattle population of that State. A total of 213,000 cattle were slaughtered in Adelaide, whereas tbe total beef cattle population of South Australia was only 189,000. It will be noted that, therefore, tbere is some justification for tbe construction of this railway as a beef railway. A considerable number of beasts is driven over tbe Birdsville track from the",39,Townley
118,Mr Coutts (Griffith) [5.15],It is,41,Townley
119,Mr Lucock,I rise to a point of,41,Townley
120,"Mr Acting Deputy Speaker,",,41,Townley
121,Mr Coutts,"Tb e policy of tbe AusChannel country in Western Queensland, which has been described by tbe Minister as the best fattening country in Australia. Queensland, and tbose west of tbe 'Great Dividing Range, flow towards central Australia. Periodically, the Channel country is irrigated by natural means, as a result of wbicb tbere are excellent fattening properties that are used to fatten beasts wbicb are brought down from the Northern Territory. Many of tbose cattle are moved to tbe Adelaide market, because, I understand, very good prices are paid for beef cattle in Adelaide. In view of the fact that this railway will be used for the transport of a large number of cattle, the conversion of the line to a 4-ft. 8-J-in. gauge is particularly important. One of tbe difficulties associated with represents a move towards tbe stana narrow gauge railway is tbe amount of bruising of cattle that takes place. The proposed line will be constructed according to modern standards, and the nuisance to which I bave referred should be overcome. Bruising causes great economic loss to cattle-producers. A royal commission, under tbe chairmanship of Mr Justice Wolff, which was appointed in 1950, found that Australia consumes 88 per cent, of its total beef production. Tbe Minister for Air pointed out that, following tbe extension of the line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs in 1929, tbe number of cattle that were moved from Alice Springs to Adelaide was doubled. Tbat statement illustrates tbe fact that tbe construction of railways encourages settlement on tbe land, and tbe production of cattle. Tbere is ample scope for tbe extension of tbe beef cattle industry. Last week at Gayndab, one of Queensland's principal graziers referred to tbe opportunity that awaits Australia to export beef to tbe United Kingdom. He directed attention to tbe fact that, before World War IL , Argentina shipped 400,000 tons of beef to the United Kingdom, Brazil shipped 150,000 tons, and Uruguay shipped 80,000 tons. -Order! Tbe bonorable member is getting away from the provisions of tbe bill. related to tbe expansion of the beef industo build a railway from Port Augusta to try, for wbicb this railway is being constructed. I am very pleased, as a Labour man, to do my bit towards aiding settlers in tbe area that will be served by tbe The waters of northern railway, wbo, apparently, are being denied the aid that tbe Australian Country party has stated, from time to time, it was prepared to give to tbe people on tbe land. Tbe only criticism of the bill that I can offer-and I suppose it is an easy criticism to offer-is that it does not go far enough. I agree with the bonorable member for tbe Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) that the standard gauge should go through to Alice Springs. I hope the time is not far distant wben Marree will cease to be tbe transhipping centre, and wben tbe conversion will be extended to Alice Springs. However, tbe bill is a step in the right direction. It dardization of railways, wbicb every Australian wbo bas tbe' welfare of the country at heart should support. do not propose to cite a lot of figures in relation to railways, or to get as far away from tbe provisions of tbe bill as otber bonorable members bave done this afternoon. Tbe Australian Country party is always pleased when legislation is introduced to help tbe primary producer. It is associated with the Liberal party in the carrying out of tbe project that is covered by the bill. Therefore, I have great pleasure in supporting tbe measure. [5.27] I do not wish to speak at length. I would not rise in my place if I could not say sometbing more complimentary than were the statements of the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull). I do not intend to speak about statistics in relation to railways, cattle or anything else. The proposal to convert to a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge the railway from Stirling North to Marree represents another step towards providing sometbing for wbicb South Australia bas been -waiting for a long time. If bonorable members were to peruse the records, tbey would discover that, from time to time, most of tbe honourable members wbo come from South Australia bave deplored tbe fact that effect bas not been given to tbe promise",41,Townley

125,Mr Thompson (Port Adelaide),"Darwin, when the Northern Territory was removed from the control of South Australia. associated with the construction of such a railway, and I realize also that other States may have opinions about the areas that railways should serve in the centre of Australia. South Australia has been of tbe opinion that the Commonwealth should try to provide proper railway communication with tbe north of Australia. Although the narrow gauge line bas been of considerable help, and although central Australia would not have been able to progress as it has progressed without it, it has been very inadequate. The conversion of the line between Leigh Creek and Marree wall give a very direct service for tbe transport of cattle which come from tbe Channel country. According to the Minister's second reading speech, tbe conversion of tbe proposed railway line will not only benefit the cattle industry in the districts around Marree, but it will also be of distinct benefit to the cattle industry north of Alice Springs. Moreover, water supplies available at Marree will be of great benefit in the' operation of tbe new line for the coal mines at Leigb Creek. I believe that tbe proposed conversion will be of great benefit to South Australia., and, indeed, to tbe general economy of Australia. Tbe honourable member for Griffith( Mr Coutts) said that tbe proposed railway line will benefit South Australia because it will be possible to bring cattle more expeditiously from tbe northern parts of that State to tbe southern towns and ports. Tbe people of Adelaide are quite familiar with the name of Sir Sidney Kidman, and tbey, together with most Australians, recognize that bis initiative was mainly responsible for the advances tliat bave been made by South Australia's cattle industry. As the population and industry of that State increase, cattle will have to be moved more often from tbe north to tbe south, and consequently this line will have a beneficial effect on tbe future of South Australia. The bonorable member for Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) spoke only about £28,000,000 to standardize tbe Jfr. Thompson. about tbe necessity to prevent injury to cattle while tbey are being carried in I realize the difficulties railway trucks. I believe that this line, by making it more easy to bring tbe cattle south, will enable us to avoid much of the cruelty that bas had to be suffered by cattle in tbe past. Even for that reason alone our support of tbe proposal will be worthwhile. We bave beard much talk in recent years about railways now being out of date. It bas been said that we can carry all tbe goods that we need to carry more expeditiously by road. I do not believe that that is so, because if heavy goods are carried by road tbe damage done to tbe roads is out of all proportion to tbe benefits that accrue from tbe road carriage of goods. I believe that it will always be necessary to have a good railway system to transport heavy goods in large quantities. Therefore, tbe more efficient we make our whole railway system tbe better it will be for tbe people, and for the general economy. I also draw the attention of bonorable members to the fact that evidence was given in South Australia before tbe Commonwealth Grants Commission to tbe effect that the transport of large quantities of goods, or heavy goods by road, was found by municipal authorities to be a most costly business. Therefore, I am sure that in tbe future, much of tbe talk, and some of tbe hurried actions, against railways, will be found to bave been ill advised. I support tbe measure. Mr £. JAMES HARRISON (Blaxland) [5.36] -On two occasions in tbe last few weeks I have asked tbe Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to consider the appointment of an all-party committee to consider tbe standardization of rail gauges in Australia. I suggest that this debate has shown how necessary it now is to appoint such a committee. Tbe honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) referred to the relatively small amount of work that needs to be done to link BrokenH ill with Port Pirie, and to tbe fact that tbe cost of doing so would not be more tban £12,000.,000. The honourable member for Swan( Mr the Webb) bas stated that it would cost rail gauge between Fremantle and Kalgoorlie. Tbat being so, bonorable members on this side of tbe House cannot understand why the Government should not support our move to set up an all party committee to consider standardization throughout Australia. Recently a contract was let to an American firm for £25,000,000 to construct one tunnel in the Snowy Mountains scheme -Order! This is not a general debate on rail standardization. member must confine bis remarks to the bill before the House. merely mentioned tbe Snowy Mountains scheme in passing. Of course we know that our rail gauges cannot be standardized unless we spend money, but I suggest that tbe money required is relatively small wben compared with tbe beneficial results that sucb standardization may give us. If we can find £25,000,000 for a tunnel in tbe Snowy Mountains scheme, we should be able to find £40,000,000 in order to arrange for direct rail transport on a standard gauge line from tbe east to the west of this continent. I again point out to honourable members that diesel electrification is tbe answer SOUTH-EAST ASIA COLLECTIVE to the profitable working of tbe railways. The Commonwealth Railways system bas enjoyed a profit since it introduced diesel electric locomotives, and I suggest that next year tbe New South ""Wales govern(vide page 2389), on motion by Mr ment railways will also show a profit as CASEYa result of the introduction of diesel electric locomotives-althoug h at present tbere are only twenty of tbem in New Opposition) [8.2] -Tbis is an important South Wales. and the standardization of railway gauges arrangement under tbe United Nations are matters completely above party Charter of a rather unusual kind, and I politics, and I again ask tbe Government consider that tbe best contribution that to consider the appointment of an allone can give is to endeavour to analyse party committee to consider tbe advansome of its features. At the outset,. I tages of rail standardization to Australia, point out that we on this side of the both in peace and in war. Question resolved in tbe affirmative.

130,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Leade r of tbecountries were equally keen on it, because of their Pan-American agreements. Those countries wanted tbe opportunity to bave matters of security, welfare, protection against aggression in tbe area, and economic advancement in tbe area, dealt with, not merely through tbe world organization, but also through tbe regional agencies and bodies. A good deal of objection was taken to that view in certain quarters. It was thought by some that there should be no rival to the Security Council in relation to the maintenance of international peace and security. Therefore, it was a matter of some difficulty to get the conference at San Francisco to agree to regional arrangements. In the fight for the recognition of that principle, one great American, Senator Vanden'berg, took, possibly, tbe leading part, and, ultimately, it was agreed to. Tbe opposing view was that the Security Council, tbe world organization, -was to be primarily responsible for tbe maintenance of international peace and security, and that we could not bave half a dozen bodies to deal with the keeping of peace and tbe prevention of aggression throughout tbe world. Therefore, why bave a separate body? Tbe view wbicb we put, and I think it is the view wbicb turned out to be correct, is that we bave a defect in tbe voting security to Australia, which is very imporsystem in tbe Security Council. The majority of tbe members of tbe Security Council-the statutory majority, so to speak, of seven out of eleven memberscould vote for a proposal to deal with a matter of peace or security, yet tbe exercise of tbe veto by any one of the permanent members could make all tbe proceedings abortive, and no decision would be reached. I mention, in passing, that the five permanent members were Russia, France, Britain, tbe United States of America and China. As is well known, the veto bas been exercised frequently. We foresaw that possible situation to a substantial degree, and proposed two important remedies to meet it. Many people thought it was unlikely, but in tbe Constitution we bad to guard against what was not likely, and tbe not likely bas proved to be tbe fact. We adopted two methods. first was the extension of tbe powers Dr. Evatt. of tbe General Assembly so that it could also deal with matters of international peace and security. The veto may not be exercised in tbe General Assembly. A two-thirds majority of tbe members, by making a recommendation, expresses the great opinion of tbe majority of tbe nations and the peoples of the world. Tbe General Assembly has acted in some situations, sucb as Korea., the Balkans, Kashmir, Palestine and at one stage, Indonesia. It bas been tbe intervention of tbe General Assembly, where the veto cannot be exercised, that has enabled matters of international dispute-acut e dispute in some cases-to be settled. Tbe second way of enabling disputes to be dealt with, irrespective of the veto of the Security Council, is by regional arrangements. I believe that regional arrangements have come to stay. Tbere has been tbe North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Europe, and a parallel arrangement in relation to South America. In the Pacific, tbere bas been the ANZUS arrangement. I point out, so that tbe people of Australia can understand the position, that under tbe ANZUS pact, we have a clear-cut, logical arrangement consistent with tbe United Nations Charter. It provides, in my opinion, tant indeed, and indirectly, security for the Pacific area largely because of tbe inclusion of tbe United States of America. Tbe South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty affords, in some respects, a great contrast to ANZUS. Nonetheless, it is tbe first experiment of its kind in grouping together European nations and Asian nations, and the experiment, no doubt, will bave to be proceeded with but, I hope, subject to certain safeguards wbicb I shall bave tbe honour to propose on behalf of tbe Opposition. It is important to examine tbe provisions of the South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty. Tbere is both,a likeness and a contrast to tbe North Atlantic Treaty and tbe ANZUS pact. Under those two treaties, the obligation assumed by each member is to act, or take action, in order to repel armed attack against any The of the parties in a specified area. The North Atlantic arrangement relates to a very wide area, and I need not refer to it now. I do not wish to refer, and I do not consider that it is necessary for me to refer, to circumstances short of armed attack, because this debate will cover a wide field. Those matters are dealt with, as honourable members know, on tbe basis of consultation. For relevant purposes under this agreement, tbere is an obligation on each member to act to meet the common danger wbicb arises in two types of cases. Tbe first is aggression by means of armed attack in the treaty area against any of the parties. The treaty area is an enormous one. It is not merely tbe South East Asia area, but includes vast areas of the Pacific. It extends as far west as ""West of aggression. It does not follow that Pakistan right over to tbe borders of Persia. It extends north to a parallel just below Formosa and Hong Kong. It extends as far south as New Zealand and Australia and includes all tbe vast area between. Aggression by means of armed attack in the treaty area against any of the parties brings into existence an obligation on each party to act to meet tbe common danger. But in addition to that, tbere is a matter which is, perhaps, more important and more pertinent. Tbe obligation to act means military action. Tbe Minister says it does not necessarily mean military action, but it primarily does include rnilitary action. It does not necessarily include it, but that is the purpose in tbe case of aggression. Tbis is aggression by means of armed attack in tbe treaty area against any State or territory which tbe parties may designate by unanimous agreement The parties bave designated the area of South Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia by unanimous agreement, so that the instrument is to be read subject to tbe knowledge that aggression by means of armed attack in that area is an occasion which will call for the obligation, the primary obligation, to act under the treaty. The term aggression is not used in tbe crucial article in tbe ANZUS pact. In tbe North Atlantic Treaty, that term is not used either, but it is used in Article IV . of this treaty. It has to be not merely armed attack, but aggression by means of armed attack. Therefore, as I interpret tbe position, tbe obligation of each party to act arises^ only where tbere is aggression by means of armed attack. Tbe vital word is aggression. It is difiicult to define tbe meaning of tbe word. There may be acts of open aggression, which are clearly seen to be used. There may be acts of deliberate provocation by one party, wbicb cause armed attack by the other party. Tbere may be acts preliminary to military action. We have to look at all the facts before we can name tbe aggressor. It was because of that difficulty that when tbe word aggression was used in tbe United Nations Charter, it was found impossible to provide a comprehensive definition the nation wbicb strikes tbe first blow is necessarily the aggressor. Tbat is tbe only point that I wish to make. It may be in a sense a defensive measure. That is well known and need only be mentioned. An armed attack may be aggressive, and it usually is, but it may at times be defensive. The term aggression is used in ArticleI . of tbe United Nations Charter. That reference is to tbe suppression of acts of aggression or otber breaches of the peace. I now wish to refer to tbe South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty itself. This treaty forms tbe schedule to tbe bill. Tbe preamble to tbe treaty, in many respects, resembles the preamble to tbe North Atlantic Treaty and tbe ANZUS pact. It becomes a part of tbe agreement submitted for our approval. The eight proposed parties to tbe agreement state certain positive aims. Tbey emphasize tbeir faith in tbe Charter of tbe United Nations, in self-government and self determination. They declare tbatThey will earnestly strive by every peaceful means to promote self-government and to secure the independence of all countries whose peoples desire it and are able to undertake its responsibilities. The aim to promote the economic well-being and development of all peoples in the treaty area is also stated. I am puzzled to know, and I should like the Minister to inform us in bis reply, why that preamble was not good enough for bim or tbe Australian draftsman. That is the preamble wbicb is almost identical, in broad spirit at all events, ""with that of the North Atlantic Treaty -and also ANZUS. It was definite, objective and positive; but in tbe preamble put in by tbe Minister bill? bill is to ratify this agreement, but the preamble contained in tbe agreement is not good enough for tbe Minister. He must have a preamble to tbe bill. Tbe preamble to the bill is unnecessary, but the draftsman seems to bave thought that it was necessary to adopt tbe preamble to the agreement with another preamble to the bill; and tbe latter preamble resembles a manifesto against communism. Tbe statements contained in tbe preamble may be quite true, but tbey are entirely irrelevant because everyone who is familiar with events which covered World ""WarI . and World War II . and the interdeals with regional arrangements. The vening period knows that fascism and nationalism are equally as productive of aggression as is communism. They are, obviously, basic causes of aggression. For what purpose have these placards in the preamble been put in by some draftsman? All tbe preamble that is needed is stated in the treaty itself in terms agreed to by the representatives of eight nations. Why is that not sufficient? Of course, placards of this kind may bave some temporary political effect, and I think that that is tbe intention behind tbem. But, at the same time, I tbink tbey may have a bad effect upon Asian nations, especially upon neutral nations, and certainly an aggravating effect upon unfriendly nations. So, we find in the bill this denunciation of Communist policies as though tbe purpose of regional agreements is to prevent aggression of one character only, namely, by, or in tbe interests of, communism. Government members interjecting. members opposite would not bark at me. If tbey do, at least I wish tbey would do so one at a time. I tbink that the argument that I bave just advanced would appeal to persons who take a basic view on the matter. Are honourable members opposite so sensitive to criticism of fascism and nationalism.? I can understand the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) drawing himself up to whatever it is, but I wish that be would listen to me. If be did so, perhaps be might agree with what I have to preamble to the say. It is absurd in an agreement, so far as Australia is concerned, to make that emphasis, because Australia's obligation under this agreement is to act-includin g military action-agains t fascist or nationalist aggression, as well as against Communist aggression. Therefore,, why does the preamble to tbe bill refer only to one class of aggression? Of course, if tbe regional agreement meant that it was to be operative only against one type of aggression in the region, that is, aggression where the aggressor is Communist, it would be contrary to tbe Charter of tbe United Nations because that Charter binds all members of tbe United Nations and it Charter prescribes what such arrangements shall contain and provides that tbey must be concerned only with "" tbe maintenance of international peace and security"" in relation to tbe region. It only authorizes regional agreements consistent . with the "" purposes and principles "" of tbe United Nations. Tbe very first purpose of tbe United Nations, as stated in ArticleI . of tbe Charter, is to take effective collective measures for the "" suppression of acts of aggression "". Tbe evil to be dealt with is "" aggression "", quite irrespective of its cause or the parties engaged in aggression. For the purposes of tbe United Nations Charter, it does not matter whether aggression is Communist, fascist or nationalist. It is aggression that counts. If one nation interferes with tbe territorial integrity of another by armed force, that is aggression, and that is enough. That bas occurred in many instances. Sometimes, the cause is an ideology or an opposite ideology, or nationalist expansion. Whatever tbe purpose of tbe aggression may be, tbe object I wish that honourable of tbe United Nations Charter is to provide collective action to stop it. But tbe preamble to the bill drags in other things. What is the purpose of this emphasis in this preamble on one particular form of aggression? Tbe preamble to which the eight nations agreed at Manila is not",44,Defence Treaty Bill 1954 Second Reading

133,Dr. Evatt,"good enough! Those nations accepted it unanimously. Why, therefore, does the Minister want another preamble for local consumption? Does he want to introduce local politics into this matter? Why does he not stick to the agreement? gentleman why. we shall see whether he was correct. Tbe reason is clear enough, because the situation to which tbe agreement directs itself, primarily and most obviously, is the situation in lndo-China. Tbe American Secretary of State, Mr Dulles, bad that in mind chiefly, and, no doubt, that would be in tbe minds of all tbe representatives of the nations at Manila. Article IV . of this treaty places an obligation upon each party to tbe agreement to act in the event of aggression against either South Viet Nam, Laos or Cambodia. That article is a unanimous declaration; and that was primarily in the mind of Mr development of self-government in lndoDulles. So, we find the extraordinary position that tbe United States bas made a specific reservation to tbe effect that "" its recognition of tbe effect of aggression and armed attack"" giving rise to action to meet tbe common danger under Article IV . ""applies only to Communist aggression "". tbere? Cameron) -Order! I shall insist on the Leader of tbe Opposition getting an uninterrupted hearing. If there are any further interjections, I shall deal with tbe offender according to the Standing Orders. at this time, that is tbe type of aggression with -which most nations are concerning themselves, but on a long-term basis we are dealing with all possibilities. The practical application of this limitation is important. Tbe trouble spot to-day is lndo-China; and, yesterday, it was IndoChiua. But nobody can say that that may necessarily be tbe case to-morrow. If tbere were Japanese aggression in the treaty area as. a result of a thrust southunder this treaty. Under Article TV. of ward into the Pacific, and parties to tbe agreement were affected, the United States, under this agreement, would not be obliged to take action with regard to that aggression. For aggression would presumably, be of a nationalistic character, or even, perhaps, of an anti-communistic character; but never communistic. Let us take the case of South Viet Nam. At present, Viet Nam is partitioned, pending a final determination by tbe people of its future government. Let us suppose that there are border incidents to tbe north of the border of South Viet Nam. People naturally tbink of aggression from tbe north directed against tbe south, Communists against non-Communists, the "" baddies"" against the ""goodies"". Tbat is the way tbe mind of certain people invariably operates. It may well be that way. Would it be Communist aggression if it were provoked from tbe south? One would have to look at all tbe circumstances. I make it plain that the history of the China since the war is that a really bona fide nationalist movement in tbe first instance, comprised often of the best forces in these countries, succeeded in raising resistance against Japanese aggression and also opposed the Vichy French Government which, at times, was willing to welcome the Japanese invader. Tbat is well known to have been tbe start of those movements; but, gradually, the movements were converted to tbe use of communism largely because self-govern(Hon. Archie ment was so long delayed. But it does not always follow that character. Let us suppose, also, that border incidents in Viet Nam are caused from tbe south for the very purpose of provoking resistance and counter attack from the north. In that case, difficulties would arise in determining who was the aggressor. But even if there was clear and open aggression against Northern Viet Nam that would not be characterized as communistic aggression, because tbe aggressor would not be Communist but anti-communist, and, in such circumstances, tbe United States would be entitled to say that it would not take action in regard to that aggression because it has carefully guarded itself against sucb a possibility",47,Defence Treaty Bill 1954 Second Reading

139,Dr. Evatt,"Admittedly , in this areathe treaty, the United States is obliged to take action only in tbe case of communistic aggression. A further example may be suggested in relation to Dutch New Guinea. If tbere were an attack on Dutch New Guinea by, say, Indonesia, and tbe Netherlands Government requested intervention under this treaty-and the area was designated unanimously under Article IV -woul d sucb aggression be termed "" Communist aggression""? It might not be Communist aggression. It might be nationalistic aggression, and the United States might so regard it and, therefore, would consider itself not bound to lend aid under tbe treaty. But whilst that country would not be so bound, all the otber nations wbo are parties to tbe treaty, including Australia, would be bound to lend armed support. That is the extraordinary position to wbicb I direct attention. Tbat is a defect in tbe treaty, and it is our duty to recognize it. It is a limitation that must be considered in tbe light of tbe provisions of tbe United Nations Charter which I bave mentioned. Tbis is one of the difficulties under this treaty under wbicb one nation, wbicb is the strongest by far in tbe Pacific, bas, in effect, created for itself a different condition for armed intervention by way of defence to aggression from the condition which binds every otber party to tbe treaty. Surely, this difficulty should have been hammered out at Manila. crucial obligation under tbe treaty. I cannot imagine why the difficulties were not confronted more boldly at Manila during all tbe celebrations that took place during this conference. This defect should have been seen, and the reasons advanced by the Minister in this respect are unconvincing. The Minister says that the view of tbe United States is that it has no territorial interests affected in tbe area. The United States certainly posesses terrigeneral. torial interests in tbe western Pacific, wbicb is part of tbe treaty area, where it bas taken over control and practical sovereignty of all the islands contained in the former Japanese mandates which extend from tbe Equator to just south of Formosa. Dr. Evatt. _ part of tbe treaty area, tbose islands also are a part of it. I submit that New Zealand is clearly within the area. war was that New Zealand did not belong to tbe south-west Pacific but was in the south Pacific. However, taking a fair view of the matter, I submit it is in tbe treaty area. gentleman's geography is shaky. bit shaky, but sometbing else was shaky at Manila when tbe Minister did not secure an all-round agreement. The security of Australia depends upon absolute co-operation with tbe United States in these matters. That is the reason why, in the end, an agreement of this kind must be accepted from a practical point of view even though it bas its weaknesses and is an experiment in some respects. We must have cooperation with tbe United States. But for American help in World War II . , our position would bave become almost indefensible. In saying that, I do not underrate tbe enormous effort made in tbe Pacific war by Australia and Australian servicemen. I bave never done so. It would be to the advantage of both Australia and tbe United Statesi f the Minister tried to co-operate on a better basis-that of That is a junior partnership for Australia. One of the weaknesses of tbe Minister in international affairs is that be places Australia in the position of a satellite to a superior. Tbat is tbe real explanation of the extraordinary position that tbe right honourable gentleman agreed to at Manila. Tbe United States bas undertaken an obligation that is limited, definite and frank, but Australia's obligation, is tralia's obligation is not confined to action in the event of Communist aggression. The treaty binds Australia and the other six nations to a general commitment. Had tbere been an attempt to frame the agreement properly, the",48,Defence Treaty Bill 1954 Second Reading

147,Dr. Evatt,"It is general. AusUnited States would have agreed. Perhaps after to-day in that country it may be more easy to get a satisfactory amendment. It is most important in these matters not just to sign on the dotted line, no matter how great may be the power and the strength of that great country, with which we must always associate on the basis of tbe closest friendship. It is quite wrong in principle, in short, that Australia's obligation under this treaty should be unlimited and that tbe United States should bave only a limited obligation. Wbo is to judge whether tbe particular aggression alleged to have occurred is Communist aggression or not ? Tbere is no judicial body to determine tbe question. It could not be referred to tbe courts. It must be left in the long run, I presume, to the nation concerned to decide whether it will intervene under tbe treaty. Tbat is a defect in tbe treaty wbicb should be amended. From tbe point of view of Australian security, therefore, I maintain emphatically that our obligations under tbe ANZUS pact are clearer. That agreement is enormously more important to our security than is this treaty. Under ANZUS tbere is an obligation on all three parties to the pact, including tbe United States to intervene against aggression, wherever it may take place, if it be directed against any of tbe parties, and whether it be Communist aggression, fascist aggression, nationalist aggression or any otber kind of aggression. Aggression means interference with tbe territorial integrity of another country, and to that country it does not matter very much what tbe ideological basis of tbe attack may be. It may be simply nationalist expansion. Tbat is the proper way in which regional agreements should be drafted. Tbe Nato agreement is drafted in that way. It is perfectly true that Nato was brought into being through fear of Russian aggression, but tbe agreement itself applies to all types of aggresthink tbe Minister agrees with my view sion. Tbat is essential if we are to work according to tbe spirit and, indeed, the letter of the United Nations Charter in its relation to regional arrangements. The ANZUS pact was drafted in strict accordance with tbe principles of the Charter, but tbe same position does not a rise under tbe present agreement. Therefore, at tbe committee stage, I propose to move that two safeguards be included in the bill. First of all, tbe ratification of the treaty by Australia should be on the definite understanding that the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand bave all ratified it or are ratifying it. I tbink that is vital. Secondly, it should be laid down in tbe bill that no armed forces are to be contributed by Australia under tbe"" treatyI am not referring to any other treatywithout tbe prior approval of this Parliament. Just imagine the situation that could arise. I bave made it perfectly clear that tbere is a definite trouble spot in lndo-China. Tbe situation may calm down, or it may be aggravated. There is to be a plebiscite in 1956 in relation to tbe future of South Viet Nam to decide whether it shall remain independent or whether its boundaries shall be altered. Wbat will be the position under this agreement if aggression occurs and is deemed to be aggression from the north 1 Australia's obligation, in tbe terms of tbe letter of tbe agreement, will come into existence, subject to tbe due constitutional processes. We can lay down what tbe constitutional processes shall be in matters of this kind. The term does not mean processes according to tbe terms of the written constitution. Therefore, as tbe lives of Australians may be involved, tbere should be a definite, clear statement in tbe bill that armed contributions under tbe agreement cannot be made by tbe executive government without tbe prior approval of the Parliament. Such contributions mean war. They might be described as security action, but, in effect, tbey would mean war. Therefore, the provision that I suggest is important. No government ought to suppose that, by merely adopting the principles of the treaty, it is under an automatic obligation to provide armed forces. I on that point. It must look at tbe situation that exists when armed forces are called for. Tbe only way to cover this situation is to give the Parliament supremacy by insisting on requirements of the. kind that I bave suggested. Tbere are otber aspects of this treaty which are important, but I shall not-touch on all of them because I know that various honourable members are specially interested in the economic side of tbe arrangement. I wish to mention only one other important matter. Wbat are the, true purposes of .these regional arrangements? Tbey are all set out in Article 5'2 of tbe United Nations Charter. Tbe-parties to regional arrangements are not only bound to carry out their obligations to act collectively in relation to aggression, whatever kind of aggression it may be, but tbey are also bound positively, if tbey are to conform to tbe Charter, to make every effort to achieve tbe peaceful settlement of disputes within the terms of tbe agreement. But there is not a word about that in tbe treaty. Nobody seems to have thought of it. Tbe Security Council, which is a similar body on a greater scale, is bound to encourage the development of the pacific settlement of local disputes through regional arrangements. In otber words, while it is important that tbe treaty arrangements contemplate economic. assistance, as well as military aid, it is far more important that tbey should be regarded as imposing a continuous duty on tbe parties to carry out the objectives of regional agreements. Those objectives, which are set out in Article 33 of tbe Charter, are to seek solutions of international disputes by tbe method of inquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement and other peaceful means. Wbat has been the tragedy in lndoChina? For five years, fighting went on tbere all tbe time. Hundreds of thousands of lives were lost. Nobody referred tbe matter to tbe United Nations. Had tbe matter gone to tbe United Nations, better terms would have been obtained tban those agreed to at Geneva recently, wbicb were very difficult and onerous to France and to the democratic forces in tbe lndoChina community, and all tbe bloodshed would bave been stopped. The Australian Government did nothing about' it. I pointed out the situation to the Government, but it did not act. I asked it to state its policy on lndo-China, and tbe reply was, in effect, "" Ob, we are kept informed. We get a cable now and again."" But it did nothing! Aud tben Dr. Evatt. came tbe conference at Geneva. The Minister for External Affairs flew to Geneva, where he had an interview with the Prime Minister of Communist China and offered his good offices. That was quite correct at tbe time. I summarize my view in this way: Tbis treaty organization should not be merely a military organization. It should be a permanent organization which can contribute to the prevention of fighting in this vast area. It is bound to apply tbe purposes and principles of tbe United Nations. Otherwise, it would be null and void, because sucb agreements can be concluded only in accordance with tbe Charter of the United Nations. The arrangement should attempt to narrow tbe area of international dispute and tbe parties should be ready to render good offices. Tbat has not been achieved in connection with this agreement, although there may be some general phrases along tbose lines, of course. In fact, sucb phrases are to be found in tbe preamble to the bill. They bave been put there so that tbe Government may gain a lot of cheap local political advantage. Tbey are not included in tbe treaty. Wbat a lie this bill is! Here is a pre-. amble which states that tbe parties to the agreement are going to fight Communist aggression, and tbe reader thinks, ""Ob well, Australia is copying tbe United States of America "". Tbe United States was frank about tbe matter and limited its obligations. But, wben the reader of the bill turns over the page, be finds that Australia's obligation is against aggression, whether it be Communist, fascist or any otber kind of aggression. Therefore, tbe statement in tbe preamble is not a true statement. gentleman is a bit touchy about communism apparently. Minister wbo is touchy about communism. He needs a little treatmenta few facts. I say that tbe United Nations stands for collective action by force against aggression, wbether it be nationalist, Communist or fascist aggression.

148,Mr Casey,The right bonorable,51,Defence Treaty Bill 1954 Second Reading
149,Dr. Evatt,"Not at all. It is thekind that I can recall previously in international affairs was the anti-comintern pact, signed by Hitler, Hirobito and Mussolini. Yet the Minister for External Affairs returned proudly from Manila, having bound Australia far more onerously than tbe United States was willing to be bound, and said, "" That was a good thing Dulles did. I had better put it in. the preamble to the bill, where it will have no effect''. it is a little placard so that tbe right honourable gentleman can still sail under the anti-Communist banner, but tbe fact is that be has committed Australia to obligations wbicb are far wider than those accepted by tbe United States. It is for that reason that we must bave in this agreement a specific clause wbicb will prevent a government like tbe present one from sending Australia's forces abroad on any occasion unless tbe Parliament first approves of tbe decision. We can never tell what this Government might do. Primarily, tbe purpose of tbe United Nations, and of every regional agreement that is lawful, is preventive. The object of tbe United Nations is to prevent tbe scourge of war which has brought, and still is bringing, untold sorrow to mankind. This principle of conciliation could constitute the most important activity of the treaty organization. Tben tbe treaty representatives could go to Indo-iChina, study the situation throughout that vast area, and see tbe causes of the trouble. Tbat would be far preferable to any military arrangement, but there is no word of such a plan in tbe treaty. The power and duty to conciliate are implied by the Charter of tbe United Nations, and regional arrangements ought to embody that power and duty. I hope it will be towards that humane objective that tbe efforts of tbe parties to the treaty will be directed. If tbe authors of tbe treaty achieve that result tbey will bave builded far better than they knew. I shall propose the specific amendments that I bave foreshadowed wben tbe bill reaches tbe committee stage. [8.45] -What a curious speech we have just listened to! It began with generalities and proceeded through denunciation of the endeavour to arraign communism as tbe aggressor. So far as one can judge, tbe bill was regarded as an attempt to secure a local political result. Would any one bave thought of sucb an idea for one moment if it bad not been suggested by the Leader of tbe Opposition (Dr. Evatt) ? Are we to understand that this treaty, agreed to by eight nations at Manila, is part of a famous conspiracy? The right bonorable gentleman went on then to arrive at a most singular conclusion. Tbe only conclusion that one can draw from tbe speech to wbicb we have just listened is that be disapproves of this treaty altogether, that he thinks it is totally unnecessary, and that be intends to rely entirely on tbe United Nations for tbe security of Australia. I shall refer again, as I go on, to some of tbe things which be bas said. Let us, for a start, look at tbe position in tbe Pacific, at the situation and the background. We bave in Asia some powerful Communist States. We have China, lndo-China, and North Korea, and behind tbem we have Russia. Tbere is no doubt about the character and nature of tbose States. Tbey are Communist States. Tbey are governed by tbe full technique of communism. Tbey are led by men wbo have repeatedly and openly declared that tbey are adherents of the school of Marx and Lenin. Tbey bave declared that they are at present in tbe stage of what is called tbe united front and that tbey are proceeding by deliberate 3teps, about which they make no secret whatever, to tbe full dictatorship of tbe proletariat, and tbey bave declared that they are doing it in alliance with world communism. Tbose are plain facts. Tbat is tbe situation in tbe Pacific. Are we to be told now that this is not the only cause of aggression? Can some one suggest another cause of likely aggression in tbe Pacific? Is it not plain that, whatever sophistries may be raised about attacks from tbe south and so on, the real danger against wbicb this treaty is erected, and is meant to be erected, is communism? It is well to realize that we live to-day in a different world from the world we lived in not very long ago, that national movements-nationalis m and things of that sort-moder n communications and scientific advances bave",51,Defence Treaty Bill 1954 Second Reading
150,Dr. Donald Cameron (Oxley),"entirely changed the world from what it was even a few short years ago before the last war, and that foreign policy in the world of to-day has to be suited to the changing conditions of the modern world. It is all very well for us to lay stress on the power and importance of the past. Of course it is important, but it is even more important that we should be able to change with tbe changing world. Wbat are tbe factors that confront us to-day in tbe Pacific and Asia? They are not tbe factors that confronted us a few years ago. The dominant factor in tbe Pacific to-day is the rise of great militant Communist powers. I want to give tbe House two examples of change in traditional foreign policy, wbicb bave taken place almost within the last few weeks. Tbey are quite different from anything that we bave been used to in our lifetime. Both of tbem were made by tbe Government of Britain, wbicb, I remind the House, is a Conservative government. One was a decision to come to an arrangement with tbe Government of Egypt, and tbe other was a decision to abandon traditional British policy and to be committed for a very long time, and, in fact, for an indefinite period, to keeping troops on tbe continent of Europe. quite different from what we regard as traditional British policy, but I believe that tbey may well prove to be two of tbe greatest acts of statesmanship in the foreign policy of Britain wbicb it bas ever taken. The simple fact is that Britain has been able to change with tbe times, and we in Australia bave to do tbe same thing. We have to frame our policy to fit the circumstances of the day. What is the object of this treaty? What is the object of our foreign policy in tbe Pacific? Surely it is security. Surely it is to preserve freedom. Can we bave security and freedom if no otber nation in South-East Asia bave them? security is interwoven with that of Malaya, Thailand and tbe otber nations of South-East Asia, and the nations in the area covered by this treaty? is an area comprising perhaps 170,000,000 or 180,000,000 people. What would bapDr. Donald Cameron. pen if this great area were to pass into tbe shadows of communism? Would it have no effect upon Australia ? Would it have no effect in reducing tbe area in wbicb freedom can still flourish in the world ? These are tbe facts against which this treaty is framed. What is tbe alternative to it? What is tbe alternative to some treaty, demonstrably framed, a8 the recitals of this treaty point out to us, against tbe most likely cause of aggression, tbe greatest threat to any of us in South-East Asia? I ask tbe Leader of tbe Opposition wbether any responsible government of Australia would have adopted any otber course. Wbat is tbe alternative to this treaty? Tbere are only two alternatives. One alternative is to do nothing. That is the only real alternative to it. Wbat does that imply? It means leaving tbe nations of South-East Asia completely exposed to intolerable pressure. It means resigning the whole position of Australia's security from the start. It means sacrificing tbe chances of goodwill and understanding with tbose still self governing powers. It means tbe limita1 tion of tbe development of peace and freedom in tbe area immediately adjacent to Australia without the slightest effort to prevent it from passing away from us. These are It means throwing over our ability to cooperate with tbe United States of America in the Pacific. These are weighty considerations. Are we to abandon all these, and are we to tell tbe United States that because of a specific statement that it has made in this treaty, we abandon all these things and throw tbem all aside? Is any responsible Government of Australia going to come to that position, because that is what tbe amendments foreshadowed by the Leader of the Opposition amount to ? Tbe right honourable gentleman went further tban that. He declared that there were no measures in this treaty to adopt a settlement of disputes by peaceful means. I do not know whether be has read tbe treaty. Is it not a fact that our I want to read tbe House ArticleI , which statesThe Parties undertake, as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, to settle any This international disputes in which they may be involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered, and to refrain in their international relations from the threat to say that it should bave, perhaps autoor use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations. This is a specific undertaking from the start, to endeavour to settle differences in the area by peaceful means. There is another alternative, and it is one which I tbink was implicit in what the Leader of tbe Opposition bad to say. Tbat alternative is that we can leave tbe onus of preserving the status quo-tb e peace of this area and tbe relations between nations of this area-to tbe United Nations. Though, of course, we in this Parliament and in this country support tbe United Nations, let us look at tbe facts of occurrences in tbe south Pacific and in tbe Pacific area in general over the last three or four years or a little longer, and let us make up our minds whether in fact the United Nations is capable of dealing, or has dealt, with this situation. bas tbe United Nations been against aggression? it with powers beyond those wbicb it really bas. Wasi t the United Nations which brought peace in Indo-Cbina? Wasi t tbe United Nations wbicb put an end to tbe war in Indo-Cbina? Of course not. Tbe fact that we subscribe to the United Nations, and that we are supporters of tbe United Nations, surely does not blind us to tbe fact that many of the great decisions taken in tbe world and many, if not most, of tbe arrangements made between tbe nations of the world in recent years, have proceeded by tbe ordinary processes of diplomacy, not in opposition to the United Nations, but certainly not initiated or produced by it. Tbis is the value of a treaty of this nature. It does nothing to denigrate the authority of tbe United Nations, but it does come to grips with tbe actual facts of what is happening in tbe world. Comparisons bave been drawn by tbe Leader of tbe Opposition to-night between this treaty, tbe North Atlantic Treaty and tbe ANZUS pact, but if any one will read tbe text of tbe three treaties and compare tbem, article by article, it is not the differences that strike one. It is the extraordinary similarities. It is very easy to say that we should bave had a different type of treaty. It is very easy matically, committed us to military action. The nations of South-East Asia are not tbe advanced, industrialized nations of Europe. Tbey are totally different. It is not possible to produce a treaty between a highly industrialized nation like tbe United States, a nation like Australia, a nation like New Zealand, and nations which are not industrialized at all, of sucb a binding nature as automatically to commit tbem. What enormous efforts would be required to produce a treaty of that nature! But tbe basic purposes of this treaty are tbe same as tbe basic purposes of tbe North Atlantic Treaty. Tbey are very similar to the basic purposes of tbe ANZUS treaty, and the important thing-the will and the spirit that lies behind tbem-is identical. Wbat shield I -want to give tbe House several reason? which I tbink will incline us all to regard Do not let us credit this treaty as having real value. First of all, it creates a common climate of opinion among these nations of South East Asia, tbe United States and ourselves. We hear a great deal of talk these clays about colonialism and we know that tbe feeling among nations in Asia is that any interference by Western nations is a relic of tlie old type of colonialism. Wbat we really are opposing is not colonialism, but tyranny, and by coming together in this treaty with these nations, the first thing that we do is to create this common climate of opinion in independence one with another. Secondly, we create a feeling among tbe partners that tbey are independent and free and that at tbe same time tbey are not alone and unsupported, and that tbe independence of one is a matter of concern to tbe others, wbo are obliged to help that nation and defend it. Thirdly, we bring them a knowledge that tbere is a military strength behind this treaty, wbicb can be called on if necessary and at the same time cannot be thrust upon an unwilling partner. Fourthly, we bring to them-and it is expressed in tbe treaty-tb e knowledge that aid, both technical and economic, and, finally, political and military, is tbere for tbem to call on, because as honourable gentlemen will realize, none of this' can be thrust upon any partner to the treaty. It must be with the consent of that partner and the unanimous agreement of all the others. We bring this aid, not only against external aggression, but also against internal subversion, again not by thrusting it on any of those nations, but by consultation amongst all of tbe partners and at tbe request of the nation wbicb feels that its safety is slipping away from it by subterfuge or by attack from without or from within. By means of this treaty, all of these things are made available to every one of tbe partners. bring tbem the hope of developing trade and commerce-because also, is referred to in tbe treatyand we give tbem some chance of raising tbeir living standards, and of improving their economic conditions by working together in partnership. things are implied or expressed in tbe treaty. partnership for doing all of these things, thereby creating strength and co-operation throughout tbe whole of this great area. Seventhly, I ask tbe House whether it -would bave been really a stronger treaty with a permanent military organizationit may well bave broken down in the attempt to secure that organizationwhat difficulties we might have encountered in the endeavour to secure it, and what compromises with efficiency may have to have been made? is essential that, if we are to bave military be the subject of further consultations behind tbe screen of tbe treaty itself. Eighthly, and finallv. if all of the partners work together to carry out this treaty and to help each otber, it may well invigorate tbe independence, increase, the freedom, and elevate tbe living standards of the peoples of the area, and create and build up, throughout all of these nations, a great store of goodwill, friendship ourselves, the United States, New Zealand, tbe United Kingdom and with each other. All of these things depend upon every signatory of the treaty carrying out the spirit of its obligations because, no matter what words are written into the treaty, if that spirit is lacking, we shall never get what we are looking for. Dr. Donald Cameron. -J Collective I believe that I have given to the House eight good reasons why tbe treaty, as it stands, and unmodified, is well worthy of support. I believe that it provides a tremendous opportunity for per-sistent and patient effort to amplify and to extend it; and its principles, throughout tbe whole of this area, and for Australia to build up an understanding between this country and tbe Asian countries, which is immensely important-a n understanding of their points of view, of tbeir constitutional processes, of their desires and of tbeir Fifthly, we progress towards independence and self-sufficiency. I believe that it may that, well promote tbe trade and commerce, and tbe general welfare and development, of those countries, in a way that nothing else could promote them.

Nothing is more important tban that we should create tbe fundamental idea of democracy in our dealings with these people, by exemplifying it in our actions with tbe individual is what counts, and that individual freedom and individual control of tbe processes apd organs of It government are far more iiiportant than the actual form of tbe orga is themselves. commitments, they should What is more important if that nations and people should realize t lat tbe objective of this treaty will be res lized in a full life for the individuals a i d that tbey should control tbe organs cf government and put them to tbe uses cf people, and not turn tbem around in tie manner in which tbey are turned aiound in tbe Communist States. It is necessary that effective military and understanding with conversations should be cone ucted behind the actual treaty. Let me refer now to another point that was qiade by the Leader of the Opposition thought it was a singular one. Tbe r iI lit honourable gentleman stated that no jommitments should be made until tbe Parliament authorized tbem. I ask tbe right honourable gentleman, and I ask >ther bonorable members, whether tqere is any British government anywhere in the world, the executive authority of which is so circumscribed that it can make no dispositions of its forces without the consent of Parliament. Are we to be told that the Australian Government is to have its executive authority so confined that, in tbe interests of Australia's security, it is not to be free to make dispositions of our forces without referring the matter to the Parliament ? Wbat sort of effective military aid can we bring to any of our partners if we are bound in that way? Is tbe right bonorable gentleman really serious when be makes that suggestion? Does be imagine for a moment that we should say to tbe United States of America-h e seems to be worried that we are becoming a satellite of that nation"" We tbink this is a very good treaty. We like tbe idea of having you as a partner. We hope that you are prepared to do sometbing if military necessity calls for it, but we will make no commitments whatever until tbe Parliament of the day ratifies tbem ?"" Is any really effective military strength to be built on sucb foundations as that? Mr J. R, PHASER -That is exactly tbe opinion that is held by tbe United States Government itself. The same position applies in the United States. mind tbe honourable gentleman of the fact that tbe United States executive-no t tbe United States Government decides where United States forces shall be disposed throughout the world. Not only does it do that, but it also sends United States national service trainees where it wishes to. consent of Congress. we have a government with executive power to make dispositions and to take some steps-no t complete steps-to consult with our allies in relation to tbe treaty, or we wipe out the treaty altogether. Unless we are prepared to play our part, nobody else will be bothered with us. I submit that it is contrary to the spirit of Australia to suggest that we should say to our allies in a serious situaspheres of trade, policy and mutual relation, "" We agree with what yon are doing. but we will not commit ourselves until you bave committed yourselves "". Tbat, in effect, is what tbe right bonorable gentleman suggested we should do. I do not tbink that it is necessary to say a great deal more about tbe treaty. Its main strength is the goodwill and the spirit that lie behind it. I believe that, no matter how we may try to alter tbe wording, we shall not get a better expression of that spirit. The country owes a debt of gratitude to tbe Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) for bis handling of tbe conference at Manila. I believe, as I stated earlier, that we live in a totally different world from tbe world in which we lived a few years ago and that, if we are going to be so timorous 'that we will not allow ourselves to be even half committed with otber nations in tbe defence of freedom-becaus e that is what we are really doing-w e do not deserve to bave any consideration from' tbose whom we hope will be our allies. I wish to read to the House two statements that were made recently about circumstances sucb as these. The first statement, which was made by Sir Anthony Eden, is as follows:It is not merely a military issue or a military challenge Talking of tbe danger to tbe free worldit is a challenge in respect of a way of life. I remind tbe Leader of the Opposition that that is what this treaty is concerned witha challenge to a way of life. Of course, we should have these recitals about communism at the commencement of tbe bill. Tbat is what we are talking about. That is what tbe treaty is for. Tbat is what all the defences of Australia are designed to defend Australia against, because that is the only real threat in the world to any one's peace and security. The second statement was. one made by Mr Poster Dulles. He declaredWe should bear in mind that the problem is not merely one of deterring open-armed aggression, but of preventing Communist sub-, version which, taking advantage of economic dislocations and social injustice, might weaken and finally overthrow the non-Communist governments. Tbat is why this treaty has in it the great hope that, by co-operation in all of tbe tion !, we win do a great deal to develop 1",52,Defence Treaty Bill 1954 Second Reading

It is remarkable 'just how sensitive some Government supporters become wben an analysis is made of this kind of legislation and wben it cuts across some of tbeir ideas of a distinctly political nature, wbicb tbey seek constantly to capitalize, and wbicb are totally irrelevant to a consideration of this bill. It is remarkable that tbe preamble to the bill should be worded in the manner in which it is worded, because, according to reports that bave been received, it was tbe Minister for External Affairs( Mr of East Asia that are not signatories to tbe Casey) wbo caused tbe very word "" Communist "" to be omitted from the treaty. gentleman deny that statement, if it is so, he certainly should state to the Parnot true.

I ask ti e Minister why the protocol bas not been put into the legislation. It has been admitted that a protocol was agreed up an by tbe eight nations about tbe area where the first obligation for intervenion was to be assumed. The protocol dealt with Cambodia, Laos and Viet Nam, and tbe Minister has stated that it is not in tbe text of tbe legislation.

Assistance of that kind will no doubt go a long way to counter any of the pernicious influence that communism may seek to exert upon the people of those States. However, sucb assistance is belated. Tbe aid should bave been given wben the ""Western Powers had a more ilirect influence on tbe lives and well-being warning bas been given ;hat any infringeof tbe people of tbose States. The world now is threatened with the whirlwind of wrong and wilful policies. Tbe Leader of tbe Opposition, wbo made an excellent analysis of this legislation and to whom the House is indebted, has made out a strong case for tbe insertion in this treaty of the safeguards be bas mentioned in respect of any obligation wbicb Australia may be required to accept. I submit that any commitment accepted by Australia should be accepted by the other signatories to the treaty, particularly tlie major powers. This Parliament should nlso be consulted about the participation of Australian troops in any military enterprise undertaken in accordance with tbe provisions of this treaty. Tbe House should be given assurances about tbe security of Australia, and any intervention which we may be required to make in the terms of this treaty. vising to support this bill, I bave a feeling of diffidence, because the matter of Australia's role in foreign affairs has been discusfed in this chamber many times in past years, and there must be many honourable members on both sides of the House who are familiar with the background of this treaty. ""We are indeed most fortunate to have the present Minister for External Affairs( Mr under this treaty, with the Western Casey) in office at this critical, time in the history of our country. No man in Australia has had of experience in diplomacy as he bas, and few men can approach his profound knowledge of Asian aff lirs, our first official diploma ; when he took up an appointment in .Loidon as a liaison officer in 1924. He wis tbe first Australian Minister to the United States of America wben that diplomatic post was created in 1939. ""We a-e signally fortunate that the ANZUS pact and South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty, which form the cornerstone o a new uational ; foreign policy for Austialia, should bave been negotiated under bis guidance. Tbe paramount advantage of this treaty, in my opinion, is that a line of demarcation is drawn between tbe free countries of South-Eait Asia and the Communist countries of Asia, and a clear ment of that line by tbe Communists will result in a major conflict. Since tbe likely aggressor would be Communistdominated China, and >ince tbe Chinese are notoriously an intensely practical and realistic people, I consider that the dangers of outright aggression are almost, if not entirely, removed by this treaty. A secondary advantage of this treaty is that it brings together a group of nations at different stagBs of development on a common plane. Tl Le Asian countries aud tbe ""Western countries alike stand to gain a great deal from round table discussions, where plans w: 11 be made for tbe future, and for mutuali defence arrangements. We in. tbe West stand to gain from a free exchange of views with tbe Eastern countries, and tbey in their turn will have 'tbeir status enhanced in tbe eyes of Asia generally as this treaty progresses* and as Asia sees bow successful it is. A great deal bas been beard, especially from India, about the disadvantages of the treaty. It is claimed that the treaty is weak because it embraces only three countries in South-East Asia, but I feel that this is only a temporary weakness, and that, as tbe treaty demonstrates its usefulness, other nations will become participants. India is also hurt, because the Asian members have allied themselves,",57,Defence Treaty Bill 1954 Second Reading
160,Mr Allan (Gwydir) [9.34],"I ndemocracies, and thus destroyed the chances of forming a powerful all-Asian neutral bloc. I sympathize greatly with India, and Indian sentiment. I worked for seven years with Asian and Pacific peoples and have had some experience of the pressures which existed under colonial rule. I can understand that when those pressures are freed, there should be a temporary boil-over of national pride, and a feeling of independence. I believe that while this phase is only temporary, these conditions must make diplomacy with Asian countries extremely difficult. Tbey are passing through a peculiar psychological phase. It is natural, and as I bave said, I believe it is only temporary. I do not consider that India's case for an all-Asian bloc would stand up tu examination for tbe simple reason that an Asian bloc would be far too weak to exist in tbe midst of' tbe strong pressures in tbe world to-day from expansionist communism. The formation of sucb an Asian bloc would also tend to exaggerate tbe wide differences that exist between the Asian standard of life, and tbe Western standards. The only practical arrangement is tbe treaty which preserves the integrity of tbe junior Asian countries. Tbey must undergo tbeir period of cadetship. Tbeir colonial status is left behind tbem, but they must pass through a period of cadetship before they become stable and fullyfledged democracies. There is a point in this bill arising from tbe form of aggression that we may expect, that is to say, subversion. It bas been found in tbe past that American aid to Europe and Asia, whilst it bas prevented tbe outbreak of hostilities, has created a great deal of ill-will in the countries that received it. Therefore, T suggest to the Government that tbe matter of granting aid to tbe countries of Asia which are threatened by communism, should be carefully considered in that light. We must not give the assistance in such a way that it appears to be patronage or charity, or implies that tbose countries are subservient to tbe West. After all, we want to win friends in tbose countries. If we can make it plain to the leaders, businessmen and as great a number of tbe people as possible that their personal interests lie in tbe Western way of life, then our aid will have been successful. Finally, I wish to reiterate that this is a battle for men's minds, and that tbe pattern of self-interest will be far more vital than tbe attraction of ideologies. If we maintain a clear conception of what we are fighting and what we are fighting for, and if we give this treaty all tbe support that it should bave, then I bave no doubt that it will be successful, and that, as it succeeds, so it will draw in otber nations wbicb bave so far abstained from participating in it. We may be sure that the eyes of Asia will be watching closely to see bow this treaty does succeed. broad terms, this bill wbicb approves the ratification of tbe South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty is a declaration of a group of eight countries that the limits of Communist expansion and aggression in iSouth-East Asia have been reached. Against the rapidly changing panorama of tbe Pacific scene, tbe treaty is desirable, but, unfortunately, there are certain overall factors that considerably weaken it. In my opinion, the great defect of tbe whole treaty is the absence of India as a participant. Whether we like it or not, India's absence from the alliance to promote tbe security and well-being of Asia is a basic weakness of tbe treaty, and tbe honeyed words of members of tbe Government that India may later see its way clear to become a signatory do not get away from the fact that the non-participation of India is to be greatly deplored. Apparently, India and other Colombo plan countries, sucb as Indonesia, Burma and Ceylon, are of tbe opinion that a military pact with the West is not the best method of insuring against the spread of communism in Asia. Tbat view bas to be respected. We may not necessarily agree with it, but we have to respect i i . We must also remember that Seato, without Asian participation, will be twisted by Communist propaganda in Peking. By Asian participation, I mean tbe participation of Asian countries of consequence, not two or three comparatively small countries, but the major Asian countries such as India and Indonesia.",59,Defence Treaty Bill 1954 Second Reading
161,Mr Bird (Batman) [9.43],"I nI t is quite conceivable that tbe Communists in red Cbina will take advantage of the absence of tbose countries from the treaty, and that tbe masses in Asia will be deluged with propaganda to tbe effect that whilst the parties to tbe treaty seek to protect Asia against communism, tbe main Asian countries bave refused to be parties to it. It is imperative that we seek tbe understanding and goodwill of tbose countries which have not joined the treaty, and that they should be treated sympathetically. Their viewpoint should be sought. We should not indulge in ill External Affairs went to Manila with a timed criticism of them, wbicb could bave serious adverse effects. I welcome this treaty, but, at the same time, I recognize that the problem of Communist aggression in Asia will continue. Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) first indicated that it was Australia's intention to become a party to this agreement, he stated in unequivocal terms what tbe treaty portended; but it is obvious from speeches which tbe right honourable gentleman bas made since, and also from the remarks of tbe Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) as well as from a perusal of tbe bill itself, that the intenterms' as tbe framework for subsequent tions that were originally announced by tbe Prime Minister bave been considerably watered down. The provisions of the treaty are general rather than specific. Certainly, tbey are more general than the Prime Mmister would bave led us to believe in the statement that be made on the subject about three months ago. A perusal of tbe treaty indicates, for example, that tbe parties to it are not automatically bound to lend military aid although sucb aid is envisaged as something in reserve. I support this deviation from tbe .original intention, because sucb a provision gives to tbe Government the right to determine, in tbe light of the circumstances, whether it shall lend military aid. Article IV., which is tbe operative article of tbe treaty, bas been made the kernel of this debate. Tbat article has been dealt with by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) and the bonorable member for Sturt( Mr tbe major Asian countries, with emphasis Makin). Under Article IV., the signatories intimate that they will automatically consult with each otber with a view to resisting aggression by common Mr Bird. action. It is obvious that all tbe parties were not prepared to go further tban is indicated in that article. Great Britain, for instance, was not prepared to do so. It also appears that a number of these nations are not as enthusiastic about the provision of military aid as are supporters of this Government. I emphasize that this treaty is not the end of our worries so far as Asia is concerned. It is tbe result of compromise. Apparently, tbe Minister for certain set of ideas conforming to tbose that were set forth by tbe Prime Minister in tbe statement to wbicb I bave already referred, but it is evident that tbose ideas were not palatable to a number of tbe signatories. Tbe ideas enunciated by Some months ago, when tbe tbe Government some time ago bave not been embodied in tbe treaty. Tbe treaty in both its military and economic aspects must be regarded as being little more tban a starting point. Whether it. will lead us in a direction that will be beneficial or deleterious to Australia is a matter for conjecture. Summed up, tbe treaty appears to be a statement of action to provide effective defence of tbe parties to it and co-operation among tbem for tbeir economic benefit. Under it, the eight nations will look to tbeir own military strength, and in tbe event of aggression will take counsel together as to bow that strength shall be employed. But unfortunately, tbe treaty, which has been sponsored by tbe Western nations, does not include tbe major Asian countries. Tbat is its greatest defect because its value is definitely limited by reason of tbe absence of those countries. Tbe offer of assistance to countries wbicb may become victims of aggression and make a request for aid might, eventually, lead to larger membership. 1 trust that we shall not bave to wait for tbe occurrence of aggression in order to attain that objective. If tbe object of tbe treaty is presented in. its proper light to upon tbe advantages that may be gained through membership, some of tbose countries may be induced to -become parties to it. In tbe view of many people the provision of economic aid as a mean's of strengthening defences against communism is at least as important as are military commitments. I make that statement unequivocally. Under this treaty, the military commitments of the eight member nations have still to be denned. So far, tbose obligations bave been set out only in vague form. However, it should be possible for the eight nations to define more explicitly their obligations under Article III . wbicb deals with economic measures that are to be taken. Indeed, tbey must do so if tbey really desire to induce other Asian nations to become parties to tbe treaty. Tbe provisions of Article III . would be much more likely to appeal to tbose countries than would Article IV . Article III . providesThe Parties undertake to strengthen their free institutions and to co-operate with one another in tlie development of economic measures, including technical assistance, designed bent on securing urgent military commitboth to promote economic progress and social well-being and to further the individual and collective efforts of Governments toward these ends. I hope that tbe Government will not merely regard that obligation with sophistry. Yet, tbe Minister practically discarded that provision as being of little account. I regard tbe provision of economic assistance under the treaty to countries wbicb ask for aid as being just as important as tbe provision of military assistance. However, tbe Minister contented himself by making a few airy statements about the economic provisions of tbe treaty and said, in effect, that tbere are a number of problems associated with such measures. I admit tbe existence of such problems, but I believe that if we cannot solve them we might just as well immediately reconcile ourselves to tbe view that Asia, ultimately, will be overrun by communism. I thought that tbe Minister would bave devoted more attention to tbe economic aspects of tbe treaty. member recommend that economic aid be provided to all Asian countries, or only to tbose countries wbicb are parties to the treaty? which are parties to tbe treaty. But it would be a good thing if tbe eight nations demonstrated tbeir goodwill toward Asian countries as a whole. If that were done, possibly tbose Asian countries wbicb are not parties to tbe agreement would be anxious to become parties to it. Such action would stimulate interest in tbe treaty in tbose Asian countries wbicb at present can see no advantage to be gained by tbem by joining tbe treaty. Our aim in the fight against communism should not be to wage that fight solely by tbe provision of colossal armed force. If we tbink we can convince tbe Asian people in that way, we bave another tbink coming. Our aim should be to convince tbem that the treaty, apart from any military pledges that it might involve, offers sucb advantages from an economic point of view that it would be in tbeir own interests to become parties to it. We should stress tbe element of co-operation rather tban appear as panicky advocates ments. The principle of giving economic aid to Asian countries that is envisaged in Article III . of tbe treaty was laid down in tbe Colombo plan. Since that plan was initiated this Parliament bas, annually, and rightly, increased its contribution under it. By and large, the plan bas been reasonably successful although certain problems bave arisen to retard tbe economic progress of the countries to which aid is being supplied. The principle of economic assistance is re-stated in this treaty, but I suggest that Article III . , wbicb deals with that aspect, is too vague. All it does is to utter a few platitudes about providing mutual help to promote economic well-being. It leaves to tbe future tbe formation of anti-Communist programmes in tbe economic and social fields. I cannot understand why tbe Government does not realize tbe importance of tbe economic provisions of tbe treaty. Military strength is imperative. Nevertheless, economic measures bave acquired great importance. Any military alliance, regardless of its scope, cannot, by itself, ensure the containment of communism within its present boundaries. For that purpose, more than military alliances are required. If communism is to be contained within its present boundaries in Asia we must do more tban prepare ourselves to fight another world war.",60,Defence Treaty Bill 1954 Second Reading
162,Mr Hayleit,"""Would tbe honourable",62,Defence Treaty Bill 1954 Second Reading
163,Mr Bird,"Only to tbose countriesWe must, at the same time, make more strenuous efforts to prove to the Asian peoples, who are still free of the tentacles of communism, that western democracy has more to offer to them than has communism. We must recognize that western arms alone will never save Asians from communism. the earliest opportunity in accordance with the terms of Article III. of the treaty, put forward a programme of practical help to the. three Asian countries which are parties to this agreement. Such a programme is an indispensable feature of any worthwhile treaty. There must be a realization on the part of the Western nations which are parties to the treaty that the fight against communism must be waged not only with defensive arms but also with economic weapons. Besides preparing to resist further military encroachments, we must ensure that communism does not gain converts within Asian countries wbicb are waging a war against poverty while trying to learn tbe technique of self-government. gramme of economic aid wbicb would make available badly needed resources of food and raw materials to ill-equipped areas may be no less potent than defensive pacts in counteracting communism. I regret that the Government is not seized of tbe importance of this phase of tbe treaty. While we are meditating on tbe grim menace of international communism, tbe existence of this treaty might give us some spiritual comfort. But we must realize that our continued security, ultimately, will depend upon the degree to which we succeed in removing tbe attractions of communism to Asian peoples. Asia's millions of empty stomachs will not be appeased by words that are uttered in this, or any other, Parliament, or by a mental picture of treaties of this kind that relegate economic measures to an inconspicuous background. Unfortunately, tbe Minister conveyed that impression about the treaty. He said that it is tbe intention of the Government to provide tbe sum of £250,000 each as aid to Laos, Cambodia, and South Viet Nam. With tbe greatest respect and goodwill towards tbe Minister for this charitable gesture, I submit that those amounts are woefully inadequate and are merely begging the question. Mr Bird. If the Government wants to do sometbing tangible, it should take action that will immediately tend to increase tbestandard of living of tbe peoples of tbe three countries I have mentioned, because such action will immediately start todissipate tbe attraction that communism Therefore, we should, at bas for tbem. Communism thrives on poverty and discontent, and, should theWestern nations prove that tbey are prepared to help these peoples in tbeir economic fight to raise tbeir standard of living,, they will achieve a practical step to save tbem from Communist aggression, to wbicb we all fear they will fall victims, possibly within two or three years. Tbe Minister urged us to approve of ArticleI l l , of tbe treaty, wbicb provides for economic assistance, but we are still going to give them assistance through tbe Colombo plan. WhilstI am prepared to concede that tbe plan bas splendid objectives, it is imperative that we should do sometbing more tban give mere lip service to it and tben airily brush it A proaside. We should analyse the progress that it bas made up to tbe present, because it is tbe counterpart of the economic aid that is envisaged under Article III . of tbe treaty, although, of course, it covers a far wider range. Article III . refers only to the three Asian nations with wbicb tbe treaty deals. If we ascertain tbe degree of assistance that bas been given to the Colombo plan countries, we can then assess the prospects of a successful programme of economic assistance under Article IL L Unfortunately, since the idea, of aid to Asian countries was promulgated in 1950, when tbe Colombo plan was thought out, tbere has been a subtle shift in national attitudes and expectations, wbicb has occurred under the impact of changing world conditions. Tbe Minister understands the situation probably better than anybody else in this House, because he attends the conferences of tbe plan's consultative committee each year. In fact, be has just returned from sucb a conference at Ottawa. He lightly scanned the problems arising from the change in bis second-reading speech, but he did not analyse them. I was astonished that he should treat tbe matter in this way. Surely he realizes that he should have devoted far more attention to methods of solving those problems, because it is Just as important to deal with them a3 it is to ensure tbe making of adequate military preparations under Article IV . -of the treaty. If we find that tbe Colombo plan has not been successful, our hopes of attracting people away from communism by giving tbem a higher .standard of living through Western aid will fade rapidly. Wbat is the situation in the Asian -countries that are receiving support under tbe Colombo plan? Tbeir national incomes are subject to extreme and -unpredictable fluctuations, and, because of such changes, the economic aid that bas been given to them already under the plan has been almost entirely dissipated. That is a fact that cannot be controverted by tbe Minister or anybody -else. It arises from factors that bave been beyond the control of tbe countries -concerned. However, unless we face up to that situation promptly and deal with it, all ideas of economic aid under this bill will be a complete waste of time. I shall explain tbe circumstances. Tbe -economies of the countries of South-East Asia are dominated by a few export commodities, wbicb are mainly raw materials. Since 1951, tbe prices of these commodities have nose dived. The price of rubber, for example, fell as much as 66 per cent, between 1951 and 1953. Tbe price of cotton decreased by 50 per cent., And the prices of raw jute and tin by over 40 per cent. At tbe same time, tbe prices of tbe commodities that they are compelled to import have fallen comparatively little. Because the tide of trade bas turned against tbose countries, tbe gulf between their living standard and the living standard of tbe Western worid has widened year by year, despite the money that has been poured in by tbe respective contributors to the Colombo plan. Therefore, tbere is an urgent need for positive action on tbe economic front immediately under tlie terms of the treaty with which tbe bill deals. Tbe Minister is aware of this need because, in bis second reading speech, be saidI t is of fundamental importance that the world prices for tlie major commodities prowould represent a signal advance towards duced in the area should not be allowed to fall below levels which allow a reasonable income-and a reasonably stable income-for their producers. This is a complicated and difficult problem and much study and inveRtigution will have to be carried out before workable solutions are likely to be found. I suggest that that is tbe first job to be tackled under tbe treaty. It is of such transcending importance in the whole scheme of our economic assistance for Asian countries that, if a solution is not found very soon, both tbe Colombo plan and tbe economic support envisaged under tbe treaty will not be worth a snap of tbe fingers. Unless we can find means of stabilizing the national incomes of the Colombo plan countries, the money that we are pouring into tbem will just be wasted. Tbeir population increases will more tban offset the investments that are being made in them by tbe contributing nations. The developments that have taken place as a result of the nose diving of export prices for rubber, cotton, raw jute and tin have all tended to strengthen the appeal of communism in Asia. The natives see, to their extreme mortification, that the much-vaunted Colombo plan is not raising tbeir living standards. Tbey do not understand the reason for its failure to do so. Tbey merely think ' that tbe contributing countries have fallen down on tbeir job. Tbey bave been waiting for a higher standard of living, but it bas not arrived because of tbe circumstances I have mentioned. Therefore, our first job should be to ensure that tbere shall be stable prices for tbe products of tbose countries. I suggest that the signatories to the treaty, together with tbe nations that have refused to enter into military commitments, sucb as India, Indonesia and Burma, should strive to devise ways and means, by international action, to give South and South-East Asia a greater measure of economic security. Sucb action would transform the situation in that area very quickly, because it would be a practical measure to improve the standard of living of that region. A price stabilization scheme for the major products of those countries tbe solution of tbe main problem, and nobody is more clearly aware of this fact than the Minister. Honourable members may ask, ""Wbat has this to do with tbe Manila treaty?"" My reply is that it bas everything to do with tbe treaty because, unless we can raise tbe standard of living in Asia, Article III . of tbe treaty will be doomed to failure from the word ""go"". Tbere is great force in tbe contention that the best way to save tbe peoples of South-East Asia from communism in tbe long run is to use otber weapons than tanks, guns and bombs. I agree that military strength should be invoked to deter aggression. Tbat course is essential, and it should be carried out immediately under Article IV . of the treaty. However, to the peoples of Asia, particularly those wbo do not come within the scope of tbe treaty, military measures seem to be at best a short-term device to deal with problems that require long-term treatment. Must we, there for, accept as final the decision of India, Indonesia and otber nations to remain outside tbe security structure which otber nations are trying to build around their borders? My answer to that question is "" No "". The best method of bringing tbose countries into the scheme is to show a practical interest in tbe economic welfare of South and South-East Asia as is envisaged in Article III . of the treaty. We must not regard tbe hostility of those countries to participation in the agreement as unalterable. try to change their point of view, and, if it can be shown that tbe treaty offers practical benefits, on the lines of those offered by the larger Colombo Plan, of technical services in many fields without strings attached, would not a renewed effort to reduce Asian reluctance be worthwhile on the part of this Government and tbe governments of otber countries that are parties to tbe agreement? Sincere efforts and good faith on our side might lead the important Asian countries to modify tbeir attitudes to the agreement in time. may be tbe practical difficulties of Asian and Western co-operation to strengthen tbe defences against conununism in Asia, tbe financial-economic aspects of tbe plan Mr Bird. call for patient examination equally with tbe problems of military planning.. Therefore, whilst I agree that tbe treaty is unavoidable and deserves our military support, I maintain that tbe Government is not sufficiently seized of tbe importance of the economic aspect of the plan and of the need to bring into tbe pact tbose countries which, because tbeir absence is a source of great weakness, we should endeavour to include in the arrangement. The economic requirements of tbe treaty must not be side-stepped. If tbe Government will take a lead in this matter, I vouchsafe tbe prophecy that, within three years we shall bave within the framework of tbe organization those countries which up to the present have been strangely reluctant to enter into tbe treaty. They would hasten to join in tbe agreement, because they would see in it some chance of helping to improve the standard of living of tbe downtrodden masses of tbe peoples whom we are attempting to help. honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird) bas stated some truths and facts with which I substantially agree, but I disagree wholeheartedly with the perspective and emphasis with wbicb be has presented tbem. I do not tbink anybody in this Parliament-certainl y nobody on this side of tbe House-woul d disagree with the concept that tbe best way to combat communism in the long run is to raise tbe standards of living and tbe comfort of tbe huge, under-privileged We should populations of South and South-tEast Asia. Surely everybody agrees with that. I should not have thought that tbere would be any sort of argument on that score. However, that cannot be done in a few minutes, a few weeks, or even a few years. It is a long process to educate tbose people to modern conceptions of economic development, to teach tbem technical systems, to enable tbem to live under better conditions, and to give tbem the better education that will enable them to do so. It takes a long time to develop a better standard of living in any country. Whatever Wbat we are concerned with in this bill is a treaty to deal with a situation wbicb may arise to-morrow, next week or next year. Tbis is essentially a military alliance. The fact that economic aid",62,Defence Treaty Bill 1954 Second Reading
164,Mr Bostock (Indi) [10.10],"Tb efinds a place in the treaty is proof that the Government is not unaware of its great importance. Therefore, the suggestion by the honourable member for Batman that the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) just waved aside the conception of combating communism by raising living standards is so much nonsense. The truth is that it was this Government which promoted Australia's participation in the Colombo plan. It is this Government which has increased Australia's contribution to the plan from year to year since its inception in 1950. Everything points to the fact that this Government is keenly conscious indeed of the economic and technical aid aspects of the fight to combat communism in South and South-East Asia. Tbe bonorable member for Batman also That is not true, because neither the deplored tbe absence of certain Asian Dutch nor tbe Indonesians are parties countries as participants in tbe treaty. to this treaty.

In substantiation of that idea, tbe right bonorable gentleman drtw an extraordinary picture of some other possible aggression in South-East Asia. No one can conceive any possible aggression in South-East Asia in the foreseeable future except Communist aggression, and therefore it is right and proper that the preamble of tbe bill should point out that our potential enemy is international communism and no one else. In extremis, as it were, tbe Leader of tbe Opposition put tbe proposition that we may be faced with aggression by Indonesia against Dutch New Guinea, and he stated categorically that under tbe terms of this treaty Australia will be committed to take part in repelling that aggression even if it be not Communist aggression.

168,Mr Bostock,"Everythin g that 1out, in the first place, that nothing can be brought before this Parliament without it being made public. ""What the Leader of the Opposition said, in effect, was that if we went to the aid of any country threatened by Oommunist aggression we should, before we had made our contribution, hand to the Communist aggressors on a plate foreknowledge of the aid that we were to render. The honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron) stated that in the United Kingdom the Executive is not responsible to the Parliament for the disposition of troops. Labour governments in Australia have followed that precept and time and again in peace-time have disposed naval forces outside Australian waters without reference to the Parliament. This Government, rightly, disposed air forces outside Australia without reference to the Parliament. There is no reason in the world why, if the conditions under which our servicemen are enlisted permit them to serve overseas and conditions warrant their utilization outside Australia, the Executive should not send them overseas without reference to the Parliament.

We planning, but it makes no provision for all are concerned with tbe defence of military commitments prior to tbe actual Australia, and it ill becomes Opposition commission of an act of aggression, members to turn debates such as this therefore, although tbe military planning into party wrangling matches. I consider it to be my duty to amplify some of tbe statements that tbe Leader of tbe Opposition made in reviewing the effectiveness of tbe United Nations organization. He implied that though this treaty is within the scope of the United Nations it is of no advantage, and that the United Nations could deal with the problem of aggression in South-East Asia, because, presumably under bis direction, recognizing tbe dangers of tbe veto, the United Nations had made it possible for the General Assembly, in certain circumstances, to deal with questions of aggression. Although that may be technically true, tbe occasion does not often arise. When it does arise, the process is lengthy. Tbe Communists bave adopted delaying tactics and have exercised tbeir veto on 70 or 80 occasions in tbe discussions of the Security Council of the United Nations. If a proposal for action against aggression must be submitted to tbose processes, and finally must go to tbe General Assembly for further discussion, any action will be very much prejudiced by tbe delays that must inevitably occur. Furthermore, tbe United Nations organization, to which we all subscribe, is subject to other limiting factors that are not compatible with Australia's particular conditions. For example, the' United Nations bas no machinery for preliminary planning. I emphasize that it is tbe duty of this Government to be prepared for an emergency within a few weeks or a few term consideration. Therefore, if any contribution that we might make against aggression is to be effective, we must bave our plans to resist possible aggression prepared in co-operation with tbe otber countries concerned. Tbe United Nations has no machinery for tbe making of tbose preparations. It is true that Australia is a party tp can take place as a sort of phantom plan,",66,Defence Treaty Bill 1954 Second Reading

172,Mr Bostock,"It answers tbeno concrete arrangements can be made, because none of the nations concerned can know what military forces will be available to give effect to any plan that might be prepared beforehand. Tbe ANZUS pact suffers also from tbe disability that it is limited in scope. For example, tbe United Kingdom, wbicb bas important interests in Singapore, Malaya and elsewhere in South-East Asia, is not a party to it. The sole signatories are tbe United States of America, Australia and New Zealand. Therefore, that pact does not meet all the immediate requirements of Australia for a collective security arrangehonorable member for Batman, this treaty ment. The South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty, to a degree, remedies those defects. The United Kingdom is a party to this treaty, as are other nations, member believe in flying saucers? including the United States that have interests in South and South-East Asia. The Leader of tbe Opposition expressed doubt whether the reservation made by tbe United States before signing tbe treaty did not in fact completely nullify its value for tbe defence of Australia. Tbat statement is complete and utter rubbish. It can be answered completely by reference to tbe ANZUS pact, to which the United States is a party, and under which it is definitely committed to come to tbe aid of Australia if we are directly attacked. That settles one aspect of tbe right bonorable gentleman's statement. reservation of the United States is not intended to i-elieve it of its commitments. The reservation was made, as tbe Minister for External Affairs pointed out in his second-reading speech, because tbe United States does not have sovereign rights over any territory in tbe South-East Asia area. It bas military bases on some islands that were formerly under the sovereignty of Japan but, in tbe accepted sense of tbe word, it does not have sovereignty over any territory in South-East Asia. I suggest that, for political reasons, in order to ensure that the United States Congress shall approve the treaty, it would be desirable for the United States Government to describe tbe treaty as a pact designed to secure tbe United States against communism, because tbe United State Government realizes that tbe development of international communism, wherever it may occur in tbe world, is a threat to the United States. I firmly regard this treaty as not distinct from tbe otber treaties to which Australia is a party. It is not contradictory of. tbe United Nations Charter or the ANZUS pact. It is complementary to tbe charter and to that pact, and it completes Australia's collective security arrangements in such a way as to meet the requirements of the peculiar situation in which we in this part of tbe world find ourselves. Contrary to the statements made by tbe emphatically provides for economic aid. member bas not bothered to read tbe bill, I shall read an important part of it to the House for bis benefit. For what it is worth, tbe article that provides for economic aid takes precedence in the treaty over tbe article in relation to military aid. Article III . , which makes provision for economic aid, statesThe Parties undertake to strengthen their free institutions and to cooperate with one another in the further development of economic measures, including technical assistance, designed both to promote economic progress and social well-being and to further the individual and collective efforts of governI n addition, the ments towards these ends. Tbat is a quite definite and clear undertaking. Another criticism that was levelled against the treaty, again by the bonorable member for Batman, was that it did not provide for any automatic commitment of troops to come to our aid, or to the aid of any otber party to tbe treaty. Such provision is never included in any treaty. Article V. of the Nato pact is in more nebulous terms, if we care to use those words, tban Article IV'. of the Manila Treaty, but, under the terms of Article V. of the Nato pact, tbere are hundreds of thousands of troops in Europe. Tbere can be no question that tbe provision of military aid is perfectly clear and definite. It is undesirable, and impossible, to specify, in tbe body of a treaty, tbe particular degree of military assistance that can be given. Sucb assistance can be",67,Defence Treaty Bill 1954 Second Reading

The treaty provides for the formation of a council to"" review the situation in South-East Asia, to determine what aggression is likely to take place, and from which quarter, to plan defensive forces to meet that probable aggression, and to allot to each of the the Navy( Mr Francis), or the nations that are parties to the treaty its share of the provision of"" the necessary forces. It is only at that stage that the allotment of forces can usefully be made. To think that there can he written into the body of the treaty provision that Australia shall provide so many battalions or divisions of troops, so many groups of air force personnel and equipment, and so many ships, is nothing short of puerile. The degree of military force that is necessary can be assessed only after an appreciation has been made in tbe light of current circumstances. Tbat is why provision for automatic commitment is not written into tbe treaty. I again express tbe sincere hope that we can develop this idea of collective security in South Asia and South-East Asia, and I hope that sucb nations as India, Indonesia and Ceylon will deem it fit to join in this collective security against the only menace that exists in this area-the menace of imperial communism. The treaty represents tbe greatest step forward that Australia bas made during tbe whole of its history, to safeguard its security. It is an international act that is very likely to promote tbe peace in the world or, at any rate, in the South Pacific area in which we live.

On a number of occasions, I bave endeavoured to direct attention to what I regard as a very serious position in relation to tbe Royal Australian Navy, and tbe discontent that exists because of tbe failure of tbe Minister for Government, to take appropriate action to bave it corrected. Apparently, the Navy bas its own peculiar methods of administering justice, but they are methods that no bonorable member, and certainly no democratic Australian citizen, ought to accept or allow to remain in existence. To demonstrate my point, I shall refer to tbe case of an ex-member of the Navy wbo, after thirteen years' satisfactory service, a great deal of wbicb was during World War IL , was practically drummed out of tbe Navy without having been charged, without having been found guilty of any offence, and against bis own personal wishes. Tbis man was a chief petty officer. He joined tbe Navy in March, 1937. He was promoted to tbe rank of petty officer in 1942, and to the rank of chief petty officer in 1950. All of tbe periodic records in relation to his service showed bim to be a satisfactory member of tbe service. I shall now outline the circumstances that brought about bis dismissal. He was a member of. the crew of HMAS. Australia. He was given a permit to bring furniture from Melbourne aboard the vessel. When tbe vessel arrived in Sydney, he was given a permit to take bis furniture ashore, and to transport it on a Commonwealth truck. adjourned. As tbe truck was leaving the naval establishment at Garden Island, it was stopped at the gateway by tbe dockyard police, wbo discovered that it also carried three bags wbicb contained five dozen bottles of spirituous liquors and wines. Tbere was another member of tbe Navy on tbe lorry. Both of tbem were questioned by tbe captain of tbe vessel, and tbey were asked whether tbey were willing to submit themselves to summary punishment by bim. Tbey both declared tbeir innocence and demanded trial by court martial. Tbe second man to whom I referred was acquitted by the court martial, because",68,Defence Treaty Bill 1954 Second Reading

177,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [10.35],"it was disclosed at the trial that the truck would not impair bis opportunities of carried 43 dozen bottles of beer in addition to tbe three bags that were mentioned in tbe charge, and that tbose bottles belonged to an officer wbo bad obtained a pass to take tbem through the gateway. No evidence was offered that any beer or spirits bad been stolen from tbe canteen aboard HMAS. Australia. Tbe charges against tbe first mentioned rating were then not proceeded with and were withdrawn. Actually, no charge was made against bim at all. Tbe next he beard of the matter was wben he received a notice that he was to be given bis discharge marked "" Services no longer required "". Tbe then Minister for tbe Navy stated, in correspondence that I received from him, that tbe man to whom I bave just referred was involved in a previous charge in 1945, as a result of wbicb be was demoted. But, tbe Minister failed to point out that be was restored to his former rank shortly afterwards because it was recognized, apparently, that be bad taken the blame for another person and that be bad refused to divulge the name of tbe person wbo was guilty of the offence. Tbe man who was guilty of that offence is now retired from tbe service, and expressed a willingness to come forward and state that he was the person who was guilty of that offence. However, according to tbe Navy, once it bas spoken, tbere can be no change, and tbere can be no variation or reconsideration of tbe penalty imposed. But the Minister raised that offence-doubtles s on tbe advice of tbe Naval Board-as justification of tbe attitude that it adopted. If we assume tbe worse from tbe point of view of this man, and assume that he was guilty on that earlier occasion, surely he ought not to be placed outside the service years afterwards because of a charge that tbe naval authorities failed to substantiate they actually withdrew. After thirteen years' service, this man is anxious to bave a satisfactory discbarge, because it is not of much use for bim to go to an employer with a discbarge that is marked "" Services no longer required"". The tben Minister bad the audacity to state that sucb a discbarge obtaining shore employment, because a discbarge that was marked "" Services no longer required"" could not be regarded as an unsatisfactory discbarge. Wbat a ridiculous attitude for tbe authorities to adopt! All that this man is asking is that tbe Department of the Navy, or tbe naval authorities, should prefer some charge against bim-it does not matter by what authority it is dealt with-to afford bim a hearing, and to let bim put forward a defence. Tbe naval authorities deny bim .that opportunity. Tbis man is admitted to bave been a very competent officer. It is no wonder that an bonorable member should have received 1 a certain reply from tbe Minister for the Navy only within tbe past few days in relation to the falling off of recruitment. The young men of Australia, as tbey become fully aware of one case of injustice after another in relation to the treatment of those men wbo do offer for service, are not showing any alacrity in responding to tbe appeal of tbe Government for recruits. I can furnish tbe Minister with tbe name of tbe particular person to whom I bave referred, but I do not tbink it is necessary to do so at this stage. Tbe Minister probably recollects tbe case. knows very well that this incident occurred before I became Minister for the Navy. that it happened during tbe occupancy of this portfolio by tbe present Minister. Tbe matter goes back beyond his time, but be bas access to the files. He is able to review these decisions. to get bis colleague, tbe former Minister and which for tbe Navy, to take some action, not only in relation to this particular case, but also to change tbe method that is employed by the naval authorities.

181,Mr Waed,"I bave tried repeatedlyopportunity to defend himself. To illustrate the efficiency of the man to whom I have referred, I shall refer to the statement of the officer who prosecuted the other rating concerned, and who would have been responsible for prosecuting this man if tbe court martial bad proceeded. The prosecuting officer wrote to the dismissed man's mother in tbe following terms:I am personally sorry that tlie R.A.N. had to lose a man of your sou's capacity and powers of leadership. This incident occurred at a time when the Government is anxious to bave recruits, and wben it is anxious to expand the services. Yet the Navy dismisses a man wbo, according to the officer wbo would have been called upon to prosecute him, showed great capacity and powers of leadership. The then Minister for the Navy made tbe following statement:The competency of C.P.O. Mentioning tbe man's name. . . as a seaman was not questioned by the Naval Board. His record in this respect is in fact very good. However the discipline of H.M. ships and establishments is dependent in a great measure on the manner in which Chief and Petty Officers carry out their duties and maintain their position of trust which they hold. Their duties and privileges demand the highest standards of personal loyalty, discipline and bearing. Any real departure from these high standards, is a factual demonstration of unsuitability for the rating of Chief Petty Officer. Tbere was never any question of this man's loyalty, of bis bearing, or of his conduct as a chief petty officer. No charge was ever preferred against this man to the effect that be was unsuitable for bis rating. Therefore, he must have been deemed by tbe Minister to bave been guilty of some offence with regard to personal loyalty, discipline or bearing, and tbe Minister and tbe Naval Board have found bim guilty without any charge being preferred and without any trial having been held. able member's time bas expired. [10.45] I desire to speak about a matter that has recently received some local publicity. I refer to the Canberra plan, but only one aspect of it. I understand that some investigation about tbe Canberra plan is proceeding at present, and I have no intention of canvassing tbe matter. However, I want to speak about it as it affects tbe Australian National University. Tbe university was originally designed to take advantage of a water frontage, and wben tbe plan was altered the design of tbe university had to be altered, and there had to be some re-planning in order to fit the university into tbe altered plan. The result of that is that piece-meal building is going on, and that, of course, affects tbe well-being of tbe institution. We may perhaps ask whether tbe site and buildings matter much to a university, and whether its surroundings bave any effect upon it. I believe that tbe answer to that question is "" Yes "". It is not true to say that academic institutions do good work irrespective of their buildings and surroundings. I believe that, in an academic institution, a great deal depends on tbe influences of beauty, design and form. One example of the influence of beauty of buildings and surroundings is the University of Cambridge. not say anything about tbe University of Oxford, with wbicb tbe honourable member for Angas( Mr Downer) is connected, but I shall limit my remarks to tbe Light Blues. I do not think that any one who has walked along tbe backs of Cambridge and seen tbe lovely buildings, beautiful surroundings and magnificent gardens, and bas noticed the atmosphere of beauty, serenity and peace that surrounds tbe university, can fail to bave been impressed. It was tbose surroundings that laid tbe foundations of tbe education that produced tbe poetry of Milton, and they are tbe borne of the amazing scientific discoveries that bave come from the Cavendish Laboratory. Tbe standards and values of our university similarly depend to a certain degree on the university's surroundings and scenery. Already, we have a not unpleasing vista from the university, and there are some quite famous names on tbe roll of the institution.

Tbey are both men of eminence and distinction. It may be asked whether this is a matter development in tbe future. for tbe Parliament. I believe that it is. The Parliament sends four of its members to represent it on tbe council of tbe university, and every year it votes a very large sum of money to the institution so that it may carry on its activities. In fact this Parliament established tbe Australian National University, and I therefore believe that we bave some responsibility to ensure that its surroundings are pleasant and effective. I hope that whatever plan is finally adopted, tbe university will not be surrounded by sucb things as race-courses. Of course, I bave not a rooted antipathy to race-courses, except in association with universities. I do not want to see sucb things as dog-racing with its public address systems and loud-speakers allowed to develop in close proximity to what should be the pinnacle of tbe Australian academic system. I hope that tbe House will take some notice of this matter, and use its influence to ensure that tbe Australian National University shall develop in dignity, peace and beautiful surroundings, as far as we are able to ensure tbeir preservation. not desire unnecessarily to take up tbe time of the House at this late hour, but my friend tbe honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron) bas raised a matter with which this House should most rightfully be concerned, and which should be deliberated upon to some small extent. I am not going to disagree with tbe honourable member merely because be was, if I may say so, perhaps a little unis that tbe bonorable member for Wills fortunate in referring to tbe university at Cambridge as one of bis criteria of aesthetic perfection. Let me say that the honourable member might have gone to an older institution as a source of bis inspiration. But tbe point is that tbe House should be grateful to tbe bonorable member for bringing to its notice, before the damage has been done, sometbing which may well be deleterious to our Australian National University and to tbe whole of Canberra. I say without fear R[97] of contradiction that tbe amenities of our national university bave to be improved, and it is the duty of this Parliament to see that nothing arises wbicb is likely to detract from tbeir healthy Many of us feel that aesthetically tbe university bas got off to a bad start. These things are to some degree a matter of taste, and I for one do not approve of tbe great majority of the university buildings that bave gone up. I tbink, as a matter of fact, that most of tbem are extremely ugly. Tbey are not good enough. Tbey lack dignity. Tbey are unbecoming for what all of us hope, irrespective of our divergencies on other matters, will be the form of tbe national university of this Commonwealth. Tbe suggestion'bas been put forward that tbe original idea of tbe lake is to be discarded, and in its place a trotting track or racecourse is to be introduced, is something that this Parliament should not allow. versity. ber for Watson( Mr Curtin) is noted in this House for bis unorthodoxy, and, occasionally, bis originality, but if one adopted the expedient that he suggests it would be extremely costly. Mr Bryson interjecting, against a race-course, or racing as sucb, but I suggest, particularly to tbe honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryson), wbo keeps interrupting in that booming voice that we know so well, that a racecourse is an obnoxious environment for students and post-graduate student *, at a 1 national university. All that I can think is anxious to see that tbe graduates at the university are invested with bad habits during the course of tbeir studies. Tbe whole purpose of tbe bonorable member for Oxley in bringing this matter forward is to show that tbe university should have good surroundings. If the race-course is established at Westlakei t will be obnoxious and unsuitable for students, and I hope that those suggestions will be knocked on tbe head before tbey proceed any further.",71,Australian Nationax University

189,Mr Downer,"L bave nothing at allagree to some extent with what has been said by tbe honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron) and tbe bonorable member for Angas( Mr Downer) about the Australian National University, but, to my way of thinking, the root of tbe matter is in the fact that members of tbe Parliament should be able to ask questions about tbe university and receive answers to tbose questions from the Government. I have taken some interest in tbe Australian National University for some time, and it appears to me that if an bonorable member asks a question of the Government be is told that tbe university is an academic matter, and that no responsibility rests on tbe Government to give any account of its stewardship. I believe that attitude to be completely wrong, and tbere are several obvious proofs that it is wrong. The bonorable member for Oxley and the honourable member for Angas have pointed out that we need tbe best possible buildings and amenities for tbe university. That is quite right, but honourable members of this House are responsible for tbe financing of tbose buildings and amenities and I am quite certain, having lived in this district for some time and having some knowledge of local matters, that a ludicrously large amount of money bas been very ill-spent on the construction of tbe buildings of the Australian National University. Until recently, wben tbe responsibility for the management of finance and tbe construction of buildings was put in otber hands, that situation was absolutely disgraceful. The Parliament should be kept informed of what goes on at the Australian National University, and should exercise some control over the expenditure of money on tbe institution. Now let me correct one or two ideas about the race-course. A race-course is not to be built opposite tbe university; it is already tbere. I am glad to say that I have visited it on various occasions, and I have done myself no more good on tbose occasions than you have done yourself, Mr Speaker. Let me hasten to assure bonorable members that tbe race-course is in no sense obnoxious. Indeed, it is a pleasant part of tbe countryside, and race meetings are held tbere very seldom. Therefore, as a norma] thing, tbe people of the district have the advantage of tbe open spaces of the race-course without having to put up with persons of tbe kind who normally inhabit race-courses. I was rather staggered to bear tbe bonorable member for Oxley, for whom I bave tbe greatest respect, say that because the university was to be built on tbe side of a lake, a lake should be provided. That certainly seems to be putting the cart before tbe borse. Tbe university is quite important, but Canberra is the National Capital, and it appears to me that otber considerations should come before the consideration of whether we should put a greater area under water simply for the purposes of tbe university. I am certain that you, Mr Speaker, will agree with me that if we put a lake in the heart of this placeI shall not call it a city-w e shall have in the winter mud, and in the summer mosquitos. Moreover, you, Mr Speaker, and tbose wbo sit in front of you who are enthusiastic fishermen, will obtain little advantage from increasing tbe water spaces of Canberra, because tbe water that will flow into tbe lakes from tbe rivers is likely to be very muddy. I am all in favour of providing all tbe amenities possible for those wbo work and live in the Australian National University. I hope to see it a seat of learning, I shall not say second only to Cambridge, but even better tban that. I hope that it will become a most worthy national university. At tbe same time, I cannot believe that we should provide it with a lake simply because some one years ago drew up a nice little plan with the idea that the university would look pleasant and attractive if it were reflected in the waters of tbe Molonglo River. have no intention of entering into a controversy with my colleagues on tbe relative architectural merits of Oxford or Cambridge; nor do I intend to discuss the needs of the Canberra University College or the post-graduate attendants at the Australian National University to study horse-racing from their windows. If they wished to study a few points on borse-racing, I could introduce tbem to",72,Australian Nationax University

However, I should think that tbey could study horse-raoing better elsewhere tban in tbe university. I do not understand the series of arguments that bave been entered into in the Canberra press recently about tbe relative merits of tbe grandstand of tbe race-course, or tbe university building wbicb fronts it. If an obvious attempt had not been made to disguise the front of tbe university buildservices are not dispensed with lightly by ing with something which looks from a distance like yellow tiles, it might even have been mistaken for a grandstand. It is not tbe most attractive kind of building which we could wish our university to have. However, I wish to put this point. This city of Canberra, tbe National Capital of Australia, was planned as a very fine conception, and an essential part of tbe conception was that it was a city built round lakes. Now, it is an undoubted fact that any group of people who are living together in a place get certain interests of their own in tbe future development of that place, and I have no doubt that tbe people interested in tbe race-course are very interested in seeing that no lake is ever allowed to swell there; and similarly, tbe people who are interested in the Canberra golf course have an equal interest in seeing that no lake shall cover tbeir greens and fairways. But tbe people of Australia, who look to this city as tbe proper and fitting capital of tbe country, have no voice ready and on the spot to claim that the original fine concept of this city should be carried out. I sincerely hope that the whole plan will be examined again before final decisions are made, and that tbe original concept of a city, built round lakes, will be adhered to. I am sorry in this matter to find myself in disagreement with my friend, tbe honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett), but after all, he is a countryman and he has been a distinguished soldier; and it is notorious that soldiers bave a rooted carry beer and spirits on which excise objection to water in any form. I seriously suggest to tbe House that bis views on this matter should be completely disregarded. I now wish to refer to tbe matter raised by tbe bonorable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) about dispensing with the services of a chief petty officer of the Royal Australian Navy with thirteen years' service. I bave no knowledge of tbe circumstances of the particular case to wbicb be has referred, but I bave some knowledge of the background, which he obviously bas not. In the first place, a chief petty officer with thirteen years' service is of great value to the Navy and the country, and bis tbe senior naval authorities. A chief petty officer is recognized as a person of great value, and great efforts are made to retain tbe services of men with that experience. Tbe former Minister for tbe Navy, in an earlier reply to tbe bonorable member for East Sydney, referred to tbe extreme importance which attaches to the skill, knowledge, experience, loyalty and leadership of tbe senior ratings of the Navy. Such men are not let go lightly. The Navy, in common with tbe other services, has always retained the right to dispense with tbe services of any officer or rating whose services are deemed to be no longer required for any reason which may appear proper to tbe authorities exercising that power. However, tbe power to dispense with tbe services of any officer or man on tbe ground that be is no longer required is exercised only after due consideration by tbe most senior naval authority under whom he comes, and that authority in this case, I presume, would be either tbe flag officer in charge of bis borne port or the Naval Board itself, probably the latter. It is perfectly clear that tbe chief petty officer in question was twice concerned in cases involving smuggling. Tbe bonorable member for East Sydney said that there was no question of tbe theft of beer or spirits from the ship. It is not a matter of tbeft. It is a matter of tbe evasion of duty, because sea-going ships has not been paid; and if tbe beer and spirits are taken ashore, and duty is not paid on tbem, tbe customs laws of the land are evaded. Tbat is tbe significance which attaches to the taking of dutiable goodsout of tbe naval dockyard without authority or without paying duty on tbem. I repeat that I"" have no knowledge of tbe circumstances of this case, but on general principles-, it is quite apparent that tbe Naval Board or a duly constituted senior officer bas been satisfied that the high standards of personal conduct and leadership, wbicb are required of chief petty officers and petty officers,, cannot be relied upon in this case, and so tbe naval authorities bave dispensed with, tbe services of this man on tbe ground that tbey were no longer required. Finally, I consider that perhaps another significant fact to honourable members is that the ex-naval rating concerned found bis only champion in. the House in tbe person of the bonorable member for East Sydney. should like to deal for a. few minutes with, tbe sensational announcement of tbe objection taken by tbe Australian National University to tbe presence of tbe racecourse within tbe sacred precincts of tbe. balls of culture. Tbe subject of Canberra andits amenities bas always been moat, amusing, to me becafuse of the fact that, many years, ago,, perhapstoo long to recall, I was born within a few miles' of this Territory, and I bave a. sort of proprietory interest in it. When we take a view of thisplacej, we may bereminded of. on us benevolently as we pass on our way the words of the poet Blakei n another connexionWhat immortal hand or eye, Could frame thy fearful symmetry? If we consider what bas happened in. regard to tbe national university, and to the architectural so-called beauties of this place, we are brought back with a jolt to a certain impertinence in this matter, wbicb is that the university should not be built close to a racecourse. This research institution bas cost tbe country to date a total of £5,000;000. Recently, an amount of £900,000 bas been expended on it, and the expenditure bas been well worth, while. But has not tbe university lost its sense of proportion when it worries about a race-course, and is obliged to get one of tbe grave and reverent seigneurs of the Senate to direct, attention, to. the facts;?. We may be full of culture^ we me teeming with new ideas,, we are absolutely cracking open with all tbeattributes of learning, but we cannot function without a lake before our eyes.

Twohonorable members opposite bave had the advantage of overseas education, and tbey talk with great feeling about tbe mother of universities, Oxford, and ber companion, Cambridge, both of wbicb stand in beautiful surroundings that havegrown up over hundreds of years. But the great men of tbe ages have been able to imbibe tbe highest classical concepts of life and learning without tbe adjuncts of a lake. Diogenes did quite well in a. tub. Shakespeare madehis immortal couplet* on a pallet bed with a bottle of rare old vintage: near bis hand. Sotbe contention, that, in order to bave an aesthetic outlook, we must tear tbe country topiece* is not supported by history.

Tbe Molonglo River is. making heavy weather, and is burrowing deeper intotbe soil, year by year. Taken rationally, the first view of the Walter Burley Griffin scheme is one of beautification. Tbe lakes scheme is splendid. But the university suddenly pontificates, "" No more learning, no more culture, no more anything "" unless it has a lake instead of a race-course near its doors.

If the professors see tbe horses in Canberra lose form, they may be able to devise a formula to help us in our rather plebeian pastimes. With relation to swabbing, could there not be a school for swabbers? Would not that be a lot better tban a lake with the withered marge on wbicb no bird sings, of which the poet Keats talks? Of course it would! If a new formula were evolved by a professor wbicb made a horse register a certain performance round the perimeter of tbe field in an exact number of seconds, he would be more than a professor, be would be a national hero. In tbe circumstances, let us take this could pick another body of architects. matter back to where it belongs. A good and learned professor bas told us of the difficulties that will result from having a race-course in front of the university. I am sure that it must be very, very annoying for professors to look out of tbeir windows and see the cavorting equines galloping round tbe ring and to know that there is to be a race-course there. Buti f the City of Canberra is to become alive, we must bave tbe racecourse, a really good pub, and a main street. I believe that the sooner we start that, the sooner we shall have a city which plan, but, personally, I believe that we shall prefer much more than tbe cylindrical plan. A visitor wbo drives into Canberra in a car goes round and round in circles and gets hopelessly lost. If a series of lakes are added to tbe existing hazards for tbe man who goes home late, as we do, we shall get a probbeing flooded. Tbe only university buildlem of such magnitude that all the professors in tbe world will not be able to provide a solution. Minister for the Interior and Minister for Works) [11.14] -Fa r be it for me, at this late hour, to enter into a controversy on tbe respective merits of Oxford and Cambridge. As a matter of fact, a well-known and independent authority named Baedeka a long time ago, in bis famous guide book, the argument by saying, well worth visiting. If pressed for time, miss Cambridge "". I remind bonorable members that Canberra is tbe National Capital, and not a university town. Tbe bonorable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) bas made that point. As tbe Minister for tbe Interior, I am not responsible for tbe Australian National University. Tbat comes under tbe Prime Minister's Department. But as the Minister for the Interior, I am responsible for any alterations that are made to the original plan of the National Capital. I wish to assure honourable members that any variations I have made, which bave been of a very minor degree, have been made only on the recommendation of the National Capital Planning Committee, wbicb consists of independent architects. I do not know where one could get a better body. Of course, one But wben tbe bonorable member criticizes the architect, all I know is that the National University authorities selected bim; and I tbink that be was a professor of fine arts. However, the university authorities asked the Department of Works to get another architect and I tbinkI am entirely unbiassedhe is doing a little better. Tbe site of tbe Australian National University was selected by somebody. I do not know whether provision was made for it on the original Canberra it was entirely wrong to place the university right in tbe heart of what was to be the National Capital. However, there it is; and we cannot i-emove it. Nothing bas been done that will in any way prevent tbe lake basin from ing that overlooks the race-course is the residence of tbe vice-chancellor, and it does not front the lake basin but backs it, if I might use that term. I do not know who selected tbe site for the existing racecourse. However, it is not intended that tbe race-course shall be established there permanently.

Tbe finest spirit exists in tbe Navy, and I am confident that tbe action of tbe bonorable member in dragging up this case in this way will not adversely effect that spirit. Tbe bonorable gentleman also said that an incident of this kind would be likely to interfere with recruiting. He should to recruiting because, since 1949, when departmental permission. this Government, time after time, bas asked bonorable members opposite to assist in recruiting, and wben we were faced with tbe problem of quickly providing men to fight against tbe Communists in Korea in order to preserve our way of life, bonorable members opposite did not say one word to assist in recruiting.
