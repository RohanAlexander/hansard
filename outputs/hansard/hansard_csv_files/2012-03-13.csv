It pointed out that strict and transparent budgeting. I want to start by talking about market based some commentators have suggested that mechanisms in dealing with environmental there is an irony in Labor being the party backing the market system. As the minister challenges. This used to be a pretty controversial area, and in fact the first person pointed out, when it comes to that view, it is dead wrong. It is this side of the House that to raise it was none other than that controversial figure George HW Bush, has been committed to market reforms in George Bush Snr, who suggested that we Australia's history. It took a Labor government to put in place banking might deal with environmental challenges by putting a price on the externalities.

It is deeply ironic that the member for North Sydney is out there speaking about job security and about the Australian a year or two but something that lasted a full economy.

He has decided Costello, said when speaking of the Leader that, when he is going to get costings done, of the Opposition: 'Never one to be held back rather than go to accounting firms, he will go by the financial consequence of decisions, he to catering firms, because it was catering had grandiose plans for public expenditure.' firms that did the opposition's costings for A former cabinet colleague of the Leader of Nauru.

They think that with their economically illiterate plans, government is an all-you-can-eat: you can talking down the economy. The Australian just go out there and have it all. You can eat economy now enjoys gold-plated AAA everything and worry about dieting-worry credit ratings from the three major agencies. about where the money is going to come When was the last time that happened?

This is the first time We have also seen in recent days a really in Australia's history that we have enjoyed a troubling development: the abandonment of AAA rating from every major ratings countercyclical fiscal policy by those agency. So when you hear those opposite opposite. Those opposite have now said that speaking about the state of the Australian they would not have put the Commonwealth economy-trash-talking the Australian budget into debt during a downturn. It is very economy and trying to damage consumer clear what that would have meant.

If that is the operators are not being forced, cajoled or answer, why are we seeing some of the encouraged to do things they should not do, trends we are seeing in heavy vehicle and there is contractual relationship between accidents? Why are we also not dealing with them and their customer, I remain the simple fact that half of all those heavy bewildered to this day why the government vehicle accidents are not caused or instigated do not provide protections in relation to the by the heavy vehicle driver but by someone contract itself.

But, on balance, I just do not industry, and I am not suggesting that fatigue believe they have made the case for the management is not part of the problem. I just legislation that is before us here this evening. remain unconvinced that the government and As someone who has campaigned actively those advocating for this legislation have on road safety initiatives in my own been able to present a direct and causal electorate, in my role as the shadow relationship between pay rates and road parliamentary secretary for roads and safety. In essence what I am saying is: I am regional transport and also as a local member unconvinced that setting a minimum rate of advocating in particular for the need to pay will turn an unsafe truck driver into a upgrade the Princes Highway, it is an issue safe truck driver. that I am very passionate about and I think In the context of this debate we need to be there are members on both sides of the mindful of the scale of the problem, and chamber who have a shared interest in this those opposite have rightfully raised their issue. In particular, members of the concerns in relation to that. But, according to committee which inquired into this bill were the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and deeply concerned about the level of deaths Regional Economics, during the 12 months and injuries on our roads involving heavy to the end of June 2011, 185 people died vehicles. So, for the benefit of those opposite from crashes involving articulated and heavy who have sought to lecture members on this rigid trucks. That is a tragic result. There is side, I do not believe that either side of the not a member in this place who does not House has a mortgage on compassion and have some concerns about the safety of the empathy for those who have lost loved ones heavy vehicle drivers and other road users. on our roads, and I think it does not reflect But it needs to be noted that for articulated very well on those who have sought to score trucks this was a decrease on average of 3.5 political points out of this debate. per cent per year over the three years to June There is a genuine, shared desire in this 2011, and for heavy rigid trucks a decrease place to reduce the road toll, but I fear, as I by an average of 14.7 per cent per year over said earlier, that this legislation is not the the same period. So it is unfair to suggest answer. It is unfortunate that it has been that there has not been some progress, and I portrayed as some sort of Holy Grail or some give credit to governments in all jurisdictions sort of silver bullet for the issues we are which have been involved in introducing a faced with. I genuinely hope that, if this range of other initiatives which are now in legislation does pass through the chamber place and showing some positive results, here tonight and the reforms are introduced, even without this legislation that the that actually does lead to a reduction in government is determined to introduce. So, accidents and fatalities, and I would be the at a time when the freight task has actually first to congratulate the government if that grown in this country and there are more were the case. I genuinely hope that it does trucks than ever on our roads every day of achieve what they think it is going to the week, we have actually seen an improvement in those accident statistics. The bill establishes the new Road Safety That is not again to suggest for a second that Remuneration Tribunal, which is to be given we should drop our guard or in any way seek broad powers to investigate and set the pay to diminish the tragic fact that 185 people rates I have referred to and conditions for lost their lives during that period. any segment in the heavy vehicle industry.

I fear that transport drivers, including independent it will not. Others have noted and, given that contractors.

It must prepare an appropriate for me also to note the fact that annual work plan with a view to making a the minister for industrial relations now has road safety remuneration order and, in doing carriage of the bill before the parliament, so, must consult with the industry. which I fear indicates where this issue is I do accept that members opposite have heading-that this is more about industrial indicated there has been a lot of consultation relations than road safety. This is not in any in relation to this issue. It is not that anyone way to ridicule the role of the Transport could suggest this has come out of a clear Workers Union in this issue. I was present blue sky; this has been debated for many when its members gave evidence to the years. I am not one of those who are committee and I have no doubt that they are suggesting there has not been consultation, genuine in their desire to reduce the road toll but I do still have a concern about the in their industry. It is not about seeking to evidence that has been claimed to be ridicule the TWU in that regard. I think their irrefutable proof of the link between safe submission was well constructed and their rates and road safety. I am still concerned position was well argued at the public that the link has not been established. The hearing, but I still think it lacked the critical crux of the issues that we are dealing with is evidence which directly linked so-called safe the setting of a safe rate. I had the rates with road safety. There are reasons why opportunity to participate in the inquiry.

None of those more than the fatalities in the construction objections withstands scrutiny; it is quite the industry and more than the fatalities in the opposite, as all the flawed arguments have manufacturing industry. For decades, been soundly rejected by research and different reports, inquiries and coronial analysis. I do not know how much more findings have lead to the same conclusions: research and analysis the members opposite transport industry drivers are being pressured need to be given before they are convinced into taking unacceptable risks, including that those arguments simply do not stand up. We have been debating these issues for some 20 years. It is interesting to note that those ignore or put aside perhaps what is the most who have objected most strongly to this contributing cause to those injuries and legislation are the industry sectors that have fatalities: the very conditions which drivers the most to gain from the existing are subjected to. In fact, the evidence that arrangements.

It is all right to say that have heard members opposite talk about they should not be doing any of those things other factors which contribute to those and that it is their fault that they are, but they fatalities and injuries. Quite rightly, they do those things because of the pressures they have referred to road conditions, rest-stop are under to meet delivery timetables and to facilities, health and safety legislation, and ensure that they are on the road long enough even truck design, construction and to get a return for the time that they spend in maintenance, which all contribute to road their truck. Fatigue, substance abuse, fatalities and accidents. Whilst that may be speeding and poor vehicle maintenance true and whilst those factors also need to be standards all increase the risk of driver simultaneously addressed, you cannot deny accidents. But let us not forget that those the fact that the current conditions which accidents are not only to themselves but to owner-drivers are subjected to are a other road users. So this bill is about making significant cause of those fatalities and those roads safer as well. It is true that other injuries. Therefore, to say that we need to fix factors may also contribute-like poor roads up all of the other matters before we look at and driver error-but overwhelmingly the this legislation is simply absurd. And the fact cause is linked to low-payment rates. is that this government is looking at all of I want to refer to two other matters that those other matters and has effectively are relevant to this legislation. Firstly, there doubled investment in infrastructure in this is the impact on the personal health of country. Much of that investment goes into drivers under the current scenario and the road transport systems. We have introduced current arrangements o drivers being a heavy vehicle transport regulator and we deprived of sleep, working long hours, are looking at having uniform laws across taking stimulants and possibly other drugs, the country.

For them it is not a case of speakers from the other side of the of saying, 'I'll take a week or a fortnight off chamber you would think that the bill before and go away on a holiday,' as every hour the House this evening is about one question they take off costs them a considerable and one question only: do we want to save amount of money. Every hour that their truck lives on the road or do we not? Of course, if is not on the road means that their ability to this bill were really about that simple make monthly repayments to the finance question, then the decision for the House to company becomes even more difficult. So make would be a very simple one, because they simply cannot afford to have what most everybody wants to save lives on the road.

Firstly, periods. The terminology which the bill uses notwithstanding its name, this is not a bill is to speak of a road safety remuneration about road safety. This is a bill which order, but when you analyse the provisions establishes a complex new tribunal and gives of the bill you see that there is no it a broad range of powers, many of which requirement for such an order to have may be exercised in circumstances where anything to do with road safety. For safety is not even considered by the tribunal. example, there is no requirement for the Secondly, I put to the House the proposition tribunal to be satisfied to any particular that the logic at the core of this bill-the standard that the measures it is imposing will logic that if you pay drivers more, if you achieve a safety outcome. In other words, we mandate paying more to drivers, you will have a tribunal that is vested with a very improve road safety-is not proven. The broad set of powers that it can exercise in central proposition upon which this entire relation to the road transport industry, very proposed legislative edifice rests is without broadly defined. If the tribunal so chooses it substance. It is without foundation. It has not could very well make orders that are been proven. predicated upon an argument in relation to safety, but there is no requirement on it to do Thirdly, I highlight the fact that there are that at all; it can make orders which it, in its other, better regulatory tools to deal with the discretion, considers appropriate. Of course, objective of road safety, an objective in those orders can be made on the application support of which all sides of politics are of any parties, including unions and united and an objective which is of critical industrial associations, under section importance to those who work in the road 32(2)(d) of the bill. transport sector and their families and to all users of the roads in Australia. What we have is a proposed legislative apparatus under which a new tribunal is to be Let me turn therefore to the first established. It will have very broad powers proposition I am putting to the House this to set wages and other terms, not just of evening.

We are simply demonstrate that this is a sensible measure required to take it on trust that these which can be expected to be effective in extensive powers will be exercised having solving the problem it is designed to solve, regard to the achievement of safety has not been met. objectives. Do not take my word for it, That brings me to the second point I wish notwithstanding the fact that I am an to make in the brief time available, which is objective and disinterested observer. Take to address the central theory upon which this the words from the regulatory impact legislative edifice is premised. The central statement prepared by the department. It theory underlying this legislation is that the says: problem of road safety in the road transport There is some research to suggest that the industry is a consequence primarily of the remuneration for drivers is a factor in safety fact that drivers are forced to work in unsafe outcomes, however data at this point in time is conditions as a result of either the basis upon limited and being definitive around the causal which they as employees are remunerated as link between rates and safety is difficult. a means of pay or the basis upon which they You could not have it put more clearly than as a supplier of services to an organisation that. There is no proven link that the relevant receive payment. For example, we are told department was able to point to in preparing that drivers of heavy vehicles are forced to the regulatory impact statement to work to unrealistic schedules, that they are accompany this bill, which responsible given time frames within which to travel parliamentarians need to consider as we from, say, Sydney to Brisbane and that when weigh up the merits of this bill.

Firstly, as we all know and as or employers and participants in the road the House has been told many times in this transport industry supply chain about debate, the National Heavy Vehicle remuneration and related conditions insofar Regulator starts in 2013.

The principal legislation is likely to be effective in objects of the bill recognise the government's improving road safety. The House has not intention to provide a framework that been provided with proof that the mechanism promotes a safe industry by ensuring that will have an effect and, for that reason, on drivers in the road transport industry do not this side of the House we are unpersuaded have pay and pay related incentives and and we are not supporting these bills. pressures to work in an unsafe manner.

There is add $510 million to costs in the trucking also nothing in this legislation to address industry in 2014.

The worse part of that is that speech, these product disclosure documents many of those people thought that they did can be quite onerous. I also, like the member have appropriate cover only to find out, on for Blair, think of myself as fairly confident top of the loss of their home and possessions when it comes to taking care of these things. and in many cases people that they loved, I recently found myself in a situation where I that the insurance cover they thought they had a bit of water damage in my home-not had was in fact non-existent. That was the due to any external activity but a leaking primary stimulus for the government putting pipe-and I found myself not knowing together the National Disaster Insurance whether I was covered either in spite of my Review back on 4 March 2011.

I turned out to be covered but it insurance cover in Australia and made some could just as easily have gone the other way 47 recommendations. for me. When I sit down now, as I am doing In parallel to that, the government also at the moment, to review my insurance released a consultation paper called policies across a range of things, I realise Reforming Flood Insurance: Clearing of the that it is really a two-day job by the time you Waters in April 2011. The purpose of that sit down and work your way carefully was to engage the community in suggesting through these rather long documents, improvements to the regulatory framework particularly if you want to compare one policy with another. It really is a substantial task indeed. Again, anything that we can do definition in the regulation. So if you use the that makes it easier for people who have the word 'flood' at all in the insurance policy, it good intention of covering themselves well will refer to that definition, which means that to do that is a very good thing. One of the things like stormwater rainfall run-off and problems with the current flood definitions actions of the sea may be covered separately used by insurance companies is that there are but they will use different terminology. It three broad categories of flood. There is clarifies quite substantially what is covered stormwater rainfall run-off, sometimes called in an insurance policy. Under current law the 'flash flooding' and so the word 'flood' term 'flood' is not defined in the act, which appears in definitions relating to those. results in insurers defining the terms in Usually the term refers to high-intensity different ways, as I just described. Under the short-duration storms which produce new law, insurance providers will be localised flooding and most insurance required to use a standard definition of the policies but not all of them cover this riskterm 'flood' in all cases for home and again, the words 'flash flooding' might building contents, small business and strata appear under current regulation.

The term 'flood' will be defined inundation caused by watercourses or in the regulations. catchments overflowing their banks due to The key facts sheet is also something long duration rainfall over large areas. Some people wanting to compare insurance insurers provide cover for this risk, but many policies or wanting a clear picture of what do not. Whether it is included or excluded in they are covered for will find very useful. It the definitions of this can vary greatly. The is a short statement of one page which third category is actions of the sea, sea level outlines what the insurance policy covers, rise and storm surge, which is inundation what is not covered, the cooling-off period, caused by movement of seawater.

Victoria are working to ensure Parliament House Tuesday, 13 March 2012 Swan Electorate: Small Business important to many people in my electorate of Swan and an issue that I have deep empathy for and an understanding of, and that is the increased regulatory burden on small business. I represent an electorate that is home to more than 20,000 businesses which form a key part of the Western Australian economy and provide employment opportunities to many of my constituents. Small business is an integral part of a thriving economy. The dedication of talented men and women risking everything they have to act on their ideas, labour to create a business, and then grow and expand that business is what has generated jobs and wealth for millions of Australians, including Western Australians, since our founding days. Unfortunately for the thousands of small business owners in my electorate of Swan, this government just does not understand the value small business has to our economy. This government does not understand that you cannot have a strong and prosperous society without first having a successful economy to sustain it. This government has continued to introduce new taxes and regulations since taking office. Despite the government promising a tough one in, one-out approach to regulation in 2007, a whopping 16,163 regulations have been passed whilst a mere 79 regulations have been repealed. The one-in, one-out policy Labor promised in opposition quickly has become a 204-in, one-out policy in government. The increased red tape is not only stifling business activity for many of these operators in my electorate; it hinders the entrepreneurship, innovation and sacrifice which create successful businesses. Today we saw the government in question time trying to convince everyone they are a party that looks after small business. I can tell them that I have run a small business for nearly 30 years, and the one thing that all small businesses dread and fear is a Labor government. The government, as part of the mining tax, is increasing taxes for Australia's 400,000 small businesses by removing the entrepreneurs tax offset. The Gillard government is trying to sell the one per cent cut to the company tax rate as a broad cut to small business when in fact less than one-third are actually set up as companies. These same businesses who miss out on the tax cut will not be able to escape dangerous cost increases due to the carbon tax. A one per cent cut in company tax represents one cent in a dollar. The only companies who are going to achieve that benefit are companies that are actually making a profit. So for all the businesses in the current economy who are not making profits that one per cent means nothing to them at all. An early tax write-off of $6,500 does not help cash flow, because the companies still have to pay for the assets they have actually bought. So there is no benefit to cash flow, which is what the Labor government is trying to represent.

156,Mr Murphy (Reid) (18:04,"Last FridayI was delighted to speak at the Southern Crossand Youth, Peter Garrett, to celebrate the official opening of the new trade training centre at Burwood in my electorate of Reid. Visiting schools is always a highlight, especially as it allows me to meet with students, teachers and school communities and to see first hand the exciting new opportunities that are available. Southern Cross Catholic Vocational College is the lead school in a cluster application submitted in round 1 of the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program and was awarded $11 million to provide this training facility. Other schools in this cluster to benefit from the training facility are Bethlehem College, De La Salle College, Marist College, Domremy College, Holy Cross College, Marist Sisters College, St Scholastica's College, St Patrick's College, Christian Brothers High School and Berne Education Centre. The dual-strand curriculum will produce workforce-ready students who graduate with either a Certificate II or completion toward a Certificate III in their chosen field. Both certificates are the equivalent study requirements of a first year apprenticeship. The program is an important element of the Australian government's education revolution and one of a number of initiatives designed to improve the quality of schooling and have a qualified, welltrained Australian workforce-a goal clearly shared by Southern Cross Catholic Vocational College and its partner schools. This program gives every Australian secondary school student access to industry-standard trades training facilities. The availability of facilities that provide pathways to trade careers is a vital element in keeping all students engaged and rewarded in their senior secondary schooling. The overall program will provide $2.5 billion over 10 years to allow all secondary schools access to infrastructure funding to build new or enhance existing trade training facilities. To date the program has approved $1.2 billion to fund more than 370 projects benefiting over 1,060 schools around Australia. This trades training centre facility in Burwood will not only provide industry-relevant training that will engage students but also properly prepare them to be the highly skilled workforce of tomorrow. The establishment of this trades training centre is also an example of how cooperative partnerships coupled with long-term vision can help promote quality education, help address national skills shortages and enhance the productivity of our nation. Finally, I congratulate all of those involved in making this project a success and applaud the college's commitment to improving the opportunities and training pathways for the students in this area. Royal Australian Artillery bravery of the 102nd Field Battery, Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery for its collective gallantry and heroic actions that took place on the night of 12 to 13 May 1968 in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The 102nd's exemplary conduct on that evening against a numerically superior enemy has yet to be formally recognised by the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal, and tonight I would like to formally raise this matter. I have been made aware that a submission for an award of a Unit Citation for Gallantry for the 102nd is currently before the tribunal. I would strongly encourage the tribunal to formally recognise the collective tenacity and bravery of the Australians who held their ground under intense enemy pressure on the first night of fierce fighting at Fire Support Base Coral in South Vietnam.",147,Constituency Statements
157,Mr Vasta (Bonner) (18:07,"It is with pleasure that I rise tonight to acknowledge theThe members of the 102nd were under strength and unprepared for the fierce attack that evening and were faced with a 1,000-strong North Vietnamese Army unit who were fresh and well equipped and whose objective that night was to secure the six guns of the 102nd. The North Vietnamese Army succeeded in securing only one of the six Australian guns that evening due to the bold and heroic actions of the battery. The members of the battery were engaged in close hand-to-hand combat with the enemy whilst performing their main purpose, which was to provide support to the Australian infantry, all the while under sustained mass infantry attack. To summarise for you today, as many as 220 Australians would have been captured and lives subsequently lost,; six Australian guns would have been lost, mortar and other vital equipment and supplies would have been lost, and the regiment headquarters would have been overrun-truly unthinkable outcomes. Without the 102nd's brave actions it really could have become a reality of the Vietnam War. The 102nd's courageous actions were brought to my attention by my Bonner constituent Mr Jurgen Harms of Wynnum, who served in the Vietnam War and was part of the 102nd FB. I thank him for his ongoing efforts in achieving appropriate recognition for this battle. In conclusion, I would like to formerly place my full support behind the 102nd Field Battery, Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery in their submission to be awarded the Unit Citation for Gallantry. Braddon Electorate: Burnie Waterfront Forestry) (18:09): On 24 February, I joined with the Hon. Simon Crean, Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, to finally open the last stage in what has been called the waterfront revitalisation project in Burnie. Burnie has reinvented itself from the 1990s, invested in itself and is now known as the place of makers. It has always had a history of manufacturing, particularly papermaking and it has revitalised itself. Through the Better Regions Program-a program totalling $176 million-the government have contributed to this revitalisation, particularly $3 million, which was used for two parts of the revitalisation process. One million dollars was spent on the Makers' Workshop, a fantastic, innovative building, which tells the story of Burnie, its surrounds and its makers' history. Two million dollars was spent to complete the physical revitalisation, the amenity-creating revitalisation, of the waterfront precinct, particularly that related to the surf life saving club and the facilities that go with it. The revitalisation project has seen the redevelopment of the Burnie surf club, which I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you have visited on a number of occasions; the rejuvenation of North Terrace into a one-way street; the creation of a pedestrian-friendly precinct off North Terrace; the construction of a new tourism and visitors centre to amalgamate the Pioneer Village Museum, Creative Paper Tasmania and the existing visitor centre into an innovative attraction aimed at future tourism growth markets, particularly through the Makers' Workshop; the erection of a new seawall; the construction of decking, an events lawn, paved areas incorporating artworks, public barbeques, shelters and play equipment, which will expand the seawall area and connect the West Park precinct; and the connection of the waterfront and the West Park cultural precinct, with decking towards the Makers' Workshop from the waterfront precinct. On top of the $3 million, we have also invested $4.6 million into the regional local council infrastructure project to bring together this revitalisation to support Burnie in its reinvestment",148,Constituency Statements

I was very proud to join Simon Crean in these endeavours and to congratulate the Burnie City Council and the whole of that community in what is an exciting, innovative and fantastic project. Longman Electorate: Epilepsy Awareness the Moreton Bay region with the event Cupcakes in the Park. This was a fantastic community event that brought attention to the important issue of epilepsy awareness. It is a condition that has wide-reaching implications in my community and for people all around our nation. Epilepsy is the world's most common brain disorder and impacts around one in 50 Australians during their lifetime. For such a common disorder little is known about it. The frustration that sufferers of epilepsy face is that there is no single cause and there is no known cure. About 70 per cent of epilepsy sufferers are able to successfully control their seizures with medication. However, others are faced with the fear of not being able to control their seizures and not knowing when the next one will strike. Unfortunately, this can lead to physical, psychological and social issues, and has the potential to impact on the sufferer's access to education, employment and involvement in relationships. I have personally seen the impact that this invasive condition can have on a person's life, having grown up with one of my best mates suffering from epilepsy. Not only are there many questions left to be answered about epilepsy by the medical world; epilepsy continues to be overwhelmingly misunderstood by the general population. It is for this reason that I decided to raise awareness and break down the stigmas surrounding epilepsy by hosting Cupcakes in the Park. I want to thank the many locals who came out in support of Cupcakes in the Parklocals who are keen to meet and support others in the community who have suffered at the effects of epilepsy, whether it was themselves, their friends, their family or their colleagues. As I have always found with my community, locals are keen to get behind those in need and offer their support. This event was no exception. Those that attended were keen to learn more about epilepsy. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Epilepsy Queensland for their assistance with this event and also for the good work they are doing in Queensland. The CEO of Epilepsy Queensland, Helen Whitehead, attended and shared her experience and vision for Epilepsy Queensland. I would also like to thank one of my staff members, Shannon Murray, who, as a sufferer of epilepsy, has opened my eyes to the challenges faced by sufferers across the country. Without her help, this local event would not have been possible. Thank you, Shannon. Purple Day is on 26 March. It is the international day dedicated to increasing awareness of epilepsy. Cupcakes in the park was my community's Purple Day event. Purple Day was started in 2008 by Megan Cassidy, a nine-year-old Canadian girl who wanted sufferers of epilepsy to know that they did not have to face their condition alone. Getting to support one another is what Purple Day is all about. I was proud to hold this community event and I thank my community for their support. Forbes, Professor John, AM Ms HALL (Shortland-Government Whip) (18:16): I would like to acknowledge the fine achievements of Professor John Forbes AM who was recognised in the Australia Day awards this year. He is an outstanding Australian committed to finding the right treatments and a cure for breast cancer. He serves as Director of the Department of Surgical Oncology at the Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital and the Professor of Surgical Oncology at the University of Newcastle. He is also the Director of Research of the Australian New Zealand Breast Cancer Trials Group and has been recognised for his service to medicine in the field of breast cancer research and in the development of improved clinical trials. He has been a leader in breast cancer research not only in Australia but has also been a pioneer in breast cancer trials worldwide. He established the first national breast cancer trials along with his colleagues 30 years ago. Today 20 per cent of the breast cancer deaths that would have occurred 20 years ago are now avoided. It is a fine record in the area. It was my pleasure, along with the member for Hume and Professor Jim Denham and many of his colleagues in the medical and scientific community, to sponsor Professor Forbes for this award. It was long overdue. The difference he has made to so many women's lives is phenomenal. Each year I hold a breast cancer morning tea in my electorate. Professor Forbes, somebody with such a distinguished background, somebody who has made such a significant contribution to research and to the treatment of breast cancer, puts aside a morning in his busy schedule to come along and talk to women in my community about breast cancer and to help us raise funds for breast cancer research. He is totally dedicated and committed to finding a cure for breast cancer through breast cancer research and by understanding how breast cancer mutates within a woman's body. He is a man who has made an enormous commitment to his community and it is only right that he be recognised in the way he was this year in the Australia Day honours. A big thank you to Professor John Forbes: you are a fantastic man who is truly committed to helping women. Aged Care government to urgently respond to the Productivity Commission's report Caring for older Australians so that this nation and its citizens can have some peace of mind when it comes to just how we are going to manage our ageing population and its aged care needs. We have already gone through 20-plus reviews and inquiries related to ageing and aged-care issues, including three by the Productivity Commission since 2007. It is now more than seven months since the commission released that last report. The Wide Bay area, which includes my seat of Hinkler, has the highest age profile in the nation, yet it is missing 429 aged-care beds and has Queensland's poorest ratio of beds to people over 70 years of age. Nationally, the bed ratio for the region is ranked the third worse. According to information provided by the Department of Health and Ageing, the missing beds-beds allocated but not yet delivered by service providers in the region-comprise 234 high care and 195 low care. Their specific location is not freely available. With this in mind, can you guess just how many aged-care beds the region received in the last round of agedcare allocation, in which 180 funded beds were up for grabs? It was zero-not one. It is utterly incomprehensible to me how a region, and thus my electorate, would not receive a single aged-care bed in the last round. It is highly distressing to older residents and their families. So, in all, we are down 600 places in the last four years. I have never been officially informed as to why no beds we allocated. Departmental officers say that there were no applications. Potential providers tell me that the capital cost of facilities and the government's per capita emoluments for clients make profitability uncertain.",149,Constituency Statements
159,Mr Neville (Hinkler,"The Nationals Deputy Whip) (18:19): I am calling on theBut, whatever the reason, the government must urgently address the care needs of the ageing population. We simply cannot wait any longer. To wait another four years would be an outrage. There needs to be a seismic shift in thinking when it comes to aged care in Australia. We need to change our whole mindset when it comes to funding and to the structured management of the aged-care system. Some have put it to me that we do not rely on profit based charity organisations to run defence and the health system and they ask why aged care should be any different. We value both our defence and our aged-care needs. We should not look to profit but should look to the care of Australians who have made a contribution over their lifetimes. Fraser, Mrs Helen Whitten, MBE Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (18:22): On4 March 2012 Helen Whitten Fraser passed away, aged 91. Helen Fraser was the wife of the late Jim Fraser, after whom my seat is named. At the memorial service for Helen Fraser, her son, Andrew Fraser, said that hers was a life of 'strength, love and fun'. She met her husband-to-be on a tennis court when she was aged 16 and he 29. They did not get married for another 22 years. By that time, Jim Fraser was already the local member for the ACT. This was well before self-government, so he was the only political representative for the ACT and looked after more electors than anyone else in the parliament. Andrew Fraser told us that when Helen married Jim she was 'on call and on show'. She attended events on her husband's behalf, regularly giving speeches at local fetes. She was the patron of many local clubs, including bowls, netball and football. It was not done for show. Over a decade after her husband's death, Helen still held some of those positions. Andrew Fraser told the story of when his mother received her MBE for community service from then Governor General Paul Hasluck. Because he was the patron of the Scouts and she the commissioner of the Girl Guides, he decided he would play a trick on her. He put out his left hand for the official handshake. Without missing a beat, Helen flicked her handbag across to her right hand and courteously shook Hasluck's hand to accept the MBE. Jim Fraser's death was utterly unexpected. He passed away in 1970, while still in office. The electorate of Fraser, which I have the honour to represent, was formed in 1974. I am the fifth member for Fraser. At the memorial service, Meg Fraser read from the splendid Henry Scott Holland sermon Death is nothing at all. It is one of my favourite pieces for funeral services as it reminds us of the importance of continuing to remember and speak often about those who have passed. It reads in part: Call me by my old familiar name. Speak to me in the easy way which you always used. Put no difference into your tone. Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow. Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes we enjoyed together. Play, smile, think of me. Pray for me. Let my name be ever the household word that it always was. Helen Fraser outlived her husband by more than four decades, and Andrew Fraser spoke of how, in her final days, she would talk about looking forward to seeing Jim. In the words of one of Jim's caucus colleagues, Andrew said, Helen had decided, 'It's time.' Liverpool: CCTV Cameras Liverpool police superintendent Ray King and his call for CCTV cameras to be installed throughout the Liverpool CBD. It is unfortunate, but today in the Liverpool CBD the many small businesses that are doing an outstanding job there are victims of shoplifting and vandalism and have to put up with drug-dealing on the streets. To have CCTV cameras in Liverpool was actually a commitment of the coalition at the last election. If the coalition had won government at the 2010 election, we would have those CCTV cameras in Liverpool today. I note that my call has been supported by my neighbouring MP, Mr Chris Hayes. I note that the Liverpool Leader has quoted Mr Hayes as saying that he had called on the then Minister for Home Affairs, Brendan O'Connor, to put Liverpool on the priority list for federal funding for CCTV cameras. It is very good to have that support, but unfortunately, when it comes to the funding, there has been a deafening silence. This government has had time to change the minister but has not had time to change the lives of people in Liverpool by taking this most basic step to ensure safety in the CBD. But it is not only federal Labor that is failing the good city of Liverpool; on the Liverpool City Council, 4½ Labor councillorsMr Neumann: Four and a half? CCTV cameras in the CBD, even though the council's budget has set aside more than half a million dollars for their installation. Could it perhaps be that they need this half a million dollars for something else? That is very close to the figure that they will need to pay the extra costs for their electricity as a result of the carbon tax. Instead of spending this money on the CCTV cameras, the Labor-controlled Liverpool City Council has elected to install a series of parking meters in their CBD. The local councillors have been most eager to install these money-hungry parking meters. No hurdles were bypassed in their installation. One can only surmise that perhaps the Labor councillors are also looking at the extra revenue from these parking meters to fund the additional costs they will have to pay come 1 July, as soon as they are hit with the carbon tax. Putting this aside for one moment, Mr Deputy Speaker, what do you think could have possibly happened to these newly installed parking meters without the cover of CCTV cameras? I have received reports that graffiti vandalism has already been covering these newly installed parking meters. Who could have seen that coming? We now find ourselves in the ironic position that Labor's parking meters are now actually costing the ratepayers of Liverpool money, before they have even been switched on.",151,Wyatt Roy Longman 18 13 Last Week I Launched Epilepsy Awareness Month In

Mental health is an issue of concern to us all. If this bill were to proceed in its current form, it would return us to treatment of people with mental ill health and mental illness that is draconian, a violation of liberties and a denial of dignity. Even a cursory read of the bill is rather frightening. A member of my family first alerted me to it, telling me it had gone viral on the web, with people expressing disbelief and outrage. I later received emails about it, and today I read in the Australian newspaper comments of concern by Professor McGorry and by Professor Jon Jureidini, from Flinders University, a child and adolescent mental health expert, who is quoted as describing the draft legislation as 'bizarre' and 'absurd'. The Mental Health Law Centre WA principal solicitor and general manager, Sandra Boulter, in their submission to the government consultation, nailed it, saying inter alia: We are most concerned about many aspects of the Bill, which include:  Addition of sterilisation as a treatment for mental illness (nowhere else in Australia)  Certain persons, including 12yo girls and boys can consent to sterilisation, ECT, and psychosurgery without the consent/despite the refusal of the parent/guardian, without any requirement to go to a Tribunal or Court The Bill is silent about who will decide whether or not the child has the maturity to consent, and no doubt will be the treating psychiatrist, who has a clear conflict of interest, because he wants to give the treatment.  Broadening of the criteria for involuntary detention  Removal of the complaint jurisdiction from the Tribunal Removal of the inspection powers of the Official Visitors (shocking move)  Removal of the right to second opinion for ECT, Sterilisation, Psychosurgery  Reduction in the strength of the current Act's safeguards against errors made arising from cultural and linguistic diversity. … … … The Bill has removed the express provisions of the current Act that:  Give a right to the consumer to call and give evidence, examine and cross examine witnesses and make submissions (current clause 2 of Schedule2 of the Act)  Give a right to representation (current clause 3 of Schedule2 of the Act)  Support funding for our service (Part8 of the Act) Furthermore, the Bill has new provisions that: Appear to give the Tribunal the right to exclude a patient's lawyerand it cites a number of provisions, andMake it an offence for anyone, including the very unwell patient, to be in contempt of the Tribunal, with a fine available of up to $10,000 (clause 364). I was shocked when I read it. I cannot believe that any jurisdiction-anybody-would even think to impose that on people with mental illness. Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee Report Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the report. Committee report In the wake of disasters-Volume 1: the operation of the insurance industry during disaster events, which was presented in the federal parliament. My electorate of Blair had 1,500 homes in Ipswich and 473 businesses, many agribusinesses, affected by the January 2011 floods. In the Somerset region, which I have the honour also of representing in this parliament, 530 homes were flooded and 400 small businesses, many agribusinesses, were also flooded. So this is not just political; it is personal to me and it is personal to my local community. The insurance industry in this country is a very large sector of our community. It has assets of about $113.9 billion and had revenue in the 2011 year of $42.1 billion. The industry itself makes a profit of $5.6 billion per annum-they are the 2011 figures, at least. The major players are Suncorp, IAG, QBE Insurance Group and Allianz Australia. They are the main players in the industry. The 2010-11 floods saw, really, a situation where there was flooding across the countryin WA, in rural Victoria. We saw cyclones up in North Queensland, with Cyclone Yasi in February 2011. We saw floods wreak havoc on Toowoomba first, the Lockyer Valley, the Brisbane Valley, Ipswich and then Brisbane. The effect on the lives of people is incalculable. The mental health and emotional impact almost exceeds the financial impact on people's lives. There was a deluge in complaints about the insurance industry. Sadly, I have to say, it fell largely on deaf ears. People felt brutalised by the floods and national disasters, and then they felt brutalised by the claims process that they had to endure. There are 13 recommendations in this particular report, and I would urge the government to take seriously those recommendations, because if taken up they will make a significant difference. The consumer protection in relation to the insurance industry is particularly poor. The enforcement and sanction is weak. And the information to the consumer is simply not available readily. Consumers are unaware, mostly-in fact, many times, until they have consulted their own policies. There are changes that need to be made. One of the most egregious examples we discovered in our investigations was the voluntary code of practice. It is voluntary and not all insurance companies adhere to it or sign up to it. It is the General Insurance Code of Practice and it has a range of consumer protections and standards. But, as we found through the floods and the natural disasters, many of the time frames are honoured in the breach rather than the observance. In fact, in 4.3 of the General Insurance Code of Practice there is a get-out-ofgaol-free card for the insurance industry and they used this to a large extent on many occasions. When we asked questions about the code during the inquiry, most people said, 'What's that?' I have to admit that the insurance industry responded by saying that the General Insurance Code of Practice is now going to be complied with-and I welcome that-except in the most extraordinary circumstances. I do not think that is good enough and in our recommendations we do not think that is good enough. We have recommended that there be a",153,Wyatt Roy Longman 18 13 Last Week I Launched Epilepsy Awareness Month In
162,Mr Neumann (Blair) (18:31,"I speak in relation to the Social Policy and Legal Affairsstandard definition of flood, that there be a standard cover, including flood cover and full replacement in the event of total loss. We have recommended to the government that the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011 be enacted and we have recommended that there should be legislation to remove the exemption of general insurers from unfair contract term laws. The problem is that the insurance industry has a number of exemptions and the sanctions with respect to breaches and penalties for the breaches of the General Insurance Code of Practice are minimal. In fact, I was really struck by the evidence from Mr Price, an ombudsman with the Financial Ombudsman Service. The role of the Financial Ombudsman Service is to monitor and report a failure by an insurance company and to correct a breach of the code. There is a code compliance committee, which may dismiss the FOS findings or request FOS to reconsider further consultation with insurers. Mr Price's evidence struck me when he noted that since 2004 sanctions have not been utilised-and those sanctions are minimal. The sanctions include a requirement that particular rectification steps have to be undertaken within a specified time, that a compliance audit be undertaken, that corrective advertising and some publication on the insurer's non-compliance be undertaken. Since 2004, no sanctions have been utilised during Mr Price's time with FOS. In fact, when you look at the evidence that was given to the inquiry about the monitoring and the enforcement of the code in chapter 3, there are a plethora of examples of insurance companies breaching their own codes of practice. On many occasions, and the evidence is there to be seen by people who care to look at the report from page 26 onwards, we found that the insurance industry failed to comply with the claims handling processes that they are supposed to comply with under their own code of practice. The amendments we recommend will not change the experiences of flood victims in Ipswich and the Somerset, but we can learn from those experiences to make sure that claims in the future will be protected. I cannot conceive a circumstance where an insurance company-and they are exempt from the duties of utmost good faith-should be allowed to go on. We have recommended that legislation be enacted to make a breach of the duty of utmost good faith a breach of the Insurance Contracts Act. I do not think they should be treated any differently from any other company or corporation. We have recommended there be a tough cop on the beat. We have recommended that the Australia Securities and Investments Commission regulate insurance claims handling. We think naming and shaming is what should happen if people breach, not this generalised approach that we have seen in the past. We want clear and comprehensive information provided to make sure that people understand the internal and external dispute resolution procedures that are there. We want to make sure that there is a consumer advisory position within the Financial Ombudsman Service as well. We want to make sure that legal aid services are adequately funded. One of the problems that came up was the need for 1300 calls. Many people had mobile phones in these circumstance but could not use them because they ran out of charge. That was the problem. The cost of using mobile phones during these flood disaster events was a problem. We have recommended that the government investigate ways to reduce the cost of 1300 calls from mobile phones during natural disasters. We need to empower consumers. We need to put teeth in any legislation. We need to make sure that someone or some entity looks at this industry and makes sure this industry operates fairly, equitably and openly. Transparency and accountability have not been the watchwords of the insurance industry in the context of natural disasters. I admit there are many cases where the insurance companies did the right thing-and we came across that. I can think of one meeting where we had about 20 people who lived in Fernvale and Lowood in my electorate. We asked people to put up their hands to indicate who had been paid out and who were happy with their insurance service. A number of people put up their hands, but many of their neighbours and friends did not know they were not covered. Sometimes you almost need a doctorate of law to understand that you are not covered for a flood. Many times people thought they had been covered but found they were not. We are recommending many changes here. A key fact sheet is critical. We are going to make sure this is an ideal vehicle for explaining the standard cover and to communicate that and any derogation from the standard cover in respect of flood. We have recommended the expedition of the passage of the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill. There are many changes that need to be made. There are many lessons that need to be learnt. I read an editorial from the Queensland Times in the aftermath of the 1974 flood. In those days Ipswich had about 74,000 people. The flood then was higher but the impact was not as great because Ipswich now has between 175,000 and 180,000 people. I remember the 1974 flood well. My parents' house was under eight foot of water. I remember it vividly. I remembered the editorial and I found it not long after the 2011 flood. The editorial in the Queensland Times was about learning the lessons from the aftermath of the flood. Tragically, shamefully and sadly, we did not learn the lessons and we let the insurance industry develop and operate with minimal regulation and minimal accountability. It has taken this event to flush out those lessons. It has taken this event to make sure that the lack of accountability and that unconscionable approach in the way things have operated are removed in the future. We need to get rid of the confusion around the definition of flood. We need to make sure that people's rights are enhanced and we need to address the failure and potential market failure of insurance premiums. There are many things that I think this government has done in this area in terms of the reviews that have been undertaken. I commend Minister Shorten, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who has been a leading advocate in this area. He came to my electorate. We put on insurance forums and, sadly, only the CEO of the Insurance Council of Australia turned up, despite the fact that we urged all the CEOs of the insurance companies to come. I think it was a terrible mistake that they did not front up and deal with their customers and clients. That was in Ipswich and I did the same thing in Fernvale, where Senator Joseph Ludwig turned up. Again, no insurance company CEOs or representatives from the Insurance Council turned up. The insurance industry need to know they are part of the community. They need to know they have a communitarian and social obligation. They cannot operate in a vacuum and they need to deal with their customers fairly and reasonably. Rural and regional people have been treated in a shabby way just as people who live on the Brisbane River in inner city Brisbane have been. The devastation that people suffer and the trauma and the loss that they endure must not be exacerbated in the future by what we saw during this inquiry. This is an opportunity for the insurance industry. If the government takes the recommendations seriously and acts upon them and if the insurance companies do not get it right and act appropriately and in a communitarian way then the consequences for the insurance industry will be enforceable instruments, greater regulation and punitive legislation. That is the only alternative. It is not just a matter of last chance here; it is a matter of them taking seriously their responsibility as good corporate citizens. I commend the committee. I thank the secretariat. I thank the chair, the member for Moreton; the deputy chair, the member for Pearce; and all those people present on the committee. I commend this report to all those who might be listening. Debate adjourned. World War II Debate resumed. Prime Minister in relation to the 70th anniversary of the bombing of Broome and to add further comments of course as the member for Durack. Broome is one of the jewels in the Durack crown, so to speak. I wonder if any of us in this place have any sense of what it must have been like on that idyllic morning, a typical Broome morning, 3 March. You would think the world was a wonderful place. There was a little extra activity because of the comings and goings of dawn aircraft that were being refuelled on Roebuck Bay. Suddenly, out of the morning sky, came nine Mitsubishi Zero fighters. They proceeded to bomb 17 flying boats moored on Roebuck Bay and left a total path of destruction, killing an estimated 88 persons. Twenty minutes of that and then there was a silence of aircraft, a silence of gunfire and a silence of bombs, but there were screams for help from burning victims. A tide was running and it was almost impossible to carry out the rescues of those who had been injured and the victims of this attack. I cannot imagine that we would have any sense of that. Immediately after the destruction had been inflicted upon those flying boats in Roebuck Bay, those nine fighter aircraft adjourned to the Broome airport where they took out numerous American and British aircraft. They left after, at most, an hour, leaving total destruction and about 88 people killed. Not one serviceable aircraft was left on the ground in Broome. The only Japanese fatality was a result of a Mr Gus Winckel, a crew member of one of the Dutch Dorniers, who was able to face an oncoming Zero with a machine gun from the hip and he took that aircraft down. Less than an hour and total havoc was wreaked on that idyllic spot, that jewel in the Durack crown, and the war had come to Western Australia. Nevertheless, as things unfolded, the Dutch supplied great asset to Australia by numerous merchant navy ships providing a lifeline to the Australia trade activities. On3 March this year, at the 70th anniversary of those events in Broome overlooking Roebuck Bay, we had present representatives from the United States embassy, the US Consul General Aleisha Woodward; Ambassador Willem Andreae, Kingdom of the Netherlands; Western Australian Premier Colin Barnett; Special Minister of State, the Hon. Gary Gray, representing the Prime Minister; and the much-loved local, Graeme Campbell, President of the Shire of Broome. What a different place Broome was on 3 March 2012 than on that dreadful day in 1942. One of the sad things that I am very frustrated by in my research into those days is that, because of the turmoil of the time, there is a lack of detailed information. The best of research",155,Committees
163,Mr Haase (Durack) (18:45,"I rise this evening to, firstly, endorse the remarks by thethrough the Australian War Memorial reveals numerous entries but, might I say, conflicting entries. One is not able to determine absolutely the number of persons who lost their lives that day. No-one is able to determine whether or not any local Indigenous people lost their lives. Some 25 Dutch nationals whose bodies were able to be rescued were buried in Broome and later exhumed and transported to the war graves at Karrakatta, a suburb of Perth. Some 25 bodies were so exhumed and transported. But one cannot get an exact figure or the list of names of those who lost their lives that day. Of heroic deeds there are numerous examples-local people who responded to cries for help and threw themselves into high-running tides and burning water, covered in burning diesel, to rescue women and children from those flying boats. Not well known is the fact that from early February to that point in early March there were something like 8,000 Dutch nationals transferred from Batavia through to Perth via Broome-Broome being an appropriate landing and refuelling spot in the northern portion of Western Australia. So Broome suddenly became a hubbub of activity. And of course in the latter stages of the war in 1942 many things unfolded. There was a migration south from Northern Australia, the Brisbane Line was created and MacArthur directed activities in Northern Australia, and there was the war in the Pacific et cetera. More and more I find that this current generation is much concerned with those things that occurred during the Second World War. It is something of a phenomenon. Whether or not it is the passing of the veterans of those battles and of that era I cannot be sure. But it is certain that there is a renewed interest. This last 70th anniversary and the spectacle that was reenacted overlooking Roebuck Bay on 3 March this year will, I believe, be an occasion that is rerun; the occasion will be used to pay our respects and recall that history. I note that more sage individuals than I have urged us today to reflect on the past in order to be better prepared and to cope with the future here in this wonderful land of ours. SoI have had great pleasure in rising this evening to remind the House of the 70th anniversary of the events that took place on that dreadful day, and in anticipating that in years to come that fateful 3 March 1942 will be commemorated on numerous occasions and so teach us of the horrors of the past and prepare us for the future-a future, we trust, that will not see warfare on these wonderful shores of the nation Australia. Ms O'NEILL (Robertson) (18:54): I too rise to speak on the commemoration services that were held at Broome in honour of those lives lost 70 years ago last Saturday, 3 March. I certainly endorse the remarks the Prime Minister made in the House on the last day of the last sitting week-the final Thursday. I also acknowledge the words of the member for Durack, who was in attendance at Broome. I was fortunate to be there on that day as well. We know about the war in the Pacific and we honour the memory of the great sacrifices that were made but, having spent so much of my life in classrooms with students, I think that we really never talk about the war of the north-the war of the north that happened in our country. This year, 70 years on, the significant commemorations that happened in Darwin are an indication perhaps of a coming of age when we can admit to the vulnerability of our northern borders and our historical understandings have reached a point where we can talk about the challenges that face us as a nation and the great vulnerability that we were exposed to at that time. Last week, on Saturday3 March 2012, all of those who were gathered in the central area of the town-and I think there would have been close to 2,000 people, which is not a small number for such a remote community as Broome-were treated to the most compelling and eloquent representation of the events of that day in 1942 by the students of St Mary's College. It was simply an outstanding re-creation of the shock and the incredible drama and sadness of that morning 70 years earlier. This event in 1942 occurred at 9.30 in the morning, on a day that we heard from locals was a very common sort of day for that time of year, early March. A gentle breeze was blowing, the water was sparkling and no doubt those people who arrived in Broome on 3 March in 1942 felt a sense of peace. As the member for Durack has already indicated, the Dutch ambassador, Willem Andrea, was in attendance at the re-creation. I particularly want to pay tribute to the Dutch ambassador for the work the Dutch embassy engaged in. They prepared a very nice piece of history in this little booklet that is about the strafing of Broome. It tells some of the stories that I think have been lost and forgotten over the years and puts them together in this one place for people who want to read about the great heroism and the tragic losses of that war in the north. The Netherlands Naval Air Service was responsible for shifting as many people as possible out of the Netherlands East Indies, now Indonesia-from Java to Broome and then through to Perth. Before the fall of Singapore, there were significant numbers of Dutch planes leaving the East Indies and heading through to Broome. In fact 57 planes were being processed through Broome a day-which is absolutely phenomenal when you look at the size of Roebuck Bay and the landing strip they had. In the 14 days before the Japanese occupation of Java 7,000 to 8,000 refugees went through Broome. This stopped on 27 February. There was a short break and then a window opened on 2 March for the evacuation of the last nine flying boats that the Netherlands Naval Air Service had. There were five Dorniers and four Catalinas. With that opportunity on 2 March they flew to Broome to refuel on their way to Perth. When they landed in Roebuck Bay they joined the United States Navy planes that had a load of wounded soldiers and were refuelling there on their way back home. They also joined some members of a Royal Air Force squadron. There are reports that on 2 March 1942 there was a Japanese reconnaissance mission to see what was going on in Broome. After they reported back, nine Zeros returned at 9.30 on that fateful morning of 3 March 1942. You can imagine, with so many people having moved to Broome away from Java, that all the accommodation on land was pretty full. These last nine flying boats in Roebuck Bay had many women and children seeking refuge on board. When the Japanese Zeros suddenly arrived, all hell broke loose, as they described it. The strafing began. There was nowhere to run. There was no way to get away from the sudden and unexpected attack. It was significantly women and children who were impacted in this terrible event. The member for Durack mentioned one very brave member of the Dutch navy who was there at the time, Gus Winckel. I had the pleasure, over 20 years ago, of travelling around Australia with my husband-not as grey nomads; in fact we were quite dark haired at the time. We travelled around Australia in a mobile home-'Harvey the RV', we used to call it. We spent a beautiful Christmas in Broome. Little did we know, as we drove around, that Gus Winckel Drive, on the way to the airport, was named after a real hero on that day. He simply pulled a machine gun up to his hip and fired and hit one of the Zeros. Gus Winckel Drive is just an ordinary looking street as you drive out to the airstrip. You would not remark on it if you did not know the story of Gus Winckel. His four sons were there to honour him on 3 March and to recall his great heroism and bravery on that day. One man with one machine gun against nine Zeros was an incredible mismatch. In closing, I would like to acknowledge all the work of the local community of Broome in putting together such a fitting tribute to remember those lives lost on that day and the bravery that people showed throughout the entire war in the Pacific, and particularly the war in our own north. I would like to acknowledge the presence of the American Consul General, Aleisha Woodward, who gave a profound and moving speech about the loss of lives of men who had been injured in the theatre of war and who were on their way home, flying out of the peaceful haven that they thought Broome to be. They died that day and did not get home. I would also like to acknowledge my colleague Gary Gray, the member for Brand, who was with me and gave an eloquent speech acknowledging the sacrifices of the day. I was very pleased to have his company on my journey to Broome. In honouring the people of Broome in their determination to not forget, I would like to acknowledge the mayor, Graeme Campbell, who is passionate in his leadership in that community. Obviously it is a community that really has taken on the responsibility of honouring this day in Broome on a regular and consistent basis. This 70th commemoration was particularly important. Eighty-eight people died on the morning of 3 March 1942. Many more were injured, and innocence was lost on that day. When we recall the sacrifice of those who fought for us, we finish by saying, 'We will remember them.' I can absolutely say with confidence that, on 3 March this year, the people of Broome very aptly and very fondly, with great respect, remembered all of those lives that were lost. was used as the Australian end of an air shuttle service from Java. Hundreds of evacuees were ferried to Broome in Dutch, American and Australian military and civil aircraft, including flying boats of Qantas Empire Airways. By the end of that month the town was overflowing with military personnel and refugees. Most of the people were there waiting for flights to continue their journey elsewhere. During the final week of February 1942, it is estimated more than 7,000 people passed through Broome and, on a single day, at least 57 aircraft landed there. It was a tiny pearling port untouched and far removed from the devastation of the Second World War, a transit stop on the escape route for refugees fleeing the Japanese advance in the Netherlands East Indies. Broome was a place of rest and revival before refugees and war victims could continue their travels to safer places. However, on 3 March 1942 all that changed. Without warning, Japanese fighter planes attacked the quiet coastal community. The invasion lasted no more than 20 minutes, during which time 25 Allied aircraft were destroyed and as many as 100 people died. Another 30 crew and passengers, mostly military personnel, were lost when an American Liberator bomber was shot down shortly after taking off. Many victims were Dutch women and children, refugees and escapees who were packed into flying boats on the harbour either waiting to be ferried ashore or waiting to depart for the southern states. Young Pilot Officer Frank Russell described the scene as one of 'ghastly devastation'. He said:",158,Statements On Indulgence
164,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (19:04,"In February 1942, Broome, Western Australia,Our flying boats all over the place were sending up huge clouds of black smoke. Burning petrol in sinister patches floated all over the sea … All around us there fell a ceaseless stream of tracer bullets. Several of the Dutch Dorniers had been full of women and kids, waiting to take off to … safety. It was safety and a new life to which these women and children were running, which they so desperately sought and which they craved, but unfortunately it was not to happen on that sad and unfortunate day. This unexpected attack, just short of two weeks after Darwin was bombed, robbed them of the new life, a new beginning. Due to the circumstances of many of those killed, precisely how many people died in the raid and who they were will never ever be known. Only 30 bodies were ever recovered from the water. The bodies of the Dutch victims, initially buried at Broome, were moved to the Perth War Cemetery at Karrakatta in 1950. Many were not identified and lie in unmarked graves. This anniversary is an important occasion. It is an important and sad occasion for Australia and elsewhere, and is one we should respect now and always remember. Lest we forget. Ms O'DWYER (Higgins) (19:07): I also rise to commemorate the bombing of Broome during World War II. I know this motion is very dear to the member for Durack, Mr Barry Haase, as the member who represents this electorate. During the war, the men and women of Australia had comforted themselves with the fact that our geography as an island nation was one of the keys to our security. An attack on mainland Australia by foreign powers at this time was unthinkable. Yet all this changed on 19 February 1942 when 242 Japanese aircraft launched an attack on Darwin. I know my friend the member for Solomon, Natasha Griggs, has spoken before in this place about that bombing. Darwin was a strategic and significant Allies base in efforts to combat Japanese aggression in Ambon, Timor and Java. With two airfields and a harbour, it was home to the Royal Australian Army, Air Force and Navy with five destroyers, an aircraft carrier and more than 25 aircraft. In this attack at least 292 people were killed and more than 300 people injured, although there is some dispute as to whether the numbers of dead and wounded are significantly higher than this. This was the start of more than 60 attacks on the north-west of Australia by the Japanese. Today we commemorate in particular the bombing of Broome, which was bombed four times between March 1942 and August 1943, first on 3 March 1942 and subsequently on 20 March 1942, 27 August 1942 and, finally ,on 16 August 1943. At the time it was bombed, Broome was being used to shelter Dutch civilians fleeing from Java as the Japanese descended from the north. The close proximity, active airport and sheltered harbour made it a logical choice for civilians and personnel and, at its peak, it played host to more than 7,000 or up to 8,000 such evacuees. As such, when the first bombing occurred on 3 March 1942, it posed a serious humanitarian as well as military predicament. Although Broome housed all of the infrastructure requirements essential to accept the humanitarian intake, it lacked the military requirements to defend itself sufficiently from attack. Because of this, it did not take much for the Japanese to inflict heavy casualties with an air assault of 12 aircraft. At the time, there were 16 US, Australian and Dutch flying boats stationed in Broome Harbour. Due to the composition of the harbour, only three of those could moor at any one time. The rest were forced to wait outside of the harbour. This does not mean, though, that we did not have any defence. One of the very celebrated stories of the bombing of Broome is of a Dutch pilot, Gus Winckel, who brought down a Japanese aircraft with a hand-held machine gun. Another aircraft was also dispatched; it ditched at sea off the coast of Rotty Island. During the attack, a number of Allied aircraft were destroyed, including many passenger aircraft. It is estimated that approximately 70 people died in the bombing, including 32 on board the one US Liberator bomber as it attempted to take off and including many women and children. One can only imagine the horrors that must have been witnessed on that day-fear and terror on an unimaginable scale. Following the attack, RAAF Pilot Officer Frank Russell, who had been on one of the flying boats during the raids, wrote of the attack: ...a scene of ghastly devastation. Our flying boats all over the place were sending up huge clouds of black smoke. Burning petrol in sinister patches floated all over the sea … All around us there fell a ceaseless stream of tracer bullets. Several of the Dutch Dorniers had been full of women and kids, waiting to take off to safety. We can only hope and pray that these events are never replicated on our shores again. Of the remaining three attacks launched by the Japanese on Broome, only the second resulted in further casualties, with one person being killed. The rest of the attacks damaged infrastructure, such as the airfield. Today we honour those who were tragically killed-men, women and children who were brutally taken as they went about their daily lives. We honour those defence personnel who sought to defend us against aggression, who gave their lives so that we may live in a free and democratic country. We honour those who saved lives on that day and who rebuilt the city in the days and weeks following. We also honour the fighting spirit that today still beats strongly in the Australian men and women who serve in our defence forces. We remember-lest we forget. Indirect Tax Laws Amendment (Assessment) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. and speak on the Indirect Tax Laws Amendment (Assessment) Bill 2012, which was introduced into the House just a couple of weeks ago on Wednesday 29 February by the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and now Assistant Treasurer, the member for Lindsay. I say at the outset that the coalition will be supporting this bill. This is a piece of legislation that updates and improves the substantive indirect tax legislation in a number of respects. As the then parliamentary secretary outlined in his second reading speech, this flows from a Board of Taxation review of the legal framework for the administration of the goods and services tax in particular. That review was announced in June 2008 and reported just over a year later. It made 46 recommendations aimed at changing aspects of the tax in a number of respects. There are four schedules. The first aims to harmonise self-assessment regimes across the GST, the luxury car tax, the wine equalisation tax and fuel tax credits. In summary, it creates a self-assessment system based on that in place for income tax assessments. As we know, that has been outlined in some detail by the former parliamentary secretary and in the explanatory memorandum. I will not go through all the detail of it and detain the chamber on that issue tonight. Schedule2 simply allows taxpayers on a GST or a fuel return to take into account",161,Statements On Indulgence
165,Mr Tony Smith (Casey) (19:12,"On behalf of the opposition, it is my pleasure to riseminor errors made in previous returns. Essentially, this places in legislation and codifies what is the common-sense and everyday practice of the commissioner, who has had power in this respect. It is a sensible reform. Schedule3 codifies the current accepted practice that luxury car tax and wine equalisation tax are part of the net amount of GST under the Goods and Services Tax Act. Schedule 4, as is so often the case with bills similar to tax law amendment bills, makes a number of minor changes to the tax law and some corrections of anomalies and removal of redundant provisions. This bill is part of the general evolution towards a self-assessment system and it makes common-sense changes. The coalition supports this bill. And can I say in conclusion that, as so often the case, I and the member for Blair have the happy duty of speaking on matters with which we agree. I notice that like an old television series he is here again, on a matter of technical tax administration. On behalf of the opposition, I commend to bill to the House. is like Abbott and Costello, if I can use that appropriately-but I think that little reference is dear to his heart! As the member for Casey has outlined, the Indirect Tax Laws Amendment (Assessment) Bill 2012 is common-sense tax reform and I support the bill. There is no doubt about it, this government has a record of tax reform. The number of TLAB bills that we have had in the four years I have been in this place is extraordinary. Since our 2008 budget was delivered by the Treasurer, the Hon. Wayne Swan, we have delivered three rounds of personal income tax cuts totalling $47 billion. We have seen our secure and sustainable pension reforms, and the Hon. Jenny Macklin, the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, played an important role in the historic rise in pensions. We saw in the 2010 budget what we called the Stronger, Fairer, Simpler package of reforms in relation to tax law reforms, particularly in non-renewable resources and support for growth across the economy. In the last 12 months we have announced and delivered many of them. Further measures which had been identified by tax reviews have been included in the budget, including what we have seen as a necessary boost to workforce participation. We are taking a million people out of the tax system with our Clean Energy Future package. I think that is a particularly important reform, increasing the tax threshold from $6,000 to over $18,000. This bill is in the same context and on the same pathway of reform measures that this government is undertaking. I have to say that on some of these reforms, particularly those I would call the more esoteric or obtuse, if not indeed boring, tax law reforms there is agreement by both sides of politics on common sense. Our indirect taxes, including the GST, will be self-assessed like income tax under this legislation, which aims to simplify the law. The member for Casey is right, there is some codification here and it gives a legislative basis in schedules 2 and 3. Also, in schedule 1 there is harmonisation of the income tax system of self-assessment. Many people do not realise that we self-assess. In large part they think that a man or woman from the Australian Taxation Office comes down and does it. In fact, most people self-assess and most people get it right-they are actually quite honest about how they assess their own tax. There are 2.7 million small businesses in Australia and a population of just under 23 million, and self-assessment obviously works. I do not see people on the rampage, saying, 'Let's get rid of self-assessment.' So what we are seeing here is that the self-actuating",163,Bills
166,Mr Neumann (Blair) (19:16,"The member for Casey and I seem to be a double act. Itsystem for GST, luxury car tax, wine equalisation tax and fuel tax credits harmonises with our self-assessment of income tax. As the member for Casey correctly stated, it is recommended by the Board of Taxation Review, and that is the harmonisation specified in schedule 1. There has been a history of this and I think that this will improve the tax system as contemplated over a number of years. Going back decades, this type of thing was envisaged, so this is a particularly important measure. The second schedule is important as well because it is legislating the commission's power to make determinations, allowing a taxpayer to take into account his or her tax or a fuel tax return for the current year. In the past we saw them having to make amendments to correct errors in earlier years on a current return. So it really is a practical way. That is what has been happening in the past and this schedule is designed to make sure the commissioner has a legislative basis for allowing this to take place. It is not wrong that in fact people make errors in their previous returns or in their current returns, and so this is an important change to ease the simplicity and the regulative burden on people as well. The third schedule changes the GST law to confirm that the luxury car tax and the wine equalisation tax are part of what is called the net amount, because in the past there was some uncertainty. The LCT and WET acts both provided that the amounts paid were added to or subtracted from the net amount. The definition does not specifically mention this in the current legislation, so there are some changes to be made there. It is a matter of legislative certainty. These are important reforms. These things make a difference in the lives of businesspeople. Anyone who has been in business knows how important it is to ease the regulatory burden and make life simpler when they do their taxes. Anyone who runs a business-and I was running businesses for two decades before I was elected to this place-knows how important it is to get the tax law right. I know how much time. I spent dealing with accountants and how important it is to make sure that the tax law is simpler, fairer and stronger for our whole economy and community. That is the how we pay our bills and provide the roads, schools and hospitals. That is how we make sure that we can take one million people out of the tax system. That is the way we can make sure we have a decent society that provides services to people. I commend the minister and congratulate him on becoming a minister. He is a good friend of mine and a former parliamentary secretary. We were elected at the same time and I think he is worthy of the honour. Well done. and I add my congratulations on his new role. (19:23): Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. I take the opportunity to thank those members who have contributed to this debate: the member for Casey and the member for Blair. The member for Blair, of course, is one of the great contributors to these amendments to the tax law and a very avid contributor to matters relating to taxation. The Indirect Tax Laws Amendment (Assessment) Bill 2012 establishes a system of selfassessment for the administration of the indirect tax laws as well as making other changes to the indirect tax laws. The amendments in this bill draw together a number of improvements to the tax laws that have been contemplated by governments for almost 20 years. These include furthering the tax laws improvement project of 1995 and introducing greater standardisation",164,Bills

168,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay,"Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation)across the administration regimes for different taxes through the adoption of the tax code conventions. Schedule1 will simplify the tax system by allowing taxpayers to self-assess their indirect tax liabilities and entitlements for the GST, luxury car tax, wine equalisation tax and fuel tax credits. It will implement recommendations arising from the Board of Taxation's 2008 review of the legal framework for the administration of the goods and services tax. The schedule harmonises the self-actuating system of GST, luxury car tax, wine equalisation tax and fuel tax credits with the self-assessment system of income tax by adopting well-established principals from the income tax self-assessment system where appropriate, with some modifications to allow for the special features of indirect taxes. The provisions use tax code conventions and are drafted generically so they can be applied across all taxes. Under the current self-actuating system, taxpayers are automatically liable for indirect tax liabilities or entitlements based on the liabilities and entitlements attributable to a tax period. Under the new assessment regime, taxpayers will only be liable to pay or be entitled to a refund of the amount stated in their assessment. Taxpayers can continue to report their indirect tax liabilities and entitlements in the same manner as they currently do. In most cases lodgement of a Business Activity Statement will trigger a self assessment. The commissioner will be taken to have made an assessment and the Business Activity Statement will be treated as a notice of assessment. Taxpayers who are required who are required to lodge a Business Activity Statement will continue to do so on the same due dates and will be required to pay their liabilities on the same day. Consistent with the income tax assessment regime the commissioner may amend an assessment within a four-year period of review. Likewise taxpayers may apply for an amendment within that same four-year period. An assessment may only be amended outside the period of review in certain circumstance. An amendment in the period of review will give rise to a refreshed period of review of four years in relation to the particular that was amended. To minimise the administrative and compliance costs for both taxpayers and the commissioner, some features of the existing regime have been preserved and where necessary existing administrative practices have been legislated. These changes to the administrative framework for indirect taxes will formalise the administration process for the indirect tax laws and help reduce the complexities associated with having different administrative regimes for indirect and income taxes. Greater standardisation between the administration regimes of the two taxes will result in lower compliance costs for taxpayers. It will also decrease the need for advisers and administrators to have specialist knowledge of the multiple tax administration provisions. The majority of the amendments in schedule commence on 1 July 2012. The amendments, which remove provisions no longer applicable following the introduction of the new assessment regime, commence on 1 January 2017. Schedule2 legislates the commissioner's power to make a determination to allow a taxpayer to take into account on his or her return for the current tax period minor errors made on certain returns for preceding tax periods. The amendments contained in this schedule ensure that the commissioner may, in a self-assessment system, continue to allow taxpayers to correct mistakes in a current tax period rather than needing to amend an earlier assessment. Schedule3 confirms that that luxury car tax and wine equalisation tax are part of the calculation of the net amount under the GST act. The luxury car tax and wine equalisation tax acts already provide that payments and refunds of amounts under these acts are to be added to or subtracted from the net amount calculated under the GST act. However these amounts are not specifically identified in the definition of net amount in the GST act. There will be no practical changes. Both taxpayers and the commissioner have treated these amounts as part of the net amount in accordance with the luxury car tax and wine equalisation tax acts. Schedule4 corrects technical or drafting defects, removes anomalies and addresses unintended outcomes to ensure that the taxation law operates as intended. This is part of the governments ongoing commitment to the care and maintenance of the tax system and I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Corporations Legislation Amendment (Audit Enhancement) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. member for North Sydney on the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Audit Enhancement) Bill 2012. I will state at the outset that the coalition will be supporting this bill. The bill proposes changes to the law relating to the auditing industry. It proposes changes to the frequency with which auditors must be rotated, allowing for a two-year extension of an auditor's term, which currently sits at five years. Further, it introduces transparency reports for larger auditors, which will help prospective and existing clients to be more fully informed about the operations of their potential auditor. The bill also changes the responsibilities of the Financial Reporting Council to remove duplication between the operational roles of that council and of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, in respect of the audit independence function. Following this change, audit independence powers will reside solely with ASIC under the existing powers. Finally, the bill gives ASIC the power to issue audit efficiency reports. The bill is an incremental but nevertheless worthwhile improvement to the audit process. It has the widespread support of the audit industry. The legislation is the outcome of a Treasury review of the quality of audits in Australia. This was instigated following the global financial crisis in 2008. This review found that the legal framework was, overall, robust and stable and was in line with international best practice and no fundamental changes were required. This is a tick of approval for the former Howard government's major audit reforms, which were introduced through the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Act some eight years ago, in 2004. The issues addressed in this bill are very much tweaking rather than wholesale, for those reasons.",165,Bills
169,Mr Tony Smith (Casey) (19:29,"I rise to speak on behalf of the shadow Treasurer andWith respect to each of the schedules, schedule 1 PartI deals with auditor rotation. It retains the existing mandatory five-year auditor rotation but allows for a two-year extension of the terms under certain conditions. The extension is only to be available when recommended by the company's audit committee where that committee is satisfied that an extension is consistent with maintaining the quality of the audit and there is no conflict of interest. The recommendation of the audit committee must be by formal resolution and in writing. There is no obligation on company directors to accept the audit committee recommendation to extend an auditor's term. The advantage of this measure is that it could be beneficial for a business to retain expertise about a client and the audit for a longer period of time. This would particularly be the case for a complex business where a significant amount of in-house knowledge is required to fully understand and monitor the business activities. For the auditing firms, this measure will reduce the cost burden incurred in regularly rotating between clients. Of course there is a danger that allowing an audit firm to remain for longer with a client may jeopardise the separation of the interests between the client and the audit firm. On balance it is judged by the industry that the option of extending the time that an auditor remains with a client from five to a maximum of seven years will preserve the chief objective of the rotation rule, which is to maintain the independence of auditors and prevent them from being captured by clients. Part II of schedule 1 deals with transparency reports. It will require audit firms to publish an annual report of their activities, if they provide services for 10 or more listed companies, listed registered schemes, authorised deposit-taking institutions and insurance companies. The objective is to improve the transparency of the audit activities of larger audit firms. Many firms are partnerships and so are not required to make public a range of information on their activities, as they are shielded by their business's structure. This new requirement will help prospective and existing clients to be more fully informed about the operations of the auditor. It will help identify potential conflicts of interest or any potential issues which may arise from one firm being dominant in one particular business sector. The actual disclosure requirements are not contained within the bill and will instead be dealt with by the way of regulation. The coalition trust that the final regulations will strike the appropriate balance between necessary disclosure and regulatory burden. A range of matters have been foreshadowed in the explanatory memorandum as being required in disclosure regulations. These include, firstly, the auditor's legal structure and ownership; secondly, information about any networks of firms to which the audit firm is linked; thirdly, information about the auditor's governance structure; fourthly, information about the internal quality control system of the auditor; and, fifthly, details of when the last reviews of the auditor took place. This measure will impact a relatively small number of larger auditors. Whilst this provision adds further cost to compliance for those affected auditors, it is not expected to be particularly onerous, as the required information should be readily accessible. While the coalition is philosophically opposed to more regulation for the sake of it, in this case the costs to auditors are expected to be low and to be warranted by the benefits to the industry and to clients. Part1 of schedule 2 deals with audit independence and makes changes to the powers of the Financial Reporting Council, as I outlined at the beginning. It removes the audit independence function from the FRC, and in its place the FRC gains a greater role in advising the minister and the professional accounting bodies in relation to audit practice. This includes strategic policy advice and reports in relation to the quality of audits. As mentioned at the outset, this change will eliminate the current duplication that exists between the operational roles of the FRC and ASIC in respect of audit independence function. Following this change the audit independence powers will reside solely with ASIC under existing powers. This provision also broadens and more clearly identifies the FRC role in providing advice to the minister and accounting bodies. Removing overlaps and duplications in the functions of government bodies is of course always a good thing and viewed as a sensible step by the coalition. Part2 of schedule 2 deals with audit deficiency notifications. It expands ASIC's powers to enforce the quality of audits by granting new powers to issue audit deficiency reports on specific auditors. These may be issued where specific failures are identified during an ASIC audit inspection. Currently those inspection reports are confidential, and ASIC reports on the aggregate of its inspections. The new power will not compel ASIC to publicly report deficiencies; it merely gives it the right to do so at its discretion. Where significant weakness is found in quality control or in the conduct of an audit which may be detrimental to the quality of the audit, ASIC may issue such a report after six months of the auditor being notified of the deficiency, but only if the auditor has not undertaken remedial action. The coalition is always wary about expanding the powers of regulators unless it can be shown to be clearly in the public interest. In this case, ASIC is simply being given powers to make public the information it collects about the performance of particular auditors. It is in effect a power to name and shame. This provides a powerful incentive for an audit firm to fix any organisational problems within that prescribed time frame. The coalition supports this initiative. Finally, under the current law, ASIC is prevented from directly communicating with an audited body or its audit committee in the exercise of its functions in relation to an audit. This means it cannot make the auditor body aware of any concerns it may have with the quality of the audit. The bill gives the power to ASIC to communicate directly with company directors, management or the audit committee if significant matters regarding the quality of the audit are identified during an audit inspection. The argument is that it is in the interests of an audited body to know if there are issues with the audit being conducted on its operations. Naturally, the coalition supports this change as well. As I said at the outset in delivering this on behalf of the shadow Treasurer, the coalition is supportive of the bill. We are very happy to support well-reasoned legislation where consultation has been extensive and the industry is in agreement, and this is one rare occasion where that is the case. On behalf of the shadow Treasurer, I commend the bill to the House. While I have the opportunity, I congratulate the new Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, who is just getting some last-minute instructions. I congratulate him on his appointment to that role. I think all members of the House would agree that the member for Oxley comes to that role with extensive experience from his time in parliament. I will miss him as the chair of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, of which I am a member, and I would like to think-but I cannot be sure-that he will miss me. Legislation Amendment (Audit Enhancement) Bill 2012. I thank the member for Casey for his contribution and I echo his comments in congratulating the member for Oxley, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, for his elevation. It is well earned and well deserved",167,Bills
170,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (19:41,"I rise to speak in support of the Corporationsand it is nice to know there is a safe pair of hands from next door to my electorate looking after some of the money. On a slightly different note, I received a text from my brother while I was sitting here. He has just taken my sister-in-law Katie to the hospital where I think they are about to produce a new Perrett. I wish them well in that endeavour. My brother Tim and my sister-in-law Katie are, I am sure, like everyone and would wish a new Perrett to come into the world. I return to the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Audit Enhancement) Bill 2012. Australia's financial markets have earned a reputation as fair and transparent over many years through the great efforts of Australian governments, both Labor and Liberal. These markets are supported by confident and informed investors and consumers. The Corporations Act 2001 sets out a regulatory framework to ensure that fairness and transparency are maintained in our financial markets. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission was set up under this act as a trusted independent regulator. Among its many activities, ASIC maintains a register of companies and a register of auditors and liquidators. Many advanced economies have a system in place that requires mandatory auditor rotation. Auditor rotation helps prevent a situation where an auditor becomes too familiar with the client and the independence of an audit therefore could, on some occasions, be questioned. Currently under the act a listed company must rotate auditors at least every five years. This ensures that auditors do not cosy up to companies by giving favourable audits in order to secure their business for years into the future. In some circumstances, however, an auditor rotation can impact negatively on the quality of the audit. For example, an auditor may have developed specific knowledge and experience which, if removed from the auditing process, would reduce the quality of the audit. This bill before the chamber will enable directors of a listed company to apply to extend the rotation period by up to two years. The company will need to prove the extension is about maintaining the quality of the audit and that it does not give rise to any conflict of interest. Directors will also be required to disclose any extension of the auditor rotation period to ASIC. The auditor will also be required to agree to the extension. This amendment will therefore provide greater flexibility for listed companies with the auditor rotation requirements and will bring Australia into line with international best practice. This bill also introduces other measures to improve the auditing process. For example, the bill requires audit firms to publish an annual transparency report. This will apply to those firms that audit at least 10 Australian entities, including listed companies, listed registered schemes, authorised deposit-taking institutions and insurance companies. Because of the structure of most auditing firms, which are normally set up as partnerships, it is difficult to access basic information, such as ownership, governance and business structure. This amendment will ensure clients or potential clients can obtain factual information about these auditing firms. I understand that the EU and the US already require audit firms to publish regular transparency reports. Transparency reports will be required to be published online on the auditor's website within four months of the end of the year and a copy will be required to be lodged with ASIC. The specific information required in the report will be developed by regulation. However, it will include items like the firm's governance structure, internal quality-control systems, independence practices, fees and the entities that are audited. Information may be omitted from the report if its disclosure is likely to cause unreasonable prejudice to the auditor. This bill also amends the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to remove some duplication in the roles of ASIC and the Financial Reporting Council. The FRC will take on a role of providing the minister with strategic policy advice and reports in relation to the quality of audits conducted by Australian auditors. They advise on the systems and processes used by auditors to comply with their obligations. ASIC will exclusively take on the role of monitoring auditor independence requirements, removing the current duplication with the Financial Reporting Council. This bill will also give ASIC power to disclose an audit deficiency in relation to specified failures by an audit firm. This would be issued where ASIC believes it is a sign of flaw in the audit firm's quality-control system. Auditors will then have 21 days before the report is published to comment on the deficiency. This is one of those occasions when government needs to apply the gentle stick of regulation. Removing the veil and shining a light on the practices of auditors will lead to a better, more independent audit system-something that, as I said from the outset, is crucial to a thriving and robust financial system. I commend the bill to the House. Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (19:46): I rise to speak in support of the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Audit Enhancement) Bill 2012. As the previous speakers in this debate have noted, this bill aims to improve the quality of auditing in Australia's firms. The process of auditing is absolutely critical to the open, transparent system of corporate governance that we in Australia enjoy. The bill aims to strike a balance between ensuring that auditors understand the companies they are auditing-and certainly we all understand that companies have become steadily more complex over recent years, so understanding a company's accounts is a tougher job than it was in previous generations-and ensuring that auditors do not find themselves in a conflict-of-interest situation. This is good, in the long run, for our corporate system. It is also good for the auditors, who I am sure would not want to find themselves conflicted. The bill will allow directors of a listed company or a listed registered scheme to extend the five-year auditor rotation period by up to two years, with the extensions consistent with maintaining the quality of the audit, and if it does not give rise to a conflict-of-interest situation. If the directors extend the auditor rotation period for a year they may, before the end of that year, extend it for another year. Australia's five-year auditor rotation period is consistent with that of countries such as Canada, China, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States. Each of these countries aims to strike that balance I spoke about-the balance between an auditor's depth and breadth of knowledge of a company's accounts and ensuring that they are not captured by the firm. The bill also introduces the requirement for audit firms to publish an annual transparency report if they conduct audits of 10 or more Australian entities over the following categories: listed companies, listed registered schemes, authorised deposit-taking institutions and insurance companies. That, again, follows common practice in the European Union and the United States. This transparency report is important because audit firms tend to be structured as partnerships. That means there is less information publicly available about those audit firms than would be the case if, for example, audit firms were corporations. The regulations will provide details about the information that has to be provided in the transparency report. It will have to be posted on the auditor's website within four months of the end of the year to which it relates, and a copy must be lodged with ASIC on or before the day it will be published. It is important in the context of considering these corporate governance reforms also to recognise other ways in which we improve the quality of corporate governance in Australia. It was my pleasure on 23 February to open the Australian Institute of Management's office in Childers Street in Civic in my electorate. That office is a first-rate facility for promoting high-quality management in the ACT with breakout rooms, a highquality library and facilities for providing training to improve not only private sector but also public sector management in the ACT. The Australian Institute of Management has also produced an important report recently, Gender diversity in management, which looks at another core corporate governance issuethat is, the share of women on boards. The report notes that if you look at the top 200 ASX boards, as at 31 January 2012 only 14 per cent of those board members are women. If you look at executive key management line roles, only four per cent are held by women. If you look at women in executive key management support roles, only 24 per cent are women. The report considers the question as to whether boardroom gender quotas would be appropriatethis was a proposal made by Elizabeth Broderick in 2009-and recognises there are other countries that have mandated corporate quotas: Norway, Spain, Iceland, France and the Netherlands. It also recognises the countries that are proposing them such as Belgium, Canada and Italy. I would like to acknowledge much of the important work that has been done within my electorate on ensuring greater gender diversity on boards and in ensuring that women are represented in Australian business as they should be. I would like to pay particular tribute to Julie McKay of UN Women Australia, who spoke extremely articulately at a recent forum at the National Press Club about the importance of raising the share of women in key management roles. Julie spoke also about the fact that these quotas are often initially opposed but are often necessary to bring about cultural change. That cultural change is critical if we are to ensure that Australian companies are as representative as the communities they serve. We have organisations that are dedicated to serving women. The ACT Women's Legal Centre is one of those. These organisations have recognised that providing greater gender diversity is an important part of ensuring a stronger Australia. Finally, I would like to go to the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Audit Enhancement) Bill, which amends the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act. This removes the existing auditor independence function from the Financial Reporting Council and gives the FRC a role in providing the minister and the professional accounting bodies strategic policy advice and reports on the quality of audits conducted by Australian auditors. It gives ASIC the power to issue a public audit deficiency report in relation to an individual firm and allows it to communicate directly with an audited body on significant matters that are identified during the course of the exercise of ASIC's statutory functions in an audit. I congratulate Mr Ripoll on his ascension to the role of Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. I am sure that he will continue to work hard in this area. It is one that he understands perhaps better than anyone else in the parliament. He will work diligently on the issue of gender representation on boards, an issue that is important to me and to many people in this place. I commend the bill to the House. all honourable members who took part in the debate on the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Audit Enhancement) Bill 2012 and say thank you very much to those who spoke for their kind remarks; they are much appreciated. Australia's audit regulation framework is robust and it is stable. It plays a critical role in the functioning of our economy by producing effective audits that provide a necessary external check on the integrity of financial statements. It is necessary from time to time, however, to examine the framework and make adjustments that respond to the new challenges our economy faces. This bill makes a number of improvements to the audit regulation framework, to ensure that it is operating as best as it can. The bill provides flexibility for directors in the auditor rotation requirements. Auditor rotation is necessary to maintain audit independence but in some circumstances it can result in a loss of knowledge and expertise that is detrimental to the quality of the audit. The bill strikes a balance between these two factors by allowing directors to extend the five-year auditor rotation period by up to two years, if it is consistent with maintaining the quality of the audit and does not give rise to any conflicts of interest. The bill also introduces a requirement for audit firms performing significant audits to publish an annual transparency report. Firms will be subject to this requirement if they conduct audits of ten or more Australian listed companies, listed registered schemes, authorised deposit taking institutions or insurance companies. The bill removes unnecessary duplication in the work of the financial reporting council, the FRC, and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, by removing the existing auditor independence function from the FRC and in its place giving the FRC a role of providing the minister and the professional accounting bodies strategic policy advice and reports in relation to the quality of the audits conducted by Australian auditors. The bill provides ASIC with the power to issue public audit deficiency reports on individual firms to increase the transparency and accountability of audit firms. Auditors will have the opportunity to remedy a failure and to provide comments on an audit deficiency report before the audit is published. Lastly, the bill allows ASIC to communicate directly with an audited body in relation to significant matters that it identifies during the course of the exercise of ASIC's statutory functions in relation to an audit. In summary, this bill will make improvement to Australia's audit regulation framework to ensure that it continues to foster high-quality audits that strengthen market confidence and also to ensure that the framework remains in line with international best practice. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.",169,Bills
171,Mr Ripoll (Oxley,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (19:54): I want to thankAustralian Floods not yet been averted. There are still communities on very grave flood watch alert in the Riverina and the situation is quite critical in those areas downstream where sandbagging has been done and people have been evacuated and now they are just waiting, watching, hoping and praying. Elsewhere in the Riverina there is not one nook, not one cranny of the electorate which was not affected by the rains of the weekend before last. Rainfall which fell was anywhere from 250mm right up to a record 400mm which was dumped on Marrar and other parts of the Riverina. It had a very serious effect on all of the ephemeral streams, and certainly the Murrumbidgee River, from which the electorate takes its name. There were places evacuated, including Hanwood, Gundagai, Lockhart, North Wagga, The Rock, Tumut, Uranquinty and Yoogali, just after that initial weekend downpour of rain. The Rock is not in my electorate, it is in Sussan Ley's Farrer electorate, but it was very severely flood affected, as was the community of Lockhart in the Farrer electorate. Elsewhere we have had floods in Northern Victoria in Nathalia, and the situation has been quite critical. While we have had the very worse of weather we have also seen the very best in human nature and people have rallied together magnificently for the cause. I am going to single out the State Emergency Service's regional controller James McTavish. James is a former army officer and he has had a lot of experience with flooding, certainly he was involved heavily in the relief efforts in the Queensland floods of 2010 and 2011, as well as the Moree floods of more recent times. He was a calm and reasoned person in a time of crisis. It was through his wonderful direction and coordination that we have avoided any serious injuries-any injuries whatsoever to speak of. Certainly, there were no fatalities. That is a tremendous thing, because I know in the 2010-11 Queensland floods we had a huge number of deaths, including many in the Grantham township. We averted that. At 9:30 pm last Monday night, James McTavish made the call for the extraordinary move to evacuate the central business district and central Wagga Wagga area. It meant that 8,000 people needed to move homes in the middle of the night. He called on the efforts of the Army, the Air Force and the Navy. We are blessed to have those three services present in our city. They went to work doorknocking. The alert went out on telephones and word spread very quickly that central Wagga Wagga was being evacuated. It as an extraordinary move. It was a big call for the SES to make and certainly a big call for James McTavish to make, but he made the right call. As events turned out, the flood did not go over the levee bank, which is structurally positioned to withstand a flood of 10.7 metres. The flood peaked at 10.6. We were 10 centimetres away from disaster. Wagga Wagga dodged a bullet. There were suspect areas of the levee bank, one where a wombat had dug a hole and one where another hole had appeared. The trucks went in and dumped a heap of dirt and there was much sandbagging and reinforcement of the levee bank in those areas. There were other patches where the levee bank, which was first constructed in 1962 and obviously upgraded since then, was at risk. We ended up being 10 centimetres from disaster. Had the water started to go over the top of the levee bank it would have taken probably only five minutes for the levee bank to give way. Pretty soon we would have had a 100-metre wide gaping hole with the muddy river water",173,Bills
172,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (19:58,"The situation with the floods in the Riverina hasswirling through in the middle of night, and had that call not been made it would have meant a huge loss of life. There has been criticism of the SES and, unfortunately, of the decision to evacuate Wagga Wagga. But it was the right decision to make and anyone who wants to criticise should consider themselves very lucky that we have someone such as James McTavish in the position of SES controller. He made that brave call and it was the right decision. The Premier of New South Wales, Mr Barry O'Farrell, visited on Tuesday. When he arrived in Wagga Wagga he had an aerial tour by helicopter. When he landed in the area near the local emergency control area, hundreds of people had swarmed in to start sandbagging. It was an amazing scene. I have never seen anything like it in all my life. There were children from as young as seven and eight, school girls, school boys, people right up to the age of 80, people who probably properly belonged in nursing homes were out there holding bags open whilst men and women, some of whom were pregnant, were busy shovelling sand. It was just like a scene out of a disaster movie. But you see the best in people in the worse of times. Wagga Wagga people rallied magnificently to fill up sandbags faster than was possible, because we ran out of dirt. Pretty soon the sand was replaced by loam. Trucks then had to go onto farms elsewhere to find anything we could put into the sandbags to put in front of shops and businesses in the central business district and in front of homes in the area, which looked as though it was going to be inundated. We were very lucky in Wagga Wagga. Not so lucky were the people of Ungarie. When I went to West Wyalong on the Monday morning to do constituent interviews, Ungarie had been evacuated overnight. Ungarie is not a prosperous community and their homes received a huge amount of water from Humbug Creek. It is not the first time in recent years that Humbug Creek has overflowed, but the 300 residents of Ungarie had been evacuated and were being housed in the West Wyalong sports stadium. Despite the fact that some of these people who, as I say, are not the most prosperous of people, got out with only the shirts on their backs and despite the fact that kids had lost their toys, families had lost their precious belongings, had furniture destroyed and everything else that is associated with flood waters, these people had a marvellous resilience and a marvellous upbeat manner about them. I was just amazed, and also at the work of the Salvation Army, the Red Cross and St Vincent de Paul, who moved in very quickly and helped those people-found them clothes and bought them food. The West Wyalong community responded magnificently as did communities right throughout the Riverina. The Premier arrived and offered any state assistance that he could muster for the people of Wagga Wagga, as well as Ungarie, obviously, and also Tumut and Gundagai, which had also been flood affected and where businesses and homes had been inundated. We do not get too many prime ministerial visits in Wagga Wagga-in fact, I could almost name them on one hand for the past 50 years-but the Prime Minister visited Wagga Wagga on Wednesday, and the community was very pleased that she made her presence felt. After the briefing from James McTavish and other SES people we went into the nearby emergency control centre, where the Prime Minister was greeted by a woman who, despite having her North Wagga home completely inundated, had manned the fort there at the emergency control centre. She told the Prime Minister just how important it was to be with her colleagues at this time of crisis; much more important than to try to get whatever she could out of her home. She said, 'Well, it is gone anyway so I might as well be here with my colleagues.' That sort of summed up the spirit of the Wagga Wagga people. The Prime Minister had an aerial tour by helicopter to see for herself the damage caused. Then, while she stood on the Wiradjuri Bridge as the swirling muddy waters of the Murrumbidgee went underneath, she promised that she would do whatever she could from a government point of view to make sure that the people of the Riverina were not forgotten and, indeed, that the people of Farrer-as my colleague joins me here in the Federation Chamber-were not forgotten. To that end I do hope that the argy-bargy that is currently, unfortunately, existing between state and federal governments is sorted. Try as I might to sort out emergency payments for people via Centrelink they have not been forthcoming. I am not putting the blame on any government in particular, but it is a situation that just needs to be sorted. It is a situation that the opposition leader called on to be sorted today. I am sure the Prime Minister knows full well the extent of the damage caused; she saw it for herself. She saw the heartache in people's eyes. I saw it in her own eyes and I believed her when she said that she would do whatever she could to help the people of the Riverina and elsewhere in this flood calamity. I just hope that this situation between the state and federal government is sorted in the next 24 hours so that those emergency cash payments to families and individuals can come through, because some people do not have a cent to their name at the moment. Certainly, the people of Griffith had a situation which they have not faced before. The Mirrool Creek, which between the early 1980s and 2010 had not had a trickle of water in it at its source in the Temora district, all of a sudden became a 15-kilometre raging torrent-a lake moving steadily towards the Griffith area. Once it got into the irrigation channels and canals it created mayhem. Yenda had to be evacuated, it caused severe flooding around the Barellan area and the Griffith suburbs of Hanwood and Yoogali were not spared either. There were a lot of concerns by people in Yenda that they were evacuated too soon. That has been a problem that has been acknowledged by authorities in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. It is something that we will need to look at after all the waters subside and the clean up is done. Certainly a lot of people in Yenda were most annoyed that they had to leave their shops and their houses when the water was not really at its height and not really threatening, and then a period of dry time lasted for hours and hours. The area was cordoned off by police and local government officials and these people were not allowed to get into their homes, which caused some consternation which was expressed very passionately at regional community meetings held in Griffith. However, that said, there were no injuries or deaths in the Griffith area. It is better to be safe than sorry. The SES made the call they felt was right at the time. The important thing is that nobody was hurt in these dire flood events. The Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, visited Wagga Wagga yesterday and I was very pleased to have him there. He went to great pains to go there. In fact, I tried to talk Mr Abbott's office out of his coming to Wagga Wagga as I felt that people had been overwhelmed by the whole exercise. A lot of people were very fatigued. They had been out fighting the good fight against the floods. A lot of people had lost everything. Others had lost nothing but had the inconvenience and disruption of having their businesses affected and were making a lot of noise and fuss and bother about the fact that their lives had been disrupted. I tried to tell Mr Abbott's office that I thought it would perhaps be best to come at another time. But he was insistent on coming and, as it turned out, I am glad he did. Rather than it being some sort of media stunt or circus with a flyover using valuable SES equipment, helicopters and resources and rather than getting into people's way Mr Abbott rolled up his sleeves and offered to help. After a briefing at the SES he and I went out and helped the people of North Wagga. We walked right around the suburb dropping in on people. One of the people we met was an elderly fellow by the name of Allan Bell, who became quite emotional. Mr Abbott said, 'Gidday, mate, can I give you a hand?' Mr Bell appreciated it but then, upon the awful realisation that he had lost everything and also with Mr Abbott there and I suppose the glare of some of the national media who were there, he broke down and was quite emotional. And you can understand that. His feelings were reflected by people right throughout the city and throughout my electorate and also Sussan Ley's electorate of Farrer. We got in and lifted some things out and moved some fencing. We then went to the neighbour's place and pulled out carpets and got quite dirty. I know that the opposition leader is a driven man but he is also almost a machine in some ways. He got in and did a lot of heavy lifting and anybody who thought it was a media stunt I can guarantee you that my arms and legs are not feeling today as if it were a media stunt. We got in and helped and the locals appreciated it. They appreciated the fact that the Prime Minister came, they appreciated the fact that that Premier of New South Wales came, and they certainly appreciated the fact that the opposition leader got in and got dirty and helped out with a lot of the mop-up operations. The clean-up operations are going to take many months. A lot needs to be done right throughout the Riverina. I was at great pains to point out in any media interviews I did-and I did them right around the countryside, and I will come back to the media in a minute-that this was not just a Wagga Wagga flood, even though by Wagga Wagga flood standards it was very high. It did not reach the record of 10.97 metres, in 1844, when there was hardly anybody in Wagga Wagga, and it certainly did not reach the four peaks of 1870 and earlier. Fortunately it did not reach the big peak on 30 August 1974, when the Murrumbidgee River topped at 10.74 metres. Many people still living in Wagga Wagga will recall that flood. The good folk at North Wagga remember that flood, because they too were inundated then. But Wagga Wagga people are very resilient, as are Riverina people. They are very resilient and brave and they will bounce back from this. A lot of scorn was poured on the climate people who told us that the dams were never going to be full, the rivers were going to run dry and it would never rain again. There was a lot of comment about those sorts of things. People said, 'Well, look at us now.' It certainly is, as Dorothea Mackellar said, a land 'of droughts and flooding rains'. A fundraiser will be held in Wagga Wagga-but it will be a regional fundraiser, I am pleased to say-next month. Already many bands and musicians have promised their assistance. We are going to need a lot of government assistance as well as financial assistance from locals and corporate bodies to assist those people who have lost just about everything. What needs to be done with the levee bank? It needs to be heightened and strengthened. We cannot afford to take the risk of having to evacuate the city again. We certainly cannot afford to take the risk of a bigger flood than 10.7 metres coming down and destroying our beautiful and magnificent city. We also need to examine the releases from Burrinjuck into an already flooded Murrumbidgee Valley. In 2010, the Burrinjuck was allowed to flow out. We need to look at the capacity levels of Burrinjuck and manage that dam better so that we are not allowing huge releases into an already flooded system. As I say, we need to get cash payments to those who need them desperately, and we need to sort out that situation between the state and the federal government in the next 24 hours. I spoke about the media. I have to say that the media responded magnificently, both the commercial media and certainly ABC Riverina, which is managed by Christopher Coleman. My two sons, Nicholas and Alexander, and I went in and helped evacuate the radio station at ABC Riverina. There was a headline for you: 'Conservative politician helps rescue ABC'. Certainly they were appreciative of the fact that they were able to get up to higher groundindeed, to one of the evacuation centres at Wagga Wagga High School-and continue operations from there. Chris and his team did a magnificent job to keep updating people, from Gundagai down to Carrathool and Darlington Point and all places in between, on when they might expect river peaks and what to do in that dreadful time. The New South Wales Volunteer Rescue Association, an organisation which started in Wagga Wagga in 1950, when we had a particularly wet year with many, many floods, was magnificent, as was the Rural Fire Service, the police, the SES, the three branches of our Australian defence forces and all the local government bodies right throughout the Riverina. They were magnificent. Unfortunately, they spent a lot of time manning cordoned off areas and they copped a bit of abuse because of it, including of SES and VRA people. That was unfortunate. Sometimes patience gets tested in these times of crises. Some people copped a mouthful of abuse when perhaps a helping hand might have been better. But we will learn from this flood. Next time around, we will be better prepared. Certainly, I cannot speak highly enough of those people who chipped in and helped. It was an unprecedented event. You do not get 400 millimetres falling on a weekend and not cop a flood of this magnitude, but we will come out the other side stronger for it. I just hope that, in the weeks and months ahead, people pull together as they have in the last week or so to help those who have lost everything to mop up and clean up. I thank the House. his contribution, which was obviously detailed. On behalf of this side of the chamber, and as a Queenslander-with the member for Chifley, being from New South Wales, having to leave the chamber-I particularly know what it is like to have been flooded. My home town of St George has suffered three significant floods in the last two years. In my electorate of Moreton 5,200 properties had water go over the floorboards. SoI know how horrible it is. I know that the busy task of cleaning up has only just begun. It is easy for politicians to come out and see it at the start. I was lucky enough to go out to St George with the Prime Minister. I think it was the first time in 160 years that the Prime Minister had ever been there. Unfortunately she had to go back there almost a year later because of another flood. I know that it takes a long time to rebuild. I would give this word of advice to the member for Riverina, the member for Farrer and others: three months on from the disaster, the busyness of cleaning up and getting life back in order can often be the most dramatic time in a community, when people realise all of those photographs, all of those memories-all of those things that are so much a part of a person's life-have been washed away down the river. That can be a very dramatic and traumatic time for people, so I urge him to look out for those signs in his community. Once the community workers and the volunteers and the bands and the benefits have gone, that can",174,Statements On Indulgence
173,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (20:18,"I would like to commend the member for Riverina onbe a time when a federal member really has to walk around his or her community and offer their support. Thankfully, there were no fatalities. I listened with interest to the member's comments about the levee. I know those opposite sometimes have a problem with the other sort of flood levy, but a levee with a double 'e' is something. When you see that 10 centimetres can make a world of difference to a community, it is certainly to be looked at as much as possible in terms of protecting a community. It is always great to see that community spirit come out when times are tough. It is the great Australian tradition-or maybe it is the great human condition-that we do step up when times are tough. And, as I said, people will have a watching brief in the three months ahead. The thoughts of this side of the chamber are with the people of New South Wales who have experienced those floods and I wish them well with their rebuilding efforts. Ms LEY (Farrer) (20:21): I am pleased to join with my colleague the member for Riverina. A support the kind words of the member for Moreton and others in this place who represent communities affected by the flooding we have seen across New South Wales and Victoria in the last few weeks. Over half of the local government areas in Farrer have been declared natural disaster areas by the New South Wales government to date and I thank them for their speedy declarations. While these disaster declarations release some funds for the clean-up and the recovery ahead, many families and households need immediate financial assistance until they can get back on their feet. An Australian government disaster relief payment makes available through Centrelink an immediate emergency payment of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child. I note the comments from the Prime Minister when she visited the electorate of Riverina last week and said that her government stands ready to do all it can to assist. Let me just underline that point again: 'My government stands ready to do all it can to assist.' While there is some precedent on this payment being reliant on an application from the relevant state government, this does not have to be the major determining factor. Indeed, the payment can be at the discretion of the Commonwealth Attorney-General in the event of a major disaster having a significant impact on individuals. I want to emphasise the term 'major disaster'. That is what occurred when flooding hit both Queensland and Victoria last year-both states received immediate offers from the then Attorney-General for a disaster payment from the Commonwealth. So what does this government consider to be a major disaster? Well, I have a few examples. One property owner, Allan Carmichael, from Ivanhoe in the Central Darling Shire in the far west of New South Wales, received 21 inches of rain at his property Rosehill-that is, over half a metre of rain-during the flooding event. A week and a half later he and his family are still living in a caravan. That is a caravan they drove to Mildura to buy for $30,000-odd. Prior to that they were sleeping in the back of their Prado in the shed. The insurance assessor is due there on Thursday-that is, if he can actually get there across the flooded dirt roads of the far west. And, as of tonight, the Central Darling Shire is yet to receive a disaster declaration. Mr Carmichael and his wife have no access to state assistance and no access to insurance. And because the federal government does not feel inclined yet, they have no access to an emergency grant from Centrelink. The entire town of Urana was ordered to evacuate during the rain event and I visited there last Thursday. The mayor, Margaret Buntin, picked me up from the recreation ground, where I was lucky enough to land in a helicopter, and drove me around town. Carmen, who runs the pub, was standing in the doorway exhausted. When I said, 'What do you need?' she said, 'I just need the phones to work'-and we set that in train with Telstra. ThenI visited Ralph at the IGA. He had the shop open, which was pretty incredible considering where the water had been. And John at the takeaway food cafe said the water had come right up to the floorboards. Everyone was open, everyone was functioning and everyone was just getting on with it. The amazing thing that touched the hearts of the people of Urana was that the Rural Fire Service and the SES had travelled up from the South Coast, from Bega, from Bungendore, from Batemans Bay and from Merimbula. From those parts of the state, they drove trucks which took a long time to get such a significant distance across all those mountains. They came to Urana to help with the clean-up. I thank all those people from so far away. While they were helping with the clean-up, they had in some cases eight inches of rain falling in their own communities, so you can imagine where their minds were. I visited Lockhart where 60 homes were inundated and 12, or approximately half, of the businesses in the main street were flooded. Lockhart has a historical society that runs a museum. Those who have visited Lockhart know it is a town that treasures its very rich heritage, its past and its pioneers. I went into the historical society's museum. In anticipation of the flood, they had put a lot of things up above a certain level. But the flood this year in Lockhart was 10 inches higher than in the 2010 floods. No-one could possibly have expected it to be that savage so, of course, a lot of things got completely drenched including some amazing collections of birds eggs, some of them from the 1930s which were okay. I looked down the corridor of the museum and saw some volunteers, older ladies, with hairdryers drying the pages of Lockhart's heritage and history because of the importance of preserving it. That, I have to say, is an image that will stay with me for a long time. I then went to The Rock where 40 homes were inundated-that is 25 per cent of the homes of the entire township of The Rock. Ten businesses were flooded and three homes were completely destroyed. I think every single home, and there might be some 120, had some damage done, if not to the house then to the yard. I visited a lady who in December last year just moved back into her home after recovering from the previous floods and had lost it all once more. The stoicism and resilience of people in this position was quite incredible. Her daughter and her son-in-law were helping with the clean-up and were in another part of the town. It was one of those things that happened and they were just getting on with it. As I said, all these towns and local farms were also flooded in late 2010 and into early 2011. There were numerous other examples in Conargo, Morundah, Blighty. The town of Hay is bracing for flooding this weekend from the Murrumbidgee's downstream flows. There will be a community meeting tomorrow night to brief residents on the possible evacuation of their community. Boree Creek might ring a bell with some of my colleagues as the home town of the former member for Farrer, Tim Fischer. I want to mention Boree Creek particularly as an example of the emergency and, so far unreported, dangers so many communities faced the weekend before last. Soaked by 150 millimetres of rain in the lead-up, the same amount of rain again in one night-around six inches in the old mark-saw the entire town's residents evacuated at 5.30 in the morning. Over 80 per cent of the town went under and 21 out of 25 homes were inundated with up to a metre and a half of water. The SES was not involved here because their attention, understandably, was turned elsewhere. The Rural Fire Service captain and his deputy took charge that night as the normally serene creek broke its banks and flooded the town from the north. There was no official evacuation order or orderly exit here because there was no warning. It was just a couple of blokes who knew their community was in trouble and got them out of there before lives could be put at risk or lost. Do you know where they went in the early hours of the morning? The entire population of 75 residents in Boree Creek were systematically ferried up to the local Rural Fire Service captain Col Richens and his family's farmhouse four kilometres up the road on some higher land and that is where they stayed for the next 24 to 48 hours, the only safe haven available until it was clear to return and begin cleaning up the mess. Col has sent me the photographs and they are incredible. Some people are now back home, some are staying with their neighbours and some people are paying for other forms of accommodation. Some have insurance, some do not. Some people will cope okay emotionally and financially and some people will not. I am going to Boree Creek at the end of this week for a local barbecue and fundraiser with the local Rural Fire Service and I am wondering what to tell them when they ask: what is the federal government actually doing to assist them after this major disaster? I have been through all this before, in 2010. I have written letter after letter to the then Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, begging for assistance and making the point that just because you live in a really small town and you do not hit the national news and no-one has really ever heard of you, and just because no news crews and no TV cameras can get there, the things that happen to you are not any less important than the things that happen in major disaster zones. If we look at towns like Boree Creek, The Rock, Lockhart and Urana and Ivanhoe, in the far west-and Ivanhoe is just a tiny place on the rail line between Sydney and Broken Hill, not known, really, for anything very much; it is a beautiful part of my electorate and I love it, but I understand that no-one really has heard of it-it is so important that the scale of disaster is the scale that reflects the local community, its infrastructure, its people, its psyche, its heart and its soul. When you damage all of that to the extent that we have seen with these floodings, it does not matter if it was a cyclone in the north of Australia or a major event that covered hundreds of kilometres; it is still a disaster on an incredibly significant scale. I know that at times like this everyone's heart is in the right place. I know that there is bipartisanship. I know that the Prime Minister, in visiting Wagga Wagga, cared very much about the things that she saw, in the same way that the Leader of the Opposition cared about the things that he saw, as we all would as members of this place. But we have to recognise that, where there is assistance that a government program can provide, we need to step in and, when it comes to the Attorney-General's declaration, we just need to sign the bit of paper, to make the declaration, to pick up the phone and talk to state colleagues and to just please, please, make it happen. I am going to spend a lot of the next few weeks-and I take the point from the member for Moreton and the member for Riverina about how when the excitement, if I can call it that, fades away there is just so much left to do. And that is when I will be there for the communities that I represent. But I just want to be able to tell them that, yes, this small contribution from the federal government, a $1,000 Centrelink payment for each adult and $400 for a child, does not do much-in the case of the Carmichaels in Ivanhoe, who bought a caravan from Mildura which cost them $30,000, it is hardly going to make a difference-but it is just going to make a small difference. And it is also going to tell them that somebody here in Canberra, in our wonderful bureaucracy and in our wonderful government, cares that they have been hurt so badly by this thing. I just cannot imagine how it must feel to be flooded twice in less than two years. We know the mental effects that that has on people. I have talked to mostly women-because probably the men do not want to say too much-who say that now, when they go to bed and listen to the rain, they cannot sleep, and that they cannot imagine living in the same house that they have lived in all their lives, in the same community that their parents have always lived in, but they cannot sell the house. After all, if you have been flooded twice, who is going to buy your property? Your insurance company possibly will not insure you. What do you do? You just sort of operate in a horrible place in your mind where you cannot relax and you cannot feel a sense of security, which must be really horrible. So, while there is such goodwill in the parliament, I repeat the calls that I have been making and I know my colleagues have been making to the government to please help, because we do need help. Thank you. Federation Chamber adjourned at 20:34. My School Website (Question No. 406) Mr Pyne asked the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, in writing, on 31 May 2011: To date, what is the total cost of the development and construction of the My School website, and what does it cost per month to operate. Mr Garrett: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The total cost of the development and construction of version one of the My School website was approximately $2.1 million. That figure includes: website development and maintenance (approximately $1.45 million). It also includes the costs of geocoding school addresses into census collection districts; security testing of the website; legal services, in particular on privacy issues; focus groups; and staffing costs (approximately $0.65 million). The cost per month to operate the My School website is currently approximately $52,000. That figure includes infrastructure and maintenance/development costs and reflects savings achieved through bringing website development and maintenance in-house. Details follow: infrastructure:  main site hosting $23,000 per month  disaster recovery site hosting $4,500 per month maintenance/development $24,500 per month Australian Learning and Teaching Council (Question No. 481) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister representing the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research, in writing, on 16 August 2011: (1) For what reasons has the Government abolished the Australian Teaching and Learning Council (ALTC), despite restoring $50 million of the $88 million ALTC budget over four years expressly to maintain its grants and programs under the same terms of reference and conditions. (2) Has the Government made public its vision for how Australian teaching and learning innovation will be encouraged and recognised internationally; if so, what is it. Mr Combet: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) was abolished as a budget savings measure to fund rebuilding after the floods. There are significant cost savings generated by continuing the work of the ALTC within DEEWR with staff costs less than half of what was incurred by the ALTC. These savings occur because DEEWR already has areas of support in place, such as IT and human resources, which do not need to be duplicated. The ALTC was established in 2004, at a time when funding for university teaching was significantly lower than it is today. The Government is investing $35.7 billion over the next four years in teaching and learning in our universities to drive greater participation and improve access and equity. This will be supported by new regulatory and quality arrangements to be funded through the $1.1 billion Advancing Quality in Higher Education initiative announced in the last Budget. The suite of quality initiatives includes: the establishment of the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA), which will carry out regulatory functions from January 2012; Reward Funding for achieving performance targets for participation of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds and other underrepresented groups; the Structural Adjustment Fund to assist universities adjust to the new operational requirements of a demand driven funding system; and the My University website which will improve transparency and inform choice. (2) Quality teaching and learning will continue to be a high priority for the Government as the sector moves towards a demand driven environment and student numbers expand. TEQSA's primary task will be to ensure that students receive a high quality education at any of Australia's higher education providers. It will register providers, accredit courses for those institutions without the authority to selfaccredit, carry out evaluations of standards and performance, streamline current regulatory arrangements and protect and assure the quality of international education. The Office for Learning and Teaching will promote and support excellence in learning and teaching in higher education institutions with funding of $50 million over four years for a Grants and Awards Program. The Office will be guided by a Strategic Advisory Committee to ensure the ongoing involvement of the higher education sector. The Office's responsibilities include:  providing grants to academics and professional staff to explore, develop and implement innovations in learning and teaching and to develop leadership capabilities  commissioning work on issues of strategic significance to the higher education sector to inform policy development and practice in relation to learning and teaching  managing a suite of awards to celebrate, recognise and value teaching excellence and programs that enhance student learning  funding fellowships and secondments for leading educators to address significant national educational issues  disseminating resources on innovations in learning and teaching  supporting the development of effective mechanisms for the embedding of good practice in learning and teaching in Australian higher education  encouraging collaboration and sharing of good practice for improved student learning outcomes  facilitating networking and professional development opportunities for academics and professional staff.

The Department monitors the Funding Agreements for each GP Super Clinic and negotiates variations to milestone timeframes, if required, to reflect the impact of these external influences.
