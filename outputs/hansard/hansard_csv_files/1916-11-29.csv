0,Tlie Ordinary Estimates And Loan Esti,"mates have been subjected to a most rigid scrutiny, and wherever possible, without impairing the nation's efficiency for war, rigorous economy is to be observed. Industrial. The policy of the Government is to maintain the wheels of industry moving without interruption, and the settlement of industrial disputes by arbitration. It is vitally important, not only for the welfare of Australia, but for success in the war, that the Commonwealth should produce as much as possible of those products, such as wheat, meat, wool, <fcc., which are essential to the maintenance of B r it a in and her Allies. It is not only the duty of' Australia to assist the Mother Country by producing these things without which the war cannot be carried on, but it is very greatly to her material in terest to do so. Industrial disturbances most seriously retard the production of wealth, and the vicious doctrine of "" slowing d o w n "" preached by the Industrial Workers of the World in the long run produces even more disastrous effects upon the community. "" Sabotage,"" that is, the destruction of machinery used in the production of wealth, falls in the same category. The Government sets its face resolutely against strikes, and urges organized labour to subm it itsgrievances to legal tribunals. Where these do not exist, or for any reason canJiot deal with disputes within a reasonable period, it w ill favourably consider the appointment . of an additional Court or Courts. and "" sabotage,"" social and economic crimes, the Government w ill use every means atits disposal to counteract and discourage them.

Question proposedThat the foregoing messages be referred to 'the Committee of Supply. That after the word ""That"" the following words be inserted :"" the Prime Minister (the Hon. W. M. Hughes) no louger possesses the confidence of this House, for the following reasons :1. That the Prime Minister secretly prepared regulations for the purpose of intimidating intending voters at the polling booths on the 28th of October (Referendum Day). 2. That though 'the said regulations were rejected at a duly constituted Executive Council meeting, held a t Mel3 bourne on Wednesday, the 25th of October, and attended by Senator the Hon. Albert Gardiner (Vice-President of the Executive Council), the Hon. J. A. Jensen (Minister for the Navy), the Hon. W. G. Higgs (Treasurer), and Senator ihe Hon. E. J. Russell (Assistant Minister), the Prime Minister persisted in his reprehensible endeavour to tack on to the Referendum an unnecessary and irritating procedure designed to add penalties for military offences already provided for in the Commonwealth Defence Act. 3. That the Prime Minister succeeded in getting the objectionable regulations passed on Friday, the 27th of October, at an Executive Council meeting, held at Sydney, and attended by His Excellency the Governor General, the Hon.

Any person who refuses or fails to answer any question put to him under these regulations, or who makes on untrue statement in any answer to any such question, shall be guilty of an offence against the War Precautions Act 1914-1916. I was not a member of tbe Cabinet at the time; but it is well known that these regulations were presented to a meeting of the Executive Council held in Melbourne on the Wednesday afternoon preceding the referendum poll, and subsequently to a meeting of the Executive Council held in Sydney. It is also well known that the Prime Minister, speaking at Albury or Wagga, said that those who had not presented themselves for enrolment under the proclamation would get the surprise of their lives when they went to vote on the Saturday. As an old parliamentarian, I immediately guessed that it was intended to issue regulations under the War Precautions Act in order to enable electoral officers to act as military officers for the purpose of making arrests. I did not think that they would merely relate to a disallowance of votes. But in any case the issue of the regulations had the effect of intimidating many voters and preventing them from going to the poll. A Government that would take such action is unworthy of living bers who are sitting on the Opposition . side of the House propose to keep it in office, they must share the responsibility for the issue of those regulations. to is out of office. quainted with seaports frequently see little vessels of about 15 or 20 tons entering dock, the crew usually consisting of the captain and a boy, with the captain strutting about the deck as if he were an admiral.

But the regulations were withdrawn that night, and no one knows it better than the Prime Minister. Telegraph offices right throughout Australia were kept open, some of them till 4 o'clock in the morning, for the purpose of transmitting telegrams to the 9,000 odd returning officers, assistant returning officers, and presiding officers at the polling places to which the regulations had been sent. It would be interesting if we could get from the Postmaster-General a little bill to show what it cost the Oommonwealth to keep open those post-offices until the withPrime Minister's own words, the shock drawal of the regulations went forward.

I ask. him to withdraw his statement. complained of,, and substitute the expression that the statement of the honourable member for Yarra is quite inaccurate. stated in the Melbourne press on Saturday, after the account of the resignations, that the regulations had never been issued, and I presume whether there was or was not an ExecutiveCouncil meeting in Sydney, on the Friday, and, if so,, whether regulations were passed at it , are matters capable of proof. Honourable members are entitled to a copy of every regulation that is issued by an Executive Council. Minister will not say that no such meeting of the Executive Council as I referred to was held in Sydney on the Friday. Wheni t was stated in the press that the Postmaster-General had been present at such a meeting that honourable gentleman denied it. He was then busy at Cessnock smashing Mr Doyle's manifesto. We shall hear either during the discussion of the Supply Bill or at some other time, of the communications from the Postmaster General during his triumphal tour which so greatly affected the "" No""' vote in New South Wales. He indignantly denied that he was present at an Executive Council meeting on the Friday, and, if there had been no meeting, he would have said so. The meeting was held, I believe, and the regulations were passed. I have every reason to believe, too, that the telegraph offices were kept open very late on Friday night, and until early on Saturday morning, for the purpose of withdrawing the regulations. I understand that in some of the polling booths the questions were asked on Saturday morning. The asking of these questions may have had the desired effect in some cases, that of giving the men, to use the of their, lives when they saw something being written across the envelope containing their ballot-paper. I believe that in some cases it had the desired effect. WheneverI was asked a question on the subject, I advised the electors to obey the law, and on the Friday night I told them to turn up and vote, and to tell the truth if questions should be put to them. At that time. I did not know that the regulations were being withdrawn, but before I went to sleep I knew that they had been withdrawn. I knew, too, that the telegraph o'ffices had been kept open. I need not specify the quarter from which I got ray information; it did not come from any public servant. On the FridayI was able to let some honourable members know that the Government had backed down, andhad withdrawn the regulations. I got the surprise of my life when I found that the Prime Minister had issued regulations and had run away from them, deciding, that they should, not be issued. asked all the same. asked, and had the desired effect. I have no intention of delaying the business of this Parliament. I am anxious that we should get on with business, but I had a right, I think, to bring this matter before Parliament. If the members of the Opposition are in. favour of the interference with the ballot-box that was intended, they"" must range themselves on the other side when a vote is taken on my amendment; if""they are opposed to interference of this kind, they must vote against the Government which tried to bring it about.",12,Regulations

86,Mr Finlayson (Brisbane) [ 4 . 9 ].,"Prime Minister to a statement that has reached me that employers of labour are persistently refusing to reinstate the men who have been returned from the military camps after being called up under the proclamation. The matter requires immediate attention, because, if the employers are going to take up the attitude that men returned from camps after the withdrawal of the proclamation, or men who have served at the front, are to be penalized in ""regard to their employment when they return to civil life, recruiting will he seriously handicapped. I am certain that not a member of this House wants to do anything that will in the slightest degree hinder recruiting, and that the House is unanimously of opinion that voluntary recruiting should be encouraged by every possible means, but nothing 'could have .a more detrimental effect on recruiting than for the impression to get into the minds of the people that the civil employment of those who enlist is not to he protected. Is the Miniswould not allow me to say that, but, if ter aware that employers are indulging in this practice? If so, can he do anything to stop it? Ministeri f it is. Will the Minister take such action as will give men in camp or on service some guarantee in regard to their employment when they return to civil life? was reported in the press just prior to the recent resignation of certain Ministers, that a large number of life passes on the Commonwealth railways had been granted to ex-Ministers and to certain officers Will the responsible Minister state whether such passes have been issued, and, if so, whether the Government intend, or have the power, to cancel them ? Such an expenditure is quite unjustifiable at a time like this, when the whole country is clamouring for economies. In consequence of the coal strike, a large number of railway trains are being discontinued. orable member not to"" discuss the coal strike. large number of people are being inconvenienced in regard to postal deliveries by the stoppage of trains. On a previous occasion, when a similar stoppage occurred, arrangements were made whereby other means of transit were adopted for postal matter. Will the Postmaster General state whether similar arrangements are being made to meet the present emergency? The matter vitally affects the public interests, and I am therefore satisfied that the Minister will give it his earnest consideration. I urge him to lose no time, because the matter is of urgent importance. [4.14] -Prio r to tlie recent adjournment, I tried to get the Government to bring about a better scheme than exists at present for assisting returned soldiers and their families, and the wives and families of men at the front. We shall be expected to go about recruiting shortly. ber must not deal with that question. we ask men to go to the front, and all or most of us have done it, the least we can do is to see that their families are looked after while they are away. We promised all sorts of good things to the men when they returned; but to-day, in Australia, there are women and children not getting sufficient to eat or wear, and without proper housing, for want of money. There are all sorts of funds to which the public have contributed largely, but one would think that those administering them had hung up the sign, "" No business done here,"" like some of the banks that closed their doors. It is impossible to get assistance from the different funds when it is required. The Patriotic Fund, under the charge of the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, may have done a great deal of good, but those responsible for it are tying up their money, and not spending it in the way that is desirable. The Government have no control over it, but they should have. The State War Council in Melbourne must be given every credit for endeavouring to carry out the work they were' brought into existence to do, and have done much good, but have not suflicient money to meet the demands made upon them.

97,Mr Watkins (Newcastle) [4.22],"1notice of the Assistant Minister. Over a hundred wounded soldiers were perfectly unanimous in their statement to me that the delivery of letters at the f r o n t has been worse since we appointed a Postal Corps than it was before. They assured me that these postal officials worked fewer hours than they did in time of peace as members of the Postal Department in Australia. They begin work at 9 o'clock, close their office at midday for a couple of hours, and close it again at 5 p.m. 'The result is that the boys in the trenches who cannot attend at the base post-offices within those hours cannot obtain their letters as promptly as they should do. If that is the position, then these postal officials should be brought back, publicly disgraced, and cashiered. If our boys are req u i r e ! to stop in the trenches night and -day, there is no reason why the field post-offices should not also be open night and day. Relieving officers could, if necessary be appointed, but even if the staff had to remain on duty all the time, they would not be doing mqre than our boys are doing in the trenches. This is a matter of great importance to our troops. If there is one thing that they desire more than another, it is to get letters from home. We have ample information regarding the many parcels addresesd to them which are never delivered. I know of cases where only two out of fifty or sixty parcels sent to our soldiers have been received. There is no possible excuse for -the Postal Corps working fewer hours in the field offices than they were working here in Australia. of them ? The information I have given the House came to me from over a hundred wounded men who had just returned from France. realizes that those officers are under the Imperial defence authorties? system. I sent both a parcel and a letter to the front , and got my reply in Britain within three or four' days. There is no complaint regarding the British side of the .'service, but there is no end to the comiplaints so far as our Australian boys are concerned. It is impossible to believe -that over 100 wounded Australians, who had just returned from the front , would unanimously make such a charge as this if it were not true. As to the Postmaster-General's interjection, I can only say .that my experience at the, f r o n t was that British officers, like their men, whether they be Australians or others, have to work a good deal more than five hours a day in the trenches. I regret the answer given this afternoon by the Assistant Minister, in the absence of the honourable member for Adelaide, to a question standing in his name. A speech delivered in Adelaide by Mrs. Lavender, one of the most brilliant scholars who has passed through our University, and who holds the diploma of-master of arts, was censored by Major Smeaton, who, at the same time, allowed words that were not fit for human lips to be published concerning the anti-conscriptionists.' Major Smeaton forgot the duties of his position. He should have tried to hold the scales, fairly as between the two parties. We were promised by the Leader of the Government that that would be done, but Mrs. Lavender's experience is an illustration, of what actually happened. Her speech, which was, perhaps, one of the best ever delivered in Adelaide, was^absolutely wiped out by the -censor. As an Australian, I also deny the right of any man to say that an Australian soldier, with money in his pocket, shall not be allowed to enter the. best hotels. There are in Cairo two pre-eminently fine hotels, but Australian soldiers are not allowed to enter them. They have to go to vile drinking shops, because some of the oflicers-the gilt-spurred roosters, did not desire them to have a W h o is in charge drink at the leading hotels, although they were willing to pay for it . If this or I could not find out. any other Administration says that an Australian, wearing the King's colours, shall not be allowed to enter any first class hotel, then it should provide that neither officers nor men shall be allowed to enter any hotel. Let us have the same law applied to both officers and men. I tested the British Then, again, why in the name of common sense were Australian privates refused permission to travel first class on the Egyptian railways? The climate there .is very oppressive, the temperature running up to 114 degrees in the shade, and one -can well understand what it would mean to travel under such conditions in carriages occupied by natives. I resent the refusal to allow our men to travel first class. I resent, also, the fact that they have been robbed. I accuse people who",17,Advances To Wheatfabmebs Paib S

102,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [4.28],"are collecting money here of having robbed our soldiers at the front, and I accuse officers there of allowing gifts sent from Australia to be sold in the shops. If honourable members think I am. speaking without my book, let me tell them that I am credibly informed that Mr J. V. Tillett, the Crown Solicitor of New Soutli Wales, has stated that, in his opinion, a strong prima facie case could be established against both Shiels and Anningthe principals in what is known in Sydney as the Shiels-Anning scandal-who have been accused of robbing the troops of £260. This case is typical of the many frauds that have been perpetrated on charitable organizations that have arisen during the present war. If the Crown Solicitor of New South Wales has given such the duty of the Government to take action, and to prevent the robbery of those who are kind enough to give to our soldiers, who are' defrauded of their rights. Department does not care whether the men who enlist contract the disease known ns the red plague. One can see every day of the week men in uniforjn in the Little Lonsdale Division of Melbourne. does not the Department take as much care of them as the British naval authorities and the German naval and military authorities take of their men? the officers and men on the little Dutch steamers which trade round our coast are protected against such dangers. But no! any such action might hurt the religious sentiments of poor Senator Pearce. He would not like to interfere. It is time that strong language was used concerning this matter. men, who contract, sometimes, a trifling disease which ought to be curable in six or seven weeks, are kept at Langwarrin for six or seven months, regardless of the feelings of their relatives. It is all very well for the Minister to hold up his hands with smug complacency, and to say, "" These men have contracted a terrible disease."" duty, they would not contract the disease. I say this as the result of knowledge gained by me whilst I had sole control for a good many months of a Lock Hospital iu London. I only wish that the widows of the unfortunate men who die at the front were treated as well as the widows of tliose who belong to the Government Dr. Moloney. House push. When General Bridges died, was there any waiting on the part of Lady Bridges for a grant from the Government? No. Senator Pearce said, in effect, to her, ."" Take four or five thousand pounds."" But the little children and the legal wife of a man who saw fit to desert them have had to wait weeks and weeks for help. This man tried to evade his liabilities by crossing over to another State when he was told that he must support his wife and children, and he enlisted under an assumed name. One would think that the Department, on learning of these facts, would have helped the legal wife and her children. But not a bit of it. The Assistant Minister, to his credit be it said, did Avhat he could for me, but week after week went by before I was able an opinion, then it is to get any help for the woman and her children. This woman was trying to earn a living for herself and family as a waitress, but we know how impossible it would be for her to support them on the Then again, the Defence miserable wages -she would earn. Her husband entered into a conspiracy with his niece in Sydney to receive his pay, but that niece has not been compelled to return' to the wife the money so received. Why The taxpayers who keep the Defence Department going are entitled to expect fair play at its hands. The Assistant Minister who has just taken office will, perEven haps, be like the proverbial new broom, which always sweeps clean. I thank him for the courtesy he has shown me in dealing with cases I have brought under bis notice. I hope that he will deal out to the widow of the ranker the same courtesy and attention, and the same ready help, that is given to the widow of a general."" These unfortunate young It is clear that the wife of a general drawing £30 a week may save far more than the wife of a man drawing 6s., 7s., or 8s. per day, and there is, therefore, the greater need for consideration for the' relatives of the more poorly paid members of the Porces. I ask the Assistant Minister representing the Minister of Defence to take into consideration the posiIf the Department idid its tion of the men in the Langwarrin Camp. The primary cause of the unfortunate position in which they find themselves is really the neglect of the Defence Department to issue proper instructions to the men going to the front. They were allowed to go away in their ignorance. The Germans do not do that kind of thing, nor do the authorities of the British Navy. I asked a question on the subject, and'was told by the supercilious individual who controls the DefenceD e -' partment that certain instructions were issued. That was not sufficient, as the men should have been given to thoroughly understand how it would be possible for them to avoid danger. could have been done, and what ought to have been done. I have made my protest in connection with the matter, and I may, perhaps, have introduced into it a little of the heat with which I should like to have discussed another matter I am not permitted at this stage to deal with . I must, however, conclude by saying that never in my experience of over a quarter of a century have I found the ballot-box so polluted as it was during the lastfew weeks. wish to ask the Prime Minister whether negotiations have bees completed with the Imperial authorities for the purchase of the Australian wool clip, and whether he is in a position to advise us as to the price to be paid. I should like to know, also, if arrangements have been made to retain the necessary raw material required to enable Australian industries to carry on during the year. make general remarks on the matter, and if the right honorable gentleman w ill answer the questions I have put it will Batisfy us for the time.being. sire to direct the attention of the Postmaster-General to the delay which has taken place in the tabling in this House of a variation of an award on the 29th September last in the case of the Tele-* graph and Telephone Employees Union. The Postal and Electricians Union were given a variation of an award on the same date, an additional award was made in the case of the Telegraph and Telephone Employees Union on the 22nd of this month, and a further additional award on the 24th of this month None of the papers In these cases has yet been laid on the table of the House; and as they must lie on the table in both Houses of this Parliament for t h i r t y days before tralia, and I appeal to the Ministeri n they are given effect, the men concerned in the awards have, by reason of the delay.' in the .tabling of the papers, been deprived of wages, which the Postmaster General wil l agree that they are justly entitled to. When a union employed in connection with a private industry is given an award it comes into force almost immediately, but the memhers of the unions to which I have referred, working under the Government, are deprived of what they are entitled to under the awards which have been made because the papers That is what must lie on the table in both Houses for thirty days before the awards become effective. Some one. is responsible for delay in the matter, and I should like the Postmaster-General to say that these papers will be tabled immediately in order that the men concerned may get the benefit of the awards. to bring under the notice of the Minister having charge of the wheat pool statements appearing in a paragraph which I uoticsd about a week ago in the Sydney Daily Telegraph and Sydney Morning Herald to the effect that the Government purpose advancing the wheat farmers something like 2s. 6d. per bushel on their ensuing crop. It is not so much the amount of the advance that is complained of as it is the manner in which it is proposed to pay it . Instead of making the advance in one sum, as it should be made, it is understood that the Government propose to advance, first of all, l s . 6d. per I do not wish to bushel, and the balance in a later instalment. As the representative of a f a r m ing district, and at the special request of some of the farmers in my electorate, I wish to point out that if we assume that the average crop this year will be 12 bushels per acre, a farmer w ill receive 18s. per acre in the shape of the proposed advance, whilst it wil l have cost him 30s. per acre to put in the crop and garner it . How can he be expected to meet his expenses in these circumstances-?' I wish to plead, also, on behalf of the share-farmers, who ' are at the expense of the labour in puttin g the crop in and taking it off Por this labour they receive something like 9d. per bushel, and on the assumption of a crop of 12 bushels' to the acre they will receive only 9s. per. acre, and with such an advance there w ill be .only bankruptcy facing them.

I have been informed by the Government Whip that he does not intend to give any pairs. . The Prime Minister has appealed to honourable memhers to go round their 'districts and assist the different district Committees in organization for securing recruits under the new scheme announced this afternoon. A man may leave our party to take up arms on behalf of the Empire; the Government are asking him and others to do BO, and yet they refuse to give us a pair for such a man. I know that honourable memhers opposite have to keep a House, and that the duty does not now fall upon us. We are not Government hacks any longer, thank God, and I wish to inform the Government that if there is to be a fight in connection with the matter of the granting of pairs we are quite willing to take it on. I do not wish the Ministry to be put in the position of asking honourable members to undertake the duty of seeking recruits, and then refusing pairs to those honourable members. -A t the instance of the Prime Minister a Bureau of Science was created almost twelve months ago, and it was anticipated that that Bureau would not only revive Australian industries, but give rise to new industries. TJp to the present, however, beyond a few meagre reports, which university professors are very good at giving to the press., nothing has heen accomplished The Vice-President of the Executive Council, under whose control, I understand, this matter comes, should,, if possible, stir this body into somethinglike decent activity; so that something' may be done for our industries. Further, I should like to' see the Vice-President of the Executive Council get intocommunicabion with the Minister for Defence,'who, during the Prime Minister'sabsence, was head: of the Government, and, in responseto. a large deputation, intimated that' he considered that this' Bureau was not sumcient for the end in view-that it was a fair adjunct as an adviser in industrial matters, but that something more practical was required. The honourable gentleman also promised the deputation that at the earliest possible moment he would make some move with a view to our industries being brought more abreast with those* in other parts of the world. I hope the Government will not take refuge behind the fact that we are now at war. In those countries which, are almost within hearing of the cannons, industries are being organized as never before, and if this is necessary there in these old-established communities, it is much more necessary here in this new country. It is absolutely necessary that something -should be done with a view to whet we shall have to face after the war, 1 or otherwise we shall not only be depleted of our manhood, but those who are l».ft here will have to face a very black future. There ought to be no postponement of the consideration of this question; but, seeing that we have to provide for returned soldiers and others, some steps in the direction I have indicated ought to be taken.
