I want to say this about the Minister for Civil Aviation: He has a remarkable record of service to this country. He has coped with problems in the Department of Civil Aviation which have never been easy. He has dealt with them to the complete satisfaction, not only of the Government, but also of the people of Australia.

How many breaches of federal awards have been detected? happy to obtain for the honourable gentleman the information relating to the three questhe question, but I regret to say that it is tions that he has asked.

Has the Minister's attention been directed to the serious position of the Western Australian wine industry caused by a section of the South Australian wine-producers selling bulk wine in Western Australia at prices well under the cost of production? Is the Minister aware that South Australian wine was being sold in Western Australia at 9s, 6d. a gallon, whereas identical wine was sold in South Australia at 13s. 6d. a gallon? Would the Minister agree that this form of interstate dumping could ruin the smaller Western Australian producers? Would he agree to investigate urgently this short-sighted policy, and, if possible, to intervene in the matter because serious harm could be done to the whole Australian wine industry? tioned by the honourable member has been brought to my notice. I must say to him that the Australian Wine Board has no authority to intervene in the matter of prices. That matter is entirely in the hands of the State wine-makers' organization and there it must reside. the Minister for Labour and National Service. Has the Minister studied unemployment figures for the July-September period in the years 1959 and 1960? Is the Minister aware that the seasonal improvement for that period in 1959 totalled 13,400, and in 1960, 11,600, and that the figures were, in fact, far in excess of this year's figure of 2,600? If so, even if the numbers on stand-down from General Motors-Holden's Proprietary Limited are included in the 1961 figures, do not these figures indicate that i l seasonal factors are disregarded, a deterioration in employment has taken place? Further, will the Government take more positive measures to give back to the unemployed their basic right-the right to work? studied the figures very carefully and have discussed them with the technical experts of the Department of Labour and National Service. When we take into consideration the fact that there were temporary standdowns at the works of General MotorsHolden's Pri'prietary Limited, Mount Isa and other places, we must come to the conclusion that the improvement in the employment situation is much better in September than it was in the previous year. But, having said that, I think the important thing is in the trend of employment. I have mentioned before in this House that the trend is expected by the Government to show a steady improvement. I believe, more optimistically now tban I have before, that this opinion is the correct one. If honourable members opposite will only wait a few weeks more, they will find that they are the most disappointed crew it is possible to find in this community. master-General is supplementary to a matter I raised in this House last week. Is the Postmaster-General aware that since the introduction of the Extended Local Service Areas scheme, quite a number of trunk calls have now become local calls to the advantage of subscribers in general, but that the number of units earned by operators of non-official post offices has been reduced? Can the Minister assure the House that every endeavour will be made to see that these essential personnel will not be unduly penalized in this connection? scheme was planned and introduced the Postal Department realized that the level of the annual payment of many non-official postmasters could be reduced as a result of a fall in the number of trunk line calls, because certain trunk line calls would become local calls under the scheme. Consequently, although the number of calls would remain the same, the units on which payment is assessed would be reduced. Realizing this, the principle was adopted that there would be no reduction because of this factor in the level of payment to existing non-official postmasters below the level obtaining in the year before the introduction of Elsa.

I ask him whether the ultimatum issued by the Minister for Civil Aviation, first, to East-West Airlines Limited that its subsidy would be discontinued and, secondly, to the Government of New South Wales that it would be responsible for the upkeep of airstrips if it proceeded with the rationalization plan, had his approval, as Prime Minister, and the approval of the Government. man is talking about some ultimatum that has been delivered. I happen to know something about the first matter that he inquires about because, as 1 think 1 said yesterday, a letter was written to East-West Airlines Limited and a letter was written to AnsettA.N.A., indicating to each of them that as an air routes re-allocation in the State of New South Wales was apparently under consideration by the Government of that State Committee:the problem of subsidy would not arise until that problem had been determined.

84,Mr Davis (Deakin) [3.13],"I presentthe committee by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Bland). Question resolved in the affirmative. 1 Speaker, I wish to make a statement in regard to a letter published in the Sydney ""Daily Telegraph"" of 23rd October, 1961, by Mr V. Gamazeishchikov, Press Attache of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Embassy in Australia, in which I have been misrepresented. The letter to which I refer was published in the Sydney"" Daily Telegraph "" on Monday, 23rd October, 1961, over the name of Mr V. Gamazeishchikov, Press Attache of the Soviet Union Embassy to Australia, Canberra. With the concurrence of honourable members. I incorporate the letter in "" Hansard "". It is as follows:I would like to make some remarks about the interview given by Mr F. M. Daly (Lab., N.S.W.) to your reporter, and published in the "" Daily Telegraph "" on October 10. [ Mr Daly said Russia had repudiated pledges that he and Senator John Armstrong, a Minister in the Chifley Labor Government, would be able to explore Russia and the Russian way of life. "" They refused to issue us with visas except as tourists knowing that way we would see nothing,"" Mr Daly said. "" Because of the .limitations imposed by this form of visa, we declined to go to the Soviet. "" Yet before we left Canberra we were told that we would be given facilities such as are given to people who are known to be fellow-travellers to make a worthwhile examination of the Soviet and the Soviet system.""] I do not know what Mr Daly had in mind, but he distorted the facts in allegedly claiming that he was not given a chance to visit the Soviet Union. Mr Daly asked the USSR. Embassy in Canberra to give him assistance regarding his visit to the USSR. "" PERPLEXED "" Mr Daly was told that his visa would be issued forthwith after his passport was received by the Embassy and the Embassy would take measures to facilitate Mr Daly visiting those places in the USSR. he took an interest in, and in meeting the Soviet officials -he would like to talk with. We feel perplexed about Mr Daly's assertion that the members of the Soviet delegation at the Brussels Inter-parliamentary Union conference, as he claims, made it clear to him that his visit to the USSR. was undesirable. I know the Soviet delegates did not make any hints regarding the undesirability of Mr Daly and his colleagues touring the Soviet Union. On the contrary, they were told by the USSR. parliamentary group that they would be given all possible assistance if they went to tbe Soviet Union as tourists. Not a single Australian has been refused entry to the USSR. The real fact is that the Soviet Union has been advocating a broad exchange of visits with all countries of the world, including Australia. Such prominent Australians as Lord Casey, Senator Mrs. Nancy Buttfield, Mr J. N. Nelson( Mr Ian McLennan), the Governor of the Reserve Bank (Dr. H. C. Coombs), and others have recently visited my country. In reality, it is Mr Daly himself who has not apparently wished to go to the Soviet Union and has made a pretext of the fact that it was proposed that an ordinary visa would be issued to him, which allegedly imposed some limitations on foreign visitors. As we understand it, some misunderstanding or merely insufficient knowledge of the situation has induced Mr Daly to make such an assertion. It is well known that the foreigners visiting the Soviet Union are not subject, compared with some other countries, to any special limitations. To be certain of that, it should be sufficient to read the articles published in Australian newspapers by Australian tourists about their impressions of their visits to the USSR. They have been given every opportunity to get knowledge about all aspects of the life of the Soviet people. It goes without saying that Mr Daly would be given the same opportunity if he wished to go to the USSR. 1 According to the interview by Mr Daly he expected to get some special invitation, although the Soviet Embassy did not give him any promises on the matter. As already mentioned, the Embassy intended to request the proper authorities in Moscow to give Mr Daly all facilities while he was staying in the USSR. I would like also to mention that Mr Daly's arguments on the situation in the German Democratic Republic and on Communism in general are pursuing certain political ends and cannot contribute to the development of better relations between nations. The letter is inaccurate in many respects. This could no doubt be attributed to the fact that Mr Gamazeishchikov is, so far as I know, unknown to me personally and had no direct dealings with the matter in question, and evidently based his letter on second-hand information. I consider, therefore, that I should put the matter straight, and outline for members the facts of what I consider to be the repudiation of an undertaking given by the Soviet Embassy officials in Canberra concerning my application for permission to visit the Soviet Union. These are the facts of the matter: Following my election as a member of the delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference in Brussels, I expressed a desire to visit, amongst other countries, the Soviet",19,Public Accounts Committee
85,Mr Daly (Grayndler),"by leaveMr (M.H.R., N.T.), the BHP. chief general manager1,'nion. Subsequently, I approached the Soviet Embassy authorities in Canberra and, quite frankly, was given every encouragement to make the visit. As a matter of fact, whilst on a visit to the Soviet Embassy with my leader, the Honourable A. A. Calwell, and other members of the Parliament, I discussed the matter with the Soviet Ambassador and he assured my leader that ievery assistance would be given to me and my colleague, Senator Armstrong, to study the matters in which we were interested in the Soviet Union. Following this discussion. I understand, Russians. They have told External Affairs that a the Ambassador arranged for Mr Alexei visa cannot be issued for more than three months Makarov, Second Secretary of the Embassy, from the date of issue. This may not be long to call at Parliament House and discuss the enough, matter with me. As a matter of fact, we here had two or three discussions subsequently at their Embassy at Brussels or other European Parliament House. I advised him of my post, and a visa obtained there. The External interests, of which he took a note, and also Affairs man here just cannot get any further stated that I desired to be given the same with them than that. opportunity to see and observe and study in the Soviet Union as was given to my This seemed strange in view of previous colleague, Mr J. Nelson, the distinguished advice from the embassy in Canberra. honourable member for the Northern Territory. I also stated that I wouldspend ten to fourteen days at least in the country. to see whether it would be possible for I make it clear that at no stage was I worried, nor was Senator Armstrong for satisfaction at all with my request and had that matter, about the cost, as I was quite no alternative but to drop the proposal prepared to pay my way provided facilities and proceed with my original arrangements were given to me to observe and study on to go after the conference. I might say an unrestricted basis. At no stage was I also that in view of early discussions with offered, nor did I expect to secure, an Soviet officials in CanberraI had already official invitation with all expenses paid. taken out a ticket through Qantas Empire It was also arranged that I would decide Berlin, Budapest, Prague, Moscow.

I also indiin the hope that I would be able to make the cated that I would probably reach Moscow visit. towards the end of September. These arrangements were evidently quite satisfactory to the Soviet Embassy officials in together with Senator Armstrong, through Canberra as I was told to send my passport our oflice in London for vises to visit the to the embassy as soon as possible and a Soviet Union. For the benefit of the House vise would be issued. Odgers, secretary of the Inter-Parliamentary Officer at Australia HouseUnion delegation, regarding my passport and other matters. In the course of this letter I stated. . . Re visa to USSR. I have already spoken to the Ambassador and have been advised speaking to him the requirements laid down by that they would like to have the passport as soon as possible and a visa will then be arranged. On 8th June, 1961, Mr Odgers wrote to the Secretary, Department of External Affairs, Canberra, enclosing my passport and advising him of my request regarding a vise for the Soviet Union in the terms quoted above. On 23rd June, 1961, the Department of External Affairs contacted Mr Odgers by telephone, arid he wrote to mc on the same date as follows:. . . Now about this difficulty with the because probably you will not visit Moscow until October. The Russian Embassy suggest that your passport be presented to At this stage I telephoned Mr Makarov me to visit the Soviet prior to going to the conference.

Upon your indicating that Senator Armstrong and Mr Daly had raised the matter with the Soviet authorities in Australia and had been informed that visas would be made available to them in London, I had telephonic enquiry made of the Soviet Embassy here emphasising their membership of our legislature. The reply given is that the Embassy has received no information from Canberra or elsewhere about the issue of visas to Senator and Mrs. Armstrong and Mr Daly and that in the circumstances the normal requirements have to be observed before the issue of visas by the Embassy. Enquiry has also been made by the Czechoslovak Embassy as to whether Mr Daly must observe all the normal requirements to obtain a visa to visit Czechoslovakia. The answer is that all requirements must be met and these are similar in nature to those of the Soviet Authorities. As Australia does not recognise the Hungarian Regime it is not possible for Australia House to make any official approach to the Hungarian Representative in London concerning the possible visit to that country by Mr Daly. I refused to accept these decisions as final, as regards both the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. On arrival in Brussels we discussed the matter with our Deputy External Affairs representative, who suggested that in view of the London decision, which seemed very definite, we should approach the leader of the Soviet delegation, Mr Paletskis, direct. Senator Armstrong and I immediately contacted him, but, to say the least, he was anything but co-operative. In fact, we got no encouragement or satisfaction from him whatsoever, despite -the fact that we advised him of the previous discussions with Soviet officials in Canberra. During the course of the week we could not make any progress with him and I actually approached a member of the Czech delegation asking if they could assist in view of previous developments. The delegates stated that they would try, but were not very hopeful that they could alter the situation. This ultimately proved to be correct. I digress at this stage to say that I had a very outspoken discussion with the Czech regarding the issue of a vise to me. Arising out of this, I received a vis6 to visit purchase of "" accommodation Ambassador in Brussels, without any of the restrictions that the Soviet sought to impose on"" me and Senator Armstrong. It is also worth mentioning that Senator Armstrong was issued in Sydney with a vise for Czechoslovakia immediately on application, without any of the terms and conditions demanded by the Soviet authorities. Later in the week, in an effort to reach finality, Senator Armstrong, deputy leader of our delegation, again approached the leader of the Soviet delegation to ascertain whether we were to be given vises on the basis discussed and arranged in Canberra. Mr Paletskis insisted that we go tourist, on the basis laid down; in other words, we could take it or leave it. At no stage would he give any undertaking nor did he promise to assist us in any way whatever during the time we were in the Soviet Union. In other words, we received no encouragement whatsoever from the Soviet delegation at the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference to proceed with the visit. These facts speak for themselves, and show that for some reason or other the Soviet delegates at the conference had no intention of fulfilling the undertaking given to us by the Embassy officials in Canberra. I place these facts on record in order to answer the letter and so that the full circumstances will be known to honourable members and the public. In the light of my experience it is difficult for me to escape the conclusion that selective treatment is evidently given to visitors according to the points of view that the Soviet believes they will express on their return. For my part I am prepared to visit any country and express quite fearlessly and honestly my impressions, provided full opportunity, without restriction or direction, is given to me to see, to observe and to study. The restrictions to be placed upon me, as outlined in the reply from the Soviet Embassy, by the issue of a tourist vise, did not give me this scope, and much as I would have liked to visit the Soviet UnionI tould not accept an invitation couched in those terms. I feel that I should also say that it is a matter of great personal regret to me that for the reasons mentioned I was unable to visit this country on possibly the only opportunity that will ever come my way. I now briefly return to the letter written by the Press Attache of the Soviet Embassy in Canberra, referring to that section in which he says. . . a visa would be issued forthwith, after his passport was received by lhe Embassy, and the Embassy would take measures to facilitate Mr tions between nations than is done by the Daly visiting those places in the USSR. he took actions of countries which threaten the an interest in and meeting the Soviet officials he would like to talk with. As mentioned earlier, the passport was submitted, together with that of my colleague, Senator John Armstrong, and it was not granted. Furthermore, no advice or details regarding any assistance to be given during our visit was ever received. The letter goes on to say that we were told by the Russian parliamentary group Treasurer) [3.31] I movethat we would be given all possible assistance if we went to the Soviet Union as over tourists. This statement is quite contrary to fact, as rarely have we received less If there has been the progress that we hope encouragement to visit a country than we to make with Government Business, we did from the Soviet representative at the could then proceed to General Business Inter-Parliamentary Union conference. to-morrow if honourable gentlemen opposite Certainly, no such undertaking was ever wished. given by their delegate. I refer to that section of the letter listing notable Australians who have visited WEAPONS WORKSHOP AT H.M.A. Russia. This only makes it more difficult for me to understand why Senator Armstrong and I were singled out for special treatment, particularly after the undertakings given in Canberra, and why we were not given the same opportunities to observe and study as were the people Interior and Minister for Works) [3.32] mentioned , particularly persons like Lord1 move1 Casey. After all, Senator Armstrong and I are members of the National Parliament Public dealing with world problems.

In the final paragraph of the letter, the an estimated cost of £420,000, of a workpress attache of the Russian Embassy shop building and amenities block to states that my comments on certain aspects of the German Democratic Republic cannot contribute to the development of better relations between nations. The press attache is quite entitled to his opinions on this matter. Furthermore, here, unlike many other countries, he has the right to express them. For my part, I doubt whether he could enjoy similar freedom in some of the countries which evidently have his active support and allegiance. I leave the people to judge whether my comments do more damage to better relafuture of mankind by continual experimenting with, and exploding of, bombs with a power of many megatons. I have no fear on whose side the judgment will fall. Precedence. That Government Business shall take precedence General Business to-morrow. Question resolved in the affirmative.

Speaker, this bill will ratify an agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of the State of New South Wales for the carrying out of certain port improvements in that State. It envisages the spending of £2,650,000 of Commonwealth money on this work. The improvements on which the Commonwealth money is to be spent are part and parcel of a general port improvement programme being undertaken by the New South Wales Government. That programme involves the spending of some £3,000,000 on a coalloader in the port of Newcastle and £5,000,000 on the deepening of the harbour entrance; £2,140,000 on a coal-loader and £360,000 on the dredging of the port at Port Kembla; and £160,000 on the improvement of coal-loading facilities at Balmain in Sydney Harbour. The Federal Government will be required, under the terms of this agreement, to meet £2,650,000 of the cost. Of this amount, up to £1,000,000 is to be made available from the Coal Industry Fund of tfee Joint Coal Board by way of a grant, and up to £1,650,000 is to be provided as a loan from Commonwealth revenue. The port-improvement scheme as a whole is one which we must support. The New South Wales Government ought to be commended on its foresight in bringing this plan forward and undertaking the scheme. Several points ought to be looked at. What benefit are we to derive, by way of increased exports, from the Commonwealth's participation? What ought to be our commitments in meeting the expense of the scheme? In what way can we assist the Government of New South Wales or, for that matter, the government of any other State in works such as these? Finally, has the Commonwealth Government taken this action at the present time in a genuine desire to assist New South Wales, or is this action brought on by the forthcoming election on 9th December? Is that the paramount thing to which this Government looks? Is it considering more than anything else how much political kudos it can gain in the dying days of the present Parliament? Is this assistance being given to the New South Wales Government for the same purpose as that behind the smear campaign which we have seen being conducted in this Parliament over the last couple of weeks? As late as last evening, we saw that campaign Harold Holt), who was shown to be a smearer of the lowest type. -Order! The honourable member will withdraw that statement. Treasurer is a smearer of the lowest type? is unparliamentary language, and I ask the honourable member to withdraw it. able to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw it. Last evening, the Treasurer was shown up in a very bad light over the smear tactics that he adopted. I am questioning whether this bill has been brought forward with the same object as that for which those tactics have been adopted. I shall deal with that matter further later when I come to some of the Government's propaganda and point out the delays that have occurred in bringing in the bills. Discussing the bill now before us, I wish to deal, first, with the Commonwealth's right to participate in the development of ports. Has it any right to do so?

The national development? 1 wish to refer the same sub-section provides that the board House to section 51 of the Australian Conshall have power in relation tostitution, which provides for the powers of this Parliament. It statesThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:(i.) Trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States: The very purpose of ports is to provide the means whereby trade can be undertaken between States and between Australia and other countries. So there is no doubt that the Commonwealth Government has power under the Constitution to assist in or, if necessary, to accept full responsibility for developing all the ports of Australia. The Commonwealth has the responsibility, first of all, for developing our export trade. Therefore, it ought to ensure that tbe ports are sufficiently developed for the needs of trade, to say nothing of the needs of defence. On those two counts, ports are the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government and this Parliament. No one can truthfully say that the Commonwealth has not the responsibility for participating, or the constitutional power to participate, in this development. So there is no doubt about the Commonwealth's right to participate in this work of port improvement. Much the same can be said of the Joint Coal Board. The Commonwealth is a party to that board. Section 14(1.) of the Coal Industry Act 1946-1956 prescribes the powers and functions of the board in these terms(a) to ensure that coal is produced in the State cannot compete with countries that carry in such quantities and with such regularity as will meet requirements throughtheir coal in such ships. We are in that out Australia and in trade with other position of being unable to compete procountries; Section 14 (2.) provides that the board about 12,000 tons to 14,000 tons. The is to have power to make provision for or handled in Newcastle is 15,000 tons. Havwith respect to"" (c) the introduction, modification, replacement and operation of machinery, plant and equipment for use in connection with in Charge of the Joint Coal Board, to make availthe production and distribution of coal, able through that Authority, suiiicient money in and improvement and standardization of such Government to immediately carry out this machinery, plant and equipment; (e) the effective and economical distribution of coal, including its purchase, sale, marketing, acquisition, disposal, supply, storage, reservation, pooling, transport, carriage, conveyance, delivery, handling, loading, discharge and reception; So there is no question as to the constitutional responsibility of this Government and this Parliament to assist in the development of the coal industry and the development of the ports required. When we have this agreement brought to us for ratification we will be dealing with something that we should have accepted as our responsibility some years ago. As late as 16th June of last year I wrote to the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) in the light of statements made by him, the Minister of Mines in New South Wales, Mr J. B. Simpson, M.L.A., Sir Edward Warren and other persons engaged in the coal industry, wherein they said that overseas there was a new development in coal cartage. At one time colliers of 1,000 tons or 2,000 tons were quite satisfactory, and later colliers of 5,000 tons and 6,000 tons were satisfactory for the handling of coal, but it is necessary for larger ships to be employed nowadays, just as larger ships are now employed in the oil carrying' industry. We have seen the ships used in oil carriage grow from 6,000 or 7,000 tons to 15,000 tons, and now some ships used are of 106,000 tons or 114,000 tons. The coal industry has progressed similarly, and to-day we find that unless a country can provide the harbour and port facilities necessary to handle coal carrying ships of from 25,000 tons to 45,000 tons it perly because our coal carrying ships are of maximum tonnage of a ship that can be ing all this in mind 1 wrote to the Minister for National Development in the following termsI therefore request you, as the Federal Minister the manufacture, procurement, conjunction wilh the New S'juth Wales State national project of deepening the Newcastle Bar. There is the position that I put right to him. The reply, dated 26th July, from the Acting Minister for National Development, statedHowever, as far as the Commonwealth is concerned . . . the financial responsibility for improvepresent, when it knows that its stocks were ment of the ports remains, as it always has been, one for the Government of New South Wales. There is, therefore, no question of the Commonwealth making funds available to the State either through the Joint Coal Board or in any other way for this purpose. Loan Funds are of course available to the State through the operation of the Australian Loan Council and the allocation of these funds for any particular project is the prerogative of the State. That was the attitude of this Government only a matter of sixteen or seventeen months ago, when it was requested to make money available for the development of ports at a time when it was realized that unless there were available to Australia port facilities to enable the handling of ships of a tonnage of 25,000 tons to 40,000 tons we could not compete with overseas coal interests. This Government stood completely aloof from that. It was not prepared to come to the party in any way, even through the Joint Coal Board and its power under the Coal Industry Act or under the constitutional power that it has. SoI suspect the honesty of the Government. It is bringing many bills forward now when an election is in the offing. Examples of those bills' brought before this House in the last fortnight are the Railway Agreement (Western Australia) Bill, Western Australia Grant (Beef Cattle Roads) Bill, Railway Equipment Agreement (South Australia) Bill-whic h will be debated later -the Railway Agreement (Queensland) Bill and the Queensland Grant (Beef Cattle Roads) Bill. In a little publication put out by your party, Mr Deputy Speaker, for distribution in the coming election campaign we find the following statement:Now to coal: The Commonwealth Government, on a £ for £ basis will provide the Government of New South Wales with £2,650,000 to improve coal handling facilities at Newcastle, Port Kembla and at Balmain. This is a developmental scheme leading to bigger coal exports-and remember, we have the finest coal deposits round the whole of the Pacific Basin. Why did you not come to the party eighteen months ago when I wrote to the Minister for National Development? At that time it was not tbe Government's responsibility, according to that Minister. But at that time there was not an election in the offing. I think that that is the salient fact. At that time, too, this Government was not held in the low esteem in which it is held at never lower. The Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) and the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) have been manoeuvring in this Parliament in an effort to retrieve the position which the Government has lost over the last eighteen months because of its handling of the economy. The Government is resorting to these snide political tricks on the eve of an election in an endeavour to curry favour with the voters. I am afraid, however, that time is running out for the Government. It has made its run too late, and the people as a whole will realize that it is now resorting to political trickery in order to retrieve the position. The leaflet put out by the Government parties is dishonest, because it says that the Commonwealth Government is making available £2,650,000 on a £l-for-£l basis. That is a lie and a complete mis-statement of fact, because a reading of the agreement shows that that amount is to be made up of £1,000,000 from the Joint Coal Boardwhich will come from the Coal Industry Fund-and a loan of £1,650,000. A loan! Where are you giving anything? You are not giving £1 to this project other than the £1,000,000 that is coming from the Joint Coal Board. The Government will lend New South Wales £1,650,000 on which that State will have to pay interest amounting to £465,630 in the next ten years. Nobody can deny that fact. And not only will New South Wales have to pay £465,630 in interest on that, but also, in respect of the remainder of the programme amounting to £10,660,000, it will have to pay interest. That money will be from the normal loan fund allocation. So this Government has now moved into the banking industry, and is lending the people's money. This money which is to be made available will be derived from revenue which the Government will have raised from taxation or from money allocated to it by the Reserve Bank of Australia. So the Commonwealth is using the people's money to lend to the State Government for its works, which are of a national character. The Government should be condemned for this. It is using the finances of this country to assist it in an subsidize its products. At present, the electioneering programme on behalf of the Australian coal mdustry has to contend Liberal Party. We realize that 10 per cent, of our coal industry in order to enable it to compete production is being exported. In 1960-61 with Australia. We can assist in the a total of £1,849,000 worth of coal was development of our industries, however, and exported and, incidentally, we are building particularly the coal industry. The honorup a nice little export trade, the major part able members for Hunter( Mr James), of it with Japan. The annual report of the Shortland ( Mr Griffiths), Macquarie ( Mr Joint Coal Board shows that last year exports Luchetti) and Cunningham ( Mr Kearney) wereCountry. New Caledonia .. 111,900 New Zealand Fiji Hong Kong Korea 9.500 Pakistan Malaya Ocean Island In fact, we are building up a substantial export trade in coal from which we are deriving valuable overseas exchange. Our exports to Japan are paid for in dollars and that helps us to meet our adverse balance of trade with the United States of America. The export coal industry is not only providing employment for 10 per cent, of the present work force, but also earning about £7,500,000 annually for our overseas reserves. The Minister for Mines in New South Wales, Mr J. B. Simpson, said recently that when he visited Japan he was assured by Japanese interests that their requirements of coal would grow by 1965 to 3,000,000 tons, costing about £12,000,000. That, in itself, is sufficient justification for this Parliament interesting itself in the development of the ports of the Commonwealth. Another matter to which I direct attention is the cost structure. Costs come into everything, and I agree that this matter must be examined because no industry should be permitted to go along in its own happy way charging what it likes. Sir Edward Warren, chairman of the Australian Coal Association, predicted in a statement made on 20th September last that American competition would become even tougher. He said that America was hostile because we had taken some of its Japanese trade and that America was determined to get its trade back. The Americans are interested in port development in Australia. I do not believe that any country should with a subsidy of four dollars a ton paid by the Canadian Government to its coal are interested in this matter because their Tons. electorates are involved. 4.800 New methods of production are having 6,700 their effect on the industry. More coal is 2.200 being produced with only two-thirds of the .. 52.500 previous labour force, and the export 8,500 market is important to the industry. If we 100 can help the development of the export trade by reducing costs in the coal industry, we will assist our export trade generally. Supporters of the Government often tell us how we can build up our industries and our export trade. I suggest that we could help our export industries by reducing handling charges and port charges generally. This need not necessarily be done by way of grants. If the Government wants to persist with its policy-wit h which I disagree-that the development of ports is the responsibility of the State governments, at least the Government could make money available to the States at the rate of interest that is paid by the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth Government pays no interest. It pays nothing for the money it raises and disburses to the States because most of our work is paid for with money obtained from taxes. Money should be made available to the State governments for port development by way of interest-free loans or loans at a maximum rate of 1 per cent, which is the interest rate that we pay the Reserve Bank of Australia on deficits and advances. My suggestion is that we could reduce prices and the cost of handling coal with advantage to the export industry by reducing interest rates. The Government proposes to lend to New South Wales £1,650,000 on which the State Government will pay £460,000 in interest. If the interest charges were eliminated, the New South Wales Government would have £460,000 more for the development of ports. It could not only improve Newcastle and Port Kembla but also open up new ports on the north coast or along the south coast. Another factor in the cost structure is the profit that is being made by the coal industry. It is quite obvious to honourable members that, from coal owners' point of view, the coal industry has never been more prosperous than it is to-day. Profits were never greater. Money was lent to them years ago at 4 i per cent, and generally at a lower interest rate than the Commonwealth is prepared to advance money now for developmental purposes. These are things that should be examined when we are considering the cost structure and the price of coal that is shipped overseas. The position is that the Government has not accepted its responsibility to assist in the development of our ports, lt should have done so years ago. I say this, not because I wrote to the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) on this matter eighteen months ago, but because I believe that the Commonwealth should Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 32); Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 33); Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 34); Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 35); Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 36); Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 37); Customs TarirT Amendment (No. 38); Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 39); Customs Tariff (Canada Preference) Amendment (No. 5); Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Amendment (No. 5); Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) (No. 6).

The winning of coal has been improved by mechanization and new methods of production, but port handling methods have not kept pace with production because this Government was not prepared to face up to its responsibilities. We have had to be satisfied with ships of 6,000 and 8,000 tons rising to 10,000 and 11,000 tons, but that is not good enough. The ports must be improved and we must be prepared to handle ships of 25,000 to 40,000 tons. I support this bill because it will make money available for port development, but 1 criticize the Government for its failure in the past to accept its responsibilities and 1 question its political honesty.

For the guidance of honourable members. I will give a short summary of the proposed alterations. Canned tuna and similar fish such as albacore and bonito are accorded protection at rates of 7d. per lb. under the British preferential tariff and 9d. per lb. most-favourednation. The protective duties on spirit levels and bolt cutters are removed and rates of free British preferential tariff and 7 i per cent, otherwise will now apply. Trucks such as fork lift trucks, of the types used for loading, unloading, stacking and tiering of goods, are now accorded tariff protection irrespective of lifting capacities. Previously only work trucks with a lifting capacity of 10,000 lb. or less were subject to protective duties. In its report on poultry, the board recommends no change in the overall level of existing duties under the customs tarifl and the primage duties. In accordance with the Tariff Board's suggestion, primage duty is being removed and incorporated in the customs tariff. With floor coverings some minor drafting amendments are being introduced, but, in accordance with the Tariff Board's recommendations, the duties are unchanged. I now deal with epoxy resins. One type of epoxy resin that is produced from bisphenol A and epichlorohydrin is being made in Australia and tariff protection is recommended for this product and for the bisphenol A the House reports by the Tariff Board on from which it is made. Protection is the following subjects:accorded at a level of 25 per cent, against imports from most-favoured-nation countries on the resins and 9d. per lb. on the bisphenol A with the British preferential tariff rates fixed according to international commitments. In regard to bean seed increased protective duties are now imposed on beans imported for purposes other than for cultivation. The new rates will be 25s. per central regardless of the sources of production. No change-is proposed for seeds imported for cultivation. bean seed subject to a decision of the Tariff Board? dation from the board. On the board's proposals. recommendation the range of chains subject to protective duties of 27i per oent. British preferential tariif and 45 per cent, mostfavoured-nation has been extended. However, with the exception of chains made in Australia such chains will be admitted at non-protective rates of free British preferential tariff and 1 \ per cent, otherwise, under customs by-laws. In addition to the Tariff Board reports covered by these tariff proposals, I will also table shortly the board's report on penicillin and streptomycin. The Government has accepted this report and action is being taken to impose dumping duties as recommended by the board. The Government attaches considerable importance to the continued production of antibiotics in Australia. It will therefore watch the trend of impoits carefully and if they continue to rise notwithstanding the imposition of dumping duties, the Government will be prepared to consider referring the need for a temporary duty for inquiry and repoit. by a deputy chairman of the board.

Debate resumed (vide page 2436). my contribution to this debate I pay tribute to the Government for bringing down this measure, but I also take the opportunity of condemning the Government for delaying so long in bringing it before this Parliament. As honourable members know, the predominant industry in my electorate is coal mining, and the coal-mining industry in that area has had one of the greatest economic shocks it has experienced since 1952 as the result of changes in the industry and a decline in the demand, both in Australia and overseas, for gas coal. I suspect that the Government has two reasons for bringing down this legislation at this late stage in this Parliament's term. First, I feel that it is being introduced on the eve of an that it might gain some public popularity from it, and, secondly, I believe that the measure is introduced as the result of pressure from the coal owners' association, which is led by Sir Edward Warren. In my opinion, as well as in the opinion of the great majority of the people I represent in the Hunter electorate, Sir Edward Warren's attitude towards the common man is merciless, cold and definitely insincere, otherwise he would have made greater efforts to prevent the closing down of mine after mine on the South Maitland coal-field in recent years. Only recently, Stanford Main No. 2 mine was closed down and 150 men thrown out of employment. Many of them have been unable to secure employment in the township of Paxton, about 12 miles from Cessnock. If Sir Edward Warren had been a public-spirited man with some feeling in his heart for the good of the community, he would have endeavoured to persuade the coal-owners to contribute towards the cost of keeping the Paxton open. It allegedly became necessary to close it down because it had become uneconomic to operate. As a result of the closing down of this mine, the whole town of Paxton is in economic chaos. Within the next fortnight, 1 have to interview some small businessmen there to explain to them my attitude towards the merciless actions of the coal owners in the area. We now find that the Government believes, probably quite properly, that the carrying out of certain works and the improvement of coal-loading facilities at the port of Newcastle would stimulate the coal industry in that area. No doubt there will be some improvement, but it will not be so great as to lead to the employment of more men in the industry or the easing of the burden that has been imposed on the unfortunate people in the northern coalfields, because the northern coal-fields predominantly produce gas coal and the purpose of this legislation is to promote the sale of coking coal for which there is a great demand at the present time front the Japanese steel industry.",36,Customs Tariff Validation
101,. Mr James (Hunter) [4.12],"In makingI believe that it is accepted by all evenly balanced thinking men that when the United States of America signed the peace treaty with Japan, her main interest was to get first bite of the trade cherry with Japan. Of course, she also had in mind swinging the Japanese people and Japanese Government away from adopting communism. In her .first attempts at getting first bite of the trade cherry, the United States negotiated for and obtained from Japan large orders for gas coal. In my opinion, the gas coal produced on the northern New South Wales coal-fields is almost as rich as the best quality of about 30,000 tons. gas coal in America. As a result of -America's getting the first bite of the trade for gas coal with Japan, and of the intrusion of residual oil into the gas-making industry, many of the South Maitland coal mines have closed down. I believe that had the Government seen fit to introduce this bill some years ago bulk carriers of from 35,000 to 40,000 tons capacity would have been able to enter Newcastle harbour and possibly we could have developed a trade in gas coal with Japan because we could have sold at a price which would have made it more attractive to Japanese buyers to purchase from us than to bring gas coal from the United States of America, as they are doing now. As proof of the fact that the gas coal produced on the coalfields of northern New South Wales is acceptable to the Japanese industries, I mention that the Caledonia company of Cessnock has successfully negotiated for the sale of coal to the Osaka gasworks in Japan. As most honourable members will know, Osaka is the second biggest city in Japan and has a population of approximately 4,000,000. But the gas coal producers in northern New South Wales have been unable to penetrate the market for gas coal in Tokyo. That city obtains all its gas coal from the United States of America. That is due mainly to the fact that we have been unable to supply gas coal to Japan at a sufficiently low price to compete with America because we have been unable to get the big bulk carriers into Newcastle harbour. In 1960 the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner), held the view that it was the sole obligation of the New South Wales Government to carry out these port improvements. MrL . R. Johnson -He made a press statement about it. ment to that effect. Let me read the report which appeared in the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" of 7th May, 1960. It is in these termsSenator W. H. Spooner said last night the New South Wales Government should improve port facilities to help boost coal exports. Senator Spooner, the Federal Minister for National Development, said Japanese businessmen were planning to import coal in colliers with a capacity Neither of the two major coal exporting ports, Newcastle and Port Kembla, could handle ships of this size efficiently. Senator Spooner said work would have to be carried out at Newcastle, Balmain and Port Kembla to maintain exports of coal. ""The provision of port facilities is a matter for which the New South Wales Government is entirely responsible"", he said. "" It seems likely the work would cost about £6,000,000 "". He said New South Wales was exporting 750,000 tons of coal yearly to Japan. This provided employment for about 750 men. Those engaged in the export trade had high hopes it could be expanded considerably, perhaps to 2,500,000 or 3,000,000 tons a year. It was imperative to improve port facilities at major ports if New South Wales was to compete successfully with overseas coal exporting countries. ""Instead of setting about this task, the New South Wales Government, through State instrumentalities, is to spend £3,500,000 on the construction of two new coal mines for the Vales Point power station"", said Senator Spooner. "" The sensible thing would be for the State Government to spend the money on the improvement of the ports, or to have begun negotiations with the colliery proprietors to provide the capital for the mines "". The view that Senator Spooner held then is quite clear, but the Government's action in introducing this legislation now indicates a complete change of attitude. In addition, the introduction of this bill makes it obvious that the views which the Minister held last year were wrong. MrL . R. Johnson -It was the Commonwealth's responsibility all the time. was the Commonwealth's responsibility all the time, as the honourable member for Hughes has reminded me. The Minister condemned the New South Wales Government for spending £3,500,000 on opening new coal mines, and I have heard other members of the Liberal Party, both in this",37,Agreement New South Wales
102,Mr James,"Yes, he made a press state",38,Agreement New South Wales
103,Mr James,"Definitel y and positively itplace and in the New South Wales Parliament, also condemn the State Government for that expenditure, but I am proud that it has done so because very soon coal will be coming out of the mines and travelling only a couple of hundred of yards into a modern power station at Vales Point. The people of New Soulh Wales generally will receive the benefit of the State Government's action by obtaining cheaper electricity. The New Soutb Wales Labour Government is aware of the huge profits which the coal-owners have made in the past, and the fact that the coa!-owners have no intention of opening new mines also prompted the State Government to open its Own. is that the coal-owners will not be able to exploit the New South Wales Government in supplying coal for its power stations. That is why the State Government is opening its own mine. Had the Commonwealth Government seen fit'to meet its obligations in this field some years ago by improving port facilities, the chaos which now exists on the northern fields would probably not be as bad as it is. Tn the report of the Joint Coal Board for the year ended 1960-61-the latest report available-the chairman, for the first time to my knowledge, has forecast greater make a summer. chaos on the northern coal-fields. When speaking about the position in South Maitland, the chairman statedFurther chances must be expected on the South backside out of his pants, but many of the Maitland field. The end of an era is being reached. unfortunate coal-miners have. They have Some of the old mines will probably close. suffered economic repercussions from time The total level of output from the field may well to time and have been thrown on the ecobe maintained at about present levels but in due course this will probably be provided by as few nomic scrap heap, but they have made as five or six mines. Further increases in output extreme wealth for their bosses. This has per manshift are necessary. To ensure that this occurred throughout the history of coalis achieved the opening of a new modern mine mining. One has only to read the history may be necessary on the field. Most of my constituents will believe in the book entitled ""The Hungry Heart"", which opening of a new mine when they tee it. is available in the Parliamentary Library, From time to time they have been misled to learn how the wage-earner has been the and hoodwinked by governments and victim of the profiteers ever since there responsible government officials such as the have been coal mines in the British ComMinister for National Development.

The honourable people, irrespective of the political party to member also spoke about profit-making in which those people belong. The honourable member for Hume( Mr the years the coal owners should have imAnderson) interjected a short time ago and proved the port facilities at Newcastle in said that it is not true that the coal-owners make substantial profits. not make as high profits as are made in other industries. ber is going back on what he said. I thought he would. Mr L. R. Johnson -He is shifting his ground. ground. I was going to reply to his interjection in a certain way, but now I shall use milder language than I intended to use. The Wallsend Coal Company ceased production soma time ago and now its interests in coal mines are very small. However, it is now, if not the biggest shareholder at least it is very close to being the biggest shareholder in the Peko mine in the Northern Territory. The money which the company accumulated over the years has been invested in that mine. That gives some indication of the profits which have been made in the industry. The coal-owners on the northern fields have acquired considerable wealth. who invested in the coal industry has the of Scottish coal mines, as contained in a the coal-mining industry.

110,Mr James,"Well, none of the personsorder to continue to sell their commodity and make prolts. The provision of money by the taxpayers of this country so that the coal owners can sell their commodity and make greater profits is somewhat in conflict with my political principles, which I hope will never change. Reverting to the newspaper article of 17th December, 1960, I draw attention to the following passages which report statements by one of the leaders of the Miners Federation:Huge profits cannot all be hidden. It is diffithose policies were not good for the induscult to pinpoint precisely the actual profits of companies because there are so many ways in whioh a real covering-up job can be done but it is impossible to completely hide the great profits that have been made. Federal President Mr W. Parkinson made this point in concluding his final address at the Coal Industry Tribunal in the 35 hours claim. The main point Mr Parkinson made reads as follows:The BHP. is Australia's biggest monopoly, and well as our industrial development and the most powerful. As at September 30, 1960, the Stock Exchange valued its paid up capital at £304 million. However, the real value of BHP. assets is shrouded in mystery, and could be in the region of £500 million. It is well known that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited owns a considerable number of mines on the northern coalfields. These include Lambton B, John Darling, Burwood and Stockton Borehole. If the company's coal is to be shipped overseas through port facilities which have been improved at the expense of the taxpayers while the company continues to make great profits, I feel that a gross wrong will be inflicted on the Australian community. It is wrong that the community should be taxed to pay for improved port facilities that will benefit the coal owners. Whilst1 am not prepared to oppose this legislation I feel that, had it been brought down some considerable time ago, there would have been a better chance of keeping the mines on the northern coalfields open and of preventing the economic chaos which now exists there. That is all I desire to say. 1 support the bill. gathered from the concluding remarks of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr export trade, but now, due to the planning James) and also from what the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Jones) said a little while ago, that they will support this measure despite some of their criticisms of it. I think it might be a good idea if, very briefly, I put into proper perspective some of the criticisms which these two honourable gentlemen voiced. Some time ago, in another debate on the coal-mining industry, I said that I gave full recognition to the fact that in the beginning of that industry in Australia, the conditions under which the coal-miners worked were very bad indeed, and that the policies of the coal mine owners in those eariy days left much to be desired. Indeed, some of try as a whole, let alone for those working in it. We have also to realize, however, that that era ended and that there was quite a long period during which the coalminers themselves were very badly led and badly advised in their actions. As honourable members will recall, this country suffered a great deal through shortages of coal which affected our domestic living as progress. Interruption of coal supplies due to bad leadership of the miners caused industry to look for alternative fuels. In addition, other States which had been good consumers of New South Wales coal were looking for ways and means by which they could develop coal deposits within their own boundaries, even though that coal was of a grade inferior to that produced in New South Wales. As examples of this I quote the development of the brown coal industry in Victoria and the development of the Leigh Creek deposits in South Australia. With regard to the loss of our coal exports, the honourable members for Newcastle and Hunter surely remember, as I do, the days when many ships lay at anchor at the Dolphin, in Newcastle harbour, waiting their turn to go to the coal loading berths in order to take coal overseas. Because of the bad leadership to which I have referred, and the consequent interruption of supplies, we lost our overseas markets. The honourable member for Newcastle knows this to be true. So, it is not correct for him to refer to the coal exports which we are now developing as something new in the coal industry. We lost our earlier coal of this Government and thefinancialassistance it is giving, we are regaining our markets. The honourable member for Newcastle even went so far as to use the words",39,Agreement New South Wales
111,Mr Dean (Robertson) [4.32],"I"" political trickery "" when referring to this measure. He, as well as the honourable member for Hunter, criticized the delay in bringing down this legislation. Both said they thought this bill was being introduced at this time, on the eve of an election, to try to obtain some popularity for the Government. That is not true at all. They must realize, as I do, that discussions on this matter have been going on for a number of years. The honourable member for Hunter quoted the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) as saying that the provision of port facilities was the responsibility of the State governments. He then said that Senator Spooner had now changed his mind. That is not true at all. The provision of port facilities is the responsibility of the State governments, and, by bringing down this measure, the Minister has in no way changed his mind. What we are doing is to make nnancial assistance available to the State of New South Wales so that these improved facilities can be brought into operation earlier than would otherwise be the case, thus helping us to gain new export markets. This is part of the export dFive in which this Government has been engaged for a number of years. It is only part of a long term programme and is nothing new. The1 Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) reminded the House, when he made his statement on 3Ist August last, that the provision of these moneys for assistance to the Government of New South Wales was incorporated in the Budget. I repeat that these financial provisions to help the Government'of New South Wales to improve port facilities at Newcastle, Port Kembla and Balmain arc part of a long-term and well-planned programme to assist us in our export trade. In concluding my remarks on this portion of the legislation, let me say that our programme for progress at these ports is a continuing one. It is carried on whether there is an election in the offing or not. It would be a very bad thing if, having commenced this programme some few years ago, we were to stop it suddenly a few months before an election. Much has been said in this House about our export programme, particularly during the debate on the prospective entry of the United Kingdom into the European Common Market. It is obvious that it will become more and more necessary for Australia to obtain a greater share of overseas markets. As we realize the competitive nature of these markets, surely we can see why it has been necessary for the Government to take steps over recent years to keep down costs in our industries. It is only in this way that we can hope to compete with other countries in overseas markets, and it is in this way. too, that we can assist the development of our industries, both primary and secondary. The economic measures that have been taken, therefore, become more and more understandable as we realize more fully the importance of our drive for increased exports. Under this legislation the Commonwealth agrees to provide financial assistance to the New South Wales Government, with the concurrence of that Government. I just want to return to what I said a while ago in reply to the honourable member for Newcastle. The provision of these port facilities has been discussed for a number of years. The Commonwealth has engaged in conferences with the New South Wales Government, and the necessity for improving port facilities has been emphasized. It is only in recent months, however, that the Commonwealth has been able to reach an agreement with the New South Wales Government on the way in which assistance will be given for the provision of coal-loading plant and equipment. The maximum amount of Commonwealth contribution under the agreement will be £2,650,000. This will be provided for expenditure at three ports. At Newcastle the amount to be provided is £1,500,000, at Port Kembla £1,070,000, and at Balmain £80,000. Of the total amount, up to £1,000,000 will be by way of grant, to be provided from the Coal Industry Fund held by the Joint Coal Board. The credit balance in this fund arose, as I think most honourable members realize, as a result of activities carried on by the board with money provided by the Commonwealth. It has been further agreed that the remaining amount of Commonwealth assistance, of up to £1,650,000, will be provided by way of advances, each of which will be wholly repayable, as the honourable member for Newcastle pointed out, together with interest, within ten years from the date on which each advance is made.. There will be no sinking fund contributions by the Commonwealth in respect of repayments by the States to the Commonwealth. This is the second major step that has been taken by the Commonwealth Government to assist the coal-mining industry to expand its overseas trade. It will be remembered that a few months ago a bill was introduced to remove the levy that had previously been imposed on exported coal. While the levy did not represent a very great amount, its removal was still of some assistance, and was another demonstration of the way in which the Government tries to help the coal-mining industry. Having regard to uncertainties regarding the volume of trade that will develop in coal, and the costs of handling the product, the Commonwealth has decided to give part of this assistance by way of the grant that I have described. This will be applied to reduce the coal-loading charges that would otherwise be levied for the use of facilities at the three ports. BeforeI conclude I would like to direct the attention of the House to the fourteenth annual report of the Joint Coal Board. Paragraph 141 of the report says:In contrast with the declining market interstate, the growth in overseas exports has been remarkable. These sales are substantially, though far from wholly, based on long term contracts. In the main, the exports are to Japan and comprise hard and soft coking coal for the steel industry, and selected coals for the gas industry. Considerable tonnages of steaming coal were also shipped to Japan in the July-December, 1960, half year, but whether coals for this purpose can find a sustained market is doubtful. Some people believe that this will be possible, and, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, we are making investigations overseas to ascertain whether it can be done. I conclude by expressing my support of this measure and congratulating the Government on having been able to make this very suitable arrangement with the Government of New South Wales. I believe that it will greatly assist the coal-mining industry. I agree with honourable members opposite that it is an industry which needs our attention and all the help we can give it. cannot agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Dean) to the effect that the miners can blame only themselves for much of the hardship they have experienced. were responsible. bad leadership has been primarily responsible for what has happened in the coal mining industry. I believe that the miners have had some of the greatest industrial leaders of all time. I think back to Charlie Nelson and Bondy Hoare, to mention only two of them. The fact is that the exploitation of our coal reserves by greedy and avaricious mine owners caused much of the trouble that occurred in the early years of the mining industry. On more than one occasion the miners found themselves locked out of employment. This happened in the 1920's, for instance. The conditions that the miners enjoy to-day would not be available to them but for strike action that was taken in years gone by. It was not until 1952 that the Coal Industry Tribunal, Mr F. Gallagher, now Mr Justice Gallagher, recognized the disabilities suffered by employees in the mining industry and granted a special allowance to coal-mine workers. The legislation before the House is of immense satisfaction to me in more ways than one. It shows that at long last the Menzies Government has recognized that State governments, having been divested by the uniform taxation legislation of their sovereign right to levy taxes, are no longer able to finance from their own resources the works necessary for the development of major industries which are of importance to the nation as a whole. A new attitude is being taken to works such as those contemplated under this legislation, which were once regarded as ordinary developmental undertakings. For this reason my remarks in this debate will be related to the part of the speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) in which the right honourable gentleman said that this project is one of the major State works to which he had previously referred as being projects that should make a significant contribution to the promotion of increased export earnings, and that increased and diversified exports are essential. The remarkable fact is that those comments are in direct contradiction to",40,Agreement New South Wales

I hope that the New South Wales Government will be able, with the funds available to it, to undertake all the work that is envisaged in this bill. However, I doubt whether it will be able to do so. I hope that this Government will see fit to amend the bill in order to make contingent provision for the Commonwealth Government and the State Government to get together and agree to provide any additional money needed to complete the work in the event of anything unforeseen happening. For instance, additional cost could be incurred in the removal of rock at the harbour mouth or as a result of basic wage increases. It will not do to have the work held up later because insufficient money is available to complete it. I know that the New South Wales Government for years has wanted to undertake port improvement work, but has not been able to do so because funds have been lacking. The condition of the port of Newcastle more than it did up to 1947 in improving is a disgrace because of the degree of siltaNewcastle harbour.

It is began work beside the Newcastle waterfront true that a sum of £1,000,000 is to come in the railway workshops.

Jt is equally true that a sum of restore the port even to the standard that £1,650.000 is to be made available by way existed in 1920. We shall need to do much of a loan repayable over a period of ten more than is envisaged in this measure and years at 5 i per cent, interest. In view of much more than thefinancebeing provided the fact that it will be the Commonwealth for the present scheme of port improvements will permit. We all know that over the past fifteen years the Labour Government in New South Wales has spent much money on wharfage facilities and the opening up of the Thro:by Creek section of the Newcastle waterfront to oil carriers and general merchant shipping. But, while that work has been going on, the harbour and the river generally have become more silted up than ever before. The cost of dredging has been enormous. The harbour should never have been allowed to reach the disgraceful state of siltation that it is now in. As I have said, the blame for this rests fairly and squarely on previous governments of Liberal persuasion. The present Labour Government in New South Wales, throughout most of the first six years during which it was in office, was plagued by war. It was physically impossible for that Government to do saw some of the worse floods in the history of New South Wales. These floods greatly In his second-reading speech, the Prime Government which will derive the greatest benefit from the increase of our coal-export trade I say most emphatically to the Prime Minister that with the financial assistance it proposes this bill is something of a threebeing done by the Hunter Valley Research card trick. Once again the people of New South Wales, in particular the people of Newcastle, are to be the dupes of this Government. For more than twelve years the people of Newcastle have received one of the worse deals that any government could hand out. For years we waited for a regional office of the Department of Social Services before such an office was established last year. We are still awaiting the provision of an all weather airport, but there seems to be no likelihood of our getting it from this Government. As I say, thefinancialassistance that this bill proposes for permanent improvements to the port of Newcastle is far too small in the light of the trade and commerce which might flow through that port in the future. It is certain that if we are to win new markets for our coal, and if we are to compete with American industry for whatever trade is available in Asia, particularly Japan, the trend will have to be towards the use of bigger ships. The Prime Minister envisages ships of up to 25,000 tons being used, but I believe that ships of up to 45,000 tons will be more in accordance with the trend. It will be quite useless to provide coal-loading plant for the quick and efficient loading of vessels if every now and then it is to be found that the channels and the berths where the ships load are silting up. For the past few years there have been no big floods in the Hunter. Nothing unusual has occurred in that respect since the Glenbawn dam was completed. I only hope that we shall see no more of the floods which have caused such a great amount of silting in the Hunter valley in the past. The leaders of industry, commerce and agriculture in Newcastle and the Hunter valley have always had to gamble against the occurrence of the next flood. Because of that, I contend that, for a permanent and lasting solution to the problem of the port of Newcastle, work of a far greater magnitude than is proposed in the bill will have to be undertaken by the New South Wales Government. I suggest that such a task is completely beyond the resources of any State government, irrespective of its political colour, especially with the rivers in their present condition of siltation. I want to pay a special tribute to the work Foundation in the field of siltation and the problems of the Hunter; but that organization's work is limited by lack of funds, despite the help given by the general public. I remember Newcastle harbour when shipping could move fairly freely in all parts of it. Ships such as the "" Euripides "", the "" Orcades "", the "" Nestor"" and many other big ships could move in and out of the harbour without their masters ever having to fear running aground. That was away back in the 1920's.' In the past few years numerous ships have run aground, and some of them have been aground for days. In order to end those conditions, much more money has to be made available to the State for the necessary work. The Hunter River rises in the Great Dividing Range, more than 150 miles from its mouth. Many other rivers are tributaries of the Hunter, and because of the massive area of its great watershed floods from time to time cause great havoc and damage. Many millions of tons of earth break from the banks of the many rivers which flow into the Hunter. In fact, the banks of the Hunter itself are continually breaking away and causing increasing siltation. Only last week, I saw the river bank at Tomago, where my brother-in-law has a dairy farm. At that point the scene speaks for itself. Acres and acres of land are being lost to production, not throughfloods,but through the stupidity of skippers of colliers who sail their vessels much too fast through the narrow channel of the river. Each vessel sends a surge of water rolling to the banks as it changes course when navigating the channel, and every now and again large chunks of earth feet deep crumble into the stream. Farmers spend huge sums on the building of retaining walls and on depositing heavy boulders on the foreshores of their properties, only to see their work disappear into the river rrom time to time. I often wonder why the farmers do not combine in a court challenge to the right of shipping companies to allow their vessels to cause destruction to the banks of the Hunter River in the Newcastle-Hexham area. In my view the port of Newcastle will never be free of the hazard of grounding until the river is made free of silting. For that to be done the movements of ships in the river itself must be controlled more rigidly. The Hunter River and its tributaries-the Williams, the Paterson, the Cockfighter, the Goulburn, the Pages and others all empty their waters into the port of Newcastle, and I believe that sometime they will all need a series of dams and weirs to control the flow, particularly in flood time. The control of the Hunter River in the manner that I have indicated could have a very beneficial effect on the whole country. Vast areas of excellent Iand could be opened up to irrigation and pasture improvement, from which the dairying and rural industries generally would benefit handsomely. I believe that the conservation of water in a region as vast as the Hunter valley would open up great possibilities for decentralization. Control of the Hunter and the de-silting of Newcastle harbour would ultimately save great expenditure on dredging. It is hard to estimate the extent of the saving, but I know that the saving each year would be considerable. No port of any consequence in Australia could be compared with Newcastle for ingress and egress if only the Commonwealth and State governments would give the port a fair go. In the past Newcastle has had a greater tonnage of goods pass through its port than either Sydney or Melbourne, and if ever the time arrives when the Commonwealth Government recognizes the importance of Newcastle to the Australian economy, and the commercial interests of Sydney lose their pettiearlier years in the building of breakwaters fogging parochialism and acknowledge Newcastle as a port capable of meeting their requirements more economically than Sydney. I have no doubt that Newcastle will come into its own and become perthe bungling that occurred in those years, let manently Australia's No. 1 port. or 30 years' time. The funds proposed They are the Tweed, Richmond, Clarence, under this measure are only peanuts comMcLeay, Hastings and Manning. At one pared with what is required to do justice time, sailing ships and steamers could be seen to port development at Newcastle. If the tied up to the Stockton dolphins four or five port is to be developed to its maximum abreast waiting to load coal, but that sight capacity, and if advantage is to be taken of has long since passed. To-day, you can tie the rural capacity of the Hunter valley, the up only small craft at most of those places. Commonwealth will be compelled to find the finance necessary. Each year for the next ten to twenty years millions of pounds will have to be spent on cleaning up the mess that has been allowed to accumulate over the past 40 or 50 years. The present condition of the Newcastle harbour and the Hunter River is a legacy of other days. In the years between federation and 1940 all that big business was interested in was the making of colossal profits. It was not concerned with the future of the waterway or the orderly development of industries in the area. The coal industry alone is a typical example of that, but time and the Standing Orders will not allow me to expand on that aspect of the matter. From about 1915 when I became interested in industry until more recent years, I have seen the slow but gradual decline of the Newcastle harbour. When the State Labour Government was elected to office 'n 1941 it not only was confronted with a decadent waterfront but also had to grapple with a world war of the worse type. For six or seven years, very little could be done to effect general improvement to the port. If the Prime Minister really wants to do something tangible to develop our overseas trade, and if he wants to see the port of Newcastle in true perspective, I invite the right honourable gentleman to take a day or two off from his office and allow some of us who know the port and its beautiful river to show him some of the fundamental causes of the silting of this magnificent waterway. Thc cluttering-up of the river in the 1920's and 1930's with old hulks and discarded vessels, together with the rotten engineering of and harbour works, have all contributed to the present state of the harbour.

Therefore, I ing has reduced the depth of water to nil at low tide. As a consequence, about three years ago the Newcastle City Council was compelled to build a 300-ft. walk-way out into the harbour for pedestrians to walk along in order to catch the ferry to Newcastle. In wet weather and when a stiff southerly is blowing, every one gets a ducking. 1 say to the House that the need for the council to undertake that work is an everlasting reflection on this Government, irrespective of what some people may think. I have said previously that Newcastle harbour is the most accessible port in Australia. I repeat that statement because I believe that there is in the making on the Stockton foreshore from North Stockton to beyond the mental hospital some of the best industrial sites any industry that requires waterfront anchorages from which to load and unload merchandise and materials could desire. Of course, there are many ifs and the main one is this: If the Federal Government would provide the finance, the work could proceed. At present, for two or three miles up stream the river is badly silted for about 200 yards from the shore. Thirty years ago there was 3 feet of water where mangrove trees are now 20 feet high. Mangroves are also growing out in the river where at one time there was 10 or 15 feet of water. It is my opinion that if the river is to be blotted out of the view of people using the highway to Nelson's Bay, then it should be blotted out by industry and not by mangrove trees. I suggest that hundreds belated and of the Kathleen Mavourneen of acres of mangrove-congested silt at Stockvariety.

Whether Newcastle and there are plenty of it is also too late will be determined by the suggest that it is up to the Commonwealth Government to reduce the interest rate to about 1 per cent, and allow the State Government to give the unemployed useful employment. The Coal Loading Works Agreement (New South Wales) Bill 1961 which was introduced by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) is not opposed by Opposition members. Our criticism is directed at the financial provisions of the bill and at the Government's delay in reaching a decision. The Government belatedly has recognized that such forms of national development as are envisaged in the bill impose an obligation on it to join the State government concerned-in this case the New South Wales Government-in promoting and planning them and also in providing financial grants. There is a great need for the introduction of modern mechanical equipment to enable Australian eoal exports to compete with coal from other nations, particularly the United States of America. I support other honourable members who say that the pattern of the legislation that has been introduced by the Government in the past week shows that the Government is engaged in an extravaganza of window dressing.

I asked also whether the Government had made a firm decision to ensure that money was made available to effect considerable improvements to the coal-loading facilities particularly at Newcastle and Port Kembla. I wanted a firm statement. I did not want any pie in the sky or airy-fairy evasions from the Minister. In his reply, the Minister did not actually answer the question. As is common practice with him, he evaded many issues of fact. I shall quote part of his reply but the passage does not misrepresent himPort facilities, and the loading facilities in the ports, have since federation been a matter . . . entirely within the responsibility of the State governments, and this responsibility is delegated to special port authorities. As late as March, the Minisler was putting up a defence against the proposal. At that late hour in the life of the Parliament he said that since federation, these things had never happened in the federal sphere and he asked, in effect, ""Why should they happen now? "" He went on to say that his colleague in another place, the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) was looking at the matter and addedTlie Commonwealth has now come in and has Intimated in thc first place, I think, to the State of New South Wales that it is willing in principle to contemplate some special financial arrangements which would enable the expeditious and adequate improvement of port facilities at coalloading ports. One would assume that that meant the Government planned to provide a very respectable sum of money to take the burden off the State Government, whose finances are already strained, and do something really big and national in its scope. But what do we find in the bill? In his second-reading speech, the Prime Minister referred to an earlier statement he made to the press. This was on 3Ist August and not on 29th August, as he said in 'his second-reading speech. In his press .release, he said that of the total Commonwealth contribution of up to £2,650,000; an amount of up to £1,000,000 would be by way of grant and would be provided from the Coal Industry Fund held by the Joint Coal Board. I point out that the credit balance in this fund arose as a result cf the board's activities using moneys provided by the Commonwealth.

Repayments by the Slate to the Commonweallh will not be subject to any sinking fund contribution by the Commonwealth. I put it to you, Sir, that the Government is not stating its attitude on this matter correctly. The Commonwealth in point of fact is providing £1,000,000 only for a programme that will cost the New South Wales Government £10,660,000, according to the schedule to the bill. That is a stupendous misrepresentation of its interest in national development. It will provide only one-tenth of the total amount. As the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Jones) said earlier, not one penny piece will come fronr Consolidated Revenue.

At least it would have had the basic virtue of sheer honesty and possibly dogged determination behind it. We could have understood such an attitude, but the Government does not do that. It makes a complete travesty of the presentation of legislation which is based on negotiations at governmental level. The New South Wales Government has not only to pay back this £1,650,000 plus £500,000 interest in ten years; it must also obtain from some other source an extra £8,000,000 to complete the scheme. The scheme does not involve coal loading alone. Wales let you down. Order! The honourable member for Perth to the quasi-governmental authorities to will remain silent.

But the work to be done does not stop there. The Council of the City of Greater Wollongong has further obligations. I must concentrate on Wollongong and Port Kembla, because they are in my electorate, but these points are common to Newcastle and will be common to the City of Sydney in respect of development at Balmain. Ancillary roads and water drainage must be provided by the local council and the county council must provide additional electricity reticulation, cables and all manner of equipment to enable the huge coalloading plant to function where it is to be located. In other words, a small new world must be constructed for the plant. The plant is not one isolated spot; there is a complete background of related equipment. unit can work. But no grant is made, either directly or indirectly, by the Commonwealth enable them to do this work. The Illawarra County Council has written to me saying that additional works associated with the coal-loading plant will involve it in the expenditure of between £120,000 and £150,000. The allocation to the council is about £600,000, and it must meet all its obligations from this sum. Obviously, the allocation is wholly inadequate. But the council cannot refuse to help this development, because it is of great national importance. Production in the Wollongong and Port Kembla districts munity.

Now, under this scheme, it is faced with finding an estimated £150,000. But there are no grants from the Commonwealth. There is no bigness on the part of the Commonwealth. All we have is a pigmy-like attitude adopted by this Government in refusing to realize these things and do something about them. The Government proposes to subsidize these works to the extent of only 10 per cent, of the entire cost to the State concerned, but no percentage whatever is to be provided for such local government instrumentalities as the Illawarra County Council in meeting their costs. That is obviously an unjust condition that should be remedied. I have made representations to the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) on that matter, but so far have not received his reply. One point to remember is that the State governments have moved with alacrity, perception a-.id determination in connection with these matters and I suggest that the statement made by the New South Wales Minister for Public Works, the Minister charged with the responsibility of executing the details of government decisions in these matters indicates clearly what will happen. As I feel that it is relevant, I shall quote what he had to say on 12th September about Port Kembla in particular. He saidModern coal-loading facilities costing £2,500,000 statement and in his second-reading speech, will be provided at the new Inner Harbour at Port Kembla. That is what it will cost the State£2,500,000. Yet the Prime Minister's statement indicates that the allocation for the work at Port Kembla is something over £1,000,000! There is certainly a big discrepancy there, and, no doubt there is a proportionate discrepancy in connection with the work to be carried out at Newcastle and Balmain. The New South Wales Minister for Public Works went on to sayWharfage and coal-handling equipment would be constructed capable of coping with the requirements of the export coal trade, and in particular, the Japanese trade. Rail and road access would be provided. This is the first phase of port development for the coal trade at Port Kembla, Newcastle and Balmain to be undertaken by the Government at a cost of about £10,000,000. Finance for the project has been allocated by the State Government, supplemented by assistance from the Commonwealth. I think that the Minister for Public Works was over-generous, that he over-stated the position, in making that statement without reservations. I think he should have qualified his statement by pinpointing exactly what was going on in relation to financing these works. He went on to sayThe work at Port Kembla has been programmed so that the new coal loader will be brought into operation by September 1963, i.e. two years from now. That is an important point, and I shall come back to it later. Are we too late in doing some of these things? These improvements will not be effected between now and the new year. Apparently two years will elapse before this new mechanical device will be put into operation at Port Kembla. This is a fast-changing world and the other coal exporters and coal-owners of the world will not wait for two years. They will not sit sweetly aside waiting until we are able to compete with them. The Japanese demand for coal will not be allied in any way to the fact that we are doing something which will not begin to operate for another two years. The Japanese need that coal now for their rapidly developing steel industry. They want it to-morrow, next week or the week after. They do not want it in the sweet bye-and-bye. By the language he has used in his press the Prime Minister has indicated that there is a vein of caution in his mind with regard to the success of this whole venture. Very clearly he does not propose to have the Commonwealth's financialfingersburnt; but he is quite prepared to dump the whole responsibility on the mother State of Australia-Ne w South Wales. The New South Wales Minister for Public Works went on to sayThe main features of the scheme include a wharf 700 feet long sited on the eastern side of Port Kembla's Inner Harbour, adjacent to the entrance. The harbour will be dredged to a depth of 38 feet. Vessels carrying 35,000 tons of coal and more will be able to use the berth. The facilities being provided will therefore accommodate the largest-sized vessel which the Japanese Steel and Coal Mission indicated would |,» j obtaining supplies of coal from n Australia. Let us pause there and refer back to the statement made by the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Jones), who pointed out that the coal-carrying vessels of to-day have altered greatly. RecentlyI read an authoritative statement to the effect that the American coal-carrying vessels are capable of carrying 70.000 tons of coal. There is a vast difference between that capacity and the capacity of the vessels for which we are preparing our Inner Harbour-thos e of 35,000 tons. The New South Wales Minister for Public Works has said that the Japanese have stated that facilities for vessels with a capacity of 35,000 tons would be satisfactory, but I dispute the wisdom of that. It is only common sense to argue that this provision may not be sufficient because the whole structure with respect to the selling price of coal overseas is very narrow. Indeed, it is almost razor-edged and every possible saving must be effected in order to compete with coal from the United States of America in particular. The United States is looking sideways at the developments the Australian industry has made in recent years and, with its great potential and the great industrial force behind it, it can do much to sweep right up against the wall the whole of our development and to impair greatly our ability to capture and, what is more important still, continue to hold markets in the foreseeable future. After all, ability to continue to hold markets in the future is the key to the entire situation. between sessions of Parliament! It is time If we are to be only puppets of Japanese industrialists in order that they might grab every pound of profit, as it were, out of using our coal just for the moment, then we should recognize that early and devote our efforts to the establishment of other services which will have more lasting benefit for the Australian people. Of course, that is purely a matter of conjecture; no one can arrive at a definite decision on that, instance, Japan and China, at this stage of but it is a thought that is in the mind of the Prime Minister as well as in the mind of every trade leader associated with the coal industry, and in the minds of many people who are knowledgeable in these matters. I have outlined broadly what the situaquate supplies right at her back door. I tion is in connection with Port Kembla repeat, the governments of those two counso far as finance is concerned. As I said tries are flat out now trying to iron out their before, the Minister is to be commended, political differences and get together. We but I must emphasize the uncertainty of cannot accept that this will be a great boon the future. We have no safe market for our coal. One of the major reasons why we have no safe market is the complete failure of this Government to give any national leadership in connection with the use of coal or its by-products. I refer in particular to the development of the chemical industry, the synthetic industry, and, indeed, to the whole galaxy of industries for which coal can be used. We should not be depending solely upon the use of coal for burning, whether it is burnt within our own borders or in other lands. In these modern times, coal is a valuable commodity because of its by-products. What is more important still, it is a wasting commodity. It cannot be replaced by growth. The coal industry is like the metal industry which has been sacrificed willy-nilly by this Government to overseas interests in an attempt to bolster its own position and to cover its own paucity of thinking in connection with overseas trade and its internal control of ourfinancesgenerally. Government is selling out our copper holus bolus. It is doing the same thing in connection with our bauxite. It is selling out everything. It is a wonder the Government does not try to sell the Post Office. Indeed, it is a wonder that the Government has not tried to let Parliament House in that the people of Australia came down to earth and realized the facts in connection with these matters. After all, from the point of view of providing work in the coal industry, the benefit to be derived from selling coal to the steel industry is limited. There is no safe market at the moment for our coal, nor can we be sure of our continued ability to sell it to other nations. For their political development, are remote markets. Politics can change in hours these days, and if those two countries fuse their politics, Japan will obtain most of her coal from China. She will not be buying coal from Australia at all, when she has ade-",49,Agreement New South Wales

133,Mr Kearney,"That is the truth. Theto us because that is problematical. It may come off; it may not come off. Those are the aspects which we must consider. Last week the press published the following report of a statement by the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) on the future of our coal export trade to JapanAnother warning on the future of the coal export mechanical methods. The work will be done trade to Japan was sounded last week, this time by the Minister for National Development, Senator Spooner. Senator Spooner said that America was ""not looking too kindly "" at the inroads Australia was making into the Japanese coal market. He warned of a price war and said: "" The United States is coming back on competitive terms. It is not only a matter of prices but also of providing loading facilities."" I give the Minister full credit for the broad sweep of knowledge on these matters which he possesses. We find thinking of that kind in many other directions. A clear picture is developing already on the south coast coalfields of New South Wales. Certain mines there which have contracts to supply coal to Japan are not able to continue profitably to produce and sell into that quarter because of the price factor. They are seeking a review of the conditions in relation to price. In other words, even though we are down on our knees in the matter of selling our commodities we cannot remain even there, much less stand up. That is a truism which applies to my own district in regard to the price factor in contracts with Japan. The Japanese Trade Agreement has not been signed again. It is continuing on a temporary basis subject to renewal every twelve months. Under this arrangement the agreement can be terminated by Japan or by Australia on three months' notice. A disturbing thought is now running through Australian industry in relation to the sale of our goods to Japan because of the present arrangement. The Government has suggested that the matter will be ironed out in the middle of next yearI think the Minister for Trade is credited with that assumption-bu t the point is that these are important and disturbing factors. Looking at the matter from the viewpoint of the workers, I emphasize that as a result of the intense mechanization and industrialization of the coal industry over the last ten years about 8,000 men have disappeared fiom the industry. As we develop further along those lines, which is inevitable, more men will disappear from it. In other words, they will become redundant. The provision of coal-loading facilities will not alter the position. It will not be a panacea for the ills of the unemployed miner. He will not go back into employment automatically following the continued introduction of new by highly mechanized devices and not very many men will be required. With the intense development of mechanical devices in the coal industry to-day fewer men are being required. That is the picture. What is being done for those men? We are still in the jungle stage of thinking at government level when we permit large numbers of men to be hurled out of an industry without an effort being made at the top level to train them for other employment and to ensure that in the middle of their lives they are equipped for a new trade. They are thrown higgledy-piggledy on the scrap heap, as they were in the 'thirties. I was one of those who suffered in those days and I know what happened. In this respect we have not advanced in the 31 years from 1930 to 1961. Why cannot a lot of this work be done by the coal companies? Why should public money be used for this purpose while the coal-owners sit back? Something worthy of note occurred on the south coast of New South Wales recently. The Coalcliff colliery company made preparations for the construction of an off-shore jetty which would take about eighteen months to complete. All kinds of plans and preparations, including soundings of the sea bed, were made, but as soon as the Government announced its intentions in relation to the inner harbour the company's plan folded up. We have reached the stage at which the Government is prepared all the time to help the big boy and wealthy industry while doing nothing to help the people who are disgorged from industry and suffer physical expulsion from their jobs. able member's time has expired. Mr L. R. JOHNSON (Hughes) [5.45] About five minutes ago I had no intention of speaking on this matter, but the honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Kearney)",51,Agreement New South Wales
134,Mr Speaker,"Order! The honorhas directed attention to some very important facets of this problem which I should like to develop. He has referred to the Coalcliff colliery which is m the southern part of my electorate. It is one of the collieries associated with the proposal to improve the port facilities at Port Kembla. The Government is to be indicted for its short-sightedness and lack of understanding of what is going on. The Coalcliff company, which is one of the largest coal exporting bodies in Australia, only a matter of months ago made the sensational announcement that its plans for the development of coalloading facilities in that area were well advanced. A short time ago I visited this mine with two of my colleagues in the State Parliament, the honourable member for Bulli and the Minister for Health, and talked to the executives of the Coalcliff company. They indicated that their plans were highly developed and that they had been working on this project for some time. They intended to provide, at their own expense, up-to-date coal-loading facilities across the surf. This was a tremendous project for any private company to undertake. I was amazed that the Government was indusiry. We set about our task assiduously not aware of what was going on. Surely and visited all States of the Commonwealth. a government which has any real compreTo ensure that the Opposition would not hensive plan of national development, incorreceive any praise, approval or recognition porating the coal industry which is one of from the community, the Government set the fundamental industries to be considered up a similar committee.

The company was prepared of 27th June, 1959, carried the following to meet the very considerable expense report:involved in this project, and its sensational announcement a few months ago was announced to-day that the Commonwealth Governsplashed all over the south coast papers. ment has set up an eight-man expert committee The company announced also that it had to advise it on research into the use of coal. worked on the plans for a long time and Unfortunately, events have proved that that had even had the proposal investigated by was a mere political hoaxa trick to draw Japanese people who had indicated their attention away from the genuinely inspired approval.

As the the Commonwealth had any responsibility honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr in respect of the development of ports in Kearney) has just pointed out, there has been New South Wales, claiming that it was a matter for the State Government. He was adamant about that. The honourable member for Hunter read the Minister's statement word for word. How in high heaven can the Government on the eve of an electionthat is a significant point-chang e its plans, abandon the assertion that this is a matter of State responsibility, and declare that the Commonwealth has an obligation, just as it has an obligation in relation to the railway line to Kwinana, the provision of beef roads in the north, the railway line to Mount Isa and a number of other things in respect of which it has denied for twelve years that it has any responsibility! We on this side of the House, and the people of Australia, are concerned about this position because we believe that important developmental matters which affect the future of this great country and the employment of many thousands of people are being made the subject of mere political humbug. We have seen this manifested in so many ways. Not so long ago-in 1959, in fact-the Labour Opposition established a committee of inquiry to investigate thoroughly all facets of the coal-mining pert committee, established by the Government and the subject of forthright announceNational Development (Senator limbo.

135,"Tlie Acting Prime Minister, Mr J. Mcewen,","no co-ordinated plan for the coal industry. We have seen mines closing down all over the countryside. Just a short time ago the Excelsior Mine in my own electorate closed and 200 men were thrown out of work at short notice. There has been no encouragement generally given to the industry. In the great South Maitland coal-field, quite a number of mines have ceased operations. They include Hebburn No. 2, Abermain, Aberdare, Pelaw Main, Kalingo, Bellbird and Aberdare Central. The only two remaining in that great northern coal-field are Aberdare Extended and Aberdare West. The Australian Government has failed to take adequate steps to encourage our coal industry and to preserve our great coal deposits. We know that very heavy inroads have been made into the fuel market by the oil industry. We have been spending millions of pounds on enticing oil interests to come into this country, at the expense of the coal industry. Unfortunately, although the great.coal deposits in the ground belong, in fact, to the Australian people, they have been leased out to entrepreneurs in other parts of the world. I did not expect to speak in the debate, which is scheduled to end before the dinner adjournment, and if any supporter of the Government had displayed sufficient interest in the debate to seek the call, I would not be filling in at this moment. However, I am prepared to speak because this is a very important topic. The honourable member for Herbert( Mr Murray), who is interjecting, represents an area where there have been closures in the coal-mining industry. One would have thought that he would be sufficiently interested to address himself to this measure. The coal mines in the north of Queensland have been denied the assistance they need from this Government and that is good reason why the honourable member should be participating in the debate. He probably regrets his interjection. intend to traverse ground which has already I simply want to indicate that the Government has no plans and has been indulging in political skulduggery in this matter. It has brought down this bill at the last minute and has caused great confusion in the industry. Here is another indication to the people that this Government is incapable of producing any plan for national development whether in relation to coal or anything else. It is unconcerned with the need to provide a plan which will bring to the Australian people the great opportunities that can result from the exploitation of our immense resources. While we recognize that this measure will mean some stimulation to the coal-mining industry, it is not sufficient. We hope that the government in the new Parliament will face up to its responsibilities in a far more effective way than has been the case hitherto. Question resolved in the affirmative.

137,Mr Fox (Henty) [8.0],"I do not intendhas a technical and practical knowledge of this subject. However, I feel compelled to make some contribution to the debate for two reasons. The first is that I wish to air a personal grievance in relation to the operation of rationalization. I do not quarrel with the policy, but I do object very strongly to some aspects of its operation. My second reason is that I want to debunk Labour's continuing complaint that this Government is doing all it possibly can to cripple Trans-Australia Airlines. During the debate last night the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) said that this bill was another step in the Government's plan to destroy-no t simply to cripplea great public enterprise. The honourable member for Bonython( Mr esting to compare figures in this report with Makin) said that this legislation set out to destroy a government-owned institution. The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr under a Labour government. The honourable Duthie), who was a little more restrained in his language, said that the legislation would erode the standards of Trans-Australia Airlines and weaken the capacity of the organization to conduct an efficient, paying airline. He said that the legislation was deliberately designed to limit T.A.A., and that it was loaded against that airline. Since 1952 this Government has introfleet consisted of twelve Viscounts, three duced a number of measures relating to the operation of airlines, and each debate on the various measures has provided the Labour Party with an opportunity to air its out-of-date propaganda and its worn-out than £12,000,000. The honourable member catch-cry that we are trying to destroy T.A.A. really believe that. However, the Opposisengers, and the total passenger mileage tion has so little of any real substance on flown was 211,000,000 miles. In the year which to pin its electron hopes that it is ended 30th June, 1960, more than 1,000,000 prepared to grasp at straws. For at least passengers were carried, the total mileage ten years the Labour Party has tried to having increased to 532,000,000 miles. In persuade the public that this Government 1948-49 T.A.A. carried approximately has done everything it can to prevent the 2,800,000 Ib. of mail and more than expansion of T.A.A. If that is true, the 21,000,000 lb. of cargo. In 1959-60 the Government has done a mighty poor job, comparable figures were 4,400,000 lb. and because the facts show that during the 38,000,000 lb. Menzies Government's term of office this airline has gone from strength to strength. craft are operating to-day, the hours flown Labour's objection apparently is that under have increased in the same period from the same administration Ansett-A.N.A. has 75,000 to 86,000. Revenue has increased also considerably improved its position. It is interesting to study the history of Trans-Australia Airlines. It was established by a Labour government on 12th February, 1946, so it has been in existence for almost sixteen years. For a period of less than four of those years it was under Labour administration, and for nearly twelve years it has been under the administration of a Liberal-Country Party Government. I have before me the annual report of the Australian National Airlines Commission for the year ended 30th June, 1960, which is the latest report available. Good and all as the position is that is disclosed by this report, I believe that the one disclosed in the report for the year ended 30th June, 1961, is even better. It is interthose for the year ended 30th June, 1949, which was the last full year of operation member for Farrer dealt with some of these figures last night, but I would like to deal with them in a little more detail. In 1949 .Trans-Australia Airlines had 35 aircraft. They comprised five Convairs, three DC4's, nineteen DC3 passenger aircraft, four DC3 freighters and four DH84's. These 35 aircraft had a capital value of £1,250,000. On 30th June, 1960, the T.A.A. Electras, ten Friendships, eleven DC3's, three DC4's, two DC6B's, four C47 freighters and two helicopters. These 47 aircraft had a total capital value of more for Farrer said last night that thefleetto-day consisted of 60 aircraft, and I am prepared to accept his figures.

139,Mr Fox,"I am not convinced that youCapital has increased from £4,400,000 to £6,400,000 in the same period. At 30th June, 1949, there were accumulated losses amounting to more than £900,000, and the effective capital that T.A.A. had to work with at that date was therefore approximately £3,500,000, whereas at 30th June last year, in addition to having its capital intact it had accumulated reserves of nearly £500,000, so that its effective capital was £7,000,000, or twice what it was in 1949. The book value of the fixed assets of the airline, which in 1948-49 was less than £2,000,000, stood at £13,500,000 on 30th June, 1960. The number of ports and stopping places serviced by T.A.A. more than doubled in the period under review. The number of persons employed increased from 3,393 to 4,168. Whereas in 1948-49 T.A.A.'s operations showed a loss of nearly £95,000, bringing the accumulated losses to that date to more than £900,000, for the year ended 30th June, 1960, the net profit was nearly £353,000. Mr Clyde Cameron -What' is the point you are trying to prove? the honourable member for East Sydney sought to belittle that profit of £353,000. He said that in 1950 the airline showed a profit of £215,000-the first year in which it had showed a profit-that since then the amount of traffic on all airlines in Australia had increased annually at an average rate of 6 per cent., but that in the intervening ten years the airline had increased its profit to only £353,000. The honourable member completely distorted the true position, because whereas in 1950 T.A.A. set aside £313,000 for depreciation, in the year ended 30th June, 1960, the amount set aside for depreciation was £1,250,000. In 1950 the total cost of flying operations, which included expenditure on fuel, oil, wages and depreciation, was less than £3,250,000. In 1959-60, it was almost £9,000,000. administrative expenses were less than £1,250,000, but, for the year ended 30th June, 1960, they were more than £5,000,000. In spite of these heavy increases in operating costs, Trans-Australia Airlines has gone from strength to strength. Each year, it has increased its profit, and, last financial year, it had an all-time record profit. I understand that its profit this financial year will be even higher. Jones. member about him shortly. Do the things that I have mentioned suggest that T.A.A. has been crippled by this Government, Mr Speaker, or do they show that, in truth and in fact, the airline has, under the administration of the Menzies Government, grown into a solid, solvent and efficient organization of which any country could be proud? I believe that I have some sort of a personal interest in the agreement covered by one of the bills which we are now discussing, because my Australian Labour Party opponent at the forthcoming federal election is a director of Ansett-A.N.A. and one of the three persons who signed the agreement on behalf of that company. Mr Malcolm Fraser -What is his name? Watson gave him the advertisement; I did not. afraid of giving Sir George Jones a free advertisement over the radio. it quite clear that I am not saying anything against the gentleman. The very fact that he is a director of an organization so progressive as is that conducted by Mr Reg Ansett shows that he has a great deal more understanding than a lot of his political colleagues have. The honourable member for East Sydney last evening referred to the allocation of air mail between the two airlines and saidIn 1949-50, the general What a stupid position for any government to put itself in! While operating its own government airline, it gave half the business available to it for the carriage of its mails to its private competitor.

"" Members of that party criticize Ansett-A.N.A. and this agreement, but let me remind anybody who has a short memory of what was said last night for the Labour Party. The honourable member for East Sydney said that this agreement was another step in the Government's plan to destroy a great public enterprise. The honourable member for Bonython said that this agreement sets out to destroy a government-owned instrumentality. I have already quoted some of the things that were said by the honourable member for Wilmot. He said, alsoWe are opposed, lock, stock and barrel to the measures that are now before the House. What could be more stupid or inconsistent than the action of the Australian Labour Party, feeling as strongly as this, and criticizing as bitterly as it has done this agreement that we are debating, in endorsing as one of its candidates at the forthcoming general election one of the directors of Ansett-A.N.A. who signed the agreement on behalf of that company? I wonder whether the Labour Party knows which way it is going. Melbourne Cup time has almost arrived, Mr Speaker. 1 think that Labour is just trying to have a bob each way. BeforeI pass on, I want to make one thing perfectly clear: We on this side of the House do not seek to knock Trans-Australia Airlines. We know it to be an efficient and well-run organization which provides excellent service for the public, but we say that this excellent service is due in no small measure to the fact that T.A.A. has to contend with competition from Ansett-A.N.A. Competition, in any sort of business, assures the public of good service. Where no competition exists, anything is good enough. The Government recognizes this fact, and it has resolved that competition shall be maintained in air services. I mentioned earlier that I had a grievance to air, Mr Speaker, and I come to it now. If one examines the time-table of the two in his second-reading speech saidairlines between any two main points, one finds a great similarity between the times established of the departure of the aircraft of both tuted by a chairman, nominated by the Minister T.A.A. and Ansett-A.N.A. Yet there are and known as the co-ordinator, and two members quite considerable gaps in the time-tables nominated by the company and the commission of both airlines when no services are prorespectively. The airlines agreed to review and vided. Let us take as an example services and between Canberra and Melbourne, which avoid unnecessary overlapping of services with are of interest to all honourable members. due regard to thc interests of the public . . , not be here long to take an interest in them. vices a lot longer than the honourable member will. He got a fright at the last election, and he will get a bigger one this time. Ansett-A.N.A. provides the first service from Canberra to Melbourne, at 8.30 a.m. T.A.A. provides the next, at 8.45 a.m. Then there is a gap of about seven hours until the next Ansett-A.N.A. aircraft for Melbourne leaves at 3.20 p.m. T.A.A. follows with one at 3.45 p.m. time-table for services between Adelaide and Melbourne later. To return to the services between Canberra and Melbourne,' T.A.A. despatches another aircraft at 4 p.m. and Ansett-A.N.A. has a further service at 5.15 p.m. Another. Ansea-A.N.A. plans leaves at 5.45 p.m. and at exactly the same hour the next T.A.A. aircraft leaves Canberra for Melbourne. One can find similar relationship between the respective services from any capital city to another. 1 have used Canberra and Melbourne only as an example. The sort of thing that 1 have described is even more noticeable in services between Adelaide and Melbourne. The first aircraft to leave Adelaide for Melbourne is a Trans-Australia Airlines service which leaves at 7 a.m. It is followed by an AnsettA.N.A. service at 7.15 a.m., and there is then a gap of nearly eight hours until 2.50 p.m., when each airline provides a service. The next aircraft from Adelaide to Melbourne is a T.A.A. plane at 5.10 p.m., followed by an Ansett-A.N.A. service at 5.30 p.m. I may be wrong, Mr Speaker, and I am open to conviction, but 1 do not believe that this sort of thing is in the best interests of the travelling public.

151,Mr Luchetti (Macquarie) [8.19],"the Prime Minister has remained silent about these things, because he has not spoken up for free enterprise, because he has not declared in favour of East-West Airlines Limited, because he has supported these financial people who are represented in this place by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Bury) and others in the city of Sydney and in Melbourne and Adelaide and elsewhere, the people in country districts are alarmed and concerned. It was not surprising that last evening we had the honourable member for New England( Mr tralia Airlines. It opposed T.A.A. at its Drummond), a former New South Wales Minister of Education and a distinguished member of the Australian Country Party, standing in his place here, and, without emotion, without heat, without any feeling at all, other than that he was serving his country and telling the truth, debunking the Minister for Civil Aviation and saying in the most calm, considered, polite and reasonable words that that Minister had not told the truth and that he ought to refresh his memory and look at the facts. I made a note of this, and it is an astonishand will continue to grow stronger. But ing thing to me that members of the Australian Country Party who sit behind the honourable member for New England have ""remained silent despite the attacks that have been made upon that honourable member in this place, where his reputation -has been torn to shreds by silence. Here we have men who have not been prepared to show the least courage to defend a colleague. This is a conspiracy of silence to which the honourable member for New England has been subjected. What sort of people sit behind that man? In my place here I often think, when I watch the honourable member for New England and the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) putting forward their proposals on matters of great importance to the nation, that they are the rebels, they are the outstanding characters, and that the men who sit behind them are the reactionaries tied to the will of this Government and the who seek advantage and favour in this land. So it is that Mr Shand and East-West Airlines Limited can be sacrificed, as they will be sacrificed under this Government, while no steps are being taken to protect them, aircraft to be used. The honourable memand while not one word has been said in ber for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn) referred to defence of their decentralized undertaking. the Caravelles. Trans-Australia AirlinesI am appalled and disgusted and saddened by what has occurred in recent times in this Parliament, when men like the honourable 'member for New England, prepared at great personal sacrifice and by the exhibition of great personal courage, to put the facts right, have to suffer almost being sent to Coventry as a result. Let us go through the history of these matters. In the first place, it is a well known fact that the present Government has never felt friendly towards Trans-Ausbirth, and has opposed it ever since, and on every occasion possible it has, in the vernacular of the racing game, given T.A.A. the top weight in every stake. is stronger than it was when the Government came to office. grown stronger, because despite the opposition of this Government it has had the support of the public. It has grown stronger in every situation that has arisen we have seen the Government's unfriendliness to T.A.A. In the first place we have had the attitude of the Government in regard to financial arrangements and the operation of T.A.A. The late Arthur Drakeford, who was Minister for Civil Aviation in the Labour Government, on more than one occasion when he was in Opposition in this place told the story of what he had to do to create that airline and of all the difficulties that occurred when he was no longer Minister. I pay a tribute to him and to everybody engaged in the operation of T.A.A. The people charged with running this great Commonwealth organization have been men of outstanding integrity and quality. Because of their knowledge of the aircraft industry and because they knew what the public wanted, they were able to produce the type of organization that would succeed in almost any weather. But despite this, the Commonwealth Government from time to time has taken action to deal with these matters. There was the matter of the type of",58,Airlines Agreements Bill 1961

154,Mr Luchetti,"Of course T.A.A. haswanted to buy Caravelles. Ansett-A.N.A. sought Electras. The honourable member for Darling spoke of the dangers of Electras and said when he was in them they seemed to be saying, "" Ta, ta "". Eventually there was need for modification. The Mark II . type came into operation after the aircraft had been sent to America. The Caravelles, which were made in France, had the British Rolls-Royce engines. We had a favorable trade balance with France. None of those things seemed to concern the Government, which was more interested in building up Ansett-A.N.A. than with the provision of safe and dependable serWales by his own courage and skill, l n vices for the people. Trans-Australia Airlines was under the leadership of Mr Warren McDonald, who was later appointed head of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. The airline has always operated a good service. One of the most infamous and scandalous things that have occurred was the decision of the Government through its Minister for Civil Aviation to compel the airline to hand over three of its modern Viscount DC6B's. forced into a shot-gun wedding. The Electras had to be returned to the United States of America for modification. These matters are well known to those who travel. Is it any wonder that we ask for a royal commission?

The honourable member for Franklin, who is rarely seen in his place in this Parliament, should not talk about nationalizing the air services. The honourable member stands for a private monopoly but he never wants to see a public monopoly. Arthur Butler built up an aviation organization in New South a time of adversity when he had to expand he had to take in outside capital and it was his own undoing. When Holyman sold out to Ansett, a chartered aircraft with a load of proxy voters travelled from Melbourne to Sydney to record their votes to destroy Arthur Butler. This was a man of private enterprise; a man of courage with business acumen. He was thrown into the maw of the Ansett-A.N.A. monopoly which is being sponsored by this aircraft for two outmoded Government in taking over East-West Trans-Australia Airlines was Airlines Limited. It is astonishing to me that a government which proclaims its faith in private enterprise has not come out to say in simple, straightforward terms to Mr Shand and Mr Pringle, "" So long as ws are in government we will guarantee you a free go in this country"".

156,Mr Luchetti,"Pleas e do not talktruth and a fine citizen. The honourable member for New England has no axe to grind in this matter. He is a member of the Australian Country Party and is an honest, honourable representative of the people in his electorate, where this decentralized organization functions and has flourished through the years. He has tried to preserve the organization. 1 take my hat off to a man who has the courage to stand up in this place for his people in defiance of the party machine and the threats that must have been used against him. I think the honourable member for New England is deserving of the highest praise and some of those who sit behind him should emulate him and have the courage to speak for their people. The honourable member for New England was quite kind to the Minister for Civil Aviation. He was quite reasonable and did not get excited. He said, "" I think the Minister's memory should be refreshed"". That was the kindest possible statement that could be made about a Minister who has persisted in his denials. On the one hand we know what Mr Shand, Mr Pringle and the honourable member for New England have said. On the other hand, we know what the Minister for Civil Aviation has said. The Minister's statements have been weighed in the balance and found wanting. I do not think we can accept his views. I am prepared to accept the views of the honourable member for New England. I do not know Mr Pringle, but I do know Mr taken any action to curb any monopoly. Shand. He is a progressive farmer. I think he is a supporter of the Country Party, but he is an honourable man. I am prepared to accept what these men have said. They have made their statements and I think in these closing days of the Parliament, it would have been right for the Prime Minister and the Minister for Civil Aviation to have withdrawn their denials, to have accepted the situation and to have faced up to it. What does the public gain from this dispute? After all, the Parliament should be concerned about the public. It does not matter what the Ansett organization gains or what Mr Shand gains. The only consideration of any importance is the well-being of the public. Over the years the people have suffered. They have paid higher has the courage to deal with the distribution air fares than they should have paid. What will happen if New South Wales persists in dividing the State and adopting a rationalization scheme similar to this Government's rationalization scheme for T.A.A. and Ansett-A.N.A.? The Minister says that he is not prepared to maintain services at the airports to meet the needs of the rationalization policy of the New South Wales Government. The public must suffer from such an attitude. Ansett-A.N.A. is crowding its passengers into its aircraft. One type of aircraft now carries 44 passengers compared with 36 in similar aircraft operated by T.A.A. These matters are known to my colleague, the honourable member for Darling, who is obliged to use these air services as he travels about the State. I should like to go on record as paying a well-deserved tribute to Reg Ansett for his business acumen, his courage and his ability to pioneer new routes. These are very good points, but why should one individual be allowed to engage in a drunken spree and give a gambler's performance in seeking finance? He is being allowed to play recklessly with the public. On the one hand, he sells notes to the public at 4s. 3d. while he issues other notes at 5s. Why should this Government allow these activities to continue? It has been proved beyond doubt that this Governnient is overwhelmingly on the side of monopoly and of big business. We have never seen any occasion on which the Government has We are accused of creating State monopolies, but what monopolies are created by this Government? In civil aviation, AnsettA.N.A. and T.A.A. are the only airlines allowed to operate on interstate routes. In steel, only one company is allowed to operate and it has no competition at all. In other fields, no competition is allowed, but a monopoly is given to one company. In New South Wales, if this Government had its way, only one intra-state airline would be allowed to operate. I should not pass this point without reminding honourable members of how Mr Butler, that great pioneer of airways, was drawn out of business. When the New South Wales Government of air routes within its State, it is told that in doing so it is breaking all the rules of the game and so must pay the penalty. Aircraft will have to pay landing fees, airstrips will have to be maintained, and subsidies will be denied. The Government is holding a threat over the head of East-West Airlines Limited. If this policy were carried into the wider field of civil aviation, AnsettA.N.A. would fold up to-morrow; it could not live if subsidies were withdrawn from it. Just to show how the press has championed the cause of the people on this occasion, I point out that the Sydney newspaper, the "" Daily Mirror"" able member's time has expired. ter and Minister for External AfTairs) [8.49] I do not propose to devote any time to what has fallen from the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti). Quite frankly, I have never heard him to worse advantage. Like the legendary tiger he went through a process of lashing himself into a fury with his tail. In the course of doing so, he came out strongI think that is the phrase-as the champion of private enterprise. This was a magnificent effort on his part, because when his party established Trans-Australia AirlinesI hope that this is not forgotten-it sought legislatively to establish that organization as the one single interstate airline in Australia. To hear people who sought to do that, and were frustrated only by the processes of the law, come out now as champions of free enterprise is really more amusing than unpleasant. The reason why I am taking part in this debate is that there has been an attempt in the last few days to create an air of scandal about something to do with my distinguished colleague, the Minister for Civil Aviation (Senator Paltridge), a man if I might adopt the phrase of the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) -of undoubted integrity, a man whose word cannot be doubted, a public-spirited man. I refrain from running through the whole calendar that he put to us. To-day, I notice that what I might call the juvenile, irresponsible evening newspapers of Sydney have really gone to town about this. There is a crisis! Somebody is going to resign! I do not know whether it is myself will be me. The honourable member for East Sydney hopes that I will resign. That is his one chance of getting rid of me. I just want to say this about the matter: What is the allegation? I think it is very important that the people of Australia who happen to be interested in this matter should understand what is the allegation. It appears to be that the Minister for Civil Aviation tried to persuade, or rather, to order East-West Airlines Limited to accept a take-over offer made by Mr Ansett, or by his company. When? In May, I960. This was an offer which was rejected by the company and which the company protected itself against very shortly thereafter by altering its articles of association to provide that shares could not be transferred except with the approval of the directors themselves. In other words, EasS-West Airlines Limited had an offer, rejected it, and then took steps under its articles of association to make quite certain that no offer thereafter could be accepted except with the approval of the directors themselves, meaning by that, Mr Shand, Mr Pringle and these other gentlemen we have been hearing about. All that took place in the middle of 1960. That is the allegation, unless it is alleged-and I should like to hear it if it is-that thereafter the Minister has been putting pressure on them, delivering ultimatums to them to accept offers which have not been made; because, if there is one thing that is clear about this it is that the only offer to take over their company that was ever made was made in May. 1960. That was rejected, steps were taken to see that it could not successfully be renewed, and not since then has any offer of a takeover been made to them. I have a very considerable respect for the intelligence of the Minister for Civil Aviation. He is a man with a great record in the administration of this department. He is a man who has done a great deal for civil aviation in Australia, and if I thought that he could be ordering people to accept a non-existent offer made by non-existent people, I would seriously worry",60,Airlines Agreements Bill 1961

159,Mr Ward,I hope so.,62,Airlines Agreements Bill 1961
160,Mr Menzies,"I know you hope itabout his state of mind. Yet that is the allegation. If the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), who is interjecting, does not mind, this is a very important matter. These charges have been made, I propose to deal with them, and I have made my first point on the matter. The man against whom is made this charge which, on the face of it, is fantastic, ship between the Minister and this airline, as I have just indicated, is now represented as somebody who wants to crush out of existence this airline. I just want to remind the House that this is the man who brought into existence for the first time a system of subsidizing these feeder airlines. But for what Senator Paltridge did in his administration, backed by the Government, EastWest Airlines Limited would probably never have made a profit at any time, for its profit, even in the years when it has had a profit, has depended on the subsidy paid by the Commonwealth. I am not quarrelling with that. I thought it was a very wise decision, but it really ought to give people some room for thought to consider that the man who goes to the trouble of devising a system of subsidies to maintain East-Wast Airlines Limited can all of a sudden want to destroy the company. subsidies. people who run feeder airlines who get the subsidies. I know you do not want me to talk about this matter, but I am talking about East-West Airlines Limited; and EastWest Airlines Limited under his policy not only has received a growing subsidy through the years since 1957 but also has received, on his recommendation, through his instrumentality, more than half of the fleet it possesses, because, in point of fact, of the total fleet of four DC3's and one Fokker Friendship used by East-West Airlines Limited, the company is indebted to the Commonwealth for two DC3's and the one Fokker Friendship. I am not quarrelling with the efficiency of this company. I think it is a very much needed enterprise. I do not argue about these things. I acknowledge them with pleasure; but, of the four DC3's and one Fokker Friendship used by East-West Airlines Limited, it happens to be indebted to the Commonwealth, through the instrumentality of Senator Paltridge, the Minister for Civil Aviation, for two DC3's and the one Fokker Friendship-mor e than half of its operating fleet. So that, in terms of capital equipment, the bulk of what the company has, has been found through him. As for the subsidy it enjoys, It had none until he came along and produced one. That is the short position about the relationand it is quite clear that, but for this subsidy payment, this airline would certainly have been unable to pay a dividend on capital at any time. I told the House that the Ansett offer, which was an offer of 56s. a share, was rejected by the company. The company, very naturally, I think, said: "" No, we want to stand on our own feet. We have local interests and we are going to preserve them."" That, I think, was an admirable point of view. I do not quarrel with it at all. After the offer had been rejected, as I have said, the articles of association were amended to make the renewal of any such offer practically impossible. The next thing that I want to say is this: Early in March this year, the New South Wales Government announced that it was making a review of rural airline services. That meant, of course, that, subject to subsequent negotiation with the Commonwealth, there would be, perhaps, some alteration of routes, some re-allocation of air routes; and, under those circumstances, what happened was that the Director-General of Civil Aviation, Mr Anderson, on 23rd March, 1961, wrote agaii. to Mr Shand setting out the details of East-West Airlines Limited's subsidy for 1960-61 and informing the company that the subsidy contract was being terminated pending the outcome of the review being undertaken by the New South Wales Government. That was an elementary business precaution because the amount of the subsidy would depend entirely on the re-arrangements that were ultimately made. This is said to have been a threat specially directed to East-West Airlines Limited. The fact is that a letter was sent to the Ansett company within two or three days of that advising that company in similar precise terms-that the existing subsidy contract would be terminated and that it would be re-negotiated as soon as possible when the recommendation of the New South Wales Government had been",62,Airlines Agreements Bill 1961

162,Mr Menzies,"There are all sorts ofreceived. So, Sir, that is that. We have heard a good deal of allegations about that matter, but those are the simple facts. Having said that, I just want to return to this allegation, which appears to be at the heart, if there is a heart, of this strange series of charges. Following the rejection by the board of East-West Airlines of the Ansett take-over bid in June, 1960, it was appreciation quite clear that the issue was dead. But when Archie and I visited you. thereafter conversations occurred between the Minister and representatives of the board Archie, I think, is Mr Smith, the manager of East-West. The first of them-indeed , of the airlineit was the first personal contact that Senator Paltridge had had with the board of Eastletter West Airlines-wa s in Canberra in about Sunday, 21st August, 1960, where we will be July, 1960.

Mr Pringle spoke to him about the Ansett bid and only way in which we could ascertain whether undertook to tell him the reasons, as a or matter of interest, why the company had the Ansett group. rejected the bid. is it not? He told the Minister why thc company had rejected the bid. The Minister replied, as any Minister would, that consideration of the matter was entirely one for the board and was not one on which the Governnient could be expected to have a ""view. During the course of this meeting, Sir, Mr Pringle indicated that the board did intend to have some further discussions with the Ansett group about a variety of matters, because people who are running airlines of this kind in the same State have a number of matters on which they may wish to arrive at agreement-workin g arrangements of one kind or another. He asked Senator Paltridge whether he could arrange this meeting for him. The senator said that he preferred not to do that, because he did not want to have any part in any negotiations that Mr Pringle might be contemplating with Ansett; that was his business. Nevertheless, Mr Pringle wrote to him in April. I direct particular attention to this because this-le t me remind honourable say? members-is a man writing as acting chairman of directors, a man who is supposed to have been threatened in July that he must get on and he must be taken over by Ansett, although the offer had long since disappeared. This is the man who is a threatened man, and this is his letterFirstly, I would like to convey to you our for the friendly and frank talk we had in your office in Canberra on the occasion The purpose of my writing you this personal is to inform you that 1 am taking my directors for a short holiday to Brampton Island on lor a friendly talk with Mr Ansett along thc lines mentioned in Canberra.

The Minister having said, "" No, this is not my business "", Mr Pringle himself got directly into touch with Mr Walker, of Ansetts, and his board in fact had some discussion with Ansett officers at this paradisical place-Brampton Island -whereve r it is. In March of I96J, that is, about six months after he had seen the directors of East-West Airlines at Brampton Island, Ansett again announced quite flatly that there was no renewal of his take-over bid for East-West Airlines and therefore, Sir, it naturally came as some surprise to my colleague, the Minister",63,Airlines Agreements Bill 1961

It now acknowledges that under its first legislative power, been continued. The new disbursement of that concerning trade and commerce wilh other countries and between the States, it is this Parliament's opportunity and obligation to rehabilitate ports but not, Sir, in Queensthird on the number of vehicles in it. These land. This Parliament has provided in times past very large sums of money to set up a new industry in a new era, to wit, the Aluminium Production Corporation Limited plant at Bell Bay, in Tasmania. Admittedly it has since sold the plant to the overseas interests which, very largely, control the production and sale of aluminium from Australia's own and the world's largest deposits of bauxite. So, that investment has been withdrawn from Tasmania. But this Parliament has not set up any similar industry in Queensland, where there are so many raw materials available for secondary industry in a geographic position close to new markets. Again, this Parliament, year in and year out, spends in Queensland a smaller amount per head than it spends elsewhere through Department of Supply. For the financial year before last the Department of Supply spent £768,000 in Queensland out of a tolal Australian expenditure of £51,159,000. Last financial year it spent in Queensland £795,000 out of an Australian expenditure of £51,711,000. The Department of Supply also places contracts for other Commonwealth departments. In the financial year before last it placed on their behalf in Queensland contracts for £1,500,000 out of a total for Australia of £29,355,000. Thc Minister for Supply( Mr Hulme) will not give the comparable figures for this last financial year, on the plea that now they figures last year-in fact he volunteered them. My concluding example of discrimination against Queensland is to be found in the current provisions of the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act. It is well known that the arrangements made to cover the quinquennium starting in 1959 will provide a lesser amount per annum for Queensland roads than would have been provided if the arrangements made for the previous quinquennium had Commonwealth funds among the States depends as to one-third on the population of a State, one-third on its area and oneare factors which inevitably operate to the disadvantage of New South Wales and Queensland which are large States and widely settled, although in some parts thinly settled. There are other States which are larger than New South Wales such as South Australia and Western Australia, but",65,Airlines Agreements Bill 1961

178,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [9.15],"Mrthey are settled only in the south-eastern and south-western corners. Having shown the general pattern of Commonwealth expenditure in the States and Commonwealth loans or grants to the States, and having illustrated how in every instance there has been discrimination against Queensland, I now want to deal in greater detail with the position of the railcerned. It took interest in the Mount Isa ways. On the question of financial arrangements for this Mount Isa-TownsvilleCollinsville railway there has been controversy from first to last in this Parliament, in the Queensland Parliament and throughout Queensland. It is no wonder that Queensland cannot build or rehabilitate the Mount Isa railway without Commonwealth assistance. There has been no significant railway reconstruction in Australia in the last half century except by the Commonwealth itself or with Commonwealth funds. The transcontinental railways, north-south and east-west have been built by the Commonwealth itself during that time. In the 1920's the Commonwealth provided the funds to build a standard gauge railway to link the New South Wales and Queensland systems by the coast route. In the 1940's it provided the money to increase the gauge of the railway linking the South Australian and Victorian systems via Mount Gambier. In the last three years it has provided the money to build a standard-gauge railway in Victoria between Wodonga and Melbourne. It is now providing money to build a standard-gauge railway between Kalgoorlie and Kwinana, through Perth and Fremantle. Under this bill it is providing much of the money to rebuild the railway between Mount Isa, Townsville and Collinsville. I have referred only to construction of tracks. No other significant railway construction in the last half century has been carried out without Commonwealth initiative and support. Furthermore, this bill provides for new equipment for the railways, as also does the companion bill which deals with equipment for the Peterborough Division from Port Pirie to Broken Hill in the South Australian railways system and for the Silverton tramway. For the Mount Isa railway, the one covered by this bill, provision is made for up to fifteen locomotives and about 500 wagons. For the Peterborough Division in South Australia provision is made for twelve locomotives and 100 wagons. I want to make one other point on the question of general assistance by the Commonwealth for railways. With regard to the Western Australian and Queensland railways the Commonwealth has shown an interest, or has been responsive, only when large mining companies have been conproject when Mount Isa Mines Limited made a proposal for the extension of its plant at Mount Isa. That was in 1956. In Western Australia, the Commonweallh showed interest in the Kalgoorlie to Fremantle and Kwinana line after the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited had shown an interest last year. The discrimination of which I spoke is again highlighted by the fact that in regard to Queensland the Commonwealth took more than five years to achieve agreement, while in Western Australia it achieved the agreement in only one year. Of course, the reason is unquestionably that Queensland has been so politically loyal to this Government that the Government thinks it can take Queenslanders for granted. In Western Australia and the other States the Government is considered on its merits and accordingly is more suspect, and particularly in the last twenty months. I now come to thc reasons for differentiating between the Queensland railway and all the others. Honourable members will rememberT will give the details presently -that in relation to this railway the provisions relating to the proportion of assistance being found by the Commonwealth, the period over which the State has to repay the money and the interest that the State will have to pay to the Commonwealth are all less favorable than are provided for the various works in the other States. The excuses have been twofold. The Prime Minister gave the reasons thus last Thursday. . . this is not a standardization work, and so should not attract the same measure of direct support as has been accorded by the Commonwealth to standardization projects. The right honourable gentleman does not say, nor does the Queensland Government, nor does Mount Isa Mines Limited, why it should not be a standardization project. There seems to be no reference in the agreement even to the provision of sleepers which could be readily used for converting the line to standard gauge. Such an arrangement was made in respect of the south-eastern division railways in South Australia, where the railway was built to 5-ft. 3-in. gauge on the State undertaking to reduce it later to the standard gauge at the State's expense. The sleepers were made of appropriate size and are already drilled so that they can be used to reduce the line to standard gauge. ment does not want standard gauge on this line. closely through all the papers on this matter, and I have not seen any reason given by anybody why it should not be a standard gauge railway. Queensland originally proposed to improve the railway by spending £10,000,000 on it. The Commonwealth later said, "" No, make more substantial improvements than that and we will assist you "". It was then agreed that £30,000,000 should be spent on it. I do not know how much more would have had to be spent to make it a standard-gauge railway. I should have thought that once the railway had been taken beyond the Burdekin River there would have been no extra expense involved in providing a standard-gauge railway. However, we have not been told why the standard-gauge line is not being provided. That was one reason given by the Prime Minister. It may be a valid reason or it may not. Then the Prime Minister proceededI might add that this view was strengthened when it was demonstrated by the most expert investigations that the re-vitalized line should have no difficulty in paying its way, including the complete amortization of its capital cost over a period of twenty years, and making a profit. It was a singularly sound economic proposition. Nobody has criticized that analysis of the financial position of the proposed railway. But a similar analysis has been made with regard to all the other railways. Nobody disputes that the Wodonga-Albury and the Kalgoorlie-Kwinana railways will be profitable propositions, and that they will be profitable propositions in twenty years, not in 50 years. I should have thought that the reason given there was no reason at all. We have been assured, and independent investigations have re-assured us in every case, that all the railway propositions, port propositions and road propositions put before the Parliament will, in fact, pay for themselves. So one is left with the solitary reason that this is not a standard-gauge proposal. The first proposal for financing the railway was that an overseas loan should be negotiated. This was a somewhat extraordinary proposition. One could not see why Australia had to borrow money overseas for this railway when Australia has not borrowed money overseas for any other railway this century. It is not as if any equipment whatever had to be imported. We had the materials and the skills with which to build this railway, just as we had the materials and the skills to build from our own resources all the other railways which have been built in Australia in this century. Nevertheless, Sir, the scheme miscarried. The overseas loan fell through. I am indebted to the Minister for Works( Mr Freeth) for a summary of the reasons, which he gave in a report to his constituents a few weeks ago. There was an impression that Queensland had not handled its application to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development very skilfully and so that body refused the loan. I suppose that, for the purposes of this bill, one can accept the proposition that the Queensland Country Party-Liberal Government did not handle very skilfully the case which it put to the International Bank. The Queensland Government then called in the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), who had experienced a resounding diplomatic defeat over the Suez Canal affair five years, ago. One should, however, give the Queensland Government the benefit of the extenuating circumstances that the right honourable gentleman had not then faced his subsequent resounding defeats at the United Nations a year ago and at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference concerning South Africa earlier this year. the honourable member relate his remarks to the bill.

The two States Suez Canal bank, though. Minister fell in there before he fell in on this occasion. 1 conclude that this was before his diplomatic defeats over the European Common Market were known so widely as they are known now. At any rate, Sir, for one reason or another-fault y handling by the Queensland Government or the further diplomatic defeat of the Prime Minister-Australi a did not succeed in obtaining from the International Bank a loan for this railway. I come now to the conditions under which the money provided for in this bill is to be made available. This money i's described constantly as a loan to the Queensland Government. If it were in truth a loan, the fact that it is not made under the Financial Agreement is surprising. If this were a loan made under the agreement, longer terms would be offered and the Commonwealth itself would have to contribute under the sinking-fund clauses of the agreement. Mr Hiley, the Queensland Treasurer, has asserted in quite colorful terms that this money is a loan and that it comes under the Financial Agreement. If is for this reason that the Prime Minister is at such pains to point out that this money is a grant under section 96 of thc Australian Constitution. If, then, this is a grant, one finds differences between the conditions attaching to it and the terms and conditions under which all other grants for railways, roads, ports or industrial enterprises have been made by this Parliament to any other State under section 96 of the row from the World Bank, are they not? Constitution. I shall now compare Commonwealth grants for railway construction and railinterest. way equipment. South Australia, as you. Mr Speaker, know, has received from the make, Sir, concerns the conditions on which Commonwealth the whole of the money the Commonwealth has provided funds for needed to widen the gauge of the railway railway equipment such as locomotives and from Adelaide to Mount Gambier£5,136,000. The State is obliged to pay for that purpose on the same conditions that back 30 per cent, of that amount over 50 I have detailed with respect to construction years. The average interest payable by the State is 4t per cent. Secondly, New South Wales and Victoria have received from the Commonwealth the whole of the funds required for the construction of the standard gauge railway from Wodonga to Melbourne are obliged between them to pay back 30 per cent, of that amount, and they have 50 years in which to do so. They have to The Prime pay interest on it at an average rate of 5k per cent. Thirdly, Western Australia will receive from the Commonwealth 85 per cent, of the amount required to construct the new standard-gauge railway from Kalgoorlie to Kwinana. The Commonwealth will provide £35.000.000 to .meet the cost of this project. The State will have to pay back 65 per cent, of that sum over an average period of 35 years. Half of it will have to be paid back over 50 years and half of it over twenty years. The average rate of interest which Western Australia will have to pay on those advances is 51 per cent. 1 come npw to thc terms and conditions on which the Commonwealth is providing funds for the Queensland railway project which we are now considering. The Commonwealth will provide only two-thirds of the amount needed to meet the cost of construction, or £20,000,000, whichever is the lesser amount. The State will have to pay back every penny of the Commonwealth advances. Repayment will have to be made over twenty years, and the State will have to pay interest at 54 per cent. Clearly, then, compared to South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia, Queensland will receive less, will have to pay back more, will have less time in which to repay, and will pay interest at a higher rate. which the State Government wanted to borpresently. The difference is in the rate of The other comparison which I wish to wagons. Queensland will receive assistance",68,Railway Agreement

186,Mr Murray,Thes e are the terms on,69,Railway Agreement
187,Mr Whitlam,"I shall come to that of the proposed railway. South Australia, however, is to receive the whole of the money required for new equipment for the railway in the Peterborough Division of South Australia-the railway between Port Pirie, Cockburn and Broken Hill. The amount to be provided by the CommonweaUh is £1,325,000, of which the State will have to pay back only 30 per cent. Repayment will be made over 50 years, and interest will be charged at 5$ per cent. For railway equipment, again, Queensland will receive from the Commonwealth a smaller proportion of the total amount required, it will have to pay back much more, it will have less time in which to make repayments, and it will pay interest at a higher rate. It has been said that the Queensland project concerns a narrow-gauge railway and that, therefore, the project does not deserve the same assistance which the Commonwealth has given to other States for railways which have been built to standard gauge or to broad gauge with an undertaking to reduce them subsequently to standard gauge. In fact, however, the equipment being supplied for South Australia is narrow-gauge equipment which can be converted to standard gauge. True enough, the wagons can be readily converted to standard gauge, but the locomotives are of 900 horsepower and there are no other locomotives of 900 horse-power operating on a standard gauge railway in Australia or, I believe, anywhere in the world. Locomotives of 900 horse-power can be converted from narrow gauge to standard gauge, but they will not be used on the standard gauge. Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes -The Victorian broad gauge locomotives were run to Albury on the standard gauge. the former Minister of Transport in Victoria, that the diesel locomotives which operate on the Victorian broad gauge were built in Sydney and travelled to Victoria on 4-ft. 8i-in. bogies which were changed at Albury. There is no dispute that standard gauge and broad-gauge equipment is readily interchangeable. Six and a half inches make very little' difference to the stability or the I am sorry speed of the equipment, But there is a very great difference between standard-gauge equipment and narrow-gauge equipment. A difference of 14± inches greatly affects the power and speed of locomotives. I have been provoked into some detail on this subject because the excuse has been given by a still earlier Minister for Railways in Victoria-the Prime Minister-that Queensland deserves less assistance for her railway construction and her railway equipment, as it is narrow-gauge. I point out that South Australia is receiving much more handsome provision for her narrow-gauge railway equipment than is Queensland, and although the wagons may be convertible the twelve diesel locomotives, while being convertible, will then be useless. I have made some reference to the increase of interest payments. If Queensland had received the money to be made available under this bill at the same interest rate as that at which the money was made available to South Australia for its south-eastern division, Queensland would have had to pay back £2,683,300 less over the twenty years of the agreement. I want to go into some more detail about interest. The Prime Minister referred in some detail to this matter of interest, which was first broached in this Parliament by the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) on 6th September when he asked the Prime Minister a question as followsTwo years ago, the right honourable gentleman agreed with the Queensland Premier that Queensland would pay to the Commonwealth interest on the loan for the Mount Isa railway at the rate from time to time determined by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development for new loans of not less than twenty years' currency. I ask the right honourable gentleman: Since the world bank rate of interest is now 6 per cent., will Queensland still be obliged to pay this rate, or will the State Government be permitted to pay the lower rate required of Western Australia under arrangements made within the last month, or the still lower rate required of New South Wales and Victoria under the arrangements made three years ago for the railway from Albury to Melbourne? The Prime Minister repliedThe honourable member will be gratified to know that, the better part of two years ago, at the request of the Queensland Government, we agreed not to apply the ruling rate fixed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and that we fixed a rate of interest in complete agreement with the Queensland Government.

Therefore, the Queensland Government's investments in Commonwealth bonds have been singularly unfortunate compared with the terms on which the Commonwealth is making a loan to the Queensland Government in this case. I wish to conclude with one more general railway. Mr Harold Holt -What was a Labour government prepared to do for Queensland? Government offered to the Hanlon Labour Government moneys for a Burdekin or any other coastal river scheme in Queensland on the same conditions as the Commonwealth has made money available for the past twelve years for the Snowy Mountains scheme. That means that the Burdekin, the Tully, the Fitzroy or the Herbert could have been conserved and used for irrigation and for hydro-electricity without cost to the State in the same way that the Commonwealth Government has made money available for the Snowy Mountains scheme without cost to the governments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia whose citizens benefit from it. I am not suggesting that each of these rivers could have been used for irrigation or for hydro-electricity. WhatI want to make plain is that the Chifley Government made that offer to the Hanlon Government and the incoming Menzies Government cancelled the offer. There is no question of the terms under which a Labour Government would make money available. A Labour government believes that Australia ought to conserve its water resources, particularly in the tropical part of Australia where we are more fortunate in our water resources than we are in the southern part. We believe that in respect of likely projects there ought to be the same thorough investigation as was made into the Snowy Mountains scheme. Then, if the economics of these schemes is established as clearly as it was in advance in respect of the Snowy Mountains scheme, the Commonwealth would offer to carry out the schemes. The Commonwealth cannot carry out these schemes, except in respect of the Northern Territory, unless it has the consent of the State Government concerned. I believe that no State Government would refuse to agree to the Commonwealth carrying out such a scheme. The Commonwealth would provide the money and Australia as a whole would get the dividend. Nobody disputes that the Snowy Mountains scheme has been a good investment. I observation concerning .this believe that we should at least investigate the economics of hydro-electricity and general production in the basins of the other rivers in the Australian tropics. You cannot have any of that conservation or irrigation or hydro-electric generation unless the Commonwealth provides the wherewithal in experts and finance. investigation of the economics of the proposal? have learned in Australia that there is no purpose in producing something we cannot sell. The Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) has asked me what a Labour government has done or what it would do for Queensland. No government has offered to set up industries in Queensland to use Queensland's mineral resources and Australia's human skills in the way Labour governments in Tasmania and in the Commonwealth set up the aluminium industry at Bell Bay-a n industry which was required by Australia and was required in an area where at that time there was no substantial secondary industry. The Commonwealth cannot build a railway in a State without the consent of that State. The Commonwealth can operate and regulate interstate shipping lines and interstate airways and can build interstate roads and regulate interstate road transport but it cannot build a railway in a State without the consent of the State. I regret all the more, therefore, that the Commonwealth did not make it a condition of this grant to Queensland that Queensland would give consent to the construction of any railway between Mount Isa and the Northern Territory border. I am not asserting that a railway would be the best form of transport to increase the cattle",71,Railway Agreement

If the Commonwealth had insisted on that condition, in due course we could have built a tropica] transcontinental, provided economic investigation showed that that would be a valuable method of opening up the country in thc north. Too much emphasis has been put on the fact that this railway depends on the .Mount Jsa mines. I am certain, however, that this railway will open up the whole of the Gulf area and the whole of the northern part of the State for many other purposes. should arbitrate on the economic justification? cultural Economics, the Commonwealth desert to Camooweal.

It seems odd to call the Mount Isa mine a small picture, but we are looking at only one aspect of the development of the whole of our north. It has been said that this railway will be re-vamped because the output of the mine will be increased and the railway will pay because of the extra freight that will be carried over it. 1 do not quarrel with that argument for one moment.

201,Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes (Chisfrom Townsville To Mount Isa Will Pay As,"transport to the Barkly Tablelands and areas of beef production. The honourable member for Herbert( Mr transhipment as between Brisbane and Murray) said that it was of no use always relying on the Channel country for the fattening of cattle. But nothing like the same amount of fattening would be needed if a fast standard-gauge rail service was provided from Camooweal to Townsville. The honourable member for McPherson, as I said, explained the costs of road transport and what they meant to beef producers. But if we are honest with ourselves, we will agree that the real reason why this railway is not wanted as a standard-gauge line is because the interests in the Brisbane and Sydney markets and even the Adelaide market still want the beef brought down from the northern areas to the southern markets. This, of course, adds even more to the rapid increase of our capital cities. We should look at this in a much wider sense. Townsville is probably the capital of this area. It has slaughter yards and I have seen areas there that could become fattening paddocks. But fattening would not be needed to the same extent now as it was when drovers brought the cattle across the waterless wastes from Camooweal to Dajarra and thentook them to the Channel country for fattening. As was pointed out in the Clapp report, the whole purpose has been to bring the cattle to the Channel country and then to the Brisbane market or sometimes down through Bourke to the Sydney market. It is about time we stopped this. Why are we as the Commonwealth Government not helping to develop new ports around our coast? This seems to me to be in the same category as activities mentioned by the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser). He said that Portland in Victoria is prevented from holding wool sales because certain people want the sales still to be held in Melbourne. How will we ever develop this country if we continue with the idea that all roads and all forms of transport must go to the existing capital cities. I know that one reason for making the line from Mount Isa to Townsville a 3-ft. 6-in. line is that Mount Isa must get metalopinions expressed by the honourable memlurgical coke from Collinsville and it is wasteful to transfer coke on its journey from Collinsville to Mount Isa. I agree with that. But as it is only 150 miles from Townsville to Bowen and down to Collinsville, why do we not make this line a standard gauge line and cause any necessary Townsville to take place at Bowen? Or on the short stretch between Bowen and Townsville we could do as we are doing between Seymour and Melbourne and put in a third line. This would be a more practical use of the money than merely revamping the 3-ft. 6-in. line. We should not stop at Mount Isa and handle practically only the mining production. We should go one step further and take the line to Camooweal as the basic loading place for the whole of the Barkly Tablelands. One does not need to be an expert in beef cattle to know that even with the road trains young beasts or some of the very old beasts often cannot be taken out. But many more head of cattle could be taken from the tablelands and surrounding areas if good loading facilities and a fast standard-gauge rail link to Townsville were provided. It seems to me that we have returned to the old position-tak e the cattle to the Channel country to fatten and on to the Brisbane market, but do not build up a new port and a new capital in Townsville and the northern areas. This is all wrong. I am sorry that at this stage of our development we cannot look at this project in anything but a piecemeal fashion. was very pleased to hear the speech of the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes), because I have made a similar speech on numerous occasions. I too believe that this line should be a standard-gauge line. Apparently the Government does not believe in standardization. It has no constant policy; it has only a piecemeal policy. We will have a standard gauge railway from Brisbane to Perth; but Brisbane is only half-way between Melbourne and Cairns. Although £30,000,000 will be spent on this railway, it will never be a standard-gauge line; the £30,000,000 will be spent only in reconditioning the old line. I was very pleased to hear the ber for Chisholm. I would have preferred the railway to be taken to Camooweal. Most of the cattle brought from the Northern Territory are placed in holding paddocks in the vicinity of Camooweal. The cattle are",73,Railway Agreement
202,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [10.8],"Iheld there for a while and subsequently taken to Mount Isa for shipment by rail. The reason I rise to speak on this measure is that I made a speech about the Mount Isa railway on 30th August last because at that time a very savage debate was taking place in the Queensland Parliament. An attack was being made upon the Country Party-Liberal Party Government there and the upshot of it was that the Premier of Queensland came to Canberra. Because the matter was topical, I referred to it. I do not propose to repeat what I said then, but I do wish to make some comment on a statement made two years ago to-morrow by the Prime Minister( Mr of both mineral and pastoral development in Menzies), and I propose to refer to a letter the Prime Minister sent to Mr Nicklin, the Premier of Queensland, two years ago, and to Mr Nicklin's reply to the Prime Minister two years ago. The reconditioning of this line was first suggested in 1956 when a Labour government was in office in Queensland. Mount Isa Mines Limited had informed the government of what it proposed to do. It was quite obvious from the information given that the existing railway would not be able to cope with the projected increased production at the Mount Isa mines. On the occasion of the general election in 1957, the present Premier of Queensland, Mr be worked out on the official level but they will Nicklin, a Country Party Premier, said in his policy speech that, if elected, his government would proceed with the reconditioning of that line. The last time. I spoke about the matter I mentioned the investigations by representatives of the International Bank. We were ultimately told of how the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) and the Prime Minister endeavoured to arrange finance abroad for the reconditioning of this line. Then, after the International Bank had made its investigations, after the application had been rejected, after the Treasurer and the Prime Minister had failed to interest other financiers abroad in advancing money for the reconditioning of this line, the Prime Minister said, "" We will finance it "" . In other words, since 1959, Queensland has been given the run-around in connection with this project. In fact, this Government gives Queensland the run-around in connection with all propositions related to the development of that State. Notwithstanding the fact that this Government had been procrastinating, Mount Isa Mines Limited pushed on with the proposals for stepping up production from 8,000 tons a day. The present line can cope with 8,000 tons a day, but the ultimate target is 14,000 tons a day and the line cannot cater for that increase. In 1959, the Prime Minister issued a statement relating to the Mount Isa railway. I have a copy of the statement. It makes very interesting reading. In it he saidWe are both That is, the Queensland and Commonwealth governmentsenthusiastic about the project and will do all we can to see it completed as a whole in the interests northern Queensland. They are both enthusiastic! Their enthusiasm must have died just after the Prime Minister made that statement because it has taken two years for any move to be made. The Prime Minister made that statement in August, and he repeated it on 26th October, but with the October statement he also published the letter which he sent to Mr Nicklin on the same date. In the October statement, the Prime Minister saidTo-day I am able to publish a letter from myself to Mr Nicklin, Premier of Queensland, dated 26th October and a reply from him which I have received to-day. Some details will have to not, I imagine, create any difficulties. Two years ago! No difficulties! Why the delay? The Prime Minister went on to sayIn effect, therefore, the great problem of the financing of the rehabilitation of the railway from Collinsville to Mount Isa in north Queensland will be solved and a new era of north Queensland development will be opened up. It has taken two years for this new era to be opened. Towards the end of his statement the Prime Minister saidIt will be widely realized that this has been a big decision for us to take. We have taken it because we have a great faith in the future of north Queensland and have felt all along that this railway undertaking is the key which can unlock the door to major development. Two years ago! It has taken a long time to produce the key for unlocking the door to major development. I do not propose to quote the whole of the Prime Minister's statement, but I shall refer to one other section of it. All through the statement, the Prime Minister laid great stress on the question of development. The other passage to which 1 wish to refer readsMr Holt, on his recent journey abroad, conducted wilh the Secretary to the Commonwealth Treasury, Sir Roland Wilson, a close examination into all possible sources of special borrowing for the Mount Isa railway, including those whi.h had been suggested from the Queensland end. It turned out there was no immediate prospect of such a loan raising. This was, from our point of view, unfortunate since to obtain the money overseas would have had the dual advantage of strengthening our overseas funds while at the same time helping to finance this great enterprise in Australia. The Government was more concerned about building up overseas funds than about producing the key that would open the door to the development of this great northern part of Australia. All through his statement the Prime Minister lays stress on the development of the north. He made statements such as, "" This is the key "", "" I would like to see something done about the matter"", and the like. He spoke about how "" my colleagues and I have been very interested in this particular project"", but nothing was done for two years. In his letter to Mr Nicklin dated 26th countries.

But, as we know from for the delay in bringing this forward is what you and others have told us, and from our that Mount Isa Mines Limited, a mining own investigations, the whole of the north-western company, had been asked to guarantee to region is rich in possibilities of other developments, some of them perhaps being likely to materialize in the not far distant future. 1 have therefore come to think of the railway as being vital not only for the Mount Isa expansion itself but for the whole future of northern Queensland. That was what the Prime Minister wrote to Premier Nicklin. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition read a question that I asked the Prime Minister in connection with the interest rate that would be charged on this advance. I asked the Prime Minister whether it was intended to charge the same rate of interest as was charged by the International Bank. The Prime Minister said that I was two years behind the times. His statement was not true, because the Prime Minister, in his letter to Mr Nicklin dated 26th October, 1959-tw o years ago to-morrow-stated The same consideration has guided us in determining thc matter of interest rates.

It was announced then that an under consideration the terms and condiOne of the reasons that has been given pay the rail freights for 29 years. No company, much less a mining company, could give such an undertaking. Rich though Mount Isa is, the ore is in the ground and the price, too, might be below the surface. In other words, the company does not know what the price of the ore will be and it might have to suspend operations if the proposition became uneconomical. How could one expect any company to give an undertaking of that kind? I ask the Government whether the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited was required to give a guarantee with regard to the Kwinana project in Western Australia. Was the Victorian Government required to give a guarantee in relation to the Wodonga-Melbourne standardization project? Queensland was singled out. If it were not for the fact that an election is coming, we would not be receiving the £5,000,000 for roads and we would not have this railway bill before us on the night before the Parliament will rise. It is quite obvious from the statements made by the Prime Minister in his letter to that State has to buy new rolling-stock, the Premier of Queensland that two years including new trucks, and it has to pay for ago all was agreed.

Is it any wonder that, as wealth would have to give the same treatlate as August, two months ago, the Premier ment to Queensland as it is giving to and the Treasurer of Queensland were Western Australia. Western Australia is in a much more fortunate position in this regard than Queensland. Being a claimant State, Western Australia can go before the Commonwealth Grants Commission, a body constituted by and under the jurisdiction of this Parliament, and the repayments required under the bill relating to the Western Australian railway project will be provided for by the commission. In effect, the Commonwealth Government will then be paying most of the cost of that line. I refer again to an editorial which appeared on 30th August. I referred to it on the last occasion on which I spoke. It castigated this Government, which had announced, a day or so before, a loan of £1,325,000 to South Australia for the purchase of rolling-stock. I do not want to anticipate the debate on that matter, but much has been said in regard to the subject. Only about 30 per cent, of the expenditure on that rolling-stock will have to be repaid by South Australia. Out of the £20,000,000 to be provided to Queensland, It is all very well for this Government tralia. As I have said previously, it has a McPherson Range complex.

He knows quite well that since the Nicklin coalition Government took oflice in Queensland it has been progressive in its approach and has instituted much developmental work. Immediately it saw the need for improved railway facilities from Mount Isa to TownsviUe it got an expert report and put a proposition to the Commonwealth. It asked for £20,000,000 out of the estimated cost of £29,000,000 and the Commonwealth Government finally arranged this. The honourable member knows that during his long term as a member here and during the long run of the Labour Government in Queensland, no such thing ever happened in that State. Now he is trying to work himself into a fury. I was interested to hear the honourable member say that he supports the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes). The honourable member for Chisholm made two points. First, he dealt with the railway gauge and then he said he was against bringing cattle down to the capital cities in the south. I do not know whether the honourable member for Kennedy meant that he supported the honourable member for Chisholm on both those points. continuing of the railway to Camooweal. member did support the remarks about southern shipment of cattle, then he did not know the geography of his own electorate, because he should know the Mount Isa railway runs into Townsville and that the Mount Isa to Boulia road connects up with the Winton railway which takes you to Townsville or to Rockhampton, according to which line is travelled, and not to the capital cities. If he supports the honourable member for Chisholm, he apparently does not want the cattle to go to the Townsville meat works. As I have said, the honourable member was just working himself up into a state of fury, without any real reason for The honourable member said that the Government has no policy. Of course it has a policy. It has a policy of development, and has spent in recent years, or has arranged for the spending in the near future, of £74,000,000 in the north of Australia. This is no mean feat. This is really getting into development. The railway from Townsville to Mount Isa will link up with the road across to the Northern Territory. Honourable members will recall that we have allocated large amounts of money for additional roadworks in the Northern Territory, and these will also link up with roads in the north of Western Australia. Of course, we have a purpose iti everything we do. When honourable members talk about beef going south from the Channel country they simply show that they do not know the geography of Queensland. The Premier of Queensland has set out the priorities established by the Queensland Government. In effect, the Commonwealth Government accepts these priorities. Where it is considered that the priorities laid down by the Queensland Government may not be the most suitable, it has been arranged that the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government will negotiate to arrive at a mutually satisfactory arrangement. The Normanton to Julia Creek road, for instance, to which we are committed, and which is mentioned in the beef-roads legislation, is given a certain priority. Does the honourable member suggest that the Georgetown to Mount Surprise road is not developmental and should not have a priority, linking, as it does, with the Hann Highway, and so enabling produce to be taken to the Townsville meat works? Does the honourable member suggest that the Mount Isa to Boulia road, which will connect with the top end of the Channel country and link up with the railway at Winton, to take goods to Townsville, or through Longreach to Rockhampton, should not be priven priority?

It is only since the present Government has been in office in the last three years that these projects have been advanced. The honourable member knows quite well that these works are State responsibilities. land was 6 per cent. The offer made to I need hardly say that we have no control over the State railway systems. Both the honourable member for Kennedy and the honourable member for Chisholm said they were not happy about the fact that the railway is to be built to the 3-ft. rate at 5 i per cent., although the world 6-in. gauge. The honourable member for Kennedy referred to the expert advisers who had been appointed. The fact is that those advisers reported against any alteration in the gauge. They said that such an alteration would result in a break of gauge which would be a disadvantage in handling goods coming from the south and iri handling coal going south from Collinswhich money is lent, and we want the ville. I might add that if a standard-gauge railway was built, the Queensland Government would have to find extra rolling-stock for that line alone. It could not be used on the main railway system. The expert consultants also said that there is no advantage in constructing to standard gauge, for it would be premature before the north coast line was constructed to that gauge. They said that the 3-ft. 6-in. line would be simply not required this loan money before quite capable of handling the traffic. They gave pretty sound reasons. Why should you isolate one railway line right up in north Queensland? The honourable member for Kennedy himself said that Cairns is as far from Brisbane as Brisbane is from Melbourne, and all the railways between Cairns and Brisbane are of the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. It would not be even common sense to provide a standard-gauge line, let alone railway sense. I cannot agree with either the honourable member for Kennedy or thc honourable member for Chisholm on this point. Thc honourable member for Kennedy also raised the question of interest. Unfortunately I was otherwise occupied when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) spoke on this matter, but I believe he referred to the question of interest, and it was later referred to again by the honourable member for Kennedy, who said that two years ago the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) had offered assistance at 5i per per cent, interest when the world bank's interest rate was 51 per cent. I can tell the honourable member that the world bank's rate at the time the offer was made by the Prime Minister to the Premier of QueensQueensland, and accepted by the Queensland Premier, was on that basis. The Premier had a second thought about the matter. He wrote and asked for further consideration to be given to it, and the Prime Minister agreed to set the interest bank rate was 6 per cent. matter of opinion, on which I might even agree with the honourable member for Lalor. However, if that is the basis on money, we simply have to borrow it on that basis. At least, the Commonwealth Government gave the Queensland Government the advantage of a lower rate. Let me also refer to the charge of delay made by the honourable member for Kennedy. If thc honourable member was honest about the matter he would agree that there has been no delay, because Queensland has now. The Queensland Government agreed to find £9,000,000 and the Commonwealth £20,000,000. Queensland has been prepared to spend its own money until now, but it anticipates that it will want some loan money during this financial year. Therefore, it is prepared to sign the agreement and the Budget provision has been made accordingly.

Honourable members who recall thc facts correctly will remember that the prepromote productfbn. The existing line has sent Queensland Government went all over the world cap in hand in an attempt to get the money needed to finance the work on this railway from Mount Isa through Townsville to Collinsville. I mentioned this fact once before in this House, and the Minister for Supply( Mr Hulme) said that I was wrong. I have since checked on the matter again and I find that what I have said is correct. The Queensland Government tried everywhere to get this money before the Commonwealth Government said that it would finance the project. I do not know where the £20,000,000 its loan funds would then not be available required is to come from. 1 do not know for amenities such as hospitals and schools, whether it is to come from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, from funds provided by a bank or from some other funds.

Cast your mind back, Sir, to the .time when the present Queensland Government took office. It applied to the Commonwealth to make Queensland a mendicant State. It wanted to take advanmission. However, the Prime Minister talked that Government out of the idea by saying that it would not gain anything. As a consequence, Queensland has been unable to get a grant from the Commonwealth for the proposed work on the Mount Isa railway. The whole of the £20,000,000 will have to be paid back at 51 per cent. This Government could at least have granted an amount equivalent to the total amount of interest that will be paid at the rate of 5} per cent.

The whole of the people of Queensland are despondent about the treatment that Queensland has received from this Government, as evidenced by the financial arrangements for this project. No grant is to be made, and no allowance is to be made for the acquisition of rolling stock and the like. 1 turn now to the employment of overseas engineers to design and supervise the work. This represents a slap in the face for the engineering profession in Australia. This project is not a difficult job. Many more difiicult jobs have been undertaken in Australia by our own engineers. The design and supervision, as well as the actual construction work, for many other railway lines in Australia have been undertaken by our own engineers. I think it is a shame for this Government to condone the apathetic attitude towards the engineering profession in Australia that is evinced by the present Queensland Government. Australian engineers, as 1 said, could have done as good a job as overseas engineers can do. What was behind the decision to have people from overseas to do this job? Was it so that more sympathetic consideration would be forthcoming in relation to the international loan tofinancethe construction of the line? Was it essential to have overseas engineers? I do not think so, because the line presents no engineering difficulties. Australian engineers should have been employed on this Australian project. While the international consultants were never be replaced. The same will happen here looking into the prospects regarding in relation to the workshops. It has already this line they also reported on the economics been stated that the Maryborough and of Queensland's railways generally.

This is being Australia. done in areas which are already badly served in relation to other facilities like schools, hospitals and medical services. What is going to happen in relation to the report, which I have not yet seen and which I do not think anybody in this House has yet seen, which recommends that the Queensland Government close its railway workshops on the east coast? What is going to happen to the development of this country if people from outside are allowed to tell us that we can make more profit on centralizing such activities? Any fool could tell us that. It does not take an expert to know that if work can be confined to a certain area the cost of carrying it out will be less. But what about development, and what about the decentralization we are always taking about here but doing practically nothing about? Centralization, with more profits, and not decentralization seems to be the order of thc day. One project or activity cannot be divorced from another. If we are determined to develop this country's great natural resources, even if we lose money in the first instance, we have to get on with the job. looking at the picture as a whole, because in the long run we will benefit. It is a poor state of affairs when outsiders make recommendations-whic h are accepted-that are contrary to the overall interests of our development. We should have before us the report on the Mount Isa line so that we can judge the capacity of those people from overseas, who call themselves experts, who have recommended, certain action which this Government will finance.

223,Mr Fulton,"They are problematical,The Government should have a knowledge of the report of those people to satisfy we shall have two States-Queenslan d and itself that they are imbued with the right spirit in regard the whole of the implications of the project. The project cannot be considered on its own. It must be considered in relation to development as a whole. We have a magnificent and lovely country endowed with great natural resources and we are cruelling it by trying to make everything pay to-day. That is pot the right way to go about things. Australia has a tremendous potential. I hate that word because it has been bandied round so much, but it is the correct word in this instance. What are we doing with those resources? To develop this country we have to take a broader outlook than is being taken at present. When a project is put to this Government the first question it asks is, "" Will it pay?"" The Government does not think of to-morrow, but we have a duty to the people who will come after us. We have a heritage to develop, not for ourselves but for future generations. On the matter of the gauge of this line I think some consideration should have been given to the possibility of its standardization in the future. The Government should have made enough money available to enable that to be taken into account. I do not say that the gauge should be standardized immediately, because the line would not link up with any other standard-gauge system, but there should have been some thought of the future. Why was the Government not generous enough to take this attitude? I believe that far too narrow a view is taken of such projects. Every project put before this Parliament is too narrow in concept. We are not looking ahead. We are supposed to be statesmen, people looking to the future and not confining ourselves to narrow projects designed only for to-day. Incidentally, it has been said that the last administration in Queensland was decadent and did not put any good propositions to the Commonwealth. I deny that, because every project put to the Commonwealth by the Queensland Labour Government was met by the attitude that the project was parochial and could not be considered. If two States had been concerned that would have been different. Let us cut Queensland in halves so that north Queensland-and then various projects will have an interstate character which should attract Commonwealth assistance. I must admit that the attitude I have referred to was taken by the previous government as well as the present Government. Every project for the development of Queensland such as the Tully Falls and the Tinaroo schemes has been financed by the Queensland Government. Not one penny has been granted by the Commonwealth Government. That is why I wish to refer to the grant for beef roads. It is all very well to provide £5,000,000 for those roads but I suspect that this grant has been made to cover up past misdemeanours of the Commonwealth in respect of Queensland. The electrification of Queensland has been done by the Queensland Government on loan money and it is a very efficient system. The Tully Falls scheme is supplying or will supply Townsville and the area to the north of it. Honourable members must remember that Queensland has earned more money overseas than has any other State by the export of its sugar, dairy products and other primary products. This Government has not fully examined every aspect of the Mount Isa mines. It has taken every opportunity to offer objections rather than help the mine. The decision to employ overseas consulting engineers to supervise and construct the line is a slap in the face for Australians. The project is not a difficult one. Any engineering firm in Australia could have coped with it just as capably as any overseas firm and with a better spirit. That is the main objection I have to more sympathetic consideration of this project. -In supporting this bill, I want to make a few brief, constructive remarks. I listened carefully to the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) and other members advocating a standard gauge for this line. Our committee on railway gauges some years ago looked at this proposal in detail. We did not think then that a standard gauge line was justified for the reasons given by the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann) and others in this House. We felt at that",83,Railway Agreement

Having said that, let me say also that gauge length from the outset. It may well we did not think that the door should be be that if we lay a 3-ft. 6-in. track now we closed to future standardization of this line. can put in a third rail in later by the It may well be in the future that the situatechnique which I think is tolerably estabtion in Queensland or elsewhere may lished, but which we have perhaps been change, though we must remember that inclined to dismiss too summarily.

If wooden survey, which has not yet, I understand, sleepers were chosen, we felt that perhaps been carried out in detail, proves that this the extra outlay-excep t for the black soil is practicable. that the sleepers should be of standard So much for gauges. Now let me say Honourable members will remember that the line, after leaving Clonto fly over it. I made a special inspection of this. Of course, you cannot be certain I say this because I believe that what Mount Isa is one of the really great The mathematics of this are very simple. Suppose the line carries in both directions together 4,000,000 tons a year. At Id. a ton mile, this means a saving of 4,000,000 pence or about £16,000 for every mile the line is shortened. It is not justified, of course, to change the route if we think, of Mount Isa only as it is now, but if we think of Mount Isa as the Prime Minister described it, which I believe is right, as one of the really great metal deposits of the world, then we should be seeking now to have the direct line. This involves a small bridge over the headwaters of the Leichhardt RiverI know that terrain-bu t it does not seem to me that there is any very great physical obstacle. So much for the question of the route. Now let me come to the question of the terminal, which several honourable members have mentioned. It has been suggested, for instance, that the line could be carried through to Camooweal, with the idea of extending it further at some later date. Let me compromise here and make this suggestion: As honourable members who have been in the area know, there is a further deposit at what I think is called the 12-mile, just out from Mount Isa along the road to Camooweal. The line will have to be extended as far as this point in the near future anyway. I suggest very seriously to the Government that we should be thinking of extending the line at least a few miles past Mount Isa in the direction of the new mine. That extension of the line can never be wasted. We should locate on it a proper cattle transfer point with resting paddocks and water and other facilities. As far as I know, there is not in Australia at present a properly designed cattle transfer point. I have not been to Mount Isa for a couple of years. to Marree. When I was at Mount Isa a couple of years ago, the cattle transfer facilities were right in the middle of the town. They were quite scandalous and were making a mess of the town. They also added tremendous costs to the handling of the beasts which came in sometimes on the hoof and sometimes on the bitumen. As honourable members are well aware, the bitumen stretches west from Mount Isa across the Barkly Tableland to Tennant Creek. We should be using that bitumen. It has been said, and I think said rightly, that we might go a little further and extend the railway into what is known as the soft country, where the more recent sediments overlie the hard rocks. Cattlemen find that the hard rocks around Mount Isa, which are very steeply tilted and very sharp, tend to bruise the hoofs of beasts that are not accustomed to that kind of country. Even droving over a short stretch of this hard country may be very difficult for cattle that have been brought up on the softer plains, on the limestone country and on the more recent sediments. There is perhaps a reason to go even a few miles past the 12-mile to establish the cattle transfer point. This is a practical question. I do not pretend to know the details of it, but I think it is worth real and serious consideration. So much for the terminal. Finally, I want to say something about the running of the line. In the past, many of the difficulties of transport to Mount Isa have been due not merely to the inefficient railway line, although some were inevitably due to this cause, but also to the inefficient way in which the railway was run. We had mixed trains instead of whole trains, and the concentrates trains were mixed up with goods trains. I know that in the past two or three years under the new administration this situation has been very much improved. I know that the line is now being operated in a very much more economical way than it has ever been operated before. However, if we are to have the full benefits of a railway system, it must be not only good in itself with good rolling-stock and locomotives' but it must also be operated in a sensible way. This means a plan must be arrived at between the railway authorities and those who use the railway, whether they be the mine or the owners of live-stock. There are many other points on which I would have liked to have touched to-night. I would have liked to have mentioned the possible development around Lawn Hill and of the Constance Range iron deposits. I would have liked to have mentioned the possible establishment of a major port in",84,Railway Agreement

226,Mr Wentworth,"Yes, I have beenthe Gulf. However, I think these are not matters proper to be brought forward at this late hour and I hope, if the electors are we now have before us a proposition relatkind enough to return me to the Parliament at the forthcoming election, I will be able to touch on these matters at some later stage. other Opposition members, I support the bill. However, I cannot refrain from uttering what I consider is relevant criticism. In the early stages of the proposal to build a railway from Collinsville through Townsville to Mount Isa, the Commonwealth Governnient, at the request of the Queensland Government, I understand, suggested that the necessary finance should be raised through the International Bank. At that time, I found it very difficult to discover an adequate reason for this. Practically the whole of the labour requirements, the material requirements, the engineering skill and the equipment for the construction of the line would be of Australian origin. I could not understand in this situation why it was necessary to approach the International Bank to borrow dollar currency to pay for this work. I could well understand why dollars, sterling or other foreign currency should be borrowed for capital work which involved the import of vast generators, vast quantities of rails and vast numbers of people from foreign countries for the labour force, but I could not understand why, for a comparatively simple engineering project, this country should plunge itself into debt to overseas interests. reasons. It appeared to me that if we borrowed the equivalent of £20,000,000 Australian, which would mean a credit with fhe Commonwealth Bank or other banking organizations of 40.000,000 American dollars, in round figures, importers of dollar goods could draw upon these funds for the import of unessential and unnecessary products. I refer to minx coats and luxuries of that kind. But the International Bank was awake to the attitude of the Menzies Government, and, Incorporated, a corporation of the State of New in its wisdomI think it was wisdom-it Jersey in the United Slates of America. rejected the application of the Menzies Government to finance this project with State governments have been building foreign currency obtained by way of loan from the International Bank. As a result, ing to an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State of Queensland under which the Commonwealth of Australia agrees to make available to the Government of Queensland the sum of £20,000,000 Australian for the rebuilding of 600 miles of railway line from Collinsville, via Townsville, to Mount Isa. Why was not that proposition put up in the first instance? Is not Australian currency adequate and suitable to pay for all the labour, all the steel rails from the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, all the engineering equipment required, and all the other components involved in the carrying out of this great engineering project? The end result of all this manoeuvring is that this Government stands condemned for endeavouring to borrow foreign currency and to plunge us into debt overseas, for it is quite obvious that it is now found possible to finance this project from our own monetary resources. In offering my second criticism of the proposal, I agree with the views expressed by the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wcniworth). I do agree with him sometimes. Why in the name of all that is common sense, should this railway be built of a narrower gauge than 4 ft. 8J; in.? In the initial stages of any railway project, it is infinitely easier, according to all accepted up-to-date railway construction practices in Australia, to build a 4-ft. 81-in. gauge line than it is to construct a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line. I repeat that I agree with the honourable member for Mackellar in his I sought to learn the criticism of the proposal on that score. The next criticism I have to offer is that I find on perusing the Schedule to the bill that the Commonwealth proposes to enter into an agreement with the State of Queensland under which the State commits itself to engage and pay a foreign engineering company for designing and supervising the carrying out of the project. 1 point out to honourable members that the Schedule provides that"" lhe engineers"" means Ford, Bacon& Davis, Mr Speaker, for over 100 years the",86,Railway Agreement
227,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [11.27],"Lik erailways all over Australia, through diffiof Queensland. Have we ever had any cult country, through tunnels in mountains, over mountains and over plains, and the engineers who were responsible for designing and supervising the construction of those lines were all Australians. Now, at this stage of our development, Australia is committed to the payment of foreign currency-dollars-to a foreign engineering company, and this at a time when Australia is in difficulty with her balance of payments! After all, the reconstruction of 600 miles of railway line from Townsville to Mount Isa is a comparatively easy engineering task; yet this agreement commits us to engaging and paying a foreign engineering company to carry out the work. Let me emphasize that I make no reflection on the engineering company concerned. I am merely criticizing the Government for the fact that it is committing Australia to the payment of dollars for work which could be done by Australian engineers. I emphasize that we are committed to paying dollars to a foreign engineering firm for the comparatively easy engineering task of reconstructing this line over sandy plains, over hills and over country which I have been told has a particularly spewy component in that it contracts, expands and does all sorts of peculiar things. Will anystupid question! The simple answer is that body in this Parliament tell me that all the difficulties associated with these soil peculiarities have not bem competently overcome by Australian engineers in the past? Are we forever to sell completely to foreign people the inherent human rights and privileges of Australians because of the incompetence of a tory government in Queensland and a tory government in the Commonwealth sphere? Will anybody tell me that such great works as the Murrumbidgee Dam, the Hume Weir and Eildon Weir are any the worse because they were designed and constructed by Australian engineers employed by the various State departments in Australia? Why must we resort to the importation of enginthe terms of that agreement. Honourable eers from overseas? Why must we commit ourselves to the dissipation of the earnings of the people of Australia in this way? Nowhere in this bill may be found details indeed to the people of Australia who, of the agreement entered into between through this Government, are backing this Ford, Bacon and Davis, Incorporated, a project, there must be something fishy about corporation of the State of New Jersey, in it. Let me suggest in all seriousness that the United States of America, and the State if the agreement is made available we shall great dam disaster in Australia? Has there ever been any serious mishap associated with the construction of any great engineering work in Australia? Have we ever had in Australia any major disaster due to the failure of the railway lines constructed under the supervision of Australian engineers? The history of railway disasters in the United States of America on lines the construction of which was supervised by engineers who have no experience of railway construction in Australia does not convince us that our engineers are in any way inferior to American engineers. Here we bave had no great railway disasters. Yet this Parliament is asked to agree to the payment of foreign currency to foreign engineers for the carrying out of a project which decent, competent Australian engineers could carry out at least as efficiently, if not more efficiently. I repeat, there is no word in the agreement of the basis upon which payment is to be made to Ford, Bacon and Davis Incorporated. land Railways have nothing to learn? the Menzies Government asking such a no human being and no public instrumentality has not something to learn. I say to the honourable member that no engineers anywhere in the world have a prouder record of success than Australian engineers, and I mention the Sydney Harbour Bridge as an example of the great work they have done. Let me return to the pertinent point. This House has been refused access to the terms of the agreement entered into between Ford, Bacon and Davis Incorporated of America and the State of Queensland. IfI know anything about the matter, I would say that a public scandal is involved in members on the Government side may laugh, but I challenge them on that point. If the terms of the agreement are not available to the people of Queensland and",87,Railway Agreement
228,Mr Bury,D o you think the Queens,88,Railway Agreement
229,Mr Pollard,"Fancy a supporter offind that it provides for a lump sum payment of some hundreds of thousands of pounds and in addition the payment of a percentage of the total cost of the works, which means that the more the project costs the more these people will get. Yet this Parliament will blindly endorse this rotten agreement. Honourable members opposite laugh, but I know that this sort of thing operated in Victoria 30 years ago, when I exposed it. The circumstances were that the Country Roads Board took over the construction of roads from country municipalities, and the local shire engineers, without doing anything towards the work, received a percentage payment on the capital cost of thc work within the municipalities and sucked the State and the municipalities dry. Subject to the revealing of the terms and conditions of the contract, it is my opinion that a similar state of affairs is in al) probaHouse that the matter has been considered bility involved in this contract. So it is in the interests of Ford, Bacon and Davis Incorporated, to make the job as expensive as it can possibly be made. Until such time as this Government and the Queensland Government have the guts to reveal the terms of the contract, my charge stands good. I indict this Government for its failure the year, most of the cattle wagons in to appreciate its own engineers, who stand Queensland are used on the Mount Isa dominant and paramount in the history of line. That means that if there were a 100 years of railway construction The standard-gauge line from Mount Isa to soundness of their designs, and the safety Townsville, with a narrow-gauge line reof the railways they have built, give them tained from Townsville to Brisbane, somea record second to none in the world.

The Labour Opposition supports the bill Mount Isa. because it believes that the railway is necessary to tap the mineral weallh of .Queensland and to bring the cattle wealth further we would carry the standard-gauge to the ports, but we severely criticize the line, because it would be necessary to get terms of the agreement and wicked features coal back to Mount Isa after bringing from associated with thc re-building of this line Mount Isa metals, cattle or whatever the and, in particular, the initial proposals that case may be. At any rate, the fact is that this Governnient made for financing the it was decided to build a narrow-gauge line. It is clear that at first we were to line. I am indebted to the honourable borrow dollars. Now we find that from member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) our own financial resources, our own labour, for saying that that was decided by the our own steel mills, our own machinery manufacturers, we can provide everything that is necessary and that we do not any longer need to borrow from overseas money to reconstruct this railway. I offer that criticism. I support to the full the criticism by the honourable member for Mackellar that at this stage of Australian railway development it is a scandal that we should adopt a proposal to strengthen an existing 3-ft. 6-in. gauge railway instead of providing a railway of the standard gauge of 4 ft. Si in. In this debate members of the Opposition have tried to tear a passion to tatters, whilst at the same time supporting the bill. Let us consider for a moment what the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) has said regarding a standard-gauge railway. It has already been stated in this and that the investigating engineers advised against a 4-ft. 84-in. gauge line. Let me mention one other matter to honourable members. We have about 900 miles of 3-ft. 6-in. railway from Brisbane to Townsville. If a standard-gauge line were built, we would have 600 miles of it from Townsville to Mount Isa. At certain times of large bill for extra cattle wagons on the standard-gauge line from Townsville to Then, we would have to decide how much",88,Railway Agreement

So the committee that investigated the matter for this Parliament has on its side the engineers who also investigated the matter. Claims were made by various honourable members of the Opposition that discrimination was being shown against Queensland. There were expressions of regret by one honourable member that the terms of the deal for this line were not the same as those of the Snowy Mountains scheme. I am not too sure what the honourable member meant by the terms of the Snowy scheme. Briefly, the Snowy scheme arranges that as units come into operation they are financed from the sales of electrical energy. Then, over a period of 70 years, the electrical energy that is sold repays the cost, plus interest. I do not know how provision could be made for a loan for this railway line on the same terms. I take it that the honourable member meant that the loan would be for a period of 70 years. Other suggestions have been made to the tax paid to-day by Victorians, for example, effect that not enough is being done for is about £10 a head more than that paid Queensland. As a Queenslander, I believe by Queenslanders, and the financial assisthat we should receive every possible astance grants made by the Commonwealth sistance financially for the development of to Queensland are more than £4 a head Queensland. But at least it is significant of population higher than the grants to that, according to the recent census, the Victoria. In other words, Queenslanders increase in population in Townsville, Rockto-day are about £14 a head better off than hampton, Toowoomba, Mount Isa and Victorians. Years ago the position was various other towns in Queensland has the reverse because Queenslanders had to been greater than the increase in population pay a great deal more per head in income in any town in the southern States outside tax than Victorians did.

Of course, there has been quite landI propose to ask for a great deal an increase since the present Queensland more in the future if I have an opportunity Government came into power a little over to do so-a t least we are receiving subfour years ago.

It was not of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) said that, entirely the fault of the Labour Government but I point out that whereas there are eight as a Labour government, because it had certain difficulties, but the Labour Government was responsible to the extent that it imposed a much higher company tax than was levied by otber States. And it did charge individuals a great deal more in income tax. The result was that when companies had the choice of setting up business in Queensland or in a southern State, they chose the southern State because company taxation was higher in Queensland. A lot of individual businessmen were also inclined to go south, because they paid less income tax there. Let me point out that since the advent of uniform taxation taxation? comment on the merits or otherwise of uniform taxation, but I think it is only fair to say that under the present Commonwealth Government, Queensland's position is quite different from what it was.

How then can any honourable member say that the position of the Government in Western Australia is weak? Let me point out to those who say that Western Australia has been getting a better deal than Queensland that only a couple of months ago honourable members were sent a series of very well written articles by a Western Australian journalist, to prove that Western Australia was getting a terrible deal. I have heard it said in this House that Tasmania is getting a poor deal compared with the treatment of Queensland. In other words, all you have to do in politics of the fact that the line will make a profit. in order to try to get a following, is to tell the pork butcher in Berlin that the pork butcher in Paris is getting a better deal than he is. That is the policy which has been adopted by certain people in this Parliament and I suggest that it has no national characteristic about it. Let us face the facts: The Queensland Government expressed its pleasure about two years ago at the agreement by the Commonwealth to grant this loan to it. I take this opportunity to say that I agree entirely with the Queensland Government. It has been suggested that this railway line should be continued to Camooweal. Surely if the State Government does not ask for money to continue the line to Camooweal, the Commonwealth has no interest in such a proposal. It has been stated that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) was at fault for not obtaining the railway loan from the International Bank. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition pointed to what he said were various defects in the achievements of the Prime Minister, but he entirely forgot to say that prior to the application to the International Bank for this loan for Queensland, the Prime Minister had obtained loans of several hundreds of millions of pounds from the bank. He was able to obtain that money without stating precisely the objectives for which it was required. In other words, the Prime Minister was able to go to the bank and get several hundred million pounds on the good name of Australia, but of course the Deputy Leader of Opposition did not refer to that at all. We have been criticized because the interest rate on this advance to Queensland is to be 5i per cent., but the Queensland Government was prepared to pay the International Bank6 per cent. Therefore, I do not quite see the force of any argument by the Opposition that Queensland is worse off. Obviously it is better off now than it would have been if the money had been obtained from the bank. Also, it has been stated by the Opposition that the people of Queensland will have to pay for this loan. The implication is that they wili have to dip further into their pockets. No mention is made We have had two conflicting statements from members of the Opposition. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) said, in effect, that the Commonwealth Grants Comniission would provide for the payment of most of the instalments of the loan for the Western Australian railway line, whereas the people of Queensland would have to pay for the Queensland railway. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not agree with the honourable member for Kennedy. He said that all these projects had been investigated and had been proved to be economic propositions. If the Townsville to Mount Isa project is an economic proposition how can the honourable member for Kennedy say that the people of Queensland are being unfairly treated? How can he say that Western Australia will ask the Commonwealth Grants Commission to approve a grant to pay its instalments on its railway project when, according to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition the project is an economic proposition and the railway will pay for itself? We know from investigations that when the Mount Isa mine is working, the Mount Isa to Townsville railway line will return a profit of up to £2,000,000 a year. It is, therefore, very easy to see how Queensland will pay back the £20,000,000 that the Commonwealth will lend it. I remind honourable members that, according to the agreement annexed to the bill, repayment is to be made in forty equal half-yearly instalments, the first of which is to be made on 30th June, 1965. So, we have the chance to get going with the construction of this railway line. Interest will be payable immediately and then, from 30th June, 1965, we shall repay the loan over twenty years. As the line is a payable proposition, and as it has been estimated that it will pay for itself within twenty years, I submit that the proposition is a good one. I agree entirely with the Premier of Queensland that the arrangement made with the Commonwealth is satisfactory, and I support the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative.

However, I presume we are not entitled to discuss that matter, because I understand it is the subject of a court case at the present time. However, I suggest that the Government should consider inserting an amendment in this bill when it is before another place to provide that the road bed, culverts and bridges shall be so constructed as to provide for easy conversion of the line to standard gauge at a later date. I suggest it would be not only a good thing but also a proper thing for the Commonwealth Government cost of constructing the line on this basis, 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, which I think will be a I support the remarks of the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent providing the same assistance to railway construction has been that the railway contemplated under this legislation is of narrow gauge, while the railways in the other States were either being built to standard gauge or had been built to a broad gauge with an undertaking by the State concerned to reduce that broad gauge 1 would like to ask the Treasurer ( Mr",90,Railway Agreement

A week ago the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) recalled the question asked by the honourable member and repeated the request. Apparently it is not possible, because of some technicality, for honourable members who are voting the expenditure of this money to see the report on which it is based. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) told us last Thursday, a week ago, that the Commonwealth would suggest to the Queensland Government that it should make the report available. However, we are not allowed to see it. Apparently we have arrived at a dead end in that direction. I then come to paragraph 16 of the in another place; a fifth clause to provide agreement, which reads(I.)

The suggestions are well intentioned and are made by people whojiave studied not only this railway but also the problems of standardizing railway gauges throughout Australia generally. The Government has previously asked the House, and it now asks this committee, to adopt the agreement already reached between the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government, and I hope that we shall proceed to do that without further delay. No doubt, what has been said in this discussion will be studied by both the Commonwealth Government and its technical advisers and the State Government and its technical advisers. If what has been said stimulates further thinking on matters that have not already been fully considered, the discussion will have served a useful and valuable purpose.

Security-Politica l Parties-Immigration Newspaper Report-Television . Supply) [12.20 a.m.] I move That the House do now adjourn. To-night, I want to make a few comments in relation to a debate which took place in the House last night, in order to clarify the position of the Department of Supply in regard to the matter dealt with in that debate. As a preamble to the comments which I shall make I want to read some extracts from, first, the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act 1947, and also some extracts from the second-reading speech made by Dr. Evatt, who was the Minister who introduced that measure, in 1947. Section3 of the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act, giving the definition of approved defence projects, states"" approved defence project"" means any work or undertaking for the testing of long range weapons which is approved by the Minister of State for Defence by notice in the Gazette as an immediate defence project and includes any other work or undertaking, being carried out or to be carried out either within or outside Australia for the defence of Australia or any Territory of the Commonwealth, which is so approved as an immediate defence project; Section4 provides as follows:(1.) Any person who(a) without reasonable cause or excuse(i) by boycott or threat of boycott of any person, property, work or undertaking prevents, hinders or exercised in visits made to the Woomera obstructs, or endeavours to prerocket range by persons not directly vent, hinder or obstruct, the carrying out of an approved defence project; (ii; publishes any declaration of a boycott or threat of a boycott by means of which the carrying out of an approved defence project is prevented, hindered or obstructed or is sought to be prevented, hindered or obstructed; or (iiij fry speech or writing, advocates of encourages the prevention, hindrance or obstruction of the carrying out of an approved defence project; shall be guilty of an offence. When that measure was introduced by Dr. Evatt in 1947 he made, I believe, some pertinent comment in relation to the bill and its provisions. He commenced his speech by sayingThis is a bill to provide for the protection of approved defence projects. Its object is to prevent sabotage, or attempted sabotage, of approved defence undertakings. Honourable members will recall that, recently, the House discussed a motion relating to espionage risks in connection with the guided weapons testing range in Central Australia. During that discussion it was shown that representatives or members of the Communist party had published certain propaganda which indicated that the primary objection to the tests was that it would endanger Australian aborigines, although the real object of that party was the prevention of the project itself. I showed to honourable members extracts from a pamphlet and from newspapers circulated in Australia which proved that point beyond doubt. He concluded his speech by sayingI commend the bill to the favorable consideration of the House and submit that, as a Parliament, we must register our conviction that when a defence project is fully embarked upon by the Government we cannot permit the boycott to be used as a political weapon to stop its progress. There is a great distinction be'tween a strike and a boycott. A strike is an action by workers to improve their industrial conditions; a boycott of the character contemplated by this bill constitutes a misuse of industrial power, not for the purpose of improving the conditions of workers but for a political or international purpose contrary to the defence policy of the Government and the Parliament. Such a boycott cannot be tolerated and accordingly I ask the House to agree to the passage of this bill. With those extracts as a background, and realizing that the condition referred to in Dr. Evatt's second-reading speech applied in 1948, considerable care was",94,Order Of The Day

242,Mr Hul Me (Petrie,"Minister forconcerned in the construction. At that time security within the range area had not been developed to a high degree of efficiency, and when a request was received for approval for a large number of trade unionists to visit the area the Government sought security advice. The security advice was that seven of the persons nominated were approved and five, including Mr Cavanagh. were not approved. There is no doubt whatsoever that the Minister of the day, in fact an acting Minister, the present honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan), acted in accordance with security advice and in conformity with the principle enunciated in the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act 1947. Other applications were also not approved for certain trade unionists to visit the area in the speech just delivered. Of course, a in subsequent years. But when a request was received at the end of 1959 from the Trades and Labour Council for thirteen trade unionists, representing ill building and allied trades, to go to Woomera and it was clear that the visit was on serious union business, approval was given for the visit of this party, including not only Mr Cavanagh but at least one other person who had been rejected previously. It will be noted that the Leader of the Opposition last night said that a visit was made in 1958 to Woomera by Mr 1959. So we ask the Treasurer either to Cavanagh and that the then Minister for Supply, who is now the Minister for Defence, "" chose Mr Cavanagh to go to to Woomera in 1958 because he was not a security risk."" I direct attention to the word ""chose"" because the Minister did not in fact choose Mr Cavanagh to go. He acceded to a request from the Trades and Labour Council for thirteen people representing various trade unions to be allowed to go to Woomera. It was not the Minister for Defence who was the Minister at the time. This happened during my own period as Minister for Supply. mistake. There was no mistake about it. Cavanagh is a Communist or a fellow 1 point out to the House that by 1959, and traveller, or to apologize, inside the House, indeed considerably earlier, security at for having said it in the House. Woomera bad been developed to an extremely efficient level, and that the gration which involve considerable harddangers associated with a visit in 1948or even into the early 1950's-were not present. A different set of circumstances applied in 1959 and approval was given in November, 1959, for all the party of thirteen trade unionists to go to Woomera, because it was known that they would not have the opportunity of seeing or discussing anything that was not related to their union business. 1 make this explanation to show that, from thc point of view of the Department of Supply, the position and attitudes which were adopted were in conformity with the situations applying at the particular times. The Opposition is quite satisfied to accept the explanation, with the implied apology, couple of nights ago the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt), made accusations, which were reported in the press, that the Australian Labour Party had endorsed as candidates for the Senate election, men who were Communists or fellow travellers. He based that statement mainly upon the statement that one of those men had been refused permission to go to Woomera iu 1948. Now we have been told that that man was permitted to go to Woomera in 1959-that he was not a security risk in repeat his statements outside the House, or to apologize for them inside thc House. I think that that matter has been effectively disposed of by the proof provided by the Minister for Supply( Mr Hulme) that the Labour Party candidate for the Senate in South Australia was approved of as a person suitable to visit a defence project in 1959. If he was satisfactorily approved of by the security service io visit a defence project in 1959, surely he is satisfactorily even to Liberals to be approved of by the Labour Party to stand on a Senate ticket in 1961.

245,Mr Cairns (Yarra) [12.28 A.m.],"migrants. These matters will be put right by a Labour government next year, but I want to refer to them now because they concern the administration of four departments over the next month or two. Great relief would be given to migrants if they were taken into account in that time. We know that because of unemployment, the composition of Australian immigration has been changed away from the assisted variety, based on a man's ability to work or on his skill or physical strength, towards a family basis. That is good. I think that family migration must be the basis of migration to Australia. Family migration is social migration. The other kind is economic. It distorts and unbalances. If produces problems of emr'oyment and social problems of a serious nature. It gives rise to a disproportion of the sexes and so on. I think that this decision has been made in an unplanned and irrational way. It is not clear really whether the Government intends deliberately to plan and encourage family migration or whether that is something that has been done alone because of the present high level of unemployment and without any real affection for family migration. In my own files, I have many cases-fa r too many to extract for attention here-of persons who have been nominated to come to Australia by members of their families in Australia. 1 ask the Minister for Immigration ( Mr engaged by Bodycraft Proprietary Limited Downer) to do what he can to expedite decisions on outstanding cases so that families of migrants can be reunited in Australia before Christmas. The present situation is causing uncertainty and worry for a great many people. That is the first point that I wish to make, I request that the department expedite the migration of members of families before Christmas. My second point concerns social services. We know that migrants are not entitled to age and invalid pensions unless they have been resident in Australia for twenty years and have other qualifications. This discriminates against migrants. It excludes almost 100 per cent, of the migrant applicants for pensions, but excludes nobody born in this country. Therefore, migrants are not treated equally with other people in relation to age and invalid pensions. We know that when these applications are made and are refused because of a lack of residential qualifications, the applicants are sometimes given special benefits. I emphasize that, because of the high level of unemployment, there is a great deal of distress in migrant families when working children have to support their families. I believe that the Department of Social Services should be more liberal in granting these applications. I have a number of cases on my own files in which there has been a delay of three months while investigations have taken place. Eventually, the requests may be granted, but I suggest that they be dealt with more quickly, and that' the department must be more generous about them. My third and most important point concerns the issue of tradesmen's certificates. Many migrants are brought to Australia on the understanding that they will be able to practise their trades or professions on the basis of their experience and qualifications at home. When they come here, they are refused a test in some cases, or, when they are given a test, they are failed despite their qualifications. To illustrate how this works I shall cite three cases briefly. The first is that of Mr A. Carleni, of West Geelong. He was selected as one of the first ten Italians to go to Rhodesia, as a welder. He had that special level of qualification. He came to Australia and was of Geelong as afirst-classwelder. There is no doubt of his ability to work as a welder but he was refused in Australia a certificate in November, 1957, and again in May, 1959. I cannot understand why this man is not considered to possess the qualifications necessary to satisfy the local electrical trades committee set up by the Department of Labour and National Service. The second case is that of Mr V. Melani, of Essendon. He was selected in Italy as an electrical fitter. He is a splendid electrician but was refused a certificate on 26th July, 1961, although he has been able to perform the task of a tradesman electrician. The last case is that of Mr A. Fasciona, of Werribee. There has been no objection to these men on the part of the unions; it is purely an objection of the committee. This man was selected as an electrical welder. He has a certificate of proficiency, which I have here, issued in a part of Italy-Turin-wher e the level of skill is as high as it is in any other part of the world. He came to Australia with that certificate, quite confident that he would be able to practise here, but he was refused a tradesman's certificate on 13th October without being given a test. In this case and in many others what happens is completely unfair to the migrants concerned. They have been given the impression by our immigration authorities on the other side of the world that when they come to Australia they will be able to practise in their trades and professions, but when they come here, they find that, despite their qualifications, they are not issued with a tradesman's certificate. tion whatever in these cases by the unions. My last point is in relation to enrolments. I found recently that only 523 Italians were on the electoral roll in my electorate, but we able gentlemen on this side of the House an have reason to believe that there are over 1,500 who are naturalized and are eligible to go on the roll. This was discovered in a survey. As a result of this discovery, I made inquiries from those who came to my office last Saturday and the previous Saturday. On Hth October, of five who were questioned and who were naturalized, only one was enrolled. The following Saturday out of five who were naturalized, only two were enrolled. When I asked why they were not enrolled, they said they did not know how to enrol. A closer examination Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) said that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) had disposed of the case of Mr Cavanagh and of any argument about hisfitnessto be a candidate for the Senate. He might be fit to be a Labour candidate for the Senate, but that does not dispose of the question, and I beg leave to differ from the honourable member for Yarra. I enter this debate because I feel personally most incensed that my colleagues, particularly the Treasurer ( Mr Chair. If he does r.ot withdraw his remark, Harold Holt) have been accused of character assassination because they, have had the temerity to question the bona fides of some of the people whom the Australian Labour Party has chosen to be candidates for the Senate in the forthcoming elections. I ask you, Mr Speaker: Since when have we not been entitled in this House to question the bona fides of candidates for political honours? Since when has it been character assassination, smearing or McCarthyism to bring out the qualifications, or lack of qualifications, of people nominated for political office? Since when has the ALP. been granted a divine right to immunity from criticism of the candidates it has chosen by its extraordinarily devious procedures? This woi/fcl appear to be the claim on which the lonorable gentleman rested his attack on tBe Treasurer last night. What are the facts, for instance, in the case of Mr Cavanagh? What is it which makes him in the opinion of many honorunsuitable person to sit in this Parliament? What is it that makes the Leader of the Opposition so sensitive about him that he. feels it necessary to impugn the Treasurer's motives in raising the matter? I do not know whe'.her Mr Cavanagh is a Communist-it is not my intention to canvass that question. But there are other factors that make a person unsuitable for membership of this Parliament other than membership of the Communist Party. Let us take Mr Cavanagh's industrial record. Much has been said about the fact that he was prevented by the Chifley Government from visiting the Woomera Rocket Rar.ge, because he was regarded as a security risk, as he was. The honourable member for Darebin( Mr Courtnay), who is now interjecting, was with him and was also excluded. member will withdraw that remark. I was a security risk.

I warn theMr Harold Holt -May I just say, Mr 1949, Mr Cavanagh and his union were Speaker, that there seems to be a misunderstanding by the honourable member as to what was actually said. 1 think he should at least know what was said. The honourable member for Barker said that the honourable member for Darebin was also one of those excluded at the time. That is a fact and I do not think the honourable gentleman will deny it. 1 did not understand the honourable member for Barker to say that the honourable member for Darebin was a security risk. He made the statement that the honourable member for Darebin was excluded. ber member must not debate the matter. Chifley Government regard this threat to withdraw labour from the range that it, in turn, threatened him with the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act if he did so. In 1941, Mr Cavanagh went further. He led a strike of workers associated with the construction of the air bombing school at Port Pirie, at a time when it was vitally important for the war effort that the work be completed quickly. These are not figments of my imagination; they are facts. I will leave honourable members to draw their own conclusions as to the motives which led Mr Cavanagh on at least two occasions to sabotage, actually or potentially, our defence preparations. I will content myself with the most charitable interpretation-that he was so imbued with a tradition of industrial militancy that he put industrial action before the defence of his own country. Let us assume that this is what happened. Is this the sort of man we want in the Senate, and not only in the Senate but, with his other left wing colleagues from the other States, probably holding thc balance of power in that chamber? If he is standing for election, the least that can be done is to make it clear to his fellow Australians in these dangerous and difficult times the priorities he believes inindustrial action at the expense of the defence of his country. Let me refer to another fact. Again this is not a figment of my imagination. In involved in a court case, which is entitled "" Murphy v. The Plasterers' Society "", contained in the South Australian State Law Reports for 1949. In this case, twelve members of the Plasterers' Society brought an action for libel against the union and Mr Cavanagh, in circumstances which involved the grossest victimization when they refused to strike. In finding against the union and Cavanagh, whom he found almost completely responsible for the union's action, Mr Justice Abbott in his judgment had this to sayApart from the illegality of his conduct, his personal dishonesty was made obvious by the fraudulent suggestion he made to the Conciliation Commissioner. He regards the pressing of union demands de'pite the Arbitration Court as a "" species of warfare"" in which "" any form of tactics is permissible, lawful or unlawful"" and brazenly confessed that he had falsely denied to Murphy that he had distributed leaflets, adding, "" I don't stick at telling lies for the purpose of implementing my campaign "". AgainI will leave it to honourable members to draw conclusions as to the character of the tactics used by Mr Cavanagh in this instance. 1 will content myself with asking whether a man who has been described by a judge as personally dishonest and of having indulged in fraudulent conduct, and who himself admits that he is willing lo achieve his ends by any means, lawful or unlawful, is fit to sit as a member of this Parliament. This is the man, Sir, who was described by the Leader of the Opposition last night as a good Australian and one he was proud to have in the Labour team at the election. May I cloie by suggesting that the honourable gentleman's fellow Australians may take a very different view of what constitutes a good Australian. I just want to tell the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) that character assassination is the oldest political trick in the world. Practised in this place, where honourable members enjoy some immunity, it is the lowest form of a political trick. I want to refer to a matter which is a little more elevating than the matter discussed by the honourable member for Barker.

258,Mr Mcivor (Gellibrand) [12.48 A.m.].,"and examined by the Public Works Committee, the report of which was brought down in this House to-day by the chairman of the committee. Some parts of the newspaper report are substantially correct; other parts of it are substantially wrong. It has been suggested that the report emanated from me. I want to say here and now that I did not give the report to the newspaper. I have been forced to say this to-night because a member of another place alleged, if I may put it in my words, that I leaked this report to the press. To be brief, the member of another place was careless in handling the truth. The Public Works Committee made full investigation of certain aspects of a project were desired for the purpose of segregating for the Department of the Navy known as HMAS. ""Kuttabul"", which is to be built in Sydney. After these investigations, I and other members of the committee were convinced that the conditions under which men were forced to work-that is, to live on the ships in the concrete docks while they were being refitted-were not desirable and should not be countenanced by any parliament or any country. Admitting that these conditions do exist could only lead to the conclusion that there was a need for better living and administrative accommodation. I was quite prepared to accept the case put up for the building, but 1 had some doubt about the wisdom of acquiring an avenue called Collins-avenue at a cost of £25,000. I felt that an agreement or a lease would be better than acquisition, but I did not raise any objection to the project on those grounds. There were three grounds upon which I raised objection, two of them relatively minor and one rather important. My main objection was based on the provision of two lifts for 78 people. It was admitted in evidence by an officer of the Department of the Navy that the two lifts were included for the express purpose of segregation. Mr Speaker, I do not like that word. I felt that the Public Works Committee could not properly base a recommendation on that ground. I felt also that the provision of two lifts for 78 people was a gross should not be reduced. waste of public money. I may say these things publicly now; I said them while sitting on the committee. Another officer of the Department of the Navy stated in evidence that it would be hard to establish a case against the common use of a grouped set of lifts. Apparently this matter has been discussed in certain places and I have been accused of being the cause of holding up this project. I make no apologies for the action I have taken. A perusal of the committee's report will disclose that I was the only member of the committee to vote against it. I take no objection to the attitude of my colleagues on the committee to this matter. It is their prerogative to express their opinions and to vote accordingly, just as it is mine. In view of the admission by the Department of the Navy that two lifts junior officers from the senior officers, I could not agree to the proposal. I was strengthened in -ny objection by the fact that ample provision was made in the building for the segregation of the housing of personnel. For instance, there were to be 66 junior ratings on one floor whereas on another floor there were to be only 26 senior ratings, and it was admitted in evidence that two lifts were more than sufficient to cater for 78 people. It was also stated in evidence that if the two lifts were taken out of the plan the cost of the project would be increased by £5,500. Frankly, I could not see how that would be. I have no time for people who say these things cannot be done. I feel that another plan could have been drawn up to include a group of lifts adequate to serve the population of the building. There is even some conflict in the report. For instance, paragraph 76 readsDuring discussion on this aspect of this proposal that is, the liftsit became evident that the majority of the members on the Committee felt that a good case had been made against grouping the lifts. They held the view that because the overall lift provision left little margin for contingencies and was not designed to cater for a large increase in the population of the building, as might occur in time of war, and so that continuous lift service to the basements and senior ratings wing could be assured, the provision of two lifts for that wing Paragraph 77 readsThe case made against the grouped four-lift installation was not acceptable to all members of the Committee. The feeling persisted that there should be a way ot re-designing the toilei and lift areas which would achieve a saving in cost; also concern was expressed that there was an admitted over-provision of lifts in the senior ratings wing. We took a vote on the matter and I was the only one who voted against the lift proposal. It has been suggested that two lifts are communism in connection with anybody in necessary because one might break down. this House. If the statement can be supI point out to honourable members that ported and verified-and I can assure when this project was first placed before honourable members that my statements will the committee the senior ratings wing was be well documented-the n it is a matter completely isolated from the junior ratings of the very highest political importance in wing. The committee recommended that relation to any member of this House or external balconies be constructed to give any member of the British Parliament or access to the two wings, and that was a any member of any parliament of the free very wise recommendation. But what world. The most important thing is where would be the position if the two lifts in the member stands on this vital issue of question broke down? Would there be Communists. Is he for it, or is he against the same segregation, or would provision it?

260,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [12.58 And When The Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt),"I think the honourable member knows a fair bit about Mr Cavanagh because he has crossed Mr Cavanagh's path, not once but on several occasions. I want to say something about those occasions to the House. On 19th January, 1950-ther e is a public press report of this-in the W.E.A. munist background which made it imperaHall at Adelaide a meeting was held to form a branch of the Peace Council at which Mr Cavanagh was present. At that time Mr Cavanagh boasted that he had been, sometime before 1939, secretary of the League against War and Fascism. That was a Communist front. But what is more important, in those days the man who is at present Leader of the Opposition fought against the Ieajue as a Communist front, as he knows very well. I do not know whether Mr Cavanagh was the Australian or South Australian secretary, I have only his own statement that was published. I think the Leader of the Opposition will perhaps remember something about this. If he does not remember, let me now remind him. Let me come to another point where their paths crossed. This occasion was just before the 1949 election when the coal strike was in progress. At that time the then Labour Government very properly took the view that the coal strike was a Communist conspiracy. It said so. It believed that to be the case and it was right; but Mr Cavanagh in Adelaide was leading the van of the people who were trying to uphold the miners against the Government and uphold the Communist case against the Government. On 24th July-agai n I refer to published materialMr Cavanagh was chairman of a meeting which was held in the Botanic Park. He was cited before the Trades and Labour Council in regard to that matter. It is true he got off, but only by a small majority after referring the case to the executive, which was perhaps a little bit frightened to deal with this particular big fish. On 10th August of that same yearagain I refer to the public press-h e was bringing into his plasterers' union meetings advocates from the miners to put the Communist case. 1 am glad to read that his union turned him down. It would not hear the people he was trying to bring forward. The union sided with the Labour government and not with the Communist side. The rocket range incident has been mentioned to-night and on a previous occasion. It was a serious incident and the present honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) very properly, in a published statement, directed attention to the Comtive to keep certain people away from that range which, I think, was a much more important defence project then than it is to-day. I think that the then Labour government acted correctly in doing what it did. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) referred a few moments ago to Mr Cavanagh's participation in the strike at Port Pirie against the construction of the air bombing school. I do not know very much about that. I have only the record that it was settled on 25th July. As honourable members know that was a few weeks after the Communists were attacked by Hitler and dragged into the war. Before that time, as honourable members know, there was an alliance between the Nazis and the Communists; and the Communists in Australia, in accordance with their prime duty to world Communism, were endeavouring to sabotage the war effort. When Hitler turned on his allies all that changed. Communists became supporters of the war effort which previously they had endeavoured to sabotage. As I have said this strike appears to have been settled on 25th July, but I must confess I know very little about the background of this affair. Perhaps the truth will out in due course. [Extension of time granted.] I thank the House for its courtesy. The honourable member for Barker has referred to Mr Cavanagh's loss of a libel case in 1949. It has not been mentioned, perhaps, that his counsel in that case was a certain Mr Elliott Johnston, a very well-know Communist, and the whole pattern of the case was in accordance with the communist pattern of industrial action at that time. That pattern was again exemplified, as the honourable memher for Barker has mentioned, in the rocket range episode. From then on we had various peace efforts, so to speak, and I now wish to read from the report of a meeting which took place in Adelaide on 19th January, 1950. The report is as followsOn 19th January about 30 persons, including a number ot well-known Comrades, met at the W.E.A. Hall to form a branch of the ""Australian Peace Council "". Other speakers included Comrade J. Cavanagh of the Plasterers' Union, who referred to matters so intimately bound up with world peace as the refusal of the Commonweallh Security Service to let him visit Woomera Rocket Range, the Safety Prevention Act of South Australia, the Victorian Essential Services Act and hie Commonwealth Crimes Act. He also claimed he had served peace before 1939 as secretary of the League Against War and Facsism. The report continues, and I hope to place Cavanagh was elected as one of the officers of the organization together with Mr which I have spoken in a debate on the Convery-on e of his fellow excludees from Woomeraa Mrs. Watt, wife of the local secretary of the Communist Party in South Australia, Mr Mattinson, whom I do not know, and a Mr Hodge who is connected with the organization. Mr Cavanagh has received over the years a great deal of praise from the Communists for what he has been doing on what is known euphemistically as a peace front but actually is a Communist auxiliary, so declared even by the ALP. To bring the matter up to date, or nearly up to date, I read from the ""Tribune"" of 30th July, 1958During the last week, as the protest grew against the imperialist aggression in the Middle East, police we have in Adelaide. He takes more in Adelaide roughly handled demonstrators while breaking up a meeting in front of Parliament House, and the homes of two workers were raided in the early hours of the morning . . . People who tried to speak and who had their names taken included . . . Mr J. L. Cavanagh, Secretary of the Plasterers' Union. . . This meeting was called at a time when Russia was exercising her veto in the Security Council to prevent the United Nations from acting in the Middle East. It was a definite Russian plot to embroil the Middle East in war, or at any rate to force Russian interests forward in the Middle East. This is Ihe kind of thing that has been going on. Here we find Mr Cavanagh, as late as 1958, associated with this Communist front, engaged at the very highest level in actions which were against the foreign policy of the free world and in favour of the foreign policy of Soviet Russia. IfI had more time, I would put a lot Labour Party know Jim Cavanagh. They more facts before the House. I think you know all about him and his actions. They will agree, Sir, that I have put very substanknow whether he goes to peace council tial facts before the House already. In the course of the next few weeks, I hope to have an opportunity to say more fully what I would have said here to-night had I had more time in which to do so. It is terribly important that these people who, whether or not they are members of the Communist Party, act as such, should not become members of this Parliament. member's time has expired. [1.13 a.m.] -This is the first occasion on motion for the adjournment of the House. I do not like to keep members up, but to-night I felt it was impossible for me to remain sitting here, listening to the stuff that was being put over, without making a reply. I bave known Mr Cavanagh intimately. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) talks about a period away back in 1938 and 1939 when Mr Cavanagh was the secretary of an organization which he mentioned. I may say that at that time Mr Cavanagh was just as militant as he is now. One of the great objections that a lot of people have to Mr Cavanagh is the way in which he carries on his work as a union secretary. He is the most militant union secretary that employers to court for breaches of awards than does any other union secretary in Adelaide. He is always taking employers to court in order to protect the men who are working in industry. Almost invariably, when he goes to court he is successful in the case that he presents. I would say to the honourable member that this is one of the reasons why Mr Cavanagh is our third candidate in the Senate elections. He was not picked out by a little group. He was not picked out by an executive. He was selected as a candidate on a vote of over 70,000 unionists and members of the Australian Labour Party. He was elected over men whom one would never dream of associating with any great militancy, any peace council, or anything else of that nature. The Labour movement, at a conference, selected him.

Will the honourable member for Mackellar say that because a reverend gentleman belonging to one of our churches, who is looked up to as a fine Christian gentleman, goes to a peace council meeting at which Mr Cavanagh is present, the reverend gentleman is not a fit man to be a leader and teacher in our community? Honourable members opposite are condemning Mr Cavanagh and saying that he is a Communist or a fellow traveller. I speak as one who knows his history very, very well. I knew his father, when Jim Cavanagh was a boy. The father was a militant man of the same sort as Jim Cavanagh. but nobody ever called him a Communist. Nobody called him a fellow traveller. He was a fighter for the workers, afighterfor the men, and Jim Cavanagh has grown up in that way. with it? right the honourable member has to try to stop me when I am giving this man's history. Honourable members opposite are condemning this man. The Minister and everybody else are condemning him because, they say, he is a fellow traveller. Mr Harold Holt -You r government condemned him in 1948. that in 1948, when Cavanagh was not permitted to go to Woomera, other members of trade unions were not permitted to go. The Minister said that there were seven of them. The security organization at the time said, "" It is better for this man not to coming out of prison, have been put into go there. We will not take any risks."" With seven others, he was not permitted to go, but that did not mean that he was a Communist. I ask the Minister and the honourable member for Mackeller: If this was such a terrible man, was he ever convicted in a court for any of these things? are? able boy opposite who is interjecting that answer, whenever a case is established when he has a little of the experience that against their administration as a government I have, he will know better.

The Communists have me in the gun all the time. friend of theirs. in standing up for a man. I shall tell honourable members something which might be good for them. In the coming election campaign I shall go to every workshop meeting and every other meeting that I can attend. 1 shall not be telling the people to vote for Bert Thompson. I shall be telling them to be sure to give their No. 3 vote for the Senate to Cavanagh. Honourable members opposite say that this man is not fit to come here. If we were to judge all candidates on the things that we hear about them, their moral lives, the way they live, we would be condemning a lot of them. But we do not do that. As I have said, this man has been selected by the Labour movement in South Australia on a vote of over 70,000 people. He was the man who got the majority. If honourable members opposite tell me that they know more about that man's qualifications to come into the Parliament and represent the people than do those persons who voted for him, honourable members opposite do not know what they are talking about. I admit that they have a right to say that they do not think so-and-so should come here, but let me invite them to go back through history. I shall not repeat the names of men who have served terms in prison and who, after Parliament, have risen to great heights as parliamentarians of different countries, and have been looked up to very much indeed. If all the people adopted the attitude that honourable members opposite are adopting, the men to whom I have referred would never have reached those positions.

He is one of those gentlemen who always look under the bed for a Communist, and that, of course, is where Roach, the Communist, keeps the Illawarra Cup that the honourable member for Mackellar was kind enough to present to him a few years ago. I do not think the Treasurer ( Mr Lang, when leader of the Labour Party in Harold Holt) will deny this: When he appeared on television on 27th August with the Minister for Labour and National Opposition ( Mr Calwell) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam), he was more or less challenged by the Leader of the Opposition who said, "" Will you fight this election on the Budget?""

These are the people who defame such a great Australian as the late Ben Chifley, and now they are up against our leader, Arthur Calwell, and are making these insidious innuendoes against such people. I can recall what happened in America during the McCarthy era. I quote from the "" New York Times"", a conservative newspaper. It said during the period of McCarthyismOne danger we are learning to our cost is the tempiation to foster witch hunts and to use the fear of communism for partisan purposes and get hysterical and set norms that carry into the field of the meeting. There is nothing you can do of general liberalism and legitimate freedom of discussion of social experiments. That was what happened in America and that is what the Liberal-Country Party Government does before every election. Supporters of the Government always resort to McCarthyism as a means of getting votes. I think the article about Cavanagh which appeared in the "" Daily Telegraph"" last Wednesday week probably prompted this Government to bring the matter up, but I challenge Reid, who wrote that article, to write that the same Cavanagh was sent to Woomera in 1959 with the approval of this Government. I challenge him to do so, but I am willing to bet that he does not. Just to show what sort of newspaper this is I point out that at the general election in 1958 Joske won Balaclava with a majority of 14,000 over Labour and obtained over 60 per cent, of the votes, but, before the by-election in 1960, this newspaper, in an endeavour to conceal the Liberal Party's loss of prestige, said that Mr Whittorn would have a bigger majority, and a better percentage of the votes cast, than Mr Joske obtained. That statement was a deliberate lie on the part of this newspaper, and no one knows better than Reid, who writes for the "" Daily Telegraph"", that it was a deliberate lie. This is the paper that you are told in Sydney you can trust! This is the journal in which the Liberal-Country Party Government places faith. Despite all this McCarthyism and all this smearing you will never kill the Australian Labour Party. You can try and you can laugh, but your attempts will smack back in your face some day. Do not worry about that. There are in this House people who think that if a Labour man has been talking to a Communist he is a Communist. Mention was made last night of people speaking on platforms with Communists. Sometimes on both sides in this political game this is inevitable. You cannot prevent it. Let me quote as an illustration the 1955 election when Jack Kane, now secretary of the Australian Democratic Labour Party, was campaign director for the Australian Labour Party in New South Wales. He wished to send me to Randwick workshops on the day before the election and, before I left, he said: "" They have a Communist, the secretary of the shop stewards, and he will be chairman about it, because it is his job to take the chair for all representatives of political parties who go there to address them."" As a consequence I went out and addressed that meeting which was chaired by a Communist. That was not my fault. It was just one of the things that happen. But had a member of the Liberal Party been passing by at that stage he would have said I was a Communist, because I was speaking from the platform with one. Those meetings are inevitable and particularly in the trade union movement you cannot avoid them. How ridiculous it is when these people opposite try to smear honourable people like the late Mr Chifley and the late John Curtin and all Labour's great men! I crave the indulgence of the House for a moment. Opposition Members -A t this hour! opposite are not used to company which apologizes, but I do apologize for speaking at this late hour. I want to direct attention to what I consider to be a very important matter closely related to the overall development of this country. I refer to the provision of television in country areas and particularly to those areas which the Government is anxious to develop. One of the most formidable obstacles to the development of many areas with a high production potential is tihe social problem-the problem",106,Adjournment
278,Mr Browne (Kalgoorlie) [1.36 A.m.j.,,107,Adjournment
279,Mr Browne,"Honorabl e members of attracting people to those areas and of keeping them there. As each decade passes this problem becomes greater because as time goes on city dwellers get more and more amenities which are denied the people in the country. One would have thought that the advent of television would be regarded by the Postmaster-General's Department as a means of assisting the Government to achieve its objective of decentralization, helping the nation decentralize those activities which are important to it and giving an incentive to people to remain in country areas. I am not going to suggest that television should have been introduced into remote and sparsely populated areas before it was introduced into the metropolitan areas because that would be silly. But I am going to suggest that it is equally silly that the gap between the introduction of television in the cities and in the areas which we are endeavouring to develop should be so wide as to contribute towards the drift to the cities. Unfortunately, the Postmaster-General's Department, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board or whichever short-sighted instrumentality is responsible did not regard the advent of television as being an aid to development. On the contrary, it is retarding to a considerable extent the development of those areas. I and other members of this Parliament have asked the Postmaster General( Mr Davidson) in this House, and his representative in another place, to consider providing television services to country areas by some of the transmitting media which are in use in other parts of the world and particularly in the United States of America. What is required is the beaming of Australian Broadcasting Commission programmes from the capital cities to the various rural centres. It is no use saying that these centres can apply for commercial television licences when they know they cannot support a commercial television station. There is evidence that these programmes can be beamed to these centres at a not unreasonable cost. a piece of equipment known as the Odler translator. This equipment is in wide use in the Uuited States of America, providing television services to viewers in rural areas. That was back in 1851. The Wentworths In effect, they can pick up telecasts beamed on ultra high frequency at a distance of between 150 and 200 miles and transmit them to viewers. The translators can also rebeam the telecast to another translator a further 150 or 200 miles away. The total cost, landed at Fremantle according to the manufacturers, is about £12,000 a unit. The cost for two units to relay programmes to Kalgoorlie would be £24,000. fhe cost for a further two units to relay programmes to Geraldton would be a further £24,000. If that figure seems ridiculously low--and it does-it should be at least investigated by the Postmaster-General's Department because the opportunity seems too good to miss. But we are missing it. In the Kalgoorlie viewing area there are 25.000 people and in the Geraldton area there are 26,000 people. Surely, with viewing licences at £5 each, the cost of servicing those areas would be offset in a very short timethat is if the cost of providing television services to these areas is to be considered foremost, which, I suggest, it is not. AllI ask is that the Postmaster-General give the people of these areas an assurance that the method about which I have spoken, and any other method that is considered feasible, will be given due consideration. If this method is not found to be feasible by the Postmaster-General's Department, then the reasons should be made known to the House so that the matter may be debated. the Opposition) [1.43 a.m.] I do not wish to detain the House very long, but as I have been referred to several times I think I should say something on the matters that have been discussed. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) is a traditionalist if nothing else. He has maintained the tradition of his family from the days of his great-grandfather, William Charles Wentworth I . He has maintained the tradition of attacking every person who happens to be progressively minded. The honourable member for Mackellar is William Charles Wentworth Let me refer to IV. It was William Charles Wentworth I . who, from his place in the Legislative Council of New South Wales, first condemned a fellow citizen as a Communist.",107,Adjournment
280,Mr Calwell (Melbourne,"Leade r ofhave been at it for 110 years. Sir Henry Parkes in his autobiography said that the same William Charles Wentworth I . , from his place in the Legislative Council of New South Wales, described him as an anarchist, a socialist, a Communist and a radical. The honourable member for Mackellar to-night attacked Mr Cavanagh because he is a militant. In the opinion of the honourable member nobody has a right to be a militant. I do not suppose that the honourable member or anybody else on the Government side would subscribe to the thesis that I now propose to quote, but I doIf communism in action is just militant unionism opposed to arbitration but determined for Supply( Mr Hulme) to-night came to to alter the law by lawful means, no punitive action against communism can be justified. I have no hostility to minority movements. Christianity itself was the greatest minority movement of history. Does any honourable member opposite object to that as a statement? Many honourable members opposite object to that statement. The honourable member for Phillip objects to it. have had second thoughts about the matter. Perhaps the honourable member for Phillip realizes that I was trying to trap him, because the quotation was from a speech by the Prime Minister( Mr want. We have listened to outbursts of Menzies), delivered in this House on 27th April, 1950. The honourable member for Barker( Mr worse. I want to quote from the MelForbes) spoke to-night to show that he, too, had done a little homework on this matter. He quoted Mr Justice Abbott as having said some nasty things about Mr entitled "" Co-operation is not ComCavanagh. Mr Justice Abbott on hi3 retirement from the supreme court bench of South Australia wrote a series of articles in the Adelaide"" Advertiser"" in one of which he boasted that before he became a judge he had been a strike breaker. No wonder he was particularly critical of Mr Cavanagh when he had surely stalked Victorians legislative halls this week, Mr Cavanagh before him. He was very when State Parliament discussed the new Cohostile towards Mr Cavanagh and fined him for a breach of the law, but it was an industrial matter and had nothing to do with a charge of communism that was levelled against Mr Cavanagh by the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt). Let us get back to that matter for a moment. According to the press, the right honourable gentleman said that Mr Cavanagh was a Communist or a fellow traveller, but he claims that the entire press of Australia misrepresented him. What a most unfortunate experience! He is the only politician in Australian history who has been misrepresented by every newspaper in the land simultaneously. But the same Mr Cavanagh was not a Communist ten or eleven years later. The Minister the table almost like a penitent approaching the penitent's stool. He gave some lame explanation of how he happened to invite Mr Cavanagh to go to Woomera. Whether Mr Cavanagh was invited or not, the fact is that he was not a Communist in the eyes of the security service in 1959. So, he cannot be a Communist in the eyes of the Minister in 1961. Mr Harold Holt -Why do you draw that conclusion? honest and decent conclusion to draw. 1 challenge the Treasurer to repeat outside the House his statements as contained in "" Hansard"", and give Mr Cavanagh and others concerned the opportunity that they McCarthyism over the last week that would have disgraced the late United States Senator Joseph McCarthy even at his bourne "" Herald"" of 12th December, 1953, because I , too, have been doing a little homework.
