He admits, to a certain point, that unquestionably everything that gives value to the land should be regarded in the light of an improvement, and then he proceeds to argue in the other direction. As the honourable member for Flinders has pointed out, many of the lands of the Commonwealth, and particularly mallee and scrub lands, have cost more in improvement that is not visible than they have in respect of visible improvements. What underlies the principle of taxing unimproved, as against improved, values? It is that we should not tax a man's industry, and, therefore, we exempt improvements. special attention of the Attorney-General to the fact that improvements that are not visible often do more to increase the productive capacity of land than do such visible improvements as the erection of fences or tenements. into consideration by a buyer. not; and the question is one regarding which the producers desire to be put beyond doubt. There is no reason why they 'should have to fight it out with half-adozen valuers. The amendment puts the question beyond the shadow of doubt. Many land-owners have cleared their properties at great cost, their improvements creating more than half, and in some instances three-fourths, of the value; but these improvements are not discernible now. be appointed to check the assessments will know nothing of the original character of the land; they will not know whether it was lightly scrubbed or heavily timbered.

For instance, the building of a large house on it tion, irrespective of the cost of improvemight, or might not; increase its' value. But all the expenditure on improvements should be deducted from the whole value of a property in assessing its unimproved value. opinion as to principle; the only question is how best to give effect to what we desire to ""enact. seems to me that we should consider more than the cost of improvements to the holder of the land. A property might be increased in value by expenditure by some one other than the owner, in which the Government or the State had no part. For instance, a track giving access to two I call the holdings might be made wholly at the expense of one of ' the holders, though it undoubtedly benefited both, and the Government or the State would not have contributed anything towards the improvement. Account should be taken of expenditure of that kind not made by the holder of the land. Probably it would be well to retain the words "" made by the owner or occupier of the land,"" but to' add others to embrace all improvements other than those made by the Government or the community. All improvements which are not directly traceable to the expenditure of the Government or the community should be exempt from taxation, but, as the amendment stands, they would not all be included. Mr W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [3.48]. -The Attorney-General simply set up an Aunt Sally of his own making to knock The Government oflicials who will it down again. I did not suggest any doubt as to the object and purpose of the tax. The measure is designed to tax that portion of the value of landed property which owes its existence to the efforts of the community. As the Attorney-General admits, there is no difference of opinion regarding the principle, the only question being how to give effect to it. In my opinion, the Bill will not give effect to it.

79,Mr Glynn,"But it was the oppositethe ground that we cannot distinguish between the value of the improvements and the value of the land. I may say that, at all events, we have done that approximately in Australia ; and it indicates a great desire not to tax the reward of a man's industry, and, as far as possible, to exempt all classes of improvements. Henry George said that if, for instance, he cleared a forest, drained a swamp, cr filled a morass, all he could justly claim was the value given by those exertions. The Bill before, us speaks of the value at the time of the assessment, but does not include such improvements. Henry George went on to say that improvements of the kind gave him no right to exemption as regards the land itself, or any claim other than to an. equal share with every other member of the community in the value which was clue to the growth of the community He points out that there may be certain classes of improvements that in time become part of the land itself, but that there would be no great hardship, after the lapse of a generation or two, if the tax did fall on such improvements. We must adopt some definition such as that proposed by the honourable member for Richmondi f we wish to exempt the cost of clearing. I am judging now by the administration in South Australia, where there have been included under the words "" improvements thereon "" improvements made on adjoining land, but extending, as in the case of drain pipes, to the taxed land. It may not have been necessary to put in the words "" appertaining thereto,"" because, under a ""general interpretation, pipes on the adjoining land, or from the taxed land to somewhere else, for drainage purposes, might be regarded as "" thereon."" In regard to clearing, however, I do not believe that the words ""appertaining thereto"" apply, and I shall support the amendment. The Attorney-General says that the amendment may operate by way of limitation; but that could be got over with the greatest ease, as shown in Act after Act. In the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, for instance, in order to prevent any limitation in the construction of the words "" industrial matters,"" it is provided that the phrase "" includes,"" a number of matters which are enumerated. All we have to do is to say that improvement in relation to land "" in cludes"" and not ""means"" certain things. T make this suggestion to the honourable member for Richmond, because it cannot possibly cut down the scope of the word "" improvements,"" and if the Attorney General objects to this, it means that there will be included for taxation improvements that are not part of the unimproved value. The drafting up to the present has added confusion to confusion. ""Land,"" for instance, is used in contradistinction to "" land "" in clause 44, where it means the whole realty-the improvements and the land itself. In the Acts Interpretation Act, which is the only definition we have of "" land "" as distinguished from "" unimproved value,"" it means the whole realty; but we have added something to that. However, I am not the draftsman; and I can only point out matters which require clearing up. The legal aspect of the question has been sufficiently explained. So far as I understand the position, the Government, in order to reach tlie unimproved value, propose to take the value of the improvements from the total selling value; and every owner is obliged to send in his own valuation. That being so, it is all the morr. necessary that some guide should be given to the owner; and the amendment of the honourable member for Richmond gives the widest possible interpretation, merely setting out the principal improvements usually placed on land as a guide to the owner in sending in his valuation, and deducting the value of the improvements. It is our duty to make such instructions or directions as full as possible, not only to the Commissioner and the valuers, but to the owner. There is no fear of the exclusion of other particulars by the enumeration in the amendment; and if a similar provision has been found necessary in the case of New Zealand and New South Wales, but particularly in New Zealand, where there is a complete staff of valuers, how much more is it necessary where the individual owner has to send in his own valuation ? Two adjoining owners may have very different ideas, indeed, as to the interpretation of a provision of this kind, and the fullest particulars, as I say, ought to be given, because every man cannot be expected to be an expert able to differentiate between unimproved value and improved value. As an illustration of the difficulty that may arise in these matters, I may point to a case in Victoria, in which Mr Justice Hodges was called upon to fix",24,Chairman Th E Honourable Of The Clearing Remains For Ever
80,Mr Sampson (Wimmera) [4,"18]the value of an estate in the Western District. The value exceeded £100,000; and the Judge after having heard expert evidence, on both sides, commented on the bald nature of the Act under which he was empowered to act. He urged that it was the duty of Parliament to say exactly what was required, so as to assist the Court-that it was not fair to ask the Court to act without instructions, or without knowing what was in the mind of the Parliament. that an enumeration would mean a limitation. misconception. The amendment does not purport to enumerate all the possible improvements, but merely to set out broadly the nature of improvements which increase the value of the land, and remain unexhausted at the time of valuation. This is done merely as a guide,, or a basis on which the Commissioner, or the owner, may act, and does not exclude other improvements. The amendment is so reasonable that I am surprised the Government should take any exception to it. the Government needed any reasons why the amendment should not be alopted, tliey have, I think, been supplied by the honourable member for Wimmera. suggested that the proper method to arrive at the unimproved value is for the owner to rake up every possible piece of work he can think of or dream of in the past history of the land, and deduct it from the value. The honourable member told us that the owner would deduct the cost of improvements from the existing value of his land, and in that way ascertain the taxable value. That is quite a new proposition, and is not in keeping with the provision that we have already adopted with regard to the unimproved value. It would certainly be unworkable, and lead to endless difficulties. The amendment refers to "" any improvement whatsoever made by the owner or occupier of the land."" How far back is such a provision to go? In many cases land has been improved by previous occupiers, and no record has been kept of the improvements. has paid for them. so. Improvements may, or may not, have been made by the present owner of a block of land. In many cases, a man has made a profit by clearing his land of blaekwood and selling the timber, yet that clearing, under this amendment, would be an improvement, and would, be treated as if no return had been obtained. Then, again, houses, buildings, and fences are to be regarded as improvements. Such improvements deteriorate, although our Australian timber is so durable that it is not easy to say when they cease to be of any value. Dams and excavations for holding water, as well as wells and bores, are also included in the amendment j yet dams or excavations might, or might not, be silted up, and the tubing in a bore might be pretty well exhausted. I come now to the question of ring-barking, and have no hesitation in saying that it is most puzzling to ascertain the value of such work. Ringbarking might have been carried out at tlie wrong time of the year, with the result that suckers have grown up, or might have been carried out by a previous owner, and no record kept of the cost. I was on a Select Committee appointed by the Parliament of New South Wales some years ago, which had to deal with the valuation of land that had been ring-barked, and there was a great conflict of evidence on the point. It was easy to arrive at the original cost, but we found that in some cases the expenditure within a few years had ceased It is to be of any value. Under this amendment, however, the owner of a property where such work had ceased to be of any value would nevertheless deduct the cost. to prove his case in a Court of law if he were challenged. volve men in litigation. The taxable value is the unimproved value, and it would be well if we could ignore improvements. I was astonished at the statements made by the honourable member for Wimmera as to the way in which he would arrive at the unimproved value of a piece of land, and, to my mind, his proposition would not work out correctly. The honourable member for Richmond would also treat as improvementsclearing from timber or scrub or stone or any noxious weed or plant or shrub and laying down in grass or pasture. How could any one arrive at the cost or the occupier the value of the removal of noxious weeds ? contracts are let for that kind of work. done by land-owners themselves, and no record of the cost is kept.

96,Mr Hughes,"No j because, in mytorney-General think that the ordinary farmer will understand the definition in the Bill? sible, we should make the measure understandable by every farmer; but, no doubt, the millennium must arrive before every Bill will be understood by all the people, and the definitions of unimproved value and improved value are at least as clear as any provision in any Statute. The farmer who cannot tell what he is entitled to deduct is hardly likely to be helped by the proposal of the honourable member for Richmond. The effect of adopting a list of the improvements which might be deducted, would be to set up the presumption that other improvements might not be deducted. Reference has been made to clearing. On the soil in its virgin state, trees may be growing, which have to be cut down ancl grubbed out to make the land fit for the plough. It is contended that the improvements are not on the land, but off it, so to speak; in fact, that they are not there. I submit that to the practical valuer or practical farmer, there can be no confusion, for the simple reason that cleared land other; now you can scarcely see a stump in 999 cases out of 1,000 is more valuable than land with scrub on it. There may be a case where good timber has been cleared off the land, and the land was worth more with the timber on than with the timber off, but in almost every case clearing does the lancl good. In Queensland, large areas of land are let on condition that they are cleared of a pest, such as prickly pear. My point is that nothing in the honourable member's amendment can help the definition of ""unimproved value,"" ancl that the amendment will not help the honourable and learned member for Flinders in his contention that some improvements are neither "" thereon nor appertaining thereto."" If they are not "" thereon or appertaining thereto,"" the mere setting of them down in a list will not entitle them to be deducted. I submit that they are entitled to be deducted, that the Bill is perfectly clear, and that we are practically in agreethat they doubt whether clearing is inment all round the Committee as to what we want to do, but the only effect of accepting the honourable member's amendment would be to add to the confusion, and make nothing clear. My object in moving the amendment was to make perfectly clear what the owner of the land was entitled to deduct-in short, Atwhat was an improvement. I admit that the definition of ""unimproved value"" is perfectly clear. ""Unimproved value"" is the difference between what the land would sell for to-day, and the value of the improvements, but the question that we have to determine is what those improvements, if any, consist in. Is it not right that we should clearly lay down the intention of the Legislature in passing this measure, as to what can be included under "" improvements "" ? What led me to move the amendment was my practical experience of the Local Government Aet in New South Wales. As president of the shire in which I was located for some time, I had to go through the Appeal Court, where a great number of these cases were dealt with. In the first year that the valuations were made, I think we had some 300 odd appeals, and we found the very definition which we are now debating of the greatest assistance in determining them, because by its means we were able to clearly define what the unimproved value of the land was. The greater part of the district which I represent was at one time covered with dense scrub from one end to the or stick, or tree, standing over thousands of acres. But it has cost an enormous amount of money to bring the land into that state. I think it should be clearly stated that the owners are entitled to include amongst improvements the clearing of the land from timber, and bringing it into that state. There is no question that such clearing is an improvement. The whole point is whether this Bill entitles the owner of the land to include it as an improvement in calculating the unimproved value of his land. I think we all agree that the owner ought to be entitled to regard it as an improvement, and to deduct it for all time, because once value is given to land by work of that description, that value exists so long as the land is wortii anything. But will this Bill allow such a deduction to be made? The legal members on this side of the chamber have said cluded in the Bill as an improvement, and I contend that the point should be made perfectly clear. siderable quantity of timber were sold off the land? compared with the actual cost of clearing the land ?",28,Chairman Th E Honourable Of The Clearing Remains For Ever

After all, you still have the stump to take out, and the head to clear away, and it is only a comparatively small portion of the trunk that you can sell, so that the actual value of the timber that you take off the land is neither here nor there in relation to the total cost of -clearing the land. the class of timber. the case of blackwoods in Tasmania, and other valuable timbers in my own State, you do not get very many trees to the acre. I do not see why there should be any hesitation on the part of the Government in accepting some amendmentI am not wedded to the form of words that I have proposed-that will make perfectly clear what owners are entitled to deduct and what they are not. It has been objected that this amendment is an enumeration, but it is nothing of the sort. It is simply an illustration, and nothing more. It defines an improvement, and, by way of illustration, states what was in our mind at the time we passed it. several legal gentlemen, and the amendment was drawn in deference to their opinion. They state that the latter part does not in any way restrict or limit the deis arrived at, because that is what is really finition itself. We must admit that we cannot deduct the full cost of improvements from the improved value in arriving at the unimproved value. We must take the value of the improvements at the time of valuation, but there does not seem to be any reasonable difficulty in arriving at the value of the improvements as nearly as possible. The only difficulty is as to what are, and what are not, improvements. General referred to the New Zealand Act. There are two definitions in the New Zealand Act, following one after the other; the first definition defines improvements, as the Attorney-General read it, and the next is as to the value of improvements. This is given, in an amendment circulated by the honourable member for Wimmera, as follows:"" Value"" of improvements means the sum by which the improvements on an owner's land increase its value, including all buildings, fences, planting, draining, private roads, and waterraces, clearing, permanent grassing, and other work of a permanent nature effected upon land. That is substantially the same enumeration as I have given. The Government, in their definition of the value of improvements, have not enumerated anything. All that we have done is to tack on to what is substantially the New Zealand definition of improvements an enumeration which shows clearly what, the New Zealand Act aims at. The same thing is working in New South Wales, and my experience there leads me to believe that it is a decided assistance to the Court in arriving at a valuation, and also to the taxpayers. It facilitates matters all round, and does not confuse the issue as honourable members oppor site seem to think it will. The Government might well accept the amendment, which, I feel sure, will be found to be beneficial in the general working of the measure. I do not think the Attorney-General can claim that we are spending too much time on this clause, because this is the clause which lays the foundation for the whole system of taxation. If we once settle the principles in it, the rest of the measure is, for the main part, machinery. get through it? ber shows a little reason, it is quite possible that we shall. It is most important to know exactly how the unimproved value taxed. The first definition that we are met with is that of '' improved value,'' which, we are told, in relation to land, means the capital sum which the fee-simple of the land might be expected to realize if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bond fide seller would require. Most of the land to which the tax will apply is improved land, and the problem is to ascertain the unimproved The Attorneyvalue. What will be the method of valuation? Will it be as stated by Mr Justice Walker, as set out in New South Wales Law Reports, vol. xix., page 363In arriving at the value of land containing improvements you value the land as it stands with the improvements on it, and then you deduct the value of the improvements, and that gives you the unimproved value.",29,Chairman Th E Honourable Of The Clearing Remains For Ever

I confess it seems to me almost impossible to arrive with any degree of certainty at the unimproved value of improved land. What the Committee are anxious to know is the method by which the value is to be ascertained. First there is the selling value with all the improvements', and then there has to be an inquiry as to the improvements oh the land, or ""appertaining thereto""; and it is just at this point that we are in a difficulty.

However, T contend that it is impossible to go back in every case to original improvements such as clearing; and it must be a matter of discretion.

I am not quite sure why the word "" guardian "" is used in the definition of "" trustee.'' I can quite understand a committee, say, in a lunatic's estate, or a receiver, or a liquidator, becoming an owner of land under this Bill, but not how a guardian could be placed in such a position. torney-General) [5.25] -It may be that a person can appoint a guardian in the terms of the Bill; but, in any case, a guardian is included in the generic term of ""trustee,"" which is not limited by these definitions, and, I suppose, will apply in some equitable, and, possibly, in some legal estates. I cannot think of any particular case in which the word would apply, but I do not think that its retention will do any harm. I presume that the intention as regards bodies or associations, corporate or unincorporate, is that, as in the case of the New South Wales Act, the Bill shall not apply to any trading partnerships? assume that partners will come under the heading of joint tenants. My attention has been drawn to the limited definition of the word ""mortgage,"" and which, I am informed, will not meet the case of building societies who generally take an absolute transfer of titles. They are registered as absolute proprietors, and accompanying that registration is a deed of defeasance, which, being an equity of redemption, is not registered. It is suggested that this might not be regarded as a "" charge "" within the meaning of the definition, because it is not registered on the face of the document; and it is suggested that the definition of "" mortgage "" should be so amended as to read that it "" includes any conveyance or transfer of, or any charge,"" and so forth. If the definition were amended as I suggest, it would cover the case of building societies which are mortgagees by virtue of two documents instead of one.

It may be that it is necessary to meet the sjpecial class of cases to which he refers. The principle of this Bill is that the mortgagor, and not the mortgagee, shall be taxed; and the question arises whether a conveyance which differs in principle from some kinds of mortgages should be, in some circumstances, treated as a mortgage. I promise the honourable and learned member to look into the question, and if the position be as he says it is, to make the amendment when the Bill is recommitted. any misapprehension on the point, I should like to mention that some of the banks take, not only a deposit of deeds, but an absolute conveyance, and that there is, of course, an equity of redemption attaching to, although not expressed in, the deed.

My attention has been drawn to the fact by the honourable member for is covered by the Acts Interpretation Act. I should also like the Attorney General to state who is to carry out the valuations throughout Australia. The Victorian Bill made provision for the appointment of certain persons by the Governor in Council, and gave a definition of the requisite qualifications. Under this Bill every land-owner will, in the first place, make a valuation of his property, and the Commissioner may accept his valuation, or may, under clause 16, cause a valuation of the land to be made. It will, therefoic, be necessary to appoint persons throughout Australia to make such valuations, and T wish to know what method of administration is to be pursued. Who are to be appointed ? The Bill makes no provision for the Commissioner, other measures for their administration, necessitating specific appointments, the officers have been appointed under the Public Service Act, and are responsible to the Public Service Commissioner. There is no provision in this Bill for the special appointment of valuers, and I wish to know whether, during the first year, a number of land agents are to be appointed to make the valuations. The Commissioner cannot in every case accept cause they are made for different purposes. In Queensland we have valuations for clause 8 municipal purposes under an Act very different from this.

The Doomsday Book, or the register on which Will be inscribed the value of all lands in this country, ought to be open to the public in the same way. There is no secrecy about the matter at all. It is not a question of the amount of a man's mortgage, or of his position or status in business. I see no reason why there should be any secrecy so far as regards the value, and especially the unimproved value of a man's landed estate. We are dealing potentially in this measure with the whole of the land-owners of the country, because it will be obviously impossible to ask for a return only from those land-owners who possess land of the unimproved value of £5,000, and over. It is for the Commissioner to decide who is to be taxed, subject to the Act, and while it may be, and very likely will be, unnecessary to demand a return from every small land-owner, it is apparent that those near the margin will be called upon to make a return. It is very desirable,, for many reasons, that those returns, subject to the necessary official restrictions, should be public property. reading the notice of amendment in this regard, I was struck by one of the reasons given by the Attorney-General. Although an oath of secrecy is imposed in connection with the South Australian Act, it is primarily in relation to income tax. The Commissioner there has thought his duty so imperative as regards secrecy that he has actually refused, without a subpoena, to produce the returns of income tax, and in one case, I believe, he would not allow the taxpayer himself to look at his own return. In that State, however, the land tax returns are all open, and provision is",34,Chairman Th E Honourable Of The Clearing Remains For Ever

Clause 60, however, deals with some information that the Commissioner may obtain outside the mere land tax return. In that regard, there is necessity for secrecy, but even in such a case I do not think there is sufficient necessity for preserving the word in this clause, because if a man breaks the obligation of secrecy prescribed by clause 6, that will be an offence under the Public Service Act, and I presume he will be liable to dismissal. scarcely think it is necessary to declare that he is a criminal if he breaks his oath. The Attorney-General proposes to strike out sub-clause 2, leaving the correction of any breach of secrecy under clause 6 to be dealt with under the power of dismissal given in the Public Service Act. If the persons referred to in sub-clause 2 are appointed or employed under the Public Service Act, there is a control over them, and power to impose a punishment, but they may be only temporarily appointed, and not under the Public Service Act. They may get an opportunity of obtaining the information which has been referred to under clause 60, and I would draw the attention of the Attorney-General to the necessity of some provision for dealing with them, in the case.of a breach by them of these provisions. ney-General) [6.3] -The point taken by the honourable member for Darling Downs is a very proper one. Clauses6 and 7 may cover a number of persons taken on temporarily, who may acquire information as to much of the private business of a taxpayer other than the unimproved value of his land. Such persons should, of course, not divulge anything of that nature, and that should be a condition of their employment. The Commissioner, however, will be an administrative officer, who will be appointed by the Executive, and, therefore, it is necessary that he should take the oath of fidelity, and not divulge anything except that which, under the Act, he is permitted to divulge. All that my amendment does is to show that the roll of valuations shall not be. secret information, but shall be available in exactly the same way as are registers of births, deaths, marriages, and deeds in general, I think the amendment ought to be allowed, but the Attorney-General must have had some good reason for putting those words in when the clause was drafted. He simply asks us now to strike them out, but he ought to tell us why they were put in. Amendment agreed to. toThat sub-clause 2 be left out. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause8 (Delegations by Commissioner). I Is it intended under this clause to delegate the final power of assessing land values to the respective Deputy Commissioners, or will the different assessments made up by the deputies come back to the Commissioner, and will his decision be the final assessment upon which the notices of assessment are .issued ? It is most important to know this, because the question of uniformity is involved, as also that of appeal. The clause says that all powers may be delegated. ney-General) [6.7] I take it that this is a genera] power of delegation, which the Commissioner may exercise, and which he could not exercise if it were not for this clause. It is a delegation, if desired, of the whole of the Commissioner's powers in any particular part of the whole sphere of his duties. It might extend to the point mentioned by the honourable and learned member, so that the decision of a Deputy Commissioner upon a question of assessment might be final to the same extent as a decision by the Commissioner himself. It is very desirable in certain cases that this should be so, especially in relation to appeals. The honourable member for Darling Downs, on the second reading, spoke of the necessity of appointing Appeal Courts, where disputes might be shortly decided in summary fashion in the neighbourhood of where they arose, and it is desirable .that, as far as possible, the Deputy Commissioners should perform these duties without too much red-tape and circumlocution. While the matter is entirely in the hands of the Commissioner, I take it that, under this clause, the intention is to clothe him with authority to delegate these powers to his deputies.

171,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"Attor(2.) The taxable value of all the land owned by a person is(a) in the case of an absentee-the total sum of the unimproved value of all the land.

This is a method of assessing the unimproved value applied to absentees as well as to residents, although this amendment deals with absentees only. The object and intention is to arrive at the true unimproved value as distinguished from the value added by improvements made on adjacent and neighbouring allotments. necessary amendment, because, in estimating the unimproved value of one particular piece of land consideration must be given to the value that has been added by improvements on adjacent lands and in the district generally. There are cases in this country where a man owns a whole township ; indeed, I believe, though I am not quite certain, that Silvertown is thus owned. At any rate, there are cases where a considerable portion of all the lands of a town or district are owned by one person; and the case frequently occurs in making subdivisions. If we take the whole aggregated holding, and estimate the unimproved value thereof, all the value of particular blocks which is due to improvements on every other block will be added to the improved value of each block, and there will be deducted from the whole value of such holding very much more than there would be, say, -if 100 men owned this land amongst them. unimproved value of the next lot would not be attached; but if the man owns a whole township or subdivision, then the unimproved value of every other block is merged in the whole value, and the community loses that which is, after all, a communal improvement. The object is, as is very necessary, to place the small land-holder in exactly tbe same position as the large landowner ; and to that end it is proposed to deal with each parcel of land separately. A man who owns £5,000 worth of land in one parcel will be in exactly the same position as a man who owns ,£100,000 worth ' of land in twenty parcels. Each parcel of land of £5,000 will be treated as if it were the only parcel he held; whether they happen to be continuous lots or not. The effect of this will be that none of the value given to any block by improvements on any other block will be deducted. It is perfectly fair and proper, and is, in proved value and unimproved value which we are discussing. torney-General has supplied some words on which a test can be made, if it be desired, whether each separate parcel shall be regarded as of separate ownership for the purposes of the tax; in other words, as if each distinct parcel were regarded as owned by a different person. The effect of. this would be to induce subdivision with a vengeance. The policy of this legislation was proclaimed to be subdivision; and If we It is a very desire to induce subdivision, a good way, though not the most perfect from the point of view of taxation, would be to say that for each separate parcel of land a man shall have a separate assessment, and be regarded as a distinct owner. This is the most perfect way in which, possibly, we could accomplish the Government policy of subdivision ; and, as some honourable members desire that a test shall be made on this point, I call attention to the fact that an opportunity now arises. For instance, we might make sub-clause 2 read, "" the taxable value of each,"" as if it were the only parcel of land owned by the taxpayer. What the amendment will do if it stands by itself is, of course, to subject to the higher rate the several parcels of land which have been made parcels by subdivision by a single owner. Instead of treating the whole as one estate, the Attorney-General desires to treat each parcel"" as In the latter case, the of separate ownership for the purpose of assessing its unimproved value, but not for the purpose of determining under what rate it shall come. 1 am pointing out that there is a method by amending the amendment of going further than the Attorney-General proposes.

174,Mr Glynn,"No doubt that would be-We understand that the object of the Attorney-General is to get the higher unim-proved value by providing that the buildings, and so forth, may be taken into account by the Commissioner; and I presume that he has in his mind a case that was decided in New South Wales'. Is it quite clear that the word "" parcel "" is the proper one to use? The word in conveyancing, we know, means a distinct piece of land, though not land geographically distinct. It has just been pointed out to me that in the next amendment to be moved by the Attorney-General it is providedEvery part of a holding which is separately ' held by any occupier, tenant, lessee, or owner shall be deemed to be a separate parcel. That accomplishes the end from the Government point of view; and I shall say no more on the point. The Committee ought to know the exact effect of this amendment; and if they refer to the case of John Cooper v. The Commissioners of Taxation, reported in the New South Wales Law Reports, Vol. xix., they will get the information. The statement of the case tells usOn the 28th December, 1896, the appellant made a return of the said lands pursuant to the Act, wherein Thrupp's grant was returned as one estate or parcel, and the unimproved value thereof was stated at £84,450 and Cleveland Estate was returned as one other estate or parcel, and the unimproved value thereof was stated at £11,000. By an assessment notice the Commissioners gave notice to the appellant that they had regarded and treated Thrupp's grant for the purposes of assessment as an aggregation of 422 separate and divided estates or parcels, and not as one estate or parcel, and had fixed the unimproved value of the whole at £220,000, and had regarded and treated Cleveland Estate as being divided into separate estates or parcels, and not as one whole estate or parcel, and had assessed each of the estates or parcels separately from the others, and had fixed the aggregate of the unimproved value of all the estates or parcels at £20,697. The statement goes on to show how the Commissioners proceeded to value the land. For instance, they took four allotments, A, B, C, and D, and A plot was treated as improved by B, C, and D ; C plot as improved by A. B, and D ; and so on right round. By this method the estate became considerably enhanced in value; and that is the method the Government now propose to adopt. This New South Wales case went to the. Full Court, which decided upon the words of the New South Wales, sectionThe word "" parcel "" means "" a part or portion or piece,"" as a certain piece of land is part and parcel of another ""piece.""

Each parcel would, in my view, come within the term ""such land"" in the interpretation clauseas to the meaning of "" unimproved value.""

That is to say, the improvements in one part of the estate are added to the improvements in another part, so that as long as he holds the estate in his own hands and works it himself, notwithstanding that it may be suitable for subdivision, he will get the full benefit of what we may call, for the sake of brevity, the mutual value of his improvements. But suppose he wishes to adopt a very common form of subdivision, and says, "" I will let out my estate to tenants, giving them the option of purchase, for a certain number of years."" From the moment that his tenants go in the taxation will be increased by 30 or 40 per cent. with the principle which confines the liability of a lessee to that particular tax which would have been paid on a particular piece of land if the lessee were the owner of it, and of no other. Mr W. H . IRVINE I understand that the Attorney-General really desires that this clause should operate to encourage subdivisions, and one of the most useful and practical forms of subdivision is that under which, in the first place, tenants are created with the option of purchase. That is a form of subdivision that ought to be encouraged' rather than discouraged, but the effect of this provision would be, in such a case, to increase the taxation by 40 per cent. That'would be a very serious bar to what, in some cases, is the only practical method of subdivision.

Cases of great hardship will arise if every parcel of land owned by one individual or company is aggregated for the purposes of taxation. The Attorney-General has already made some concessions to mortgagees, but they will not meet the position of. unfortunate mortgagees whose loans have matured, and who have become the actual' proprietors of certain properties. Let me cite a few cases. In the first case, an absentee company has been the owner for some time of several properties. If the first of these, the unimproved value of which is £22,000, were separately dealt with, the company would pay, by way of taxation upon it, ,£250 ns. i d . ; and a resident owner ,£158 17s. 9d. In the next case, the tax on a property of the unimproved value of £36,000, if separately dealt with, would be £412 12s. 9d. in the case of an absentee owner, and £262 12s. 9d. in the case of a resident owner. My third illustration relates to a property in Melbourne of the unimproved value of .£26,000, the tax on which, if it were separately dealt with, would be £310 ns. i d . in the case of ah absentee owner, and ,£204 4s: 5d. if the owner were a resident of the Commonwealth. Then, I have before me details of a property of the unimproved value of £19,000 on which, if it were separately dealt with, an absentee owner would pay £208 9s. 5d., and a resident owner £129 6s. ' i d . If we add up the several amounts, the tax payable by an absentee company on these properties, Mr W. H . IRVINE -That would not be the absentee provisions. in the company owning these properties are If they were resident the properties, when aggregated, is nearly double what it would be if they were separaI do not think it was the intention of honourable members opposite that absentees should have to pay, not but nearly double what the taxation would",38,Chairman Th E Honourable Of The Clearing Remains For Ever

I will now bring under the notice of the Attorney General a property of the unimproved value of ,£16,000, the tax on which, if separately dealt with, would be ,£62 12s. in the case of a resident owner; but, as it is owned by an English company possessing other properties, the taxation upon it will amount to £407. Separately dealt with, it would be taxable to the extent of £^62 12s., at the rate of 6d. in the £ 1 , if held by a resident owner; but, aggregated with other properties, and owned by an absentee company, it is taxable at 7d. in the £ 1 , and the tax totals £407. Take the case of another property of the unimproved value of ,£40,000, and situate in Collins-street, Melbourne. The owner is a resident of the Commonwealth, and if it were separately dealt with, the tax upon it would be £ 3 1 6 ; but, as the owner possesses land all over Australia, and the several properties are aggregated, the tax upon this particular property will amount to no less than £1,166. That seems a most extraordinary increase. The last case to which I desire to refer is that of a property of the unimproved value of £57,000, the tax upon which, if separately dealt with, would be ,£688 15s. But the owner is a bank having property scattered all over Australia, and the tax on this property, since it is aggregated with others, will amount to £1,427. I am sure that honourable members do not desire that properties should be aggregated and also subjected to a progressive rate of taxation. The system is very like that illustrated by the story of the man who agreed to pay so much per nail for having his horse shod, the price per nail to be increased by the square. The total in that case reached a fabulous sum, and the result of this method of taxation is practically the same. parcel of land belonging to a person or company possessing a number of parcels shall be treated as if it were the only piece held ? the Minister will take into consideration the exceedingly hard cases which will be created if the Bill becomes law as it stands. If a worker becomes insolvent, his tools of trade are exempted, and the buildings of the banks, with the land on which they stand, may be regarded as the company's tools of trade. It is not as if these institutions were holding land to block settlement ; the. land which they hold could not be subdivided, and by lending money to others for the carrying out of improvements, they are greatly encouraging settlement. T do not press for the acceptance of the exact words whose insertion I have proposed, but I ask the Minister to see if justice cannot be done to institutions which have greatly benefited the country. The Prime Minister said that he would do his hest to put right any provision which affected injuriously a single individual, and I am sure that honourable members opposite do not wish injustice to be done. The object of the measure is to compel the subdivision of large estates, with a view to the encouragement of settlement, but it will needlessly penalize banking and other companies, whose operations compel them to have branches all over the Commonwealtli, if the small parcels of land which they hold are treated as one estate, and made taxable accordingly. ney-General) [8.15] -The honourable member for Fawkner proposes to treat each property belonging to a person or company owning several properties as if it were the only property owned, and to allow exemptions accordingly ; but that would perhaps reduce the rate of tax, in many cases, from 4d. or 3&d. fo i£d., and in addition to being a violation of the underlying principle of the measure, would prevent the realization of the Treasurer's estimate of the revenue to be received from it. . According to the honourable member for Fawkner, the Treasurer's estimate is too low, and the tax will really return about £3,000,000; but the Treasurer's estimate would certainly be much too high were the exemptions which the honourable member proposes allowed. The New Zealand Act has been amended no fewer than nine times. The people of the Dominion have, during a number of years, been feeling their way to an effective system of graduated land-value taxation, and we must assume that they have now got a practicable measure which, although its incidence at some points is heavier than that of our tax will be. has not driven capital out of the country, nor stricken the place as with a plague ; in fact, the country seems to be doing very well under it.

Unless inconsistent with the context, "" land"" does not include ""mortgages,"" and every person is liable to pay in each year, commencing with the year ending on the 31st March, 1909, a graduated tax upon all land of which he was the owner at noon on the 31st March of the preceding year, and the unimproved value of which is £5,000 or more. That is substantially our proposal. The Victorian Bill, which was rejected by the Legislative Council hy a majority of four, says that the tax shall he assessed, charged, levied, and collected by the Commissioner-in the case of each owner on the total unimproved value of all lands, which means whether held in one block or in a thousand blocks.

My complaint is that honourable memhers opposite have no reply to make. against the proposal of the honourable member for Fawkner is that it is opposed to the mode of taxation adopted by two of the States and the Dominion of New Zealand. As to the States concerned, their taxation is so extremely small that it cannot fairly be compared with that proposed, while as to the New Zealand tax, although it is heavy, its incidence is not so heavy as that of this tax. By making a comparison by means of the tables prepared by the authority of the Government, I found that the New Zealand rates are only from two-thirds to three-fourths of our rates. existing State taxation. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Yes. The honourable member for Wakefield has told me, and I believe it to be true, although I have not had an opportunity of examining the New Zealand Act, that a further fact exists there which deprives this of any possible reasonable analogy at all-that the whole of the tax on income from land is deducted from the land tax. companies; only with regard to individuals.

The honourable member must see that the amendment is entirely in accord with the breaking up of big estates. that object,' if that be the object of this legislation, to be effected in a way lhat will involve less hardship and less' injustice. If a man happens to be possessed in different parts of the country, or in different States, of certain landed interests, not one of which, under the policy of this ""legislation, would the Government ask this House to break up, but all of which are put to their best use, why should that man, because he has invested his hard-earned money in that particular form, be subjected to this enormous taxation? Turning from country to city properties, the absurdity becomes still more marked; but the only answer which we get to all the ordinary appeals of reason which we make to honourable members on the other side is this: "" It is not done in New Zealand; it is not done in New South Wales; it is not done in South Australia."" Mr W. H . IRVINE I do not comin the view that he has expressed. It is plain of the brutal majority. jority on this occasion shows only the si-' lence of the brute, not its stupidity. Is there any reason, in justice or principle, why we should impose the heavier rates of tax, which are only justifiable for the purpose of breaking up estates that ought to be broken up, upon estates which no man on either side of this chamber conceives that it is necessary to break up ? So much for the statement of the Attorney-General that the amendment is opposed to the principle of the measure. For my part, I am, getting tired of attempting to impose' reasonable restrictions on its operation. I warn honourable members opposite that the' current does not always flow in the same, direction. If they want to get on to the statute-book the principle of land '.axation, which, within reasonable limits, and under proper restrictions, is one to which many of us on this side give their adherence, they are adopting the very worse way by hampering it with' extreme and drastic provisions of this kind. ney-General) [8.32] -The principle the Government have in view, and that this Bill embodies, is to discourage the drifting It must be the of land into the hands of the few.

216,Sir Robert Best (Kooyong) [8.40].,"was as desirous as any one to do justice to all sections of the community, because nothing more than justice is sought by those who are contending for amendments. The Attorney-General has told us that the design and object of the Bill is to discourage the drifting of large areas of land into the hands of the few; and, if that is the sole object I venture to say that the Bill utterly fails; or perhaps I should rather say that if the Bill succeeds it is at the expense of an injustice to large sections of the people. The honourable gentleman refers to the New Zealand laws when these suit his own purpose, but he fails to refer to them when concessions are sought in connection with the more rigid proposals before us. I could quite understand a measure which had for its object the breaking up of large areas suitable for agriculture, an idea that proved very attractive to a vast number of voters at the last election. But in New Zealand there is a low rate so far as business premises are concerned. I have in my mind a case where a man, starting business in the ordinary way, extended it by means of branches throughout the States. That was a perfectly legitimate thing to do, and the extension arose through his own business enterprise. I ask the Attorney-General whether his object is to burst up that man's business by the penal clauses of the Bill? The mere fact that a man owns these necessary branches can hardly mean the drifting of areas into the hands of one particular man. In this case there is an attempt made to apply to town areas principles which might be justifiably applied to large areas suitable for agricultural purposes. If the design and object of the Bill be as stated, -why are business premises not taxed at a lower rate? there is no proposal for the exemption of business premises before the Chair. The proposal is to omit certain words, with a view to insert other words. with the aggregation clause and its effects, the idea of the Attorney-General being to break up estates into small parcels, and thus obtain a certain assessment; and I am pointing out that, while the aggregation clause might be applicable to country areas, it cannot be legitimately made applicable to town areas, especially in view of the avowal that the object is to discourage the drifting of large areas of land into the hands of the few. Under the circumstances, I urge that where lands are legitimately occupied separately, the real object of the Bill is achieved. Of course, it may be desirable to say that these lands shall be a certain distance apart, for that would be a reasonable manner of dealing with the question; but to say that, where they are separately occupied and dealt with separately in every respect, they are not entitled to separate consideration, is an unreasonable view. The Attorney-General has told us that the amendment of the honourable member for Fawkner would seriously interfere with the revenue as estimated by-the Treasurer; but, as the honourable member for Coolgardie has pointed out, that view can scarcely be entertained if it be shown that the Bill is going to work an injustice. the amendment would injuriously affect the Bill from both stand-points-bot h in regard to bursting up estates and to revenue. Attorney-General does not desire to burst up town areas; and the effect of this clause will be to burst up businesses and depreciate values. The honourable gentleman has had figures submitted to him, showing that the revenue will be largely in excess of the estimate made by the Treasurer. Thesefiguresare open to be tested; and if it be stated on expert authority that the revenue will be three times the Treasurer's estimate, surely it is a reasonable suggestion that some concession might be made in the aggregation clause, which, as indicated by the illustrations submitted, will prove so disastrous. If the principle of aggregation is maintained, there should, at least, be large reductions in the rates, but if , on the contrary, the penal clauses are to be adhered to, then it may be fairly and reasonably urged that very substantial concessions should be given in the aggregation clause. That is the design of the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Fawkner. I again impress on the Attorney-General that, when he quotes the New Zealand Act, he must not always have regard to the more rigid sections while omitting the concessions therein provided, particularly those in regard to business premises. Another instance that strikes me is supplied in the case of building societies. In the case of one building society, if the properties are separately assessed, it will have to pay £ 5 6 per year, whereas, if the aggregation clause is applied, it will have to pay £1,800.",43,Chairman Th E Honourable Of The Clearing Remains For Ever

220,Sir Robert Best,"But themortgagees in possession? member has not read the Bill. concession had been made providing for a period of three years to elapse. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Building societies are not strictly mortgagees in possession, but are actual owners. Sir societies take an absolute transfer with a deed of defeasance, but the deed sets out all the terms of a mortgage, just as if it were a mortgage uncier the old law. The point is, however, that these building societies, under the Bill, are owners. We know that the borrowers from these societies are all working people, and the endeavour of the society is to "" nurse "" its borrowers as long as possible. If a man has the misfortune to be out of work, and unable to keep up his payments, the society, as I say, "" nurses "" him until the overdue payments almost reach the full value of the property, when they are forced to realize or probably lose by the transaction. In the case of the building society I have mentioned, who is going to pay the £1,800? Not the building society, out of profits, but the loss will be distributed over small properties. In many cases, at present, the borrowers have the opportunity of ultimately redeemingtheir properties, but they will not be able to do so if the penal and aggregation clauses of the Bill operate. This is a very serious matter, affecting a large number of people whom it was never for one moment intended this land tax should hit. I am very hopeful that the Attorney-General may ultimately see his way to exempt building societies from the tax, but, at present, I can only deal with the Bill as I find it. clause, the honourable member is discussing something not before the Chair. tlie effects of the aggregation clause. able member, he may discuss anything under this clause. 1 have departed from discussing the principle of the clause, the effect of which will be to seriously interfere with trading and the business of building societies, and, to go variably mixed up with parties that have a step further, with legitimate banking. Banks, as we know, have their branches ['34] throughout the land, and the excessive payments under the aggregation clause will mean increased rates of interest to be paid by the small traders of the community. I earnestly urge the Attorney-General to modify the effect of the clause, realizing, as he must, the serious injustice it is calculated to work. I specially emphasize this point of view, bearing in mind the remote possibility of a reduction of the penal rates. am really charmed with the remarks of the honourable member for Kooyong, especially when he speaks of the desire of honourable members opposite to make this a just Bill. There seems,for a moment, to be a misunderstanding. It must be recognised that, so far as this clause is concerned, and, indeed, so far as the whole Bill is concerned, we on this side and honourable members on the other side are fundamentally opposed. The Opposition may think it an act of justice to refrain from imposing a tax in any form. They have not proposed a land tax, and they have no intention of proposing one; whereas we believe it just to impose a progressive land-values tax, with an exemption of .£5,000 worth of unimproved value. We are prepared to accept amendments of a justifiable character; but the Opposition, in giving effect to their principles, and what they term their sense of justice, are submitting amendments, every one of which is in the direction of curtailing taxation or preventing its imposition. member must not deal with the general question. tually before us will tend to prevent the operation of the tax in certain directions, and, to such an extent, that each individual owner will be entitled to an exemption of £5,006 in respect of every parcel of land that he owns. ncintention of amending the other part of the clause. are the intentions of honourable members, but "" actions speak louder than words."".

The reduction of revenue that will result from the adoption of this amendment may, perhaps, be alarming from the point of view of the Government. My view is that we need revenue in this direction.

They brand it as if it were from this side, whereas they have constructed it out of their own imagination.

Every honourable member admits that it would. Even the last honourable member to speak said that there might be some justification for breaking' up large estates in agricultural areas.

246,Mr Glynn (Angas) [9.4],"I had athe possibility of the exemption of £5,000 not being taken from the aggregate, I proposed that it should be made in sub-clause 1. I did not know at the time that the Attorney-General was dealing with an amendment in a later part of the clause. The honourable gentleman very properly withdrew his amendment, and we have gone back to the first part. I would remind honourable members opposite that it is not proposed to alter in this way paragraph a or paragraph b, so that the deduction of £5,000 will only be made from the total. I had proposed to move an amendment providing that in the case of an owner not being an absentee a deduction should be made from the taxable value of the area, or areas, as the case might be, of £5,000, such deduction to be made in the case of an owner of more than one holding from the values of such areas fro rata, so that the £5,000 should be apportioned amongst the lot. If a man had several holdings of the total unimproved value of ,£50,000, we should deduct £5,000 from the total, leaving £45,000 worth still subject to taxation. That is quite different from a proposal to allow an exemption of £5,000 in the case of each separate holding, so that if a man had twenty properties of the total unimproved value of £50,000 he would escape altogether. Under this amendment such a man would escape only to the extent of the £5,000 which is deducted from the aggregate unimproved value. This means almost the full benefit of the penny rate. I am sure that the Opposition would be prepared to guard against any leakage as regards the penny rate by providing that there should be a tax of i d . in the ,£1 on every one. If the exemption of £5,000 were deducted irom the aggregate there would still be .£45,000 to be taxed in the case of a property of the unimproved value of £50,000, but it would be taxed at a lower rate to be determined by the extent of the subdivision. What objection could there be to that? The policy of subdivision would immediately be brought into force. If we do not agree to the amendment, we shall acknowledge that the principle of this Bill is not merely to bring about subdivisions, but to tax the aggregate of a man's wealth. It will be a wealth subdivision tax, and that wealth sub-divisional tax will not apply to any extent in tlie country, because it seldom happens that pastoral areas are divided into twenty or thirty allotments. One geographical expanse would be the average of almost 90 per cent, of the totai areas held. There is no reason why we should tax wealth in that case. We desire to tax only for the purposes of subdivision, and we shall carry out that desire by this amendment. It may be said that in the case of city properties we ought to tax the aggregate of £50.000 worth of unimproved values, and we shall do so if we do not take the exemption of £5,000 from the value of each parcel. If honourable members opposite wish to go beyond that, I am sure the Committee will facilitate effect being given to the principle of subdivision, coupled with the fair tax of i d . in the £ 1 , if honourable members like, or a much lower exemption. Therefore I fail to see why the Government should object to this amendment either from the point of view of securing fair revenue or fair subdivision. Under its operation, honourable members will secure subdivision and taxation, but not taxation that is disproportionate to a man's wealth. They will secure taxation which is exactly proportioned to it. If we allow a man to deduct from a property of the unimproved value of ,£50,000, held, perhaps, in ten areas of the value of £5,000 each different States? If there are ten areas of the value of .£50,000 in the aggregate, those ten areas will be taxed on the lower scale, and the only departure from the principle of perfect equity will be that we shall allow an exemption of £5,000 from the aggregate. In this way, we shall practically secure the two great principles which the Government have in view. We shall secure the principle of subdivision, and we shall almost secure equity by adopting the principle df taking only £5,000 from the aggregate. pleasing to hear of the degree of unanimity at which we are arriving. We are told that both sides now desire land taxation, and that the only question at stake relates to the amount of taxation to be levied. The statement made by the honourable member for Angas as to the .operation of the amendment seems to me to be very different from that which the mover of it indicated. The trouble appears to be contained wholly in the question as to the amount of taxation.

I know, from a careful survey of my honourable friends, that some of them are fundamentally opposed to the rest of the party in connection with this matter, though, no doubt, the party will vote solidly when the time comes. . The Attorney-General, having directed his microscope to the measure, has discovered that it contains a principle. member is not in order in talking about the principle of the measure now. in order in showing that the principle of the measure will not be invaded by the acceptance of the amendment, especially as you, sir, allowed the Attorney-General to speak for some time about nothing else. The only reason he gave for opposing the amendment was that it would violate the principle of the measure, which, as he laid' it down, was the prevention of the aggregation of property in the hands of any individual or company. If the principle of the Bill is as now laid down by the Attorney-General, its object has been very successfully hidden. If that principle, which the Attorney-General has discovered somewhere, really applies, then the Bill ought to declare that the holding of property in large amounts by any one individual is jmmoral, and against the public interest. But the Bill does nothing of the kind. For instance, a man may be bound under a legal settlement to continue to hold a large extent of property, and not subdivide, sell, or otherwise get rid of it, an-J yet, under this Bill, be compelled to pay the tax on it. Why not declare such settlements void? clearly out of order. sequently, it may be out of order. But I appeal to the Attorney-General, if the principle whicli he has discovered is really the principle of the Bill, to put it in the Bill, and let the public of Australia know exactly how far they are to be indebted to him. Sir honestly stated. sent, because the Bill is like a Chinese puzzle. Some such amendment as that now moved might be accepted by the Government. Unless they do this, they are taxing the tools of trade of great industrial organizations, that will pass the tax on to the persons who will have to use their agencies, and those persons, when paying it, will not be pleased that the hangman has done what he conceives to be his duty. A number of honourable members opposite, including the honourable member for East Sydney, declared to their constituencies that the tax was only to be applied to the bursting up of country property. Let them show by voting for this amendment, which will free the town agencies from this penal taxation, that they had nottheir tongues in their cheeks when they spoke to their constituents, or that they have not since been forced to vote for something in which they do not believe. The Committee is making progress with the Bill at a positively alarming rate. We are now tour lines further back than we were when we adjourned for dinner, and are listening to a number of admirable dissertations, not on the principles of the Bill, whicli are the principles held by the whole of the Government supporters, but on that variegated collection of substitutes for principles which the gentlemen on the other side will persist in putting forward. According to the honourable member for Fawkner, there is at the bottom of this measure an attempt to place on the shoulders of a comparative handful of this community a burden intolerable and not to be borne, viewed from the stand-point of either justice or equity. We have listened to the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Wentworth giving a dissertation of an entirely different kind, and arguing, not that the few were going to bear the tax, but that it will descend with crushing force upon the many. One honourable member delivered himself of an oration about building societies, the virtues of the thrifty, and the terrific impost that would fall upon them under this clause. We learn now that it is not the wealthy that are to pay this tax, but the unfortunate man down at the bottom who has been paying it from the beginning. If that is so, what is all the trouble about? The trouble so evidently is that JOHN FORREST -Let us see it it is not the man down below who is going to pay, that it is scarcely necessary to reply",48,Chairman Th E Honourable Of The Clearing Remains For Ever

270,Mr Hughes (West Sydney) [9.22],"to tlie statement at all. These pathetic references to the members of building societies are beside the mark. The honourable member for Wentworth, in his. anxiety to discover a point on which he could hang his remarks, endeavoured to persuade the Committee that the acceptance of the amendment of the honourable member for Fawkner would assist the purposes that the Government have in view. The simplicity which he apparently predicates in respect to our character does not conform to our ieputation as men v/ho have had long dealings with the honourable gentleman. It is obvious that the intention of the honourable member for Fawkner is to defeat the purposes of die Bill in any way he can. He suggests that we should accept an amendment which would haye the effect, as he admits, of reBill, as expounded to the electors, was to ducing the revenue from one property from £1,166 to £316, and which would also have the effect of impairing the other purthat long ago. pose for which the Bill is introduced, namely, the bursting up of big estates. The honourable member's amendment is not even effective for the purpose for which he ostensibly introduces it, because if you had an estate in which one man owned contiguous blocks, that man would not be entitled to the same exemption as a man who had alternate blocks all down the street. So that, if one man should own every alterput it before the country. When he says nate block all down the street, he would be entitled to a separate assessment for each block, whereas a man who owned twenty blocks together would have all his holdings treated as one, although the effect upon the community would be precisely the same in each case. The proposal is not even logical, from the stand-point from which the now proposing it, honourable members ophonorable member introduced it. I ask the Committee to come to some decision on the matter. It has been exhaustively argued, and, apparently, there is an irreconcilable difference between us. Let us, therefore, take a division, and determine the matter. A number of amendments of a very substantial kind have already been made, but I notice that they arc referred to and treated country consider to be a desirable thing-« mere matters of no concern j whereas, as a fact, they go to the very root of every concrete case that has been cited to-night. For instance, I would point out to the honconsistent to a considerable extent. I will orable member for Kooyong that there is not a building society which, as a building society, can possibly be taxed under this measure as proposed to be amended by the Government. Mr Hughes. yes-whe n they come into possession as mortgagees. ber has not read the amendment. There have also been amendments prepared dealing with the aggregation of lands held by other institutions; banks, and so on, which place them in an infinitely better position than they were in before.. I submit that they are treated fairly. What we are asking for has been embodied in every other Bill, and we must ask the Committee to accept it as it stands. serve with some surprise that the Attorney General opposes the amendment on the ground that it is inconsistent with the principle of the Bill. The principle of the burst up large landed properties. dropped it. That was the position taken up in the country, and I challenge the Attorney-General to show anything put before the electors which justifies the aggregation of all sorts of property all over this continent as one property to be burst up. He knows perfectly well that he and his party never contemplated such a thing, and never that the amendment is opposed to the principle of the Bill, he is asking us to assent to a principle that has never been assented to by the people of the country. When they ask this Parliament to do what was never put before the country, and never even contemplated by the party who are posite should be invited to look at the thing, not on the grounds of expediency or taxation, but of justice. Is this a just proposition? The proposal, as the honourable member for Flinders points out, is one to deal with taxation. If it were only taxation, it would be a simple matter, but the major consideration is not taxation. It is to do what very many people in this to break up properties in the country districts suitable for settlement, and held in large aggregations. The two things are ingive two cases. There is a corner block, less than one-eighth of an acre in extent, at the corner of Bourke-street, that was sold the other day for something like £50,000.

B. Watson, did him. any rate, and invested it. I do not think the honourable member is entitled to make that remark. I suppose the miners were paid, and paid well. At any rate, I know nothing about that. able member does, or he would not say they were paid well. that one of Mr Watson's strong points was that he paid his men well, and got good results in consequence. At any rate, that money is invested in that corner block, less than one-eighth of an acre in extent, and worth £50,000. Another property of 25,000 acres, at £ 2 an acre, which it may be desirable to break up, is worth the same amount of money. Under the principle, so called, of the Bill, we are entitled to treat both these properties in the same way. One property cannot be burst up, and is being utilized to the utmost of its capacity. Such a result is unjust, and, therefore, ought to form no part of the measure, especially as any idea of the vkind was not placed before the country. The honourable member for Darling referred to properties held by banks; but I say that no properly conducted bank would hold a property one hour longer than it can help. No prudent banker would make any advance on a property if he had the slightest expectation that it would ever come into his hands : and if a property should come into his hands, his business is at once to turn it into money, but I showed, in my second-reading speech, and so have the advance repaid. The difficulty about the Bill is that it condemns the just in order to catch a few unjust persons; and that is not wise. Apart altogether from properties which may fall into the hands of banks in the way suggested, many properties are otherwise held in the centres of population ; and I believe the honourable member for Darling is right when he places the values of such properties throughout Australia at £^5,000,000. Is it not a necessity and a convenience to the public that the banks should possess these properties ? They generally take the form of handsome buildings. In my opinion, it .is not fair to tax banks iu the way proposed, merely because there may be in the Riverina holdings of 50,000 acres which ought to be subdivided. how much is the tax. the honourable member for Angas; but it is questionable whether such properties should be taxed as much as those which can be burst up. However, that is a question of general taxation. The honourable member for Darling, said something about monopolies, but banking is not a monopoly. orable member to confine himself to the question. ber for Darling pointed, out that it is desirable to curb monopolies; but whether that be so or not, to deal with them is quite apart from the principle of this Bill or this clause. There are businesses which ""are large because the continent is large. There are warehousemen who have branches in five States, and they must have premises and employ an enormous number of people in each. There are other industrial concerns which cannot be carried on from one centre, but surely these cannot be described as monopolies, or as estates which ought to be burst up. line. ought to try to do what is just. It may be that we cannot meet every case, but we ought to lay down some broad principle that is defensible on the grounds of justia and fair play. The clause, in my opinion, is distinctly an infraction of the principle! of fair play. The Attorney-General said that the amendment of the honourable member' for P'awkner would affect the revenue; that the tax will probably bring in three times as much as the Government expect, or profess to expect; so that there is ample margin to do everything that is reasonable and proper. I do not hesitate to say that this taxation, if carried out on the principles laid down in the Bill, will result in a revenue of close on ,£3,000,000. I submit that this clause ought to be amended in the direction proposed. I have heard honourable members suggest that we on this side are really opposed to the Bill, and we accept that position-o r at least I do.

We are only endeavouring to do our duty; and if we are not listened to, the responsibility must rest with the Government and their supporters. The honourable member for Darling said I had submitted a number of cases which had not been authenticated, or words to that effect. much of the property was in country districts. brought forward were town cases, because I looked on this particular proposal as nof so much affecting country properties, although it will touch them. The cases I mentioned have been laid before the Prime Minister, who has the fullest particulars. I should like to say that if a company or an individual owned three properties worth £ [ 1 0 , 0 0 0 , , £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 , £ [ 3 0 , 0 0 0 , or £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 in all, and the owner was taxed separately for each, he would pay £559 os. 6d. as an absentee, whereas, under the aggregation clauses, the taxation would come to £899 6s. i d . Honourable members will'see that under my suggestion a very substantial tax is left. The Attorney-General referred to the enormous difference in the case of one property I mentioned, namely, the difference between £316 and ,£1,166; but £316 is surely a veiy large tax on a building which tlie company has to use for its own business. If the company has to pay £1.166 it will mean absolute ruin. Is that justice? The building cannot be cut up, and it is used in the conduct of a business which is valuable to the community. memory, I should say about £50,000. afford to pay something? member not think that in addition to rates and taxes £316 a year is something? getting off very lightly indeed. able member know that this will mean the whole revenue of the company ? It is simply confiscation. ber state what company it is? mention names here, but the Prime Minister has all particulars. In my opinion, the taxation under the aggregation clauses wiil, in this case, mean simple robbery. am very grateful to the honourable member for Angas for his further explanation of the amendment of the honourable member for Fawkner; and I frankly admit that I do not think it will have the effect of permitting separate exemptions from taxation. But it will have two other very serious effects; first, it will permit the holding of vast values by any one owner, who will thus be able to escape the progressive principle of the tax; and, secondly, it will mean that the progressive principle wiil be entirely eliminated. An mdividual owning land will be able to nominally split it up, so that, this principle will not affect him in any way. There is the third point that the amendment will reduce the anticipated revenue to such an extent as to make the Bill, from this point of view, a mere farce. In my opinion, the revenue, if the amendment be accepted, will be reduced by more than one-half. A man who owns property of the unimproved value of £50,000, will have an exemption of £[5,000. There will thus be £45,000 of taxable value, cn which, under the Bill at present, he will pay £[375 a year; but if the amendment of the honourable member for Fawkner is passed, the owner will be able to nominally split his estate up into three blocks, and, while still working it and receiving-the profits, be called upon to pay only £[187 ios., or just one-half. As the values get higher the reduction in the revenue progresses in proportion. escape taxation altogether. he could escape altogether; but tlie progressive principle might be so whittled away that there would not be £[1 worth of vaiui.' in Australia taxed at a higher rate than i d . , although an owner might hold £[250,000 worth. All such an owner would have to do would be to get a separate title for each £[15,000 worth; and that would, be a small matter for some men.

The Government propose to tax owners of such blocks without giving them the option to escape any portion of the tax. complain. purpose of the Bill were the taxation of the people for the services of the government of the country, they would not, but the Government are not essaying to do that. They propose an exemption which applies to the unimproved value of large areas, but they evade that principle by adopting the system of aggregation, and taxing not only large areas, but, in addition, a number of small areas. In this way the Government, in some instances, are taking the tax off the land and putting it on ""to the owner; by taxing city properties they are taxing the use and not the ownership of land. Government ought so to arrange their tax as to cause it to rest on some sound principle of taxation, or they should say in effect that they are imposing a penal tax on the large land-holders of Australia. They are departing from every principle of land taxation advocated by any economist of whom I know. By this Bill they are .going to do the double trick; they are going to tax land that is held in large areas, and land that is in small areas, irrespective of the use to which they are put. That is _ a wrong principle, and will do an injustice to a great body of deserving people who are at present putting their land to its best use. The Government are going to encourage the holding of land in idleness, instead of putting it to its best use. Many a man owns city properties exceeding the unimproved value of ,£5,000, but they are in half-a-dozen different localities. Such a man, under the clause as it stands, will be taxed far more than a man who is holding a smaller taxable block in a city Chair. Why should a small man who owns only .£2,000 or £[3,000 worth of land, as represented by shares in a company or bank, be taxed ? with companies. Notice has been given of .an amendment relating to them. -aggregation of land. The point we are discussing is that if a man has a number of blocks in the city he has to pay the tax on the whole. When we ask for relief for the owners of small blocks of land in different parts of the city, we are met with the statement that we shall get no revenue if we make such an exemption, while on the other hand, if we argue that a man is being unduly taxed on a large aggregation of land, we are told that he can avoid the tax by subdividing his property. And so the contradiction goes on. It is time that we laid down the principle that the tax shall rest either on the land or the owner. If it is to be on the man and not on the land then an income tax would be preferable. Under the clause as it stands it is proposed to tax both the land and the owner, so that we have two contradictory principles involved. hope that the Government will not accept the amendment. I challenge any one to say that the clause if amended as proposed would have its equal in any Land Tax Act save that in operation in VicEither the toria, and which is recognised as the vilest example of land taxation in the world. The amendment would extend the system in force in Victoria, where a man may own twenty properties of the value of under £2,500 each, and, if they are more than 5 miles apart, is not called upon to pay a penny in the shape of land taxation. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition would not advocate such a land tax. that case we have a sound principle wrongly applied. rotten. but the application of it. and the application of it are wrong. member must not discuss the Victorian land tax.
